I've always been lonely even when I was little. I've never been very good at communicating or socializing with anyone, so I would always blame myself for my loneliness. I was told and I thought over the years I would get used to it but it's only gotten harder to deal with. It's especially hard because I'm not that connected with family either. A lot of my family often doesn't talk to me very much. My dad hasn't been the best dad and just this year he completely cut contact. You'd think I'd be happy about that but he's still my dad. He actually would tell me quite often things like ""if you do such and such you really will have no friends"" or other things along those lines. My relationship with my sister was really good (probably the best it's ever been) but recently things have been very bad and I think she sees me as a failure now too. My mom is pretty supportive of me at least. My mom's husband really doesn't like me anymore but I won't go into that one. I lost my one last friend after graduation and I feel so disconnected (more than I've felt in the past). I actually joined a dating app, even if I just made some friends from it. but somehow it makes me feel more alone with conversations ending so quickly.

Jess.

I’m entering the second quarter of my life. I’m not proud of myself. I have a small collection of accomplishments, but an ever growing sea of failures, this is my rant. I don’t expect any sympathy so skip it.

..you ever just lay awake at night? Thinking. About where you’ve been..where you came from..where it went wrong..

I can’t get over the sense of emptiness I’ve been carrying around with me for the past several years. I’m no longer suicidal. Numerous failed attempts have stapled my time here on this rock so I’m just counting the miserable days till I can finally fade, quietly into dust. Alone.

I think what I miss most is your warmth. The way you would make a room brighter just by walking into it. That smile and those eyes..Mona Lisa would cry if she could see what I did. 

I never loved anything or anyone like I did you..and at this point in my life I’m convinced that every failed attempt after just further proves that I’m to blame and I fucking deserve it. 

Now I’m overwhelmed by my vices. No one to turn to. I miss you. I miss how it felt to be near you. 

I miss how it felt to be loved by you.

Now, I can’t go anywhere without hearing your laugh, smelling your scent faintly dancing through the air..and all I want is to feel you in my arms..I want to watch you paint and smile and be free. 

But I’ll have to do that from here cause we both know that I’m the rock holding you back..

You’re on my mind tonight. You won’t read this but I love you Jess. 

I always will.

I’ve always found it hard to make friends and I’ve never been the outgoing type. I would stick to one at a time, building a small group, and managing from there. All of my friends split up (as usual) I decided to go to an out of state university and it’s been a little brutal. I have my teammates, but we’re just a team, I feel like they’re all really close with their roommate/made friends, or have boyfriends/girlfriends. A handful of them also go home every weekend and spend time with their families. It doesn’t help that all my teammates or two floors above me and closer to each other so they often hang out/make plans and I’m not included. I had a real connection with this guy who lives next door to me (coed dorms). We hung out for a while doing homework one night, he was so easy to talk to, a good listener, extremely charismatic and funny, but also reserved. I thought he could be my one really close friend, that would lead to a few others so I wasn’t so alone. He messaged me the next day and mentioned he had a girlfriend which just made everything really awkward. I shrugged it off replying with a joke or something and I haven’t messaged him since. I see him everyday because we have classes together and he’s right next door. My social anxiety makes me overthink every little thing and I’m right back where I started.

So my story starts 2 years ago where I had 2 different squads where I would literally hang with them all the time it was great, but things started when I was hanging with the first squad and what happened is there was that guy in that squad who was an asshole and would always do bad jokes and cross the boundaries and one day he kept on doing this to me and I told him to stop or I will hit you, so when I told him this, he hit me and dared me to hit him back he kept on doing this and I was like I dont wanna fight but he kept on until I hit him then a fight happened then this whole squad decided to stop talking to me and cut me off completley.....anyway I was like fine I still have my girlfriend and the other squad so  I started focusing on them and trying to forget about the others but am always thinking about them.
 
Anyway 3 months later I  was with this the other squad and we were always 6 guys always togther but one day one of the guys couldnt come so the all other guys that day was like we dont want that guy to hang out with us anymore (the guy who couldnt show up) and there reason was that he talks alot!!! anyway I told them this is not right and you guys  shouldnt do this qnd this is so wrong (because I would know how he would feel if this happened to him) anyway big surprise they decided to cut both of us off!! anyway I find out later that the same guy I defended he is back hanging out with them and am left alone I tried to talk with them but they would always be saying they were busy and stuff like this and I open snapchat and instagram they are all togother! I never said anything to them and then they completley cut me off also now am left alone no one to hangout with.
 
Except my girlffiend but after a couple months I started to get anxiety and feeling lonely and depressed I started to be like boring and I have nothing to talk about..and mt girlfriend could see this when were togother am quiet am not like before I used to be always laughing and doing stuff now just quiet and so she decided to dump me....anyway a month later from stalking her I find out she is dating one my ex friends from the second squad and that really hurt me.

Sorry for making it too long but this is what happened and thank you for reading it....so this has bern my situation for the last year and half just alone watching everbody having fun..and graduated from uni also being broke and not finding a job isnt really helping at all.

Feeling lonely is something I am all too familiar with. I have friends, but they don't make me feel valued. I don't trust anyone. Everything negative that has happened to me throughout my life has been my own problem, that is it's my fault. I'm not a smart guy either, infact I've got an average intelligence, so there not much room for career advancement. Did I mention my lackluster social skills? Infact upon further research I can almost say that I might be autistic. Its unfortunate because I want to go into business as a career path, but you need social skills for that. 

All I want right now is to feel romantic love. I want to feel a deep emotional connection with someone. I want to experience feeling like I truly mean something to someone outside my family. But when I think more logically I realize that no girl wants to date a depressed, emotionless, asshole such as myself. 

I kind of am hoping that sometime in my 20s I die accidentally. I hope I get hit by a vehicle. I hope I get shot in the head by a stray bullet. I hope I get caught in a freak accident. I'm too cowardly to take my own life, it'd be better if someone or something did it for me.

I tell myself to think of the positives, but there are none, or well the negatives outweigh the positives. I just hope that maybe some day I'll meet someone who truly understands and cares about me as a person. I hope I can feel happy and fulfilled in life.

Today, I went out with the team to get fast food and socialize. Unfortunately, the group I sat with were all friends and they only talked about what they did together, what they and their friends did etc. I couldn't even take part in the conversation because it was about something I wasn't and couldn't be a part of. I'm depressed because I wanted to go to Homecoming like everyone at my table, but I can't because I have no one to go with. I never even have anything to look forward to like other people who can go to the movies and do fun things with their friends. It's just not the same doing it alone. Will I ever have friends?

I get that depression isn't cured by material things, however he never even mentions that he has a lot to he thankful for. On top of that, he's a complete pothead and does a lot of bad things in his spare time. So how does he get somebody to love and be loved by and I don't? Don't get me wrong, I am I'm no way saying I'm entitled to anything. I know I'm not. However he is way, way more undeserving of those things than I am. So why on God's green Earth can he have what I so desperately crave? Why does he get love when I don't? It's like I'm being tested, and if I am, I'm definitely failing. I was livid when I heard the news. I wanted to scream, bawl my eyes out, punch my fist through dry wall, pass out, and throw up all at once because of how livid, jealous, and upset I was and am. I just don't get it. I've been trying so, so hard to better myself as a person and to try and meet new people. Why doesn't anything good happen to me for all the good I try to do? Don't get me wrong, I don't do good things for vanity or rewards. But it just seems nothing good ever happens to me. That's why I find it hard to believe in karma. You could be a complete saint of a person and still only get shit thrown at you for it in this world. 

Sorry for the random and unstructured nature of this post. I'm just really not doing well and needed to vent. I just want to get so drunk that I forget I'm depressed. Cheers.",lonely,Why doesn't anything good ever happen to me?,2019-09-29 12:56:11

101,hamartiated,1569725040,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I want friends. I want a good conversation. I want romance and kisses in the dark and big hugs that come with being picked up and spun around. But, the interaction it takes to get there is exhausting. It's always so *taxing*. Laughing at the right jokes and finding particular subjects in common and constantly picking at someone's brain. I hate that it's so tiring. Because I want to be able to do it.

But, it's so exhausting.

I want to be able to be charismatic. I want to be able to find friends. I want to be able to stay up until 2 in the morning talking with someone and having laughs and creating memories and letting our fingertips roam.

But, it's so exhausting.

What I want is to crack jokes and laugh until I snort. But what I do is I stare at a blank television trying to decompress in the middle of the afternoon. What I want is to get dressed up and go out and have a good steak and a drink and giggle at jokes that are actually funny. But what I do is lay in bed yawning at 8 P.M. wishing my son would go to sleep so I can fall asleep, too. What I want is to cry on someone's shoulder and hear them whisper that things are going to be okay. And I want to be able to *believe* them.

But, it's just so damn exhausting.

I hate being an introvert. I hate being the quiet one. I hate that human interaction is so taxing on me because I miss human interaction so much.

It's an exhausting dichotomy, and I don't want to be this way anymore. I don't want to feel this way anymore.

A very important person in my life just cut ties with me and now my only outlet for discussing these episodes is gone. I sometimes tell me best friend about them but usually I don't wanna bother her. I feel like an idiot. Right now I'm literally praying because I don't know what else to do (I'm not religious). I have a stroke and heart attack specific hypochondria but sometimes it manifests differently. For example, if I find a mole that I don't remember my mind immediately jumps to skin cancer and I'll make an appointment with my dermatologist. Usually the hypochondria is manageable and doesn't impact me negatively. I actually started living healthier due to it (eat healthy, exercise regularly, use sunblock, avoid alcohol and drugs etc.). But every two months or so it gets really bad and I have an acute episode of hypochondria that makes me think I'm about to suffer a stroke (or less often a heart attack). I have none of the classic risk factors associated with stroke (high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, smoking, obesity, migraine with aura, clotting disorders etc.) but I do have a family history of stroke (my mother survived a stroke at 27 (!) and my maternal grandmother survived a stroke at 87). I have also been on birth control pills for a little over a year now (another risk factor for stroke because it increases clotting) but I don't wanna quit taking it because it ended my very painful periods (I have a tipped uterus, which is a very frequent thing that doesn't cause problems for many people who have it, but it can come with painful periods). My mother didn't have any risk factors for stroke when she had one except for smoking and taking oral birth control.
I'm constantly lowkey afraid of dying or suffering some kind of permanent damage to my health. I wish I had someone to talk to about this. I wish I had a partner who sleeps in the same bed as me, who will comfort me and tell me everything's gonna be ok. I'm sick of having to comfort myself. I know I'm being an idiot and that's how I get over these acute episodes, and I also know that if I did experience some kind of medical emergency I could get adequate care (I live in a country with socialized medicine).

I have no one to talk to about this stuff, no one who cares enough, no one who I can talk to without them making it seem like they are doing me a favour or no one who I can talk to without feeling like I am begging for their attention. Its just been a cascade of horrible things and I just want to be with someone fun, someone who cares and I want to distract myself, but I can't find anyone. Also, just the fact that I'm having to look makes it so much worse, it reinforces that there's no one right there. The bad things that have happened are awful and ironically, one of the bad things involves losing such a person and thats whats really brought out a problem in my life I have never really noticed before. Its left a huge void in my life, making me realise I lack meaningful relationships, all of my friendships are pretty surface level and until life took a downturn, I didn't know that these friends would just be taxing. Its also not like they don't know what I'm going through, its just that they aren't willing to treat it seriously enough, as they don't consider it a serious problem or they have a different approach that they think should apply to everyone, beyond which they couldn't care less. A lot of people tell me I should find more/new friends, but I don't think its that simple, it was really difficult for me to find the people I have and learning that some of them can't and others don't want to help me makes stuff really difficult.

142,anonyak10,1569694470,5,"I was thinking about all the suffering and the selfish behavior people have done and all the evil humanity has caused. I started questioning if being nice and a good person isn't the answer. It's hard to separate the good and the toxic narcissists, so I was wondering if maybe all the selfish people are the winners. If being evil gets you in serious trouble with the police or whatever, you always have plan B (suicide) by your side. Since you don't love anyone, you have nothing to lose and only things to gain. Take advantage of peoples trust and use it against them. Death doesn't scare you, therefor you will do anything to gain wealth and success. If you fail, you won't hesitate to take your life because you loved no one. This kind of reminds me of Deathnote which is a good anime. I recently watched it and the main character, uses peoples trust against them and acts selfishly. He uses his charisma and good looks to get what he want's from 2 women.

Don't worry guys, I won't chose myself over others happiness and wellbeing. I try my best to understand everyone and since I don't have any dreams and interests in materialistic things, I'll spend it on people when I get old. I think it would be hard to help people you don't know. Maybe you are accidentally rewarding someone bad. Maybe your act of kindness changes their attitude on life.

I'm not sure if you get it, it's like, you save up that one special dance, those hugs and kind words, and you want someone to give all that, and yet, no one's there. You end up lonely, without giving any hugs, without ever saying I love you, without dancing during the night, without saying good night to someone, without opening up yourself to other people, without the joy of gifting love, without watching a good movie, without having a nice dinner out. So I said ""screw it!"" Why am I waiting for someone who may never come before I die? Why do I have to give my love only to that special someone? Why can't I love myself, my friends and family like that? Will my love towards you be any less if I've loved other people before? cause looking back at things, I don't think so, and I don't want to live my life anymore knowing that I preferred to love someone who was never there instead of appreciating the love I can find with the people around me and myself.

(Btw, I just wanted to make things clear before someone can misinterpret it. Here I'm talking about love in the form of affection, this does not mean it's bad for you to wait for that special someone for more intimate things like sex or your first kiss.

1. **Keep an open mind and experiment.** 
   1. **Emotions vs. logic.** Most decisions are made from emotion and aren’t always based on the most logical approach. 
   2. **Mixed associations:** People want to get good at socializing, yet they don’t want to experience failing. This produces an illogical mixed emotional state that messes them up. People are driven by emotion plain and simply. 
   3. “The first few thousand encounters don’t count.” 

Now for those who are interested in learning social skills, I think the best way to learn social skills from a mentor. I have personally been learning and practicing social skills for 6 years and have been teaching social skills for about 1 year.

I didn't give them much attention but ever since school started again I've noticed the pattern of go to school, make friend laugh, go home and either be sad and cry or make something funny. I wouldn't wanna blow my own horn, but I do have a good sense of humor. I constantly make people laugh without even putting that much effort into it. Thing is, I don't really have much more to offer to anyone. I'm not attractive, I'm not interesting, I can and want to be supportive and just a friend people would want to have for reasons other that humor, but noone sees past this funnyman that is in front of them. \*He is for making you laugh, nothing else\*

Earlier this week me and a friend who I constantly goof off with were joking a lot about his ego and how invented music and sex. The next day I decided to put together a script of a parody interview with an exaggerated version of him. Nobody was avaliable or wanted to record with me so I did both roles by myself. I turned out so beautifully that I might even consider voice acting as a carrer path. Last evening I decided to make a sort of follow-up in the form of a news segment, again filled with inside jokes. I wrote a script, practiced acting it out once and then recoeded. It knew it wouldn't be as good as the first one and to br honest it was not bad at all. 

The thing is that all throughout the process of creating that I couldn't get a certain thought out of my head - I want to be more than my sense of humor. I don't want to just be my friend group's entertainer. I don't want to be theirs. I want to be one of them.

175,Jamie_User,1569663093,20,"Just recently went to the hospital for self harm (still here), and my doctors are convinced I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). Currently attending college and I was on the football team but I 'respectfully' got kicked off. One of my dreams is to make it into the NFL, but it seems like now pursuing football as a career and as a passion, is impossible due to my mental condition. 

I can't think straight and I'm stressed. My brother and a few people I talk too are saying that I can go back because of the passion I have for it. I just think.. well not think, know I can't go back to that.  It's hard to focus on anything due to my ADHD. I can't sleep because of my Insomnia and PTSD and everything is messed up. And because of those I loose sleep and even when I was on the team I was tired all the time. I've pretty much messed everything up for myself. 

Other dreams/goals I have is to get better at drawing. To others my drawing looks fine, to me it's horrible and I've even goten people saying it was. I also wanna get better at being social, as of right now the only way I feel I can communicate and get my point across is by talking with people online. In real life however, I can't even LOOK at my crush let alone talk to him. My social interactions don't go any farther than a simple 'Hi' and even that's hard. I just shut down if I need to talk to someone. 

So, overall I feel like everything that's went down over the past 4 days has been my fault. And, I'm convinced that it is. 

It isn't anyone else's fault that I was molested. It isn't anyone's fault that mentally I'm messed up. It isn't anyone's fault that I can't be ME.

So I have girl co worker. a ""weird"" female co-worker. Lets name her Anna. My other co-worker calls her weirdo because she's kinda sensitive on very little things, I didn't care what they think of her because Anna is part of the team. Everytime she needs help moving heavy stuff or hard labor stuff she calls me because I'm prolly the only one who doesn't think bad of her. Btw we work on a grocery store. So before we became close we did had a lot of arguements because she said I say random stuff that irritates her, like just confirming to her where this items go and I remember clearly she told me that time was ""ofcourse i know ive been here longer than you!"". That time I felt pissed because even I help her a lot and be nice its like she still hates me but I still try to understand. I buy her lunch every weekends because she doesnt wanna spend money and she doesnt say anything but I can see she is happy which was fine. My co workers doesnt even wanna bother talking to her even the guys because they think shes kinda ""off"" so I was the only one she tells stories to.

Time passes by we just got used to each other, she greets me every morning and asks me how my day or dayoff is. Today the unexpected happened, I was kinda worried because shes 3 hours late without calling, I was doing some work and she called my name handing me the money for the lunches I spent to buy for her. I told her its fine she didnt have to pay then she broke down in tears and told me she is quitting with a smile on her face. She left not telling me why and I felt hanging but she was happy because I know she didnt like working there. She told me to promise with a pinky promise to her to be good always and work hard and hugged me before she left. I wasnt able to say anything because I was still in shock thinking about her leaving. I asked my co worker why she left but they didnt know she quit because she didnt tell them only the manager and me.I didnt even thought about how bad it will feel till now, maybe because I cared about her a lot. Its worst than breakup lol. After that my manager told me to work on my day off because we are short in people, I told him I can't because I'm having a checkup which is just an excuse then I started crying down infront of him which was kinda pathetic. I wont probably be able to sleep even tho I have to because I got work at 5am.

I feel like I have to keep my mouth shut and always pretend to be the funny guy and the smartass, which is what everyone expects and wants from me but the second that I talk about how I really feel or what's really on my mind it's an endless stream of responses like ""Yea man, that sucks.""

190,throwaway20191819,1569642350,11,"This is probably gonna end up being a massive rant but I need to get some things off my chest.

I'm an extrovert. Always have been. And yet, for some reason, I've always struggled making friends.

I honestly don't know if I have some type of childhood trauma I've repressed, but whenever I try to talk with someone I get nervous and have to force myself to relax - and it's obvious (and on top of that I tend to speak fast, stutter, and mumble at times. It's embarrassing.)

I'm in my senior year of college right now, and I've haven't made a single friend and let alone gotten into a relationship. I have acquaintances, but I don't have anyone I can go get lunch or chat with after class. And it particularly sucks because in one of my classes, my professor likes to drill into my head that ""friends you make in college will last you a lifetime"". 

The only friend (that I made in high school, btw) that I had at uni moved and even then they used to ghost me at times once they got a partner.

It sucks. The last time I had some social interaction was last week; some classmates offered me a ride back to uni after an event, and even though it was a short drive and I was a bit awkward, we still had a good time. Once we got to campus though, I thanked them, got off the car, and sat alone in an empty campus waiting for my dad to pick me up, while everyone else was laughing and socializing while driving off to get some lunch. That 15-20 minute drive was basically euphoric for me.

Relationship wise, I've never been in one. I'm not even sure if I've ever felt romantic attraction before. But I can't help but want one. The three friends I managed to make at high school are all in relationships. Old acquaintances from elementary school are in relationships, some of them are even married. And constantly getting asked when I'm going to get a boyfriend is getting really, really tiring. I want someone I can trust, talk to, travel with, listen to, spend time with. But honestly at this rate, I don't think that's ever gonna happen.

My niche interests aren't helping me, either. Sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong country, and feel like if I were born or lived in a different one my interests would be more popular, and would help me find friends.

I'm 21 and I can't help but think that time's already up for me. I feel like I've wasted my time and I'm gonna end up alone.

195,hamartiated,1569640110,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Second of all, you guys probably dont know who I am and thats fine. I was never really known on here, which could be a good thing or a bad thing. Just some scrub with a big enough ego to try and avoid humiliation and low enough self esteem to delete a bunch of my posts.

Lastly. Since you've last not heard of me, i have:
Fallen in love with this amazing girl, found out that she was dating someone, found out this girl had been into me and basically rebounded onto new person, kinda had an on-off love triangle thing with girl (their relationship was not very good, and she felt alone with them [direct quote]), got dumped because she felt it was wrong (I dont blame her,) we fell back in love, kinda just ignoring her other partner, as they had essentially mutually ghosted each other. (Now that i think about it i feel like a piece of shit)
 We then kinda gave up and fell out of love,
I miss her
A lot
We talk but not much and its mostly surface level stuff

210,patchouli_bitch,1569625495,3,"Almost 23, female and never really had a platonic friend in my whole life. Pretty much only social interaction in adulthood has been with the few male sexual partners I managed to attract.

I've kissed 7 guys, blown 5, fucked 3. I've had 2 boyfriends.

But hanging out with someone platonically? Hanging out with a girl? Only like twice since turning 18, and hanging out with someone briefly twice doesn't really make it a friendship. 

Having guys want to fuck me, yet being unable to make friends, makes me feel like that's all I'm good for.

What do I even have to offer in a friendship?

It can be really hard for guys to find a girlfriend or a sexual partner, so I have value there by being a willing partner.

But, most people have enough friends so why would they need me around? 

Some guys are desperate enough for a relationship or sex that they will overlook my extreme shyness, extreme anxiety, autistic traits, neediness due to loneliness, etc.

But, no one wants to be platonic friends with that kind of person.

I legitimately have no idea what it's like to actually have a friend.

I crave platonic female intimacy even though I don't know what it's like, how it's formed, what the unspoken and inscrutable social rules are, etc.

Also I'm bisexual and it kills me to know that I'm never going to get to have any experience with a woman. Women aren't as desperate for sex as men, they aren't going to lower their standards for me.",lonely,"The only ""friends"" I've ever had are guys that wanted to fuck me.",2019-09-28 09:04:55

This year has been toughest in my life. Wife filed for divorce even though I tried all I could to reconcile our marriage and has successfully managed to find a way to keep me from my daughter (she basically moved back in with her family in another state while I was away for military training, then filed and left me out to hang and dry and without any custody of our daughter). I had to drop out of graduate school so I could afford the child support she has so “graciously” asked for even though her family makes significant more income than me and who are paying for everything for her anyway. 

I had to move out of state back closer to my family and try to be closer to my daughter and thankfully found a place to stay for cheap rent. But I am so incredibly lonely. I’m going to therapy, mainly for grief, but I have little to no heart left to try and make new friendships as I am afraid to even share any part of myself with anyone again, and have no idea where to start with even looking to make friends. My work is unconventional and odd hours. I found a job that pays just enough but it’s not what I aim to do for the rest of my life. 

I just wake up and feel like I am just here existing until I finally expire. This whole process has left me wondering who I am. I feel homeless and lost. I miss the intimacy I had with another person and the loss has left a void in me.

From a family of one sister and two brothers. A very traditional family and a humble one, beside the problems that my mother has with my father's family and my father too, life kept going on and kept growing. I was kind of used to waking up early in the morning in fights and screaming. My mother screaming that we don't live like others, we need and need and need,dad goes to his damn hard job as a mechanic for earth drilling machines. Getting paid 7 bucks a day which is nothing. I remember going to school with holes in my pants and clothes and my camarades would make fun of me. Run away from house because of the problems and forgetting to bring my books, then I get hit by the teachers and would hide the truth why that happened.

My sister couldn't sustain the pressures and she lost her virginity, she got beat so hard from my family, after that we accepted the fact and she started to do things like how others may call that (slut), she was forced and i knew myself sister, she was lost and not one was there to save her from that path. She needed many things and couldn't find them.

In 2012 my father passed away from stomach cancer. We suffered during that period of two years, we saw his pain and the death into his poor eyes, we wished him to pass away because it would be as a mercy on them. I quite school because I needed to support my family, and my sister got married because she needed someone in her life to save her from the unknown. my youngest brother kept going to school as he is younger than me.
Tired and pained soul wondering places in another city, seeking a job in restaurant. And then days passed and my mother and brother kept dealing with life with my little support. Renting apartments with low quality and bad conditions. 
With these misfortune and troubles getting bigger and bigger, lately my mother collapsed down and her health is now in danger, I'm afraid to lose her also as i lost my father. God help me keep writing this...
I die everyday a thousand time, seeing my mother skinny body lying there in that sad dirty corner of the room. Getting kicked out of this place soon because of the unpaid rent. I do fight my demons whispering into my ears to end this misery, to hold up my breaths as much and long I can, so that my beats will stop I I'll go, go for ever, been forgotten.

270,hamartiated,1569550404,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26, guy, Europe - Clean audio chat - Looking for online friend, who needs regular conversation and emotional support - Depression, anxiety, arts, books, philosophy, music",2019-09-27 12:13:24
271,sumimasen28,1569547550,213,"My high school friends and I grew apart, and I always commuted to college. So I've been pretty lonely for several years now. I was sort of subliminally familiar with the app called Meetup but never thought about it until I just downloaded it about a week ago. 

There was a meetup at an outdoor beer garden about 30 minutes from me. I was nervous, but with 8 people going, it seemed like a good sized group. Large enough to fade into the background if I wanted to, but small enough that I'm not overwhelmed and I can stand out if I wanted to too. 

Anyway, this isn't a paid advertisement or anything, but it felt really good to just be out with other people, having a drink, chatting and having a nice time. It wasn't too intimidating either. Since, I mean, we're all here because we downloaded an app to meet people. Why? Because we didn't really have friends to begin with. So everyone was friendly and inviting. 

It was sort of an eclectic group, people from different countries and some big age gaps, but everyone got along. Even if I don't get anyone's number or meet my next best friend right away, it's nice to just have a friendly conversation with people and being out in public, in the real world, after spending how many weeks / months / years sitting alone in my bedroom. 

Anyway, I can't guarantee, every meetup would be a success, but if you're lonely, I think it's worth looking into that app.",lonely,"Met up yesterday with a group from the ""Meetup"" app, and it actually went really well.",2019-09-27 11:25:50

I wish I had someone that loved me unconditionally and cared about my mental health and understood mental health.

I’m not as depressed as I used to be, idk if I’d consider myself happy (probably not) but I’m not depressed 24/7.

Idk this post is all over the place &amp; has shit grammar. I just had to vent I guess to prevent myself from going into suicidal thoughts mode. I’ve been starving myself all day idek why. It makes me feel bad to starve myself cause my mom takes the time to cook food so then I just feel like a shitty daughter. And I feel like I’m a burden to my bf cause I bring too much negatively because of my shit life that I hate, and he complained about me always involving him in my stress when I try to talk to him about it.

282,lukeisbored,1569537453,6,"I mean I do like individuality, but I feel like I'm completely incapable of getting into mainstream interests. Even though I do like memes, I feel like I'm too different still. Like when I download videogames for myself, I end up quitting them after a while. When I decide to watch a TV show, I forget about it for a while. I decided to watch anime last year because it was mainstream, but I lost interest. I decided to listen to one of Blackpink's albums on Spotify but stopped after a while. I'll probably do it all soon, but I feel like I have no purpose to do it. At the same time though, I don't feel depressed, but I do feel like my existence is pointless other than to get a job in the future and excel at school, which is good but makes everything else in life pointless. BTW, the reason why I say I'm incapable of mainstream interests is because while everyone else cares for TV, music, videogames, etc., I care for trains and animals. Since my school is located in a transit desert (which means there are no trains in the area), nobody is into trains (even though there are trains in the neighborhood where I live). As for animals, people like them, but I feel like it's not too much of a conversational topic. Also everyone at my school is in their own little cliques, so I don't want to intrude cause I know they're already well-established and they're all mainstream. Also, this is kind of related to trains, but not to the topic, but I'll say it anyways: Last year, when I was 14-15 years old (I'm now almost 17), I was harrassed by my dad because I was watching Thomas the Tank Engine (the really early seasons though, not the Teletubbies-simple 2000's episodes I grew up with). If you like the 2000's episodes, I respect your opinion, I just wanted to specify that the 80's and 90's episodes are more for a general audience like Spongebob or Gumball as opposed to the 2000's and 2010's episodes when it was more tailored for a younger audience a la Baby Looney Tunes. However my family doesn't know that it was more of a general audience show, so my dad was treating me like a baby and went into my YouTube account for some unknown reason (probably to annoy me😡) and found it was 100% Thomas videos (again, the old seasons, not the Modern Series of the 2000's as they call it). I had to stop watching it because I didn't want to be treated like a 4-year old by my dad, and I knew that they think of Thomas as a simplistic, babyish show like Peppa Pig, even though it's much deeper than it looks.

325,Shenzo1,1569477342,2,"Hey, first time poster so i'm sorry if i did something wrong, and english is my second language, so sorry for the bizarre mistakes ahead.

So, i have ended a 4 year long relationship earlier this year. I don't regret it, but it led to me seeing some things i really did not want to see. I felt very lonely even before doing this, but things have changed a bit since.
I need people. I always have and probably always will. I need to feel like i make a positive difference in someone's life to feel like i'm worth being alive. 
Since this break up, i have tried to get closer to my friends (the relationship didn't push me away from them in any way, but now i was trying harder), but it wasn't really working. Most of them either had something better to do than doing whatever with me or just wanted to avoid any intimacy for some reason. Even if i just wanted to talk about something (very usually personal problems that come from not being a very mentally healthy person), they would try to change the subject to basically impersonal small talk or just stop talking. I know, it is my fault for keep bringing up these not very fun topics, but in my defense it really didn't look like they would act any differently if it was another subject.
At first this was annoying, but after a 4 weeks vacation in which i spent most of it locked in my room due to not having anyone to do anything with, this started to become increasingly difficult to bear.
After my classes started, i thought they would help distracting me of this. And they did, for a while, but soon enough i found that my college friends also had the same disinterest in me in every way. Still, i talked to people at least 4 days a week, even if it was mostly random small talk.
I was trying to help anyone with whatever they needed that wasn't too extravagant or out of reach for me. From assignements to just being an ear to whoever needed and stuff like that. I thought i could try to transform my suffering into kindness, and maybe helping others would help me too. It is a nice thought, and i hold to it even now, but in the end no one wanted my help. Maybe it was me who was so hung up to my own loneliness that i couldn't feel the empathy needed for this. Still, most of the time it felt like i was just intruding on other people's life.
Sometimes, when i was alone in my room late at night, the loneliness would creep in and send me in a spiral of dread that would knock me down to my bed and make me question why the hell am i still alive. Whenever that happened, i would try to reach out to one of my friends, but they would always act in the same disconnected way. Still, it was better than nothing. 
That went on for a couple of months, until every single one of them was fed up with me. The last time i tried my hand at this pathetic endeavor, i was so far down the pit i tried using some self destructive behavior to get attention. 2 of them reminded me, pretty bluntly, that this is my problem and not theirs, and that they had better things to do and their own shit to put up with. That broke me. They were completely right on this, of course, and i really should stop doing it.
Pretty fun how my loneliness is making me push away the people i like.
So i did stop, i have been trying for the last few weeks to not seek help from them when i'm feeling like a useless lazy bastard that everyone only puts up with because telling me to fuck off would much more trouble than i'm worth.
Which is what brings me here. Because of some random event, i don't have classes this week, which led me to being now on my second day on which i don't leave my room except to get food and go the bathroom. It is expected that this will continue for the next 4 days, but i'm not sure how i'm going to handle it. There is no one left i could reach out to. I tried pretending i was ok to ask someone one out, but i was promptly ignored (maybe it is because it is the middle of the week, i hope).
Yesterday i tried drinking it away, but luckily i hate the taste of alcohol and ended up not drinking too much. Today the suicidal fantasies came back, and i'm not sure how long it will take for me to go back to my self harm habits. 
And i'm running out of shit to try to fill the void. Every anime or game i am either close to finishing it or am feeling less and less enthusiastic about. My self image is slowly shattering, in a way that makes leaving my room increasingly difficult: no one wants me, so i'm a burden to everyone and shouldn't bother them with my presence.
I have no expectation of finding new people to hang out with, i usually need the pretense of doing something to be confortable enough to try to get close to someone, but i'm stuck only in college(with loads of people that don't care), with nothing i really  want to engage in outside of it. Even if i did, for the reasons above it would be very hard.
In the end, i feel like this room i use to run from reality has become a prison i can not escape, and the walls are slowly closing in while i repeat myself to sleep ""i will die alone and no one will even notice"".

330,OnceAHoe,1569472834,6,"Trading real human interaction and friendships and conversations for meaningless sex with random strangers from tinder doesn’t help.

For a moment, it’ll feel as if I helped someone feel good. I fulfilled a purpose. I did something with someone that felt good and was harmless.

But after it’s done, the experience is done too. The daily messages fade away. The interest evaporates. They disappear, and I’m left empty again.

It’s not their fault for that happening. I mean, most of the time the premise of hook ups is straight forward. They’re always honest. We both look for something from someone.

It’s not about the random men. It’s not about feeling admiration or infatuation for them. It’s about feeling like I mattered enough to get someone’s attention.

But at the end of the day it’s just meaningless sex with meaningless men who’re having sex with a meaningless girl. It never meant anything in the first place.

It gets tiring playing another random girl, ya know? It’s just hard when I get my hopes up because I feel like someone actually likes me. And it’s my own stupid fault.",lonely,Sex doesn’t help fill the void.,2019-09-26 14:40:34

I don’t really think asking my friends out is ever a good idea. IMHO it kinda makes things uncomfortable afterwards when you/they break up with you if you/they still have feelings towards them. I accidentally ruined a couple of friendships when I tried asking them out. So I just accepted the fact that I shouldn’t expect anything more than friendship. I just wanna make good friends without the intimacy because I’ll be honest, I’m very scared when it comes to talking/asking out to girls.

I would go out and enjoy my time while in solitude doing whatever it was that I enjoyed. I feel as now things have been changing again for me. My thoughts and everything have been mushed up and I’m just confused on so many things. It’s been 2 months since I’ve moved states to attend pharmacy school. I’ve been away from my gf, however this wasn’t really the first time. The lack of intimacy on any level has killed me for years on end. It’s just like human connections that are so basic I’m missing now. Everything I think or study are just words that are being said in my conscious. All I do is hear myself talk without talking all day. I’m trying to make the most of myself with what I have. Anger and jealousy from my family, not intermediate family is just following me whenever I get the chance to go back home. I worked hard to get where I have gotten at a young age. A few of my family members have supported me and everything, in relation to cousins. However, so many of my cousins parents have always tried to point out my flaws. If I was caught doing anything it would always come onto my ass since they would tell my parents. The kids of many of these cousins didn’t even finish high school but I am a prime target. I have always been social with everyone but now I’ve seemed to die off. And even social interactions that I have with people make me feel so alone inside. I talk with people but feel no more content inside. I’ve noticed myself physically age a lot older than I am. People will say I’m in my late 20s when I have yet to turn 20. I just don’t know  anymore. Why do I feel this way? There’s always been hostility from everyone towards me when I’d be quiet but I would never say anything. My intermediate family I feel has not even acknowledged anything I’ve done. I had a full ride in college and I was supposed to try out for the junior olympics in swimming.

340,hamartiated,1569464864,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26, guy, Europe - Clean audio chat - Looking for online friend, who needs regular conversation and emotional support - Depression, anxiety, arts, books, philosophy, music",2019-09-26 12:27:44

I talk to classmates, we hang out, and I'm pretty sure I've made at least one friend at my new college, so I'm pretty happy about that! I've also gone out on two dates since my ex and I broke up at the end of May. I have to be honest though, I still think about him often and wonder if he thinks of me at all, and there will be moments that I do cry and I somehow still feel the share pain here and there. We haven't spoken since July and it wasn't on the best note. I am mostly moved on from him as I know I deserve someone to love me as much as I loved him, but I know I'm not there quite yet, and I can't seem to find any guys where I feel the same way as I first felt with him. I know that's not fair to do at all, so for now I'm trying to hold the phone on the dating and relationships thing and focus on school, friends, keeping up with family, working out, going to school clubs to look more into what I want to do, and finding a job. I've been looking for a job for over a month but I can't find anything and I'm really worried because I'm having issues with financial aid and may have to pay out of pocket instead. That makes me sad and stressed but I notice that I try to let those thoughts pass and I think that I'm a I'm employee and a hard worker and that something will come through sooner or later. I feel like I'm doing better but every now and then I feel glum out of nowhere, but not for as long as before. I went to the gym and felt sad to see a lot of couples working out together but after a few minutes I just focused on the intensity of my workout and burned off 400 calories, so I tried to keep my mind off it. I guess I struggle with reminding myself that I still have worth as a person even if I feel lonely and if I'm single. Heck, I gladly tell that to people to hype them up, but it's so hard to do it on your own sometimes.

Anyways, yeah. The last few months have been full of firsts (this whole year, actually). Most recently though I got out of my first relationship, moved out for the first time, and I'm living on my own independently for the first time. I'm very grateful for this and for my existence despite the ocassional sadness I will feel every now and then. But, it is a process. I just wanted to let you guys know that it can get better eventually, even just a little bit, and that even if progress is slow, it's still progress, so that's great.

I do exercise regularly, but again always on my own. My parents are home sometimes, but it barely feels like they talk to me like a human being.

And ""shes out of my league"". We ended up just continued  smiling at each other and walking our separate way. Immediate regret. I hate that i need absolute certainty to make a move (aka Why ive sadly stuck to online dating as of the past couple years). Why am I like this..",lonely,I feel like my loneliness is self inflicted in respects to relationships &amp; dating,2019-09-26 07:17:53

I sometimes wonder. Do I even deserve a girlfriend? Just recently I started thinking like this. It isn't now ""When I'll get a girlfriend"", I realised that I need to ask do I? I mean a lot of people say ""I need a girlfriend (or boyfriend etc.. You get the point.)"" but the question is do they deserve her? I hope I won't be on r/niceguys or something like that. I'm just thinking if my behaviour, personality or my thinking is good enough for someone to even consider hanging out with me more than once per several weeks or months. I know this probably doesn't make any sense for you but at least my brain gets it, what I'm trying to say. I always wonder why she would stay with me, why she would pick this kind of garbage when she can have something better. There is nothing interesting about me. There is nothing sweet about me. I'm just a regular good boy (I hope) that is filled with negative thoughts.

It's easy to say that someone will come. Or you'll find someone. But is it really true? I already swallowed the fact that I will be alone. I mean if I'll try hard and study at least I'll have money. Right..? I know money doesn't make people happy. Its like a drug. It makes you happy for some time but you'll be empty sooner or later.

Sometimes I miss human contact. I fortunately got to experience a nice hug from a girl which was pretty comfortable since she was okay with it. It feels really great. I used to hug my friend I had but he was pretty uncomfortable with it. I just hope he doesn't think I liked him more than a friend because I didn't. I just wanted to hug my Comrade to make him feel better but.. Whatever..

Sometimes I wonder why do people read this crap. I'm really curious. This is literally just to help me fall asleep. And people (I guess they do?) read this. That's weird but I don't mind. I just would like to know why..

371,Rizzuna,1569444281,7,"I honestly don't exactly know why I'm writing this, I just want to write this down and maybe I find someone who feels the same... 
Since last winter, I kept losing a great part of my friends. Some would just leave me on read, but I've also left some because I found that the toxic relationships are harming me. So now I have like 2 friends who I believe are real friends and I try to trust them as much as I can. However, both are online friends which live in other nations and I've never seen in real life. I had friends in my old school but this year I went to another one and I feel so alone there. I have maybe spoken 10 sentences so far with my classmates and the loneliness has come to a point where I'm so desperate that I stopped myself from having imaginary conversations with people in my mind because I just haven't talked for so long. When I come home, sometimes I don't find my voice when I try to speak the first sentence.

I don't know how to handle this and I'm tired of hearing hollow phrases like 'yeah that will go away soon' because I'm in that situation and I know it will not. We're 4 boys and 16 girls which sucks too because honestly I've always been a bit nervous talking with girls because I barely had contact with any in my childhood. It doesn't help that they all have a friend group and then I always feel like I would be annoying them because they're obviously happy with the group and don't want a disturbing element.

I used to be happy about lunch break but now it only means a void to fill somehow by running around uselessly. My alarm senses are always active somehow and I've got that constant feeling of 'I shouldn't be here'. At home it's not any better. I keep hiding how I feel all the time and most of the time I'm alone in my room, feeling useless if I don't do anything so most of the time I just sit around doing nothing.

I feel like I shouldn't be depressed, there are people who are way worse, who have parents who hate them, who don't have any friends at all, who live in a bad situation. I don't have all these things, so why does it hurt so damn much? I just wish I had someone to talk to, like really, someone I can go to, I can feel. Someone who cares, who's there. It really hurts.

373,Annaille,1569442228,4,"My entire life I have had issues with friends. I could be very popular one year then not at all. And by not at all, I mean, eating lunch alone without a friend in the world. I am always wondering what changed about me? Did I do something? 

Year's later.. I'm now 31. 

I arrived late on the first day of the third semester (of my college program). I am by myself in the back row. There is one other girl in the back row. One final girl enters the classroom, she will have to sit next to me or the other girl. No surprise, she sits next to the other girl. Ever since that day, everyone keeps the same seating and I am alone. What is it about me that people just shy away from?

I tried to be happy and engaging when everyone was just starting to meet each other. I seemed to get along fine. Then as the days went on, people began to establish their friendships and nobody continued talking to me. 

I try to occasionally strike up a conversation, but they seem eager to be done. When DO have to people talk to me, I feel like I'm overly enthused and desperate. I try to play it down. Now am I pushing people away? 

I try to be happy and confident. I raise my hand in class, laugh, and smile with the teachers jokes. I have a learning disability, my confidence is waning. Nobody can see me smile, I'm in the back row.. 

I share too much information about myself. I told the class that I have dyscalculia when it was mentioned in the lesson. Why did I do that? Do I really need attention so badly that I will highlight my faults for everyone? 

Maybe people don't like me because I'm an idiot? I have learning disabilities, maybe I come off as a tard? 

Maybe I project too much confidence that it irritates people. I should have more self-awareness and be shamed. I should sit in silence. 

Maybe I'm unlikeable? Awkward, un-enjoyable, annoying etc.

376,LordSt4rki113r,1569439444,6,"I've had a rough go the past year and a half. I started getting really sick in February of 2018 and couldn't figure out why. In September 2018 I was diagnosed with cancer, went through 4 rounds of chemotherapy until December, and then had surgery to remove what was left at the end of January this year, and was declared cancer free in February. Through all of that, the only people I really had were my immediate family members.

I'm so very lonely right now, and I have no one that I can relate to on a physical, mental, or spiritual level. I desire someone that will love me in spite of my flaws, in spite of what's happened to me.

I've always been a very sociable person, but since cancer stuck its nasty little footses into my life, I've had a lot of trouble relating to people other than telling them my testimony. A couple of months ago, I was able to start back to college, and I've been able to get back out in the world again. I've met some old friends, and made new ones, but still I feel alone.

A couple of days ago, I finally built up enough courage to ask a girl I have a crush on out to lunch. I didn't hear anything from her until today, and she said (verbatim), ""Thanks for the offer, but I'm really busy right now and not interested in anything, sorry!"" I was finally starting to feel a connection with someone other than my family, but that text bluntly hit me in the face that she's not interested at all. This is but the latest in a line of a handful of girls that I've ever been interested in, over a period of 8 years.

I'm tired of looking for a partner. I don't know how else to put it. I'm tired of feeling like I'm building up to a relationship and then getting my legs cut out from under me. It's days like this that make me wonder ""What is it about me that drives everyone away?""

Since chemo, I've been completely fine with no emotional outbreaks, but this actually mentally broke me today and I don't know what to do except move on and try not to be upset.",lonely,I'm tired of looking for a partner,2019-09-26 05:24:04

I mean don’t get me wrong, I have friends and family that I share my time with frequently, it’s just recently that I figured out how I actually feel.

412,hamartiated,1569379157,4,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

A lot of the time when I comment on someone’s post it’s because I reallly want to converse with them, seeing how we have the same interest. As humans this is what we crave right? We love talking right? Seems now only: likes,follows and retweets are all that matter. Just when I think I’m getting somewhere when someone replies... after I reply to them again and only receive a “this person has liked your reply” I die inside. Just once... I would love to come back online and see someone say “I missed you! Hope you’re okay😊”. Don’t misunderstand, I understand people don’t have all day to talk to someone, especially people they don’t know. These days it feels like everyone has their own circle and are not interested at all in letting someone new in. Legitimately doesn’t feel like my disappearances aren’t even acknowledged. Hurts like shit man. Don’t get me started on when I’m not here. Yeah I rarely get a conversation here... but when no one I know is on, I have no one to talk to. Never invited anywhere, no one even wants to come over. I’m in a relationship and I couldn’t feel anymore alone man. Not going further than that. “You don’t need a lot of friends.”What if the small group of ones you have are not around in different states?
Times zones? Countries? And this includes the ones online. I am able to go out alone, get what I need and come home. But just once I’d like to go to the movies, mall, theme park with people who want me around and have a great time. Like it is for other people when I’m out alone! From my childhood I’ve never been liked by anyone not even my own mother. More often than not I crave for people to ask: “Hey are you okay? “Want to hang out?”“Would you like us to come over?”, “Happy Birthday,”. Just once in my life. Yesterday I was just thinking of how truly alone I am and then the one person contributing the most to it came into the room... I broke down and the whole time they didn’t say anything. There I finally got this junk off my chest. And I know no one will ever read this, it is great to have it out there. No regrets.

I always tell myself that they are too good for me and that it's an insult for me to even talk to them.


I just hoped that I would eventually embrace the loneliness and I would be happy on my own but the truth is its getting worse and worse and I think to myself you don't have a reason to be lonely u have friends. But I feel like I can't talk to my friends about it. They ve all had relationships they wouldn't understand.

Plus I only have a couple of friends that I can say I fully trust but even then I still don't want to tell them how I feel. I don't want them to feel sorry for me. I just want someone to listen. Another reason I'm lonely is because I have a fear of being that one annoying person that everyone hates but acts kind to. That's why I do trust alot of people.

Recently I expressed the fact that I had feelings for this girl. I managed to gather up the courage to tell her. We had been talking for a while I was sure I liked her. I didn't really want to tell her tho because I really liked the friendship we had but I also felt like I had to tell her how I felt.

I told her that I liked her for a while and that I felt a genuine connection between us but she didn't feel the same way plus she decided to tell me that she liked someone else I played it of and said that's OK we can just be friends but I was really hurt. I had this voice saying that I'll never go out with anyone and that I should just hide away from everyone. But a part of me told me to think positive so I did but she has started to stop talking to me now and I know its because of what I said and its really fucking hurt me but even after this I have been acting as if everything is good to my friends but it ain't. I act as if everything is good because I tell myself that I'm only liked because I'm always happy and funny and it couldn't be further from the truth and I basically the groups fucking therapist I fucking fed up.

Nowadays I see things like people having lots of acquaintances but no close friends, or lots of close friends but they're long distance, or just not being in a relationship but still having tons of friends. And it makes my heart sink, because I can't relate even to that.

I don't have any acquaintances or IRL friends. Not a single person at my school that I've been at for over a year knows my name; I spend days alone in my dorm playing games or browsing the net because I can't stand the abyss of loneliness inside me and knowing that nobody in the world wants to talk to me or spend time with me. There's only one person I'm close to and it's an online friend. Other than that, nobody. My mom is abusive, my dad is emotionally absent and my brother is six and not someone I could have a relationship as an equal.

I feel like I truly embody the definition of being completely alone. I have been alone for a long time; it essentially defines me as a person. I'm completely on my own, and when you're completely alone your mind does terrible things to fuck with you to cope. Ever heard of this thing where people had experiments where those who delve in long periods of isolation (like that one Twilight Zone episode) inevitably go insane? That's me. It's gotten to a point where I feel like I'm just floating away in my own bubble. Everything around me is muted and it's like I'm barely aware of anything. I'm far away from the world and it's just me. Living like this... I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

I know one day I'll end it all. I'm just afraid of pain and afraid of being inescapably alone again, only I won't be able to escape. I'm terrified of being trapped in a cold black void after I die and I won't even be able to engage in my usual escapism. I'm hoping I can blink out of existence someday. Just... poof.

It’s ironic to think that being connected with everything online can make you feel so disconnected. I’m 21F. My life is consumed with social media. I hate it. I live at home for college and my Instagram is just a feed of people showing off how much fun they’re having. At first it made me sad when I would compare my commuter life to all my “friends” from high school who moved on to live this wild &amp; exciting life. Now I’ve decided that I actually don’t care anymore because it’s fucking fake. 

I remember when I was younger we took pictures for memories. Now we take pictures to tell stories. We share pictures to show that our lives are great and we’re having fun. The motivation behind posting an Instagram is just for the satisfaction of having someone pressing “like”. The more likes you get, the better you feel. I’m over it. I talk to, in real life, about 3% of my followers (1,200 followers). If I wanna show them something can’t I just show them in person when I see them? Why do I need to post it on social media for 1,000 people to see?

Two weeks ago I deactivated my Instagram and it’s been the best decision I’ve made in a while. It doesn’t cure my loneliness completely but it makes me feel more comfortable with it. I like having nothing to compare my life to. Which is a great feeling. The only thing I have to compare myself to is my friends and family who I love. They are the only people I give a shit about. I don’t feel bad anymore about the fact that my life consists of working 30 hours a week, going to school, working my ass off at the gym, and sometimes going out drinking with my friends. That is what makes me happy and I don’t need strangers on Instagram to make me feel like my life is less exciting or cool than theirs. 

Right now the world loves to share and show off every aspect of their life. One day people will slowly start to go offline to realize the satisfaction that comes for keeping large parts of your life private. And when that day comes I’ll be ahead of the game ✌🏻✌🏻

If you’re constantly overwhelmed and depressed by the world of social media, you should try and delete yours too!! I recommend it.",lonely,Deleted Instagram at an attempt to feel less lonely.,2019-09-25 04:01:37
439,ItzDanDan,1569346813,1,"I used to live in Georgia my whole life. I had great friends, a nice house, the typical American pre-teen life. Until, my mom thought it was a good idea to move to England. I didn’t think she was being serious so I just put it aside. What I didn’t know, was that we were having huge financial struggles. And I just didn’t understand how, and I still don’t. How can all those other people in America live with such big debt and financial issues yet I had to move. Why me? After 7th grade, my family moved to Nashville Tennessee. I was lonely at first yeah but being so close to home, I adapted quickly and made such great friends that I love, and hold close to my heart. I was only there for a year, and this time it really hurt. I would cry myself to sleep every night, and I stopped eating and I had no motivation to get out of bed. After summer ended for everyone, and seeing everyone go back to school in high school as freshmen while I stayed home, alone, packing, watching my friends stories on social media seeing them all together laughing. I felt so empty. I felt nothing at that point. Then I finally moved to England, the UK. I moved here about a month ago, and I’m so sad. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even cry anymore. Everytime I’m sad I’m just empty inside. Like I left a piece of mind in every place I used to live in. Now I live in a one floor, one bathroom apartment. I’m only 14, and I don’t fit in at school at all. Everyone just sees me as the american kid. No one wants to know me. I have “friends” but I just can’t talk to them or hang out with them without thinking about my memories with all my old friends. I just feel so empty, sad, lonely. I just want my old friends back. I wanted a good childhood experience and above all I wanted to have fun in high school. High school here is just secondary school. Basically middle and high school put into one. I feel nothing. I haven’t felt happy in months. I’m going crazy and I just... i don’t know.

450,sparklingbxtch2,1569321659,7," (I’d like to say thank you for all the nice comments on my last post, and heres the explanation on how I found him for the few people that asked.)

Okay so I explained in my last post about what happened and how I found the person I spoke to on Omegle. So it took three weeks to find him, it might not feel like a long time to you guys but it felt like a long time to me lol. Some people may say it’s weird and obsessive to get hung up on someone you only spoke to once, the truth is when I spoke to him I felt like I already knew him for years. It was crazy. 

Anyways since that day had happened, I would go on Omegle every night at the same time we spoke, hoping to find him. I legit did it every day, I didn’t miss any days. I had no luck, it was becoming extremely frustrating. I knew his age and his full name, as well as some other details he told me. So I worked with what I had and I looked him up on all social media platforms, still no luck. I told my friends about him and they also helped me search. They had no luck either, I was beginning to think that he had lied about what he told me, which made me question if I should carry on looking for him. Clearly I didn’t let that stop me, and I carried on. My best bet was on Omegle because he told me he was a frequent user, he liked to go on it when he was feeling depressed. So I carried on going on Omegle, with very little hope at this point. 

After three weeks of searching and going through an emotional rollercoaster, I got a follow request by him on Instagram. I was very confused at first because the username wasn’t what I expected. I accepted the follow and he DM’d me. He told me he’s the guy from Omegle, I did not believe him one bit because he didn’t have any pictures of him on Instagram, he only had artwork, but then he proceeded on to tell me how he’s been looking for me ever since and he was really devastated that I left without giving him any of my socials. At this point I still wasn’t 100% sure if it was him, he obviously realised that and then told me about an idea he had.

 So on Omegle you can put topics in and then match with other people that have the same topic as you do, it’s totally random and you basically match with people that have the same interest as you do, so he told me to put “olives”  as the topic on Omegle, and he would do the same, so then I can find him. So I turned on my laptop and and did what he said, I put the topic as olives, and I clicked start, it was a blank screen that came up at first and then I pressed skip so I can go to the next person, and there he was. We both looked at each other for a second and smiled instantly, ahhh my stomach was full of butterflies and I was so shocked yet so joyful it was amazing. The first thing he said was “I missed you” and my heart melted ughhh, sorry for being cheesy lol. Anyways he gave me his number instantly, and we spoke for hours on Omegle and he was explaining how he felt that day and how he was looking for me all that time.

But WHY I’m going to die anyway

I see people working towards goals like if they’re going to be here forever, they’re going to die and that makes me feel sad. 

The thought of seeing some beautiful landscape and knowing that I’m going to die and won’t be able to see it again keeps me away from enjoying outdoors, activities.

I find myself doing stuff, working on something 
And then realizing I’m going to die anyway and it ruins me

In the end, all is forgotten, in the end, nothing matters, hope is lost, lies prevail, and at the end, you disappear. 

The thought of knowing that in 1,000 years I/we won’t even be dust brings me down so much to the point I became suicidal now, and I’m scared because that would hurt my immediate mother and grandma and don’t want them to blame themselves or kill them with sadness if I kill myself.

453,Mon0noke,1569320704,3,"Every year on my birthday i get this grim wakeup call that people around me truly dont care for me. 

For context, im a pretty lonely person in general and have no friends. This year i made a big effort to gain some friends and got a small ”friendgroup” - during summer most of the group had their bdays within like a week and i made sure to get everyone a gift by arrangement a group effort on the side for each individual that was having a bday (which was hard as they had them VERY close by and im quite poor).  Everyone got a gift card to a thing that was their biggest hobby (maybe not as personal as i hoped for but it was atleast something that they could use to engage in their hobbies). I researched one of the friends favourite flavour and baked her a lemon drizzle cake and felt very happy with myself for making someone i appreciate around me feeling loved and special. 

Another friend reached out to me yesterday saying she was in town in need of a place to crash today (my bday, which she didnt know) she had stood me up last time she was in town and it struck me she only reached out to me because she has nowhere to go and i lied and Said that i was going out for dinner with some friends (i still feel bad and i made sure to ask that she has somewhere to crash - if she doesnt il probably have her over anyway).. she just left me on read and didnt even wish me a happy bday which.. hurt a bit.

I... guess they didnt feel the same for me. And once again im spending my birthday alone wondering whats so wrong with me that no one wants to have anything to do with me.

I feel like everything I’ve ever done or ever have gone through was preparing me for this moment in my life. Preparing me for everything I would need... for you. I just get these feelings that you’re thinking about me like am I you. If it’s the same intensity, I’m sorry. It’s a lot. I know. I feel like something is pushing or pulling me toward you. I don’t know what it is about you. Idk. I feel like I have a lasso around me and it’s just telling me that it’s you... it’s you. I imagine this cord glowing this bright golden color. Illuminating even. Sorry of that doesn’t make sense. It does in my mind. Idk..

I feel such warmth when I hear your voice. So much calm. But you’re no where around me. Living halfway across the world it seems like. My heart longs for you. It craves you. I would give almost anything to have you here or me there with you... holding you. Comforting you. Loving you. Kissing you. That sounds so much better than this ever growing loneliness. Everyday that goes by seems to go by so much slower. I just want them to be done. I just want it to be the third already. It’s killing me. So bad. &lt;/3

I keep telling myself I’m crazy. I don’t want this to be in my head though. I can feel my heart break even with just thinking about this. Why are my emotions so strongly toward you? I've never met anyone like you. I usually don't even like people in that aspect. I usually just find whatever is easiest and forget about it. You make me want to work harder. You give me hope. I haven't had hope in so long. And I really know that I'm falling for you. But I'm afraid I'll never be enough for you. Look at me. Kevin Federline over here.

When I wake up, I check my phone to see if you’ve messaged me. Or called me. I get excited and immediately happy when you have. You have no idea how much you mean to me.... Or maybe you do?

Hi.

Now that you’re here, I want to tell you guys a story. A story about how I found my soulmate, lost my soulmate. and how I deal with having the chance to be with her again. Why am I doing this? Mostly because I need an outlet, also because I need some advice, and also because I have developed a crippling sense of loneliness that makes life a chore.

This is going to be long. Probably, an essay about being young, love, loss, and pain. I do NOT expect you to read it all. If you do, I salute you. I just want this story out there so I don’t feel trapped anymore.

Here we go: 
In my Junior year of high school, I met this girl a year below me. Now, I hate stereotypes, but for the sake of reference and the fact that you’ve never met her or seen her, lets say that as for her physical appearance, she looked like your classic white sorority girl. Perfect body, beautiful smile, etc. You get the picture. However as for her personality, she was quiet, mature, thoughtful, and very down to earth. Moreover, her friend were good people too. As you may have guessed, I instantly was head over heels for her. 

I want to mention here that I went to high-school in the south and am a lanky middle-eastern/canadian and one of four brown people in a school of 600. So naturally, I felt that this girl was way way out of my league. However, I forged on. I’d like to say that I made an effort to be her friend and flirt with her and win her over with romance and humor, but that would be lying. One day, before Spanish class, I noticed she was dead silent, her hair was a mess, massive pout across her face, so I walked up to her and asked what was wrong. 

Best choice of my damn life. Instantly, we became close. She moved to sit next to me the class after. She gave me her number, FaceTimed me often, I was so shocked. We realized we had a lot in common which was awesome! However, we were still just friends. One day she invited me over, and we baked cookies for a bake sale. It was wonderful. After we made cookies, we watched Captain America: Winter Soldier and after awhile she just curled up next to me and out her arm across me and her head into my shoulder and we cuddled until I had to leave.

I almost crashed three times on the way home because my mind was racing. I had trouble comprehending it. Was it possible that this beautiful white girl actually liked ME?! (I hate to bring race into this, but I have faced a lot of discrimination bc of my skin color, and told often that the chances of me getting w a girl like that were 0 just because of my skin color).

We hung out again. and lets just say uh things went farther than cuddling. No, not sex, but darn close. So at this point we were both a bit awkward. We had no idea what came over us, but in the end we agreed that we loved it. However, I saw where this was going, so I just blurted out I liked her one day while going to get lunch. She blinked and smiled and said, I like you too. Thus began the happiest three years of my life. I won’t bore you with the details, but it was a committed, healthy, and loving relationship that got through anything in our path. 

For the first time in my young life, I felt so alive and grounded. Strong relationships with friends and family, strong romantic relationship, I felt on top of the world.

College was always a scary thing for us. We both knew it was coming, but didn’t want it to be the end. We largely just chose to focus on being happy and “in the now”.  Fast forward to February 2018, heading towards me graduating, we are chilling in the back of my car and all of a sudden she burst into tears. I am confused and ask whats wrong, and she explains how she is so scared of how to deal with me leaving for college. I had just chosen to attend school in Canada, thus requiring me to move out of country. Honestly, a completely understandable crisis. Theres two choices: you call it quits, or you attempt the long distance. Of course we were going to stick together or at least try to. However, she was hysterical, and asked me to promise her that no matter what happened, if we were both available after we graduate, that I would come back to her/she would come back to me. Honestly, for me, there was no hesitation, and I said of course. That solved that issue.

Lets skip graduation, and summer. Not much happened, happiness and rainbows as usual.

Going to university. It was new for me, I was SO nervous. However, I had this special someone to comfort me and I used that as a crutch. I would text her, facetime her, and give her attention because at the time she was the only person who instantly connected with me. However, this led to me not having any friends. I went out and partied, but always without people to hang with. Classes began, and so did the workflow. At the same time, extreme depression started to develop. September goes by, A- average in classes, still good with my gal’, making loose friends, life was okay. 

In October, I went to visit her. I had a blast. Such a sweet time. I took her to her senior homecoming. We had a wonderful, wonderful time.

However, after I went back, the problems started. I think a very big factor in this was anxiety and separation anxiety on her part. For her, I was her rock when her mom would continually verbally abuse her. Id be there to hug her, make sure she felt loved, and overall feel safe. I think being in high school, but not having me there made her feel empty. This was the beginning of the end, but I can understand why.

She should’ve broken up with me at the end of October, but she clearly desperately wanted to make it work and she stayed until she couldn’t anymore, I can understand how hard it can get. In the months leading up to this, my roomate was getting on my nerves, he was an extreme pothead who kept irregular hours, so my room smelt like weed 24/7 and he was up until 5am every night. Moreover, I was keenly feeling having no friends. I often felt empty. Watching people on Snapchat go clubbing and hit the frats, or just be watching movies with people. I also gained weight. Food helped me cope. It made me feel happy. I couldn’t help it. I also keenly felt my relationship slipping. Not because of anything bad, just because of distance. My grades TANKED. I started skipping class because I couldn’t get out of bed in the morning. You get the picture, I slid into and hit rock bottom. 

Fast forward December. Exams time. At this point, my one chance to at least pass all my classes. I scraped enough money together to visit my girl. If I could get through this, life would take a turn for the better. I didn’t. Two days before exams started, she broke up with me. A dick move? Of course. However, she was broken and depressed. It was affecting her mental health not having me there, and she didn’t know why she needed me to physically be there, because she was desperately in love with me, but regardless it was affecting her. I couldn’t argue. I loved her, and above all else put her health first. I said okay, I respect you, I love you. I need space. I hope God brings us together again. 

I tanked my exams. Failed my entire first semester. I was a mess. However, I refused to get help. This may sound odd, but the alarm bell for my parents was when I stopped maintaining my appearance. I religiously trimmed my beard, faded my hair, dressed extremely well, and all of that stopped. I became a walking vessel of depression. To be clear, I have never had that much love in my life, even from my parents. When I found someone who gave me her whole heart, I ate that shit up, loved it more than anything. It was gone, and I was alone.

Looking back, I realize that once she was gone, I was truly alone. No girlfriend, no friends, failed classes, fat, disheveled, depressed, nothing to live for honestly. Not even a hobby. My second semester went much the same except....I MADE FRIENDS around March. I was so happy, there was light in my life again. However, she contacted me after all this time. She said she missed me so much. She said she loved me. I ate that shit up. Honestly, I know she meant it. I know it. We started talking again, slipping into old habits. It was happy, but it felt like dating again? So I asked her what the hell was this. She said she didn’t know, and that all she knew is that she knew I was the one for her, but being apart wasn’t good for her mental health. A shitty crossroads to be at. 

Eventually, I laid out some boundaries. We agreed, it was stupid to be “just friends” it wouldn’t work. We decided that we should be close. Still talking, helping each other, but being respectful if one of us somehow got into another relationship. Long story short, the summer was a weird mix of being as I like to put it “very in love friends”. We cared for each other, talked about funny stuff, sent memes, but also flirted outrageously. Sometimes she would text me serious serious love stuff and I knew it was genuine. I would to the same.

There was definitely some major speed bumps. We of course talked less. Didn’t text each other 24/7 or call once a day. I felt ignored a lil. I needed some adjustment. She became snarky at times, cold even. We worked that out but it hurt. 

This culminated in her telling me that she hasn’t seen me in almost a year and its making it hard to reconnect with me. I agree, phones and FaceTime will never have that personal touch.

I was so hesitant. I did NOT want to spend money to see her just to have her getting her back blown out my some dude as soon as she got to university. I want to note, thats not who she is and I know that, she’s told me why, it was an irrational fear. At the root of it, I don’t want to feel used. I don’t want to spend this money, and feel like a fool. 

On the other hand, to maintain the relationship, maintain the promise, I do need to see her. I want to. I bought the ticket. I am going in October.

Heres why: about a week ago, her roomate called me. She told me that my ex was so sad she couldn’t see me, and that she clearly was still into me, and that she was turning down every guy just because “its not the same”, so her roomate said, look, this is a unique situation, but anyone can see y’all have something special. Don’t lose that, please come see her.

(she cannot come see me because her parents are really really really really bad people. they would annihilate her if they found out, and wouldn’t support it)

Judge me how you will. She is the one for me, and I wont stop loving her until she tells me its over. Theres more, my best friends from HS also go to her university, its a one stop shop for love, affection, bro time, partying, and just happiness. 

You may be now going, “okay, that sounds good! why are you lonely?”

I am back home right now with my parents. I took a semester off. I need time to reset, deal with my depression, deal with my anxiety, earn money to pay for school, and an apartment. However, I have no friends in this city, I work 55 hour weeks, I feel dead. 

I see all my friends going back to school, having fun, reconnecting, chilling together. 

And i’m here alone. Far away. I don’t feel real to them. I feel like a machine. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. I’m 20, I should be in my prime, yet I feel so low. 

I am going to go see her. I want to know, and see for myself if the love is still there. If its real, I will continue to put effort in. If it’s fake, I will have to move on, a big challenge. Wish me luck my friends.


This was a lot to type, if you are still here, I fucking salute you. This may seem like nothing, but to me its impacted me a lot and changed my life for better and worse. I will keep you all updated as to what happens.

So yeah, thats why I have the phrase “Love knows no distance”. It is so damn true. We love each other. However, distance can impact and warp the love we have, and make love something too intense to bear. 

Thank you for reading, this has helped me so much. Now people know what I am going through. I don’t care if this is “too long for reddit”, or a “stupid read”. I feel better. Thank you.",lonely,I hate the phrase “Love knows no distance”.,2019-09-24 13:18:33

I know about the intense rollercoaster that brought me here, and the one that has not fared particularly well on my appearance or my social skills. 

I forgot how emotionally taxing spending a 30 minute lunch period alone is.

485,hamartiated,1569290456,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I am lonely even though she is right there. No shared interests asides minor things such as genre of movies but that seems vague. Even though there is love the desire she once for me is extinguished. I miss passion, the touch, the warmth, the connection. The smells, tastes, and that ecstatic exhaustion after words. All I get is the occasional blowjob and a pat on the stomach as she peels away from what seems like a chore to her. There are those things that hinder like the loss of our first child and the medical scarring she has from it. Yet she knows of this and does nothing to repair it. I yearn to feel wanted in more ways than a friend or a father to our son. The only lynch pin that holds me, deadening fear of being torn from another child. So many years tied to the same person and property. Yet it seems dull, placid, and weak. I have no one to talk to about this issue that causes such anxiety.

Social skills. This term refers to skills that enable an individual to interact positively with the environment, which provides positive responses and avoiding negative ones.These skills allow individuals to satisfactorily adapt to the social environmental demands.

Individuals who lack social skills need to be trained in a structured manner and be presented with situations where the learned skill is to be used. In addition, they need to be exposed to increasingly socially complex situations. A particular group  who are especially prone to social deficits and who could greatly benefit from social skills training are individuals with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD).

Social skills interventions can help improve social abilities, such as cooperation, assertion, responsibility, empathy and self-control.",lonely,Social Skills,2019-09-24 09:32:34

In other words we had a really good conversation. We spoke about life and all sorts of other stuff. This was rare for me because I always come across old dudes with their dicks out on Omegle lol. Anyways what had happened was that he asked for my Snapchat/insta and right when I was about to give it to him at 4am, my laptop died, I put the charger on straight away and turned it back on but everything refreshed. So he probably thought I didn’t want to give him any of my socials. Anyways I’ve been on the hunt for him every since that happened.  

So the update is, I FOUND HIM!! Turns out he was looking for me too, it’s quite a long story as to how I found him but let’s just say it wasn’t easy. I can’t explain the feeling I had when I found him!! All I know is that I was overwhelmed with joy!! We’ve been talking non stop, and we FaceTime each other everyday.

Idk what I was expecting really. I knew it'd be long hours, but I thought it'd be fun and that I'd be useful. Neither of those things were true.

If I wasn't having fun but I still felt useful, I think I could commit to it. But I was such a hindrance, I know some of you will think I'm biased, and yeah to an extent, but I truly believe I was just getting in everyone's way.

I was looking forward to this for so long as a way to meet people, and I had pushed all my previous doubts out of my head because I just wanted to commit to something. But it became so clear very quickly that it would not be wise to commit to this. I really would have just ended up more and more miserable.

There is the big local convention coming up here in NZ and I am going as I do every year but I think this year is going to be even more isolating than last year. And last year was pretty bad. The cosplay I was working on isn't going to be allowed due to rule changes (which is fair enough its their event their rules) just wish I had known sooner or made enough adjustments to get it across the line.

My wife is super happy about the idea of me having a shit time so that I will stop going. I tried telling her that me not enjoying it will take away the only thing I look forward to in the year. She hates going due to crowds (everyone had their weak spots) and the other people I have previously gone with aren't going.

I use to hang out and travel with people but I seem to have been ostracized from the group and not seen anyone since like John Wick 2. I will put my hand up and say that is like all on me but it still sucks.

The feeling of loneliness. I go to school. There I meet my classmates / ""friends"". It feels nice, I'm not going to lie I have fun with them. But do they have fun with me? When I get home it hits me. The loneliness. I again feel not needed. Noone needs to write me, noone needs to chat with me, noone needs to hang out with me. It feels weird. Maybe the word I'm searching for is sad? But if I'm the reason why I'm lonely why should I feel sad for something that I did? Or maybe I didn't? I don't know.

The worst feeling of loneliness is at night. The feeling that you go to sleep unneeded and wake up feeling the same. Have some fun at school and then again sit at home, do homework, maybe play some games or something, take a shower, brush your teeth, go to sleep wondering how it would feel to actually have someone. Someone that wouldn't make you feel lonely. That one that would hold you when you would need it. Hold you together mentally. I know it's a lot to ask from a person but still, I would do the same.. Or it wouldn't be enough..? I don't know.

I just hope you don't feel the same way, I hope you'll have a wonderful night or day, depending when you're reading this, or should I say if even someone is reading this crap? Haha?

524,TheGreenHatIsMine,1569245043,4,"Ever been a little lost and confused about where you’re headed?

Ever feel like you sort of find it but it’s not where you should have found it?

Ever think you should feel guilty for it, but you can’t help how it turned out?

So recently in my relationship I have just been going through the motions.
We have only been together for 18 months now but I can’t help feeling like all is lost. She’s lazy. She has been living with me for some time, and for more than half I have been supporting her because she’s too lazy to get a job. She hasn’t made an effort with me. She doesn’t touch me. She has put on a whole load of weight. She doesn’t take care of herself. Doesn’t do her part with the house work. It’s a strain.

Let’s call “her” Grace.

So I feel like I’m holding onto what was the fun aspect at the beginning of the relationship. That excitement you get. The honeymoon stage. Maybe I love the idea. Not her. At least not anymore. She walks all over me. Uses me. I’m just a welcome mat that pays the food and rent bills. And I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired. I work myself to the bone and still can’t afford all the bills.

I spoke to her. 

I told her I feel like this between us isn’t going anywhere. I’m not happy. I don’t feel it anymore. That I want to try and work at it. That it’s a two way street.

Conveniently I think she’s forgot about that long conversation that lasted for hours over a night of tears. A night of raw emotion. She cried, I cried. but for a moment I could almost believe that she was trying to understand and that she would work to help. That was the best part of 3 months ago.

But I want to love her.

I cringe when she leans in for a kiss. I have to force myself to stop a recoil from an embrace. Everything she does frustrates me. Infuriates me. This isn’t how I imagined to be spending my life at 22. In constant need for money. I haven’t even experienced anything yet and I’m still waiting and waiting for something to pop out of the woodwork and give me a damn break.

But I want to love her!

Or I’m just indifferent. I just don’t care enough. I promise I’m human. I’m not heartless. I’m just tired.

I used to hang on every word she said like it was gold dust. Now she just bores me half to death. I am not interested in how her day is going. If her day at work was okay. Her sadness and feeling have just become an inconvenience that I feel obliged to listen to because I am in a relationship and that’s what’s the done thing. Right?

I want someone to want to touch me. I want someone I want to touch. I’m so lonely.

I feel so lost. And don’t know what avenue to take. Am I at a fork in the road or a dead end? Am I doing this to myself or is Grace a contribution?

Naturally, I turned to a friend. She has helped me through so much. She’s pulled me out of some dark places and even laid into me a few times when she knows I need the kick up the ass. “You deserve better”. “Grace doesn’t treat you right”. And all the statements that go hand in hand from a friend that cares. And I know all this. Somewhere I’m sure I know.

But I wanted to love her.

Grace slags off my whole family and lays into my little brother. She's so nasty. My mom has been paying for her too at this point.

But now here comes the cherry, sprinkles and icing one the cake.

The friend that gives all the support and love unconditionally? Spends time with me? Makes the effort with my incredibly autistic brother and is loved by my whole family? 

I love her too.

Far more than I should. More than is acceptable for a person already in a commited relationship is allowed to love someone else. The way I love her.
I don’t feel lonely when I’m with her. She held my hand and I’m weak. She hugs me and I have those fireworks all over.
Maybe I’m wrong? Maybe I am confusing my feelings for her because I’ve never had someone support me the way she does. I’ve never felt this way.

540,ketyockman,1569215953,1,"I am going to write down my thoughts and tough shit it’s going to be you that I send this one to.
This past month has been hard on me. I didn’t think it was and just thought it was just bad days, but after the second week of feeling shit I realised I was going through a low mood. So I acknowledged and owned it which is what I spoke about to you. I had such awareness of what was going on - negative thoughts warping me thoughts of reality. It’s the first time that I’ve been totally aware of the whole process and my past insecurities being brought to the forefront of myself. Owning the feeling and working towards getting rid of it has been ‘wild’ haha. It makes sense that it targets the person I love more than anything, but it has been the worst feeling not having trust. I didn’t think it was my low mood, I thought that things had changed and made up little stories behind actions. I now see it is though, and feel bad because I really took a huge step back in my emotional maturity and my ‘active love’, because I was too busy making up shit in my head. I haven’t been attentive to charlie. Been super withdrawn.
I want to take this moment to acknowledge how much I’m grateful for because I have been so busy hating everything bad in the world.
I’m so grateful for your patience, love, advice and tolerance in this whole experience Elouise. I truly mean that. You have shown me and reinforced that feeling content and happy in a relationship isn’t ‘textbook’. I’m finding it difficult to express in words, but I guess I mean how you don’t judge or care about how relationships ‘should be’ aka immature views of the man doing everything and spoiling you. True love when you get to the core is just spending time with each other is what you’ve shown me. I appreciate that because I know when I feel anxious I reach to others for validation and reassurance, my relationship with Charlie can be viewed as ‘youre both different’ or ‘not long term’. Peoples opinions on someone else’s love is irrelevant. They aren’t in the relationship and don’t know it. My biggest concern with Charlie is that I think things as cliche as it sounds are too good to be true. It’s my most honest and vulnerable relationship so I’m scared of getting hurt and overwork things.
But ENOUGH OF THAT! That’s the problem, I forgot what charlie also is. My best friend who I have been super neglecting because I let the term of ‘boyfriend’ Be such a worry for me. I’m sad about it but really trying to retouch base and connect with him on a companion/partnership. And hey, things will suck eggs if I’m not with him in 3 months time, but that’s still 90 good days left I can have with him. And I can’t keep pushing people away because I’m
Scared of being hurt because if I do that forever then I’ll never be truly content. I know this all seems stupid as shit because I am older and therefore should be wiser and stronger so I’m sorry that you’ve had these basic daily dealings with my irrational mind. My goodness after yesterday’s car ride I felt so bad! All I’ve done is focus on negative and even when I’ve talked to you I can see how one-sided and ‘demanding high-mantainece’ it all has been.

I miss looking forward to waking up knowing I will see my mates and have a good day.

I miss physical touch: a hug of greetings, shoulders rubbing whilst sitting, leaning against each other at sleepovers, laying hands on each other whilst praying. 

I miss making others laugh. Watching as the smile spreads from one face to the next until it reaches my own.

I miss people saying my name and seeing their lips move as they say it. Damn I miss people saying my name in greetings or calling me out from a crowd. 

Fuck. 

I wake up, a sense of dread fills me and I return to my mediocre dream which seems like bliss next to reality. 

I cling to my pillow. I hug it tighter, maybe if I hug it tightly enough it will hug me back. A stranger bumps into me whilst getting groceries, it fills me with a warmth I didn't expect. 

I make a funny comment on twitter. People like it and seem to find it funny. There is no gratification, the smile never spreads back.

560,hamartiated,1569205078,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

565,Kaiju1964,1569202720,1,"So I (23M) feel like telling the story about how I was once the 9th wheel. I do want to clarify a few things though. First, I'm not looking for people to feel bad for me as this happened years ago and I laugh about it now. Second, I'm currently don't feel as lonely as I did when I was 19 when this happened, but I do consider it one of my loneliest times in my life. Third, I hope that this helps people who feel lonely know that it does eventually get better.

So this was either my first or second semester in college and break was coming up. I had a group of friends back then and I talked to one of my friends who lived in the dorms to about having a movie night with pizza before break starts since some of the people in the group lived hours away making it hard to hang out. Since I considered myself the host I offered to buy the pizza and bring the movies. When getting the other people in the group to come most were able to go. Now this wasn't anything really new as we've done stuff like this before, but the only difference is that most of the people in our group were in a relationship with either someone else in the group or someone outside of the group. I was not one of those people.

Now, I obviously invited the other single people in the minority of the group with them saying they'll try to go but might not be able to. For a week leading up to the movie night I was thinking to myself ""man, wouldn't it suck if I was the only single person at the movie night"" well let's just say welcome to self fulfilling prophecy. None of my other friends who were single were able to come so movie night was 9 people with 8 of them with their SO. In other words I pretty much created a quadruple date for my friends. Congratulations past me, you played yourself.

Now I'm someone who doesn't like to ask people to give me money and I already offered to pay for the pizza so not only did I set up a quadruple date, I was paying for it *epic facepalms*. Now because the pizza place we were ordering from was too far away to get delivered I went to grab the pizza alone which was kind of a good thing. On the way to the pizza place I remember crying almost the entire 25 to 30 minute drive there as I felt completely distraught. I kept asking myself all the questions like ""why can't I get a gf?"" And so on but in an ugly crying tone. I still ended up having to wait for the pizza to be made when I got there which was definitely a good thing because it gave me time to collect myself. On my way back I did eat a couple of slices, because I paid for the pizza, but I was wondering if I was even missed or if my friends knew how lonely I felt.

When I got back I tried my best to act happy and like I was having a good time. I couldn't really leave early because I was the host. I don't remember much specifics after that other than a few things. During one of the movies all the couples were cuddling with each other during one if the movies and I had to just try my best to ignore it and focus on the film. One of my friends there jokingly asked if I wanted to cuddle with him and his boyfriend. I probably answered with something like ""nah, I'm good."" In a positive manner or as close to positive as I could produce. As the night ended I was left to clean up with my friends helping out but I left the dorms feeling sad and tired.

Afterwards, the one friend whose dorm building we were having it in mentioned that he and his gf at the time noticed how I was kind of left out socially. Now, like I said I laugh about it now even though I still don't have a gf I learned to get over it and try to enjoy life as is with the close friends I have. If there's a moral of the story I guess it would be either don't let your relationship status stop you from enjoying yourself or don't set up a quadruple date for your friends without you having a date yourself. If you made it this far thanks for reading, it feels good to get this stuff out.

TL;DR: In college I set up a quadruple date for my friends where I was the host and paid for it.",lonely,How I was the 9th wheel for one night.,2019-09-23 11:38:40

567,atotallunatic,1569199157,4,"Introverted  with severe anxiety and depression, both relating to ASD.

I don't get along with people face-to-face. My own family grates on my nerves. It's gotten to the point where I practically live in my room, only venturing out to grab food or use the bathroom.

And, for the most part, I like this lifestyle. Not having someone constantly watching over me feels great. However, as I have learned, there are two main drawbacks to this.

Firstly, my personal hygiene is horrid. I shower once or twice a week (at best), wear the same clothes for days on end, and have yet to open a fresh tube of toothpaste that's been sitting on the counter for months. My messy environment doesn't help, either. I've found dirty sushi trays trapped under my bed on more than one occasion.

Secondly, I don't have any friends.

Well, that's not entirely true. I have one friend who lives down the street from me, yet we haven't seen each other face-to-face in literal months, and my anxiety keeps me away from texting him. So, yeah. One friend, whom I haven't seen since June. It probably doesn't help that I'm homeschooled, either.

I know some of you are thinking, ""Well, why don't you go out and make them?"" And I want to. The thing is, I just can't. I cannot set foot in a public area without having a massive panic attack, provided it's located anywhere near my former school. I'm fine with going out in totally alien areas, so long as no one tries to talk to me, in which case the anxiety gets almost unbearable.

I do have meds to treat it. My psychiatrist prescribed me extremely low doses of hydroxyzine. They are supposed to be taken situationally, and I would, if my mom would let me have access to them. I think she's afraid I'll get addicted or overdose, which is practically impossible at this dosage. We've brought it up to the psychiatrist, and he sides with me, but she still won't listen.

My only interactions with non-family members are with biweekly group therapy sessions. Surprisingly, those go swimmingly. It seems I can't hold a conversation with anyone who isn't mentally ill to some degree...

I don't particularly want to be in a relationship. I've never really felt the urge to be in one. Back when I was in public school, some people would hint about their feelings toward me, and I just wouldn't care. That said, having a girlfriend would probably help to some degree, at least until the inevitable breakup. I'm woefully irresponsible, so I'd probably end up dragging the person down.

I think I'm just gonna cut it off here. This post was supposed to be a ""help me"" affair, but at this point it's become the ramblings of a total lunatic (he he).

TL;DR: At this point, my social life is a lost cause.",lonely,"I love being alone, I just hate being lonely.",2019-09-23 10:39:17

574,MJtheMC,1569195498,3,"     6 months ago my wife started learning Spanish. She was doing really good so I told her to check out Interpals to find spanish women to talk with. She told me she met an ""evangelist"" from India. She said she wanted to send his church a box of old clothes for winter, and I thought nothing else of it. Fast forward 2-3 months. I notice her Google Hangouts app is up on her desktop PC and there are no chats in it. I asked her why that was up. My wife is not a tech-savy person so it would be work for her to download the desktop app. She shrugged it off and so did I. A couple weeks later I asked her if she was talking to the India man still. She said no, but when she said it I could tell she was lying. I really wouldn't have a problem with her talking to someone on the other side of the planet, but lying was odd. Imagine being with someone 8-9 years and being able to tell when they lie easily. So I honestly shrug it off for about a week. The following week it starts bugging me. I know it's an invasion of privacy but I put a keylogger on her computer. I know, I know. I read what she had been saying. She was telling this man she loved him. I was furious. I confronted her. She lied about it 3 times, when I asked if she was still talking with him. The 4th time I told her what she had said to him and I know what she said. She still lied and had a pure look of shame on her face. She admitted it that night and told me she would stop talking to him. I said ok. But again I checked the messages. She told him that she couldn't live without him, and it doesn't matter what I say she will always love him. I confront her again. She's obviously pissed about me reading messages. Note this whole time we are NOT arguing we are being adults and talking about this. I pretty much tell her fuck it just have a boyfriend if this is what you want (testing her). She says no she must stop talking with him. That she will send one package a year and one letter on his birthday.... barf. And she says she wants privacy and for me to not read this time. Of course I read. She tells him that he is her soulmate, that she will always love him. You have to understand, no matter what you believe my wife is a highly ""Christian"" woman. So I start giving her Bible verses after confronting her again. I say there is no way you could love us both and that she does not love me anymore. She tells me she does not want a divorce and wants to stay together. She deletes everything and tells me she's done for good. She kept hidden folders on her desktop PC with pictures and video messages. She constantly deletes her email trash. Again. My wife is not a tech-savy person. Deleting her trash in her email is suspect. I figure she probably still talks with him. And honestly I don't care. If she doesn't love me it is what it is. I am just sad because we have a 2 year old son. He is such a good kid and I do not want him to go thru that divorced family shit. But honestly I don't see a point in staying in a relationship with someone that does not love me, and has proved she is a blind faced liar and will lie to my face even when there is proof.  

     So a couple months goes by. Again I know she is talking with the man still. Or still loving him, whatever. So out of nowhere I meet a woman from Egypt. She is a model and she is a nice person. We fall in love. We talk multiple times a day. The tables have turned. But this woman tells me she cannot be with me or marry me if I am a Christian and do not convert to Islam. So now I am sitting here losing my mind. Holding on by a string just to keep my son happy. Because at the end of the day he is ALL that matters. We're in a crazy situation and I think I am going to pay off what little debt we have and divorce her. She will probably have to move in with her mom, and I will probably have to live in my car until I can buy a house. If I even want to buy a house. I'm not sure I want to. I'm just feeling very strange. And these religions, and how people use them are really strange... just feeling alone... i have told no1.

596,Random_Username54,1569181533,11,"I've never really been one to post stuff online but I really dont know where else to turn. From the outside it looks like I'm doing fine. I'm 25 years old, graduated engineering school, got a relatively high paying job out of college, and I'm doing well for myself. But in reality I don't like my job and I rarely do anything social outside of work. I've never had a girlfriend. Most of my college friends are far away such that I can only see them on occasion. The ones that are close by rarely want to do anything. All of the friends that I have made in the area such as through work are superficial and don't really know me. Generally speaking for the past 5 years at least my day to day mood has ranged from emptiness to depression. Any feeling of happiness has been relatively short lived and overall life feels meaningless and I cant foresee any likely scenario that would change this.

I guess recently a string of bad weeks has put me in this sad mood. Labor day weekend I was really sick and couldn't do anything, which sucked because some of my friends were doing stuff. 

The following weekend I went back to my parents house to attend a wedding of a family friend. My entire family lives in the area and since I went to college I've only seen my 2 older brothers and my older sister during breaks such as Christmas. I was still a little sick from the week prior and my brothers get extremely paranoid when someone's sick so I neglected to see them until the wedding, even though I had taken a few days off. When I finally saw my brothers at the wedding it was like I barely knew them. My brothers tend to exclusively hang out with each-other when they're together so I should've expected it, but still, I literally grew up with them and hadn't seen them in a year and its like I didn't even know them. Not to mention that I didnt know the vast majority of the people at the wedding. My brothers end up leaving the wedding early without telling anyone and I just get drunk off of the open bar (I usually don't drink at all).

Fast forward to this weekend. My 2 favorite EDM DJs are having concerts Thursday and Friday in my town which is especially crazy because I don't live in an area where you'd expect to have big concerts. I knew about this months in advance and had bought tickets really early. One of my brothers is also a huge fan of the Thursday guy and a couple months ago he said he'd come up with his old college roommate who I know. These plans fell apart at the last minute. The Monday of that week, my brother had told me that he didn't buy a ticket and he couldn't take off work that Friday so he couldn't go. He said his roommate had bought the ticket but couldn't go because he had a bachelor party he had to go to that he forgot about. 

I had also asked all of my friends in the area a few weeks ago. All of them said no to Thursday either due to having plans or not liking the genre of music. One particular denial hit me hard. I had asked my closest friend to multiple different concerts each time he came up with an excuse for why he couldn't go, such as he's doing something with his family. And I really didn't have any reason to doubt him. This time he flat out said that even though he likes the music, he's ""not a concert guy"". Which would normally be fine but it rubs me the wrong way for 2 reasons. First it makes me think that he was lying the other times he said he didnt want to do things. The second is because whenever we do hang out, probably his number one thing he wants to do is go to bars and dance. I usually go along with it even though I hate the mainstream music they play at bars. 

So I end up going to the concert alone. I'm able to have a good time at the concert but as soon as it ends and I leave its like a light switch and I'm back to that empty lonely state.   


Then the Friday concert.

So I did the same thing with the Friday concert as the Thursday one. I had asked all the same friends, but this time the only people who had said yes were some friends from work. I asked a bunch of people, but I specifically focused on my closest work friend. We had gone out to bars before and he's a really outgoing social person so it seemed like he'd be interested. So he never wanted to give me a straight answer, often switching the topic whenever I brought it up. He waits until the week of the concert to start giving me an answer, but he flip flops multiple times. On Monday he starts off by saying he wants to but he cant afford it, which I don't buy because we make approximately the same amount of money because we're both new hires. That and also he's willing to spend a lot more on a casual night of drinking. That same day we find out that you can get discounted tickets. So he says he'd be willing to go with the discount. So we plan on meeting at my place after work then heading to the concert. Then Friday morning, he texts me saying that he's not going because he didn't buy his ticket yet and the discount ended on Wednesday. This made me feel like shit cuz I had just gotten blown off two nights in a row. I took Friday off so I could sleep in after the Thursday concert and so I could clean my apartment because people were coming over, but now that nobody was coming I just did nothing all day. Then at 4pm he says that he's going again and that he invited a few of his friends from out of town, none of which I know.  


So the work friend goes back to his apartment after work to get changed and whatnot. He lives approximately 40 minutes away from my apartment. I live approximately 10 minutes away from the concert. The concert starts at 8pm doors open 7pm. I looked up the supporting acts and I would've liked to see all of them, but I specifically wanted to see the guy who went on at 8:40, all of which I let my friend know. We plan on meeting at my place at 7pm. I rush out to clean the apartment and get some stuff at the liquor store because I don't have anything because I usually don't drink. 7pm rolls around and nobody's here, so I call my friend. He said that the guys from out of town had a late start and are headed to his apartment, expected to get there around 8pm. I propose that everybody can come directly to my place IF they can get here by 8pm (which might actually be the case because of traffic around my friend's place). Otherwise, we should just meet at the concert. I also remind my friend that it takes approximately 40 minutes to get from his place to my place. I hang up at around 7:10. Then at 8pm, nobody's here. I call my friend again and he says that he hasnt left his apartment yet and his friends are 25 minutes away from my place. I tell him to fuck off and I'm leaving and locking my apartment. He's mad at me for doing this because I was the one who suggested this idea, ignoring the fact that I said if they can get here by 8. He then tells his friends to turn around and go to his apartment, even though at that point they could've just went straight to the concert. And I end up going to the Friday concert alone as well. As a side note I had to watch half of the 8:40 act from a distance because getting through the security check took so long.   


And again the concert was fun but at the same time I couldn't shake the feeling that I was there alone. It sucks. I hardly see the people that I care about. When I do see them it doesnt go as well as I hoped. I can make new friends because of shit like this. Not to mention the other stuff that I haven't gone into like my job (this post is already too long). And then it also seems like nobody I encounter shares any interests, even my close friends from college. It just seems incredibly unlikely that something will work out and in all likelihood I'm doomed to this empty existence.",lonely,Superficial Friendships and Mundane Existence,2019-09-23 05:45:33
597,TheCarlyleanHero,1569180183,1,"I was always lonely growing up. I have never had any close friends or a relationship. I thought I was doing well and didn't need anyone. Then I came to university and realised how lonely life is with no one by your side.

Long story short, in the first year of university I made the idiotic mistake of falling for a girl who was taken. It was a disaster. It ruined our friendship and also my relations with quite a few other people. She was the closest friend I've ever had. I'm not sure I'll ever find anyone like her. We would talk regularly and share music (we had similar music tastes) and our personal problems. Now I have no one to do that with.

I have tried the most insane things out of desperation for love. Desperation is not attractive, I know, but I can't help it. I have been through a lifetime of rejection by my peers. I feel lost and lonely and in desperate need of affection and adoration. I feel like I will never quite get it. I will never fit in or belong anywhere. I will always be a loner.

I do have one thing going for me, which is music. In the songs of singers like Jim Reeves, Al Martino, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and others, I have found solace and comfort in knowing that my pain has been expressed through music by men long before me. My ambition is to become a singer. I've been told I have a great voice. In my spare time I like to sing for the elderly in a local care home. Sadly, few people my age share my taste in music.

I've been feeling useless and lonely.
I've got no motivation for myself.


I'm happy my close friends both found partners that can make them happy but sometimes it just gets to me and really drives home that I dont have anyone waiting for me like they do.

I dont have anyone to wake up to or fall asleep with.
No one i can trust myself with intimately and have them feel the same way.
No one to share my life with.


I feel like everyone is moving on with their life and  I'm just stagnate.


Lately, I've just been thinking that I should've never been born.
That I'll never find anyone who could love me.


I know it all sounds pathetic and like I'm asking for a pity party but I just really need someone to tell me it's gonna ok.

I've just been hurting a lot lately and I don't wanna burden anyone in my life with my shit.

Ive struggled with drugs and alcohol ever since the age of 14 because they were the only things that gave me the ability to like relieve the constant anxious/nervous pressure in my head. Its just like everyone in my life that cares for me is like because of an obligation to care wheather thats my therapists, addiction counselots, people from the last sober living home i was in (a couple of which were genuinaly good people that wanted a friendship with me) and my family so nobody in my life really cares for me that doesn't pretty much have to and that's pathetic and its one of the main reasons that i have decided to end things.

I was best friends with my roommate and 2 other girls on my floor freshman year until my roommate began to bully me and they took her side.

I joined a club sport and have a friend ""group"" that I get together with once in awhile but don't hang out with them regularly. When I do spend time with them, I feel like I'm being invited out of obligation and no one really talks to me/they don't want me there.

I joined a professional sorority- I'm even on the executive board. I have lots of acquaintances there too, but they have their own groups and I don't get invited to hang out with them. I've made plans with some of them but I'm always the one initiating things.

I moved into an apartment with 2 other people, and they're really good friends with each other. I knew that from the start, but I didn't think they would pretend I didn't exist.

I have a boyfriend but we're in a long-distance relationship so I only see him on breaks.

I don't know what to do or what I'm doing wrong; I had lots of friends in high school. I have no one to regularly hang out with, to study with, to do stuff at night with.

This will be all over the place as I can’t gather my thoughts in the right order but here goes: 

Was it something I said? Something I did? Am I not good enough? When will my heart not hurt anymore and long for things I know I can’t have? Will I ever not feel this way?

I just wish we could go back to how we used to be when I was cuddled up in your buttery soft arms. 

What I would give to hear you call me “babe” just once.

I’d give it all to rewind time. If I had to choose between never meeting you, knowing what I do, I would do it all over again. 

In the short time I knew you, I felt so connected to you on so many levels that I’ve never felt with anyone before. I know you felt it too, you can’t argue that point. 

I have never met someone so addicting before. You’re like adderall, I can never get enough. I feen for your touch. Even though we aren’t romantically involved anymore doesn’t mean I don’t still care for you. 

If living through the pain of this terrible life again meant never forgetting you, I would do it without a second thought.

I have never been so comfortable with anyone before like I was with you. I can also say I never had fallen for someone so quickly before. 

You’re a sight for sore eyes, but I don’t mean just your looks. Your soul and energy more than anything.

You’ve endured a lot in this life, more than most people can say honestly. If anyone deserves to be loved and happy, that’s you. I’m sorry I couldn’t be that one worth of you, but I hope you never forget our good times. 

In the short time I knew you, I learned a lot of things I didn’t know about myself. 

I hope one day I connect with someone again the way I did with you, but this feels different (to me). I’m fairly certain I won’t click like this again, but that’s quite alright. I will always long for and cherish what we did have. It’s just hard knowing I may never feel this way again in my gut.

Maybe it’s best this way. I am young, but I fear after everything life has thrown my way over the years, I’m just a broken toy that eventually gets donated.

I’m more of a half empty glass type of gal. I’ve always been this way and fear I will never change. 

As these tears hit this screen I’m beginning to think I’m disposable. As if I can be used and thrown in the trash without another thought. Is this how I’m seen? As a Kleenex? A sad, little tissue I’m using right now to dry these tears caused by the trauma of my life. 

People always tell me that they care, but as I slowly kill my liver, where are you? When I self harm, where are you? When I need you to hold me while I cry, where are you? 

You? You’ve always been right there even though we are complicated. I hope you remember me as the one who got away. Maybe our timing was off. But I’m not like you. I can’t just write our time and conversations off as nothing. I can’t pretend I never knew you..

I pretend everything is fine, but it’s not.

I’m also starved for attention, yet can’t properly appreciate or thank those who do give me attention. I am conflicted. I recently lost and entire group of friends of who I had an online relationship with.

When I lost them, I fell into the arms of a girl who we had mutual feelings. Now she wants me out of her life. 

My grandmother, and last remaining grandparent, passed away yesterday morning.

Roughly 4 days ago I tried drowning myself.

I am not a first time to this page. This is about my 3rd time being here.

I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, and I live I clean life style, however I’ve developed an addiction to sleeping pills. When ever I have free time or a day off from school or work, I take about 4 over the counter sleeping pills at once. Doesn’t matter the time of day or night, if I have nothing to do within the next hour, it’s a sleeping pill.
I’ll skip meals and hygiene if it’s bad enough. 

I’m told I need to learn to love myself, but it’s hard to do so when you are alone. 
Let me be clear, I’m comfortable with who I am. I just don’t love who I am.

I need friends. I have a hard time asking for help, and like I said it’s very hard to me to also accept help. I have a tendency to stress or hurt others unintentionally.

667,ayejaytemporaris,1569102477,2,"I don't expect an instant cure from this post. I just need to get my thoughts out.

I've always been an introvert. And I've always been ""closed"", so to speak. I've never understood how to just be completely open and inviting to strangers, which has obviously hindered making friends. I can, at a stretch, for a limited time force myself out of this, i.e. in the first weeks of University, but I can't keep this up for long and inevitably fall back into the comfort of my own company.

I'm 32 now. I've never had a proper relationship (just short-term things that we both knew were short-term things, and the last of those was five years ago now.) I've never slept with a girl I truly cared for.

I don't have a great circle of friends to make up for that void either. I have a few friends, but they're all unconnected to one other - there's no opportunity to go on group holidays or have game nights etc, cus at most there's only two of us. And they all have girlfriends or wives, so I'm understandably not a key part of their lives. This can be summed up by the fact that if we meet up, it'll be the major event of my week but a tiny footnote in theirs.

I haven't had a holiday in eight years, because I have no-one to go with. I take my annual leave from work but have nothing to do with it. I'd love to go somewhere, but alone? I can't do it. And I'm not outgoing or naturally welcoming (or good looking) enough to be one of those people who can travel the world and meet amazing people at every stop. I'd set off alone, see whereever alone, and come back alone. I've considered things like moving to a completely new town, but it would just change the scenery, not who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

All this together makes me even more closed off from others. I am actually afraid(!) of the completely benign questions ""what are you doing this weekend?"", or ""have you got any holidays planned?"" from colleagues at work, because I'm terrified they'll see how boring my existence is. Everyone does something at the weekends, even if it's just family stuff. If I'm meeting a friend for a drink on Saturday evening (maybe once or twice a month) I'll try and say that, but what about the rest of Saturday and Sunday, weekend after weekend... 

I hate talking about myself, because there's so little to ever say. Even people I get on with at work, after a few months I've already told them about past holidays etc and I run out of things to say, because nothing new happens to me and I have no new experiences to tell. And this makes making new friends impossible - at an age where most people have settled down anyway, with families of their own.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I've been trying to think of something to do or someplace to go, even just for a drive. But I realise I'll just get out of the car at wherever (let's say I drove to the countryside), and look around, then get back in my car and drive home...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really think I'm depressed about things anymore. I've been depressed before, and it was way more intense than this. This is just...... Numb. 

I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I'm unlikely to ever meet anyone, partly because I don't know how to, and partly because I've become completely entrenched in introversion to a level where even if I go to a friend's house by 10pm I'm craving solitude instead. I'm even becoming closed off from my parents, and barely tell them anything anymore.

I'm bored of my life, and don't see how it can improve unless I completely change everything about myself, but even if I somehow manage to do that I still don't see how I can meet new friends, or a partner. Part of it is a catch-22 situation - I don't do anything because I don't have close enough friends/a partner, which makes my life boring, which gives me nothing to talk about, which means I'm less likely to make a good enough impression on anyone for them to become a friend or partner.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a half-decent job, which eventually will lead to decent pay, and I've been going in early and leaving late because for the most part I actually enjoy it. But at the end of the day it's just a job. Someone in my company fell extremely ill a few months back, after dedicating a huge amount of their life to the job, and only one person went to see them in hospital. They'll probably never be able to work again. Was that job dedication worth it at the expense of what really matters? And what really matters is exactly what I don't have, nor do I ever see myself having.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of hobbies I've slowly dropped everything. Even video games, which I've always used as a distraction from these problems, have lost their appeal. I haven't turned on my games console in months. I've always been okay at most sports but never great at any of them, hence I never joined any clubs or met anyone that way. Apart from that? Nothing really.

&amp;#x200B;

Will I continue like this? For a while at least. But weekends are long, and the future looks so bleak, that I genuinely don't know. When I was majorly depressed I'd think about suicide but it was never more than that, but that was at University and I knew the future could change. But I'm now past that, and things are actually worse since everyone around me has adapted to adulthood whilst I've been left behind, living in an empty flat by myself.

I've always been a lonely person. To make a long story short, childhood trauma f-ed me up pretty badly and made me a severely anxious and socially awkward person. It got pretty bad for me when I left for University. I moved out to live on my own in a bigger city. I've been there for almost 5 years now, and I don't have a close relationship with anyone. I don't really have any friends. My former friends from back in my hometown invite me for drinks a few times a year when I'm there, but I know that it's because they feel bad for me. 
But I think the worst part in all of this is living with myself. I am so angry at myself for being anxious about irrational things. I am so angry at myself for being depressed while it could be so much worse. I am so angry at myself for being unable to interact with another person properly because I'm such a mess. I am disgusted with myself for envying people who have friends and relationships. I'm amazed by how pathetic I am.
I yearn to be closer to people. I would like to get in a normal relationship, but I can't. I can't, because nobody would love a faulty defective thing like me. And most of all, I can't because even if there were someone for me, I would never inflict that on them. I would never want someone to have to live with an ugly, uninteresting, flawed person like me. 
I know that I'm a burden. To the people that know me, who make efforts to be nice to me. To my only friend, my mom, who doesn't even know that I'm struggling because I don't want to admit that to her.
But in a paradoxical and probably selfish way, I still can't help to feel lonely. These last few days, for some reason, I feel almost crushed by that to the point where I'm not able to function anymore.
I'm at the point where I need to tell my story to strangers on the internet because I feel like that will help. I felt like writting everything down could maybe take some weight of my shoulders.

675,WardsWardsWardsWard,1569094177,6,"Just wanted to share my life story as im feeling terribly lonely and depressed.

I've never had a lot of friends when growing up.I've always been abit ""slow"",hence i would act or say something weird at most times thinking it was ""cool"". But i still managed to make small groups of friends who didn't mind my weirdness,usually with others who didn't totally fit in as well.After realising how weird i was after thinking about these.I developed severe social anxiety.this made it even more difficult to talk to people,the constant fear of others making fun of me behind my back or thinking im weird and wanting to stay away.my entire primary school life i was lonely. i was the weird kid in class,i was made fun of alot.My appearance didn't help either,i the tallest in class yet i'm very thin,weighing as much as an average girl (i'm a guy).i basically looked like a stickman.These happened in primary school.

Now onto secondary school.I wanted to start fresh,start a new,my secondary school was one that was located very far away from my primary school,no one knew me,it was the perfect chance to start anew! Or so i thought.Everyone already had friends they made during primary school.again i started off alone.During the school orientation activities and games,i tried my best to speak up and participate,but i was ignored.On the second day of orientation,just as things got a little better,i manage to screw it up terribly.on that day someone came to talk to me,introduced me to afew of his friends.on that day,the orientation had a fun game using rock paper scissors.STUPID me got overly aggressive as i was engrosses in the games and started shouting and laughing away as i won in streaks.and yelling terrible stuff to the players on the other side.I'm guessing because of this,people no longer tried to approach me.Of course i regretted and cringed when i thought about it,but i didnt want to stop trying,i didnt want a repeat of my life in primary school,being shunned and lonely.

I tried to join into groups,tried to approach others,turns out.In my class,no one played video game but me.everyone's interest lied elsewhere.mainly in sports like basketball.As the skinny boy i was,i had no interest or experience in sports,i wasn't able to join or contribute in any conversation at all.i was lonely for the first 2 years.However.I manage to get through it as i had 3 friends from my primary school who would play video games with me.

Om the 3rd year of secondary school.i manage to make a very small group of friends,there were 5 of us,the others didn't play games either,but they didn't mind my weirdness,instead they found it a little funny,hence i was able to be the funny person for once,i would try my best to make them laugh as much as possible.i was confident for once.they were people i could talk about anything to.

This point in time was probably the peak in my life so far,i was happy and not lonely.However,nothing last forever.everything slowly went downhill.2 of my primary school friend slowly stopped coming online as they spent more time with their new friends in secondary school,to the point where they would reply my messages after days or even weeks.the last primary school friend found a girl  friend whom he met online in a game,had a huge crush on,and ""ditched me"".he completely stopped playing with me for the girl.From this point on i looked forward to school everyday as thats when i had friends with me.i didn't like the school holidays as i was bored and lonely.

This didnt last either as my secondary school life came to an end.everyone went their separate ways and found new friends BUT me.in my new school,i wasn't the weird kid anymore,i learnt to restrain and control myself.i could hang with the others in class,join in for lunch,but i wasn't close enough to be invited to outings.same thing as secondary school,i could not join in the conversation,nobody played games,the only topic that rises is ""girlfriends,relationship,sex"". I never even had a female friend before,there was nothing i could say,i just listened in silence.

Everyone i knew left.even my online friends got into a relationship and stopped playing with me.I've got no one left and i feel so terrible.I wish i could find friends that stayed or a girlfriend that i could play with.Looking at everyone else having a big clique of friends or a girlfriend.I feel lonely and depressed.honestly,i cant help but feel jealous of everyone else.

689,raymondsebond,1569074277,3,"&gt;Yesterday, I thought a lot of books. Every monday, I go to therapy and usually I have lunch, before therapy, in what is a bookshop/restaurant. The food there is good enough and very cheap. Anyway, yesterday I went there and then saw if they had the translation I wanted of Swann's Way. They didn't but I still bought a book: Limonov by Carrère. Emmanuel Carrère is one of the greatest writers of contemporary French literature and I had heard his name, knew some of his works by name and had even read some articles by him, so I thought it was time to get to know more of his literary work. Limonov is a biographical novel about the life of Eduard Limonov, a poet, a writer and a fascist-ish Russian politician. It has been a quite interesting read: Limonov is despicable but his life was (and, I presume, still is) fascinating. Carrère's writing is very honest. I do like buying books. I feel some kind of pleasure when I do. I buy books for many reasons: because I have heard of their authors, because of their publishing houses (yeah), because of their covers. I bought Limonov because of its cover and because I had heard of its author.

That's a paragraph I sent someone. That does summarize my life quite a bit: literature, therapy and France. I've loved France since I was a child (for real); I'm in therapy and I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar; and I love literature and I love writing. Last year, I was interning at a bank and I bought more than seventy books with my salary. I'm compulsive. I love Tolstoy, Faulkner, T.S. Eliot and many others; and I know I might sound arrogant because of this, so I should say I cried at Gossip Girl's finale. Really cried. I loved Gossip Girl. I also love Tintin. Why am I telling you this? Because you might love Tintin as well. Or you might be Belgian: if you are Belgian, please I thank you all for Tintin.

Besides literature, being mentally ill, and having a love for France, I also have a bit of enthusiasm for cinema. I have helped to direct a short film and I just learned it is going to compete in a festival. I'm quite excited. I also just decided I want to study Political Science in uni. I'm quite excited. I'd love to talk more about being mentally ill, about loving France (and not knowing French) and many others countries, about politics, literature, cinema, about Tintin and many other things. I'd love to share my writing, to exchange books and chocolate. I'd love you to be from anywhere, be from India, France, Switzerland, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Suriname or Luxembourg.

Back when I was 12-16, I was bullied quite often.   
I turned away from people and sought out the comfort of books and fictions.  
From there, I find myself straying into the non-fiction sections. One, in particular, caught my attention.  
Psychology.

I read through it and understood depression from a clinical level.   
I learnt about how people engaged in self-harm to feel better.

I tried to cut myself.  
It hurts. lol.   
It wasn't worth it.   
I remember then, thinking that I would rather throw myself into stories than to cut my wrists.  
I think of myself as some sort of ""*misunderstood hero""* where I would withstand my sadness through sheer force of will and a bit of cleverness.

That's where it all began.  
I thought that if I learn more,  
If I read more,  
I can become a real boy.

Fast forward to today,   
I have tons of head knowledge on how to go out and socialize.   
A mixed bag of information ranging from ""Pickup Artists"", ""Redpill"", ""MGTOW"" etc.   
I filter out the toxic teachings as much as possible and implement the rest into my life.  
Started going to the gym  
Talking to people more  
Trying out new activities that allow me to engage with people  
Going through subreddits for relationships / friends etc  
Dating Apps...

But at the end of the day, something in my head says that I'm just faking it all.   
That I'm still the same little boy that runs to the library  
I'm still the same weakling that abandoned reality for something fictional.

I tell myself to ""expect nothing"" when talking to people  
For that is how it is supposed to be done right?   
No expectations, no problems.

I tell myself that people will be sad if I commit suicide.   
We can't have that now, can we? It will be selfish to make others feel terrible.  
Maybe once my parents are gone, and when I'm no longer talking to anyone...  
That will still take a while though. 

It's so tiring.  
I keep going through the list of ""what to do"" and ""what not to do"".  
PUA says ""You fake it till you make it.""  
Until it becomes part of you.

How long is it going to take? 

I shouldn't have picked up that book then.  
Shouldn't have tried to fix myself.  
I should have just go through the normal life of suffering and enlightenment,   
Not this current state of half-fixes and DIY-repairs

I feel lonely.

So that night \*in my dream\*  I decided to bike to a convenience store to buy things to make me happy, once arrived there was a group of people looking up to no good, they stared at me as I was locking my bike, after finishing locking my bike I head inside the convenience store to look for things, the store was empty because it was late at night and most people were sleeping, and stands there the convenience store cashier doing his night shift. As looking around the store and I suddenly hear some loud noises outside and ran outside to see what's going on, then I saw my bike, destroyed, pieces everywhere, and both wheels gone. I quickly looked around and saw the group of people riding motorcycles and two of them holding my bike wheels and everyone in the group laughing at me. I quickly ran back inside and told the cashier what happens, the cashier told me he couldn't anything and gave me a  cigarette to calm down, but I said no to the cigarette because I don't smoke so he ended up giving me coffee instead, seconds later I wake to my alarm, when I woke up I started to cry.

I was always talking to her whether that be in person or on Snapchat. We're both in college so she slept over at my dorm literally every day. I didn't know relationship burnout was a very real thing and eventually it came to a point where we would have the same conversations every day - it would still be fun and playful but there would be moments where I would just feel really bad, borderline disgusted from talking to her even though nothing in the conversation has triggered it ever. We've never gotten into an argument and on paper this girl felt perfect for me. I went on a date with her to the park and I remember not wanting to let her out of my sight. I truly felt in love with this girl. 

On our one month anniversary as I was taking the train to her house to celebrate I remember getting this really awful feeling - wondering whether i actually liked this girl or not. But the thing is i cared about her a LOT, i cared about her so much she was my best friend that i could get intimate with. So i brushed these feelings away and i generally had a good time that day with her. The feelings would periodically come back and I would continue to brush them away because getting notifications from her really lit my day up and it just made me happy even though i didnt feel much infatuation. When I first met her in person I wasn't super infatuated with her and thus i was a bit hesitant to fully get involved. But we kept pushing the boundary and it eventually turned into a relationship. I fell in love with her personality and thats what kept me going. This feeling persisted for about 2 weeks until I actually couldn't take it anymore - I woke up super early to go see a therapist at my school (which was 2 hours away, I made the commute because it really messed with me so much and I felt really hurt by it). It was really driving me insane so I had o call her up and break up with her. I really did not want this to happen - my mind screamed to be with her but my heart didnt. I cared about her a lot more than I did love her and losing her really messed with me. This girl has literally been the perfect girlfriend and I can't help but feel disappointed in myself because I feel like this was an amazing opportunity lost because of something so close yet so far to me (my feelings). I desperately did not want to feel this way and did everything I could to try to change said feelings. I started going to therapy, I started seeing a psychiatrist I tried logically working things out I tried venting to my friends I tried taking time off away from her to get away from this codependency I developed. It felt like something within my control because its ultimately something that internal - and i really really wanted to cultivate my feelings leaning towards falling in love with her but I had anxiety built underneath with us actually getting together. All i wanted was to get rid of this anxiety.

My theory is that I've subconscious developed a standard for how I feel around her when she slept over all the time and 95% of my day involved her. It was just a constant good, harmonious feeling and I really enjoyed having that feeling. I really missed what we had and by the time she moved back home, it became super inconvenient for me to even visit her. She had work and it around 4pm on weekdays and was never available on weekends and she also wasn't allowed to leave the house on her own and it was an hour commute going to her house from mine. We still talked every second of every day and I figured that the solution to my feeling this way was not enough quality time spent so I tried making an effort to have daily date nights where I would watch shows with her online until I felt sleepy.

We've gone back and forth with ""I can't handle talking to you anymore it hurts too much we need to cut contact"" to ""More than anything I respect and value you as a person above all so not having you in my life really hurts me"". We've supposedly cut contact indefinitely about 5 or 6 times in total only for either me or her to reach out the day after feeling terrible about everything. 

We kept talking to each other but with tension in the air for about 2 months after we broke up - I really wanted to give myself space and try to get back what we originally had because I missed that so much. We had a similar sex drive and strong dynamic in all departments except for romantic, she was open minded and took interest in all my hobbies, she's been so selfless and has always been there for me when I felt down and I also served as a shoulder for her to lean on. She was fun to talk to we played similar video games... she just felt perfect but this anxiety really held me back from truly being with her. I'm still tearing up about all of this even now - 3 months post breakup. 

Fast forward to today - shes told me that shes fully moved on or is very close to it and she believes that I was more in love with our dynamic but not necessarily her. She still respects me but shes blocked me on all social media because she figured that that was best. I could reach out to her through her number but the way we talk to each other hasn't been the same. She said she hates being cold towards me but she can't bring herself to be that warm again from all the stress that shes felt during the summer and I fully understand. On top of all of that I keep venting to my friends and they keep telling me the same answers - its gotten to the point where a lot of them are just really annoyed at me now because they keep having to repeat themselves and I don't listen. The reason why I don't listen when they say to just move on and cut her off completely is Ive never met anyone who has gone through a similar situation to mine and I feel like they can only sympathize with me so much. They're treating this as just some other relationship breakup and would always give me that generic ""Move on you can to better"" type of advice. But no, I have yet to see a true conflict in values and morals and like, why would I want to get rid of this connection is talking to her makes me happy? It also really hurts losing her on top of all the stuff that I've said. I really feel like no one just understands me. So not only do I have to deal with losing her - my friends are legitimately getting really angry and annoyed at me now so I'm even hesitant to vent to them anymore. I've been relying on my therapist and a therapy hotline and now I've resorted to posting on this subreddit. Yeah, I go in circles about this whole situation but the circles have progressively been getting smaller and it's been a process but Im progressively feeling better and better about the whole situation I just relied on my friends to talk me out of it when Im feeling down for quick relief.

Last night I got really drunk and played pictionary and blurted out words that were offensive to people in the room but i was too drunk to realize the damage that I've been doing. What started off as a fun friendly game ended in people feeling uncomfortable and upset at me, and I still thought about my ex even afterwards. I've apologized as much as I could and one guy is just tired of hearing me apologize without taking action, but the other 2 seemed to be a bit more forgiving. I legitimately did not realize that I was hurting people... I just wanted everyone to have a good time. There's no one I can really vent to because the people I would normally go to to vent about issues I have are the ones who are upset at me.

I also tried going on tinder to cope with this emptiness but none of the girls I messaged were really responsive to me so that's also a big bummer lol. I don't have family to rely on because I'm not really that close with them and my mom is a bit old so her values are a lot more different from mine so venting to her doesn't really help me feel any better. Earlier today I felt like I didn't want to be alive anymore - but the thoughts stopped there. I'm just tired of feeling lonely and horrible all the time from all these things that have built up and I really dont know who to go to anymore to talk about my feelings. No family, I'm graduating late so a lot of my friends at my school have graduated and I only really have select few people to really hang out with. My workload is relatively light so I have a lot of free time on my hands but no one to really spend it with.

759,akjiakji,1568974390,1,"Hey guys I just want to write my thoughts and organise them.

I am naturally a very quiet kid. I found it hard to socialise with other people. For the last 5 years I went to school, came back and went on my phone. I barely talked to anybody including my parents. Now because of this I have become extremely socially awkward.
Due to me staying in my room all the time, I haven't matured and my life was a mess. Right now I understand there is a problem and I'm gonna change. I started by making my bed. I have made my bed for the last three days. Hopefully I can do it everyday. I'm attempting to eat better and go for a run everyday. This has been hard but I did run for the last three days. I am too skinny and also attempting to get better. 

Ever since I stopped going on YouTube as much my mind is not distracted and I am having more and more suicidal and negative thoughts. I am slowly learning to deal with it. But don't get me wrong it's been a challenge. Yesterday I cried in the bathroom. This has been the first time I cried in a long time. Youtube was my safe space that blocked out everything. It blocked away the sadness and but stopped my growth as a person. 

I started college now and I have skipped a few classes. It's very early in the college year and I'm forming bad habits. I will change this about myself. 

I still sometimes feel the world is laughing at me and my mistakes but now I'm starting to feel the world and everyone in it is indifferent towards me. I wasn't able to run infront of other people but now I'm changing that. Running infront of other people doesn't seem like a big deal but for someone as like me it was a big achievement. 

From now on I'm gonna take more chances i.e start conversations first. I have done this twice and I haven't regretted it. However my body just freezes sometimes. It's something that needs a lot of improvement.

I also want to stay in the moment a lot more. I have trouble with concentration and paying attention. This will need to be improved but I don't know how. People have laughed at me about how oblivios I was. I am very self conscious about this and will improve. However I want to improve for myself not for other people. I will also take less things seriously. When people said something I hurt me emotionally but everyone gets this. 

I wanted to ask myself whay I truly desired. I think I want close friends to share things with. Currently I have some acquantices but no real friends. Due to my lack of social skills I'm finding it hard to interact with people. I feel like I'm truly lonely and I'm not good with dealing with it. I'm attempting to go out and meet people I'll tell you how it goes with u get around to doing it. 

Why am I writing this? I am writing this is as an attempt to try new things I don't really post anything. So I'm curious to see how I feel after I attempt this.

777,redditsagrandoltime,1568947800,2,"I’m so broke... too broke to do anything. I struggled with isolation for the past 5 years (and have an extensive history of it as well, so that’s *definitely* not my only 5 years) but now that I’ve pushed past it and am ready to explore my limits, I have no money to do so. Today I slipped back into my old habits that I (for the most part unconsciously, but this time I caught myself) do, where I’ll look into other peoples windows not in a creepy way, but if they have a TV on I’ll wonder what they’re watching, try to see what the channel is, start to wonder if it’s a dvd or if they’re going old school right now and playing a VHS, then I’ll wonder about the people who acted in the movie, how long ago it was cast. I also do this thing where I’ll think of the nearby trains, there is one not far from my house. The one by my house is under a bridge. I think of the probability of being on the train, while a person who would be either one of the best friendships I could ever have, or one of the best lovers I could ever have, being on the top of the bridge, or vice versa with me being on the bridge, while simultaneously a person who would be one of the most amazing friends or romantic partners would be directly under my literal exact feet, unbeknownst to me. I think about the people on the highways, in the cars, and in their own houses on a typical day. Oh, how I wish I was omnipresent. I feel I am missing out on so much in life, being sheltered all the way and then isolating on top of it. I think about the ways I could fit into these peoples lives. I wonder where I was meant to be right now, because I’m so obviously out of alignment. When I watch videos online, I tend to notice the background more than the focal point of the subject they are talking about; this includes, yes, porn. I look at the rooms, the houses, I look at the outside. I cherish all that exists on this earth. It’s such a large world, despite what anybody says. I wonder if these places are now abandoned, or if a patch of grass or cement has been neglected. I think of how many times a particular spot was stepped in, I think of the things that were touched, how long ago, and the things that were not. It’s superb to me how magnificently vast this world is, and that I could never ever touch every spot of the earth, and meet all of the people, in my human lifetime. It makes me so depressed thinking about that. I have the greatest affinity for all that there is, and I want to give all that there is, the time of day. These are the things that I do when I am at the epitome of loneliness, and I am falling right. back. in.

780,hamartiated,1568945345,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I have haters and trolls following me around on my main account.

My alcoholic dad was starting to get me alcohol every week in exchange for my family using all of my food stamp money each month.

I said really horrible stuff while drunk two years ago (and while not drunk) and I acted dumb to this person that I really look up to a lot.  My other best friend kept bragging about being friends with her, and I acted badly to them before; so I tried to be friends with them to show everyone that I'm better now than I was when I talked to her many years ago, but then I ended up being a bit clingy and sending her horrible weird drunk messages.

When she finally said she's ""really starting to hate me now,"" all of a sudden, I stopped messaging her (aside from every now and then sending her huge messages saying that I apologize and that I hope she'll delete the screenshots of my private messages to her that she posted on her public Twitter account with my username not edited out at all. I tried reporting the tweets to Twitter several times, but they don't do anything about it.)

I moved out 6 months ago and kept behaving really good.

So I had my friends ask her, after over a year or so of leaving her alone, if she would please delete the horrible screenshots of my private messages to her that she posted on her public Twitter account that ruined my entire reputation and brand name.

But she keeps freaking out and saying its good that I feel bad and that I ""should feel bad"" and she keeps bringing up all of this really horrible stupid stuff I said two years ago when I was drunk. I was like ""wat"" when I first read what I said, I didn't even remember that I said that at first, and I felt bad for saying that and I didn't do anything that day and the day after I kept crying over it literally and called my mom while crying.

I talked to that person again last week, and she brought up the stupid stuff that I said AGAIN and said she has a hard time believing that I'm sorry when I'm ""executing the same behavior as back then.""  But I don't act the same, I left her alone for a long time and only messaged her to apologize and ask her to please take down the tweets and several people have told me that they notice that I don't drink anymore and that I'm a lot better now.

I want to move on with my life and make my dream project. I can't because there's a rally of haters and trolls that constantly bring up that person's screenshots of my private messages to them that they posted on their public Twitter account that ruined my entire brand and reputation. People say ""oh that's easy, just give up on your dream project or get rid of every single character in your project and replace them with new ones!!"" But I don't want to do that and it'd take a long time to build up my rep on a new identity when I'd rather just be on my normal previous identity anyways.

..Please help?

Even if I try to move on and be more independent, people keep bringing up that person's screenshot tweets that she tweeted two years and five months ago and warning everyone to stay away from me and to never support any of my projects ever, even when I change myself for the better.

788,tadootz,1568938357,11,"First post so bear with me it’s long but anyone willing to read and give me advice would be much appreciated.

I’ve always been a social outcast. I () was just never any good at making friends in high school and I wanted to change that in college. I actually have managed pretty well in my first few weeks. I got to know pretty much everyone in my wing of the floor and I even made a pretty large close friend group, around 12 people, and we all get along pretty well. We go to partys, stay up late playing cards, and always end up hanging out for hours on the weekends. I started getting really close to one of the girls in the group(). We ended up doing a lot of the same clubs and having dinner together almost every night because of how our schedules worked. Eventually I noticed that she would always bump into me when we were walking together, stand really close to me when we were talking, or grab my arm on the way to a party and she even shared a blanket with me and rested her head on my shoulder when my friend group had a movie night. She would laugh at all my jokes, even the stupid ones that made no sense. She invited me to study with her all alone. She would bring me gifts late at night even if I didn’t ask for anything. I thought there was no way that she could actually like me because of how pretty she was and how every guy seemed to want her. But I eventually got the hope that this girl of my dreams with the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen and the happiest laugh I’ve ever heard may actually like me. I finally mustered the courage to ask her out on a proper date and made a plan of where and when I was going to do it. During dinner only about an hour before I was going to ask, her phone got a notification and I asked who the girl was on her lock screen thinking it was going to be her best friend from back home. In a way I guess it was because it was her girlfriend. I think I actually felt my heart shatter. All the signs of her possibly liking me were flukes. It seemed too perfect to be true and it was. I don’t want to lose her as a friend but honestly it just hurts too much. I can’t look at her without hope of being together bubbling up inside me only to be crushed by reality, I can’t hear her laugh and not have a smile on my face, I can’t have her brush against me and not want to squeeze her in a hug and never let go. Looking into her beautiful eyes makes me long for what I’ll never have. What do I do? I still value her friendship and don’t want to hurt her but it hurts me to be near her and have her continue to do all the things that made me come to like her in a romantic way so quickly. Honestly all I’ve ever wanted is somebody to love who also loves me and I thought that I could actually do it with her but now I feel like I have to rip her out of my heart in order to move on.",lonely,Too good to be true,2019-09-20 10:12:37

I turn 23, but right when it hit 12am today, I cried a lot. My anxiety went off the roof. My body was hot and I couldn’t sleep at all. 

4 years ago, I was having a pretty good birthday. My boyfriend at the time told me to dress pretty and get dolled up. I was super excited. So I wear my fanciest dress and put makeup on. He picks me up and asks me where I wanted to go. I asked him, if he had any reservations. He said no. I was pretty disappointed. I was under the impression that we were going to a nice and fancy place. Instead he decides to take us to Cheesecake Factory without any reservation, so we had to wait. He decided Cheesecake Factory since I didn’t say anything. By the end of the night, I had told him that it was cute of him to tell to dress up but I had wished that we were going to have set plans instead of Cheesecake Factory. Where we literally go all the time. 

He had locked the doors and cussed me out. Saying that I don’t respect him and that I need to keep my spoiled mouth shut. He called me all sorts of names. Told me that I should be grateful that he does anything for me. He told me that he only tolerates me so he could get my family’s fortune. I’m baffled. I start crying and try to unlock the door. I don’t have my seatbelt on. So he decides to swerve and drive carelessly to make me scared. 

He finally calms down. Takes me to his cousins condo. I ask him “aren’t they out of town this week?” He tells me to shut up and get inside. Next thing you know he locks me in the master bedroom. He proceeds to forcefully take off my clothes. I scream and cry. He didn’t care. When he was finished. He left the room and played video games. 

After this, I refused to have him touch, kiss, or be intimate with me for months. He was going insane because he didn’t have anything to “fuck”. So he cheated on me. I finally had the guts to break it off with him 9 months after.

When I was a kid/teenager, I always had a best friend, that one person you spend all your time with, can tell anything too, they know all your secrets and love you unconditionally. When I started dating I just replaced having a best friend with having a boyfriend, one person who was my everything. I was 17 when I got into my first “serious” relationship, it lasted 1.5 years. When we broke up, I started seeing a mutual friend who I already knew well, we ended up being together for 3 years. I was single for two months before I started seeing the next one who I was with for 5 years. When that one ended I started seeing a coworker who I had been friends with for 2 years already, him &amp; I were together for 3.5 years. That’s 13 years, almost completely straight through of being half of a couple. My entire adult life I’ve had someone by my side. The most recent one ended last November, so it’s been almost a year, and I am still single this time. 

I am proud of myself, I told myself I needed to break the cycle, I needed to learn and grow and become my own person, and I have in a lot of ways. I’ve worked very hard on myself, I’m emotionally intelligent, moral &amp; honest. But I’m lonely as fuck. I have some friends and family nearby, but I don’t have a single person I share that deep connection with. That one person I can tell anything to, or do anything with. And the physical part is killing me, I so desperately just want to be held (Quality Time and Physical Touch are my love languages). I lay in my bed alone at night and just wish someone was there to spoon me. Honestly, I’m good looking and people tend to like me, but there’s always a disconnect. I feel like I’m living in a different reality than everyone else, all by myself, like no one speaks the same language I do. I’m not trying to get into a serious relationship, I don’t even subscribe to monogamy anymore (haven’t really for a long time, but that’s another story), but I just want someone to connect with, someone in my life who speaks my language, vibes on the same frequency as me. I miss that deep soul touching feeling so much. It’s like a big empty hole in my stomach.

About two months ago I met someone on a dating app that I felt for the first time in almost a year I had a connection with. I haven’t felt like that in so long, it felt so good, too good maybe. We were obsessed with each other, we were in pretty much constant contact for about 3 weeks (short lived, but intense!) until he suddenly had home-life drama and distanced himself from me… since then we’ve still been talking, but a lot less, and spent a little time together. He told me about what happened and what he’s going through, he had a lot happen in a short amount of time. I know that it wasn’t about me, but it did still hurt. I was hoping our connection and the time we get to spend together would be lighthearted, stress-free comfort for both of us, that we'd help each other get through the shit. Then today, out of the blue I get a message saying that “I won’t see him around for awhile” with no explanation about why. I know he’s going through shit so I just told him I’m here if he needs me. He didn't say it, but it very much felt like the last message I’m going to get… who knows, I could be jumping to conclusions, but it just felt final. 

I don’t know what I’m trying to get out of this… just someone to talk to maybe? Advice? I’m just sad and tired of feeling alone.",lonely,"[f30] after a long history of serial monogamy, I’m single &amp; feel so alone",2019-09-20 08:15:18

801,sitterofsubere,1568929995,2,"Hello there, an 18 yr old loner here. Just wanted to ask if you en up that situation too.

Im an collage freshman. It's been like 5 days since I first met my classmates. First day was not that lonely for me, I talked with my new classmates and maybe made a few new friends, or I thought so. We drank and ate together, played some board games and such. We were like very close. But when I looked myself this afternoon, I was lonely af again. There was like 52 students in my classroom, but no one looked like they wanted to talk with me. I had a quick chat with some of my classmates, the ones that I met the first day, but these chats were so cold, nothing like the first day. I almost talked with no one today and am sitting alone right now, thinking about the possible reasons for them to stop talking with me.

Its probable that its because they found much more interesting peope than me. But It has been happening for like 5 years, every year I met new people and just dont talk with them again after a few days. Idk if thats loneliness, but i kinda feel sorry for this situation. Id even k why In writing this. To feel a less lonely maybe? idk again.

Sorry for my bad EnGLaNd btw, Im not a native speaker.

Sorry again if I sounded like an edgy teenager.

802,JunVahlok,1568926038,3,"It's been a weird week. I sort of feel like I've lost my mind. I've been going back and forth and in-between different moods. Upbeat and fun to extreme depression and all around. I'm not usually like that, I've just been really.. ugh.. idk.. annoyed at myself and lonely. The moodswings are so frustrating though. It makes me feel like I'm legitimately crazy.

My only friend is on Discord and is the only person who probably notices. So I can kind-of vent... but you don't want to use up somebody's goodwill by complaining too much...

I guess I feel like really out of place in life. I make stupid decisions and ruin any possibility of friendship. Either I just outright am an idiot and do everything wrong and drive people away or I struggle to get up the courage to not be so shy and bad at talking. Or if I am able to talk to someone, I find a way to screw it up, like I have some kind of self-destruct feature.

I journal how I'm feeling sometimes and this past week I just seem so annoying and neurotic. *sigh*


It's just been so weird and frustrating lately and I feel like such a fool and I can't decide if I should have a laugh and smile about: ""oh well! that's just life! be a better, more normal person tomorrow!"" or just cry myself into a coma.

I don't even know if I should post here. I'm not terribly sure if ""lonely"" is the right way to describe how I'm feeling... Well, right now, at least. But, I'm feeling like I shouldn't even try talking to people because, idk, I'm just.. a waste of time or something? A bad person? I don't really know. It's like, I feel lost. And I feel guilty and remorseful. And I just..want... Oh nvm.

803,fadedrejoice,1568924493,2,I transferred to a new college last year. I made some good friends or so I thought. Then they all moved in together and I couldn’t move with them and now I guess we’re not friends anymore because we never talk now that we don’t live together. My roommate never showed up so i live alone. I have no friends here. I hate being here every second. Im so lonely. I have nobody. Today i put got ready and put on makeup just to maybe feel a little better and i just ended up crying it off. I’m too anxious and depressed to go to class tonight. I hear all the people going out and partying outside of my window every night and i just feel so left out and alone. I can’t believe I thought i had friends here. I was so excited to come back this year and be back with them all but like i said i guess we’re all not friends anymore cause I’m the odd one out. Just like always. Nothing is new. The only time I’ve even spoken today was so ask someone sitting next to me a question about the work we were doing in class. And I won’t speak again for the rest of the night. And probably all this weekend too. I’ll just sit in my room alone and cry. I never sleep. I hate school. I guess it doesn’t matter because when I’m gone at least it wont hurt anyone.

815,trashy247,1568916476,2,"I recently moved to Sweden about a month ago to pursue a masters degree. Initially, I had only positive thoughts about moving, it was what I wanted for a year. I knew I was leaving everything behind, friends and family but I thought it would be so easy getting started here.

For context, I am usually the center of attention back home and am super extroverted and loud. I assumed it would be the same here. I ended up booking a flight to Sweden that would arrive one week before I started my classes. As soon as I arrived, I booted up Tinder to try and meet other guys (I'm gay) to get to know and maybe make some friends along the way. I ended up meeting a guy on there that I thought was so fun and great. We ended up having about a 14 hour date where he showed me around the city and his favorite spots, then we went out to a couple of bars and had a great time. I thought about how amazing my night was and how much of a great start this was to my next 2 years.

He ended up telling me he wanted to only be friends after a week of not texting me. During that week, school had started and we had orientation week. I had to miss the first 3 days I was accepted late and couldn't sign up for the Swedish classes offered the first 3 days. I walked into the 4th day of orientation and immediately had social anxiety. A group of 300 new students and everyone had a group of friends they bonded with, and I was alone and had no one to talk to. I stayed for one hour and left.

The next day it was the same thing, I couldn't bring myself to talk to anyone because it was too nerve wracking. I needed someone to vent to, but the time difference from back home meant everyone was sleeping and I had no one. I turned to the same guy I met on Tinder but he wouldn't reply to any of my texts. I realized I was clinging on to him because he was the one thing that made me feel at home in a country where I knew no one. The same day he friend zoned me and it all felt like too much. I was on the subway and was trying to hold back my tears until I could get off. I did, but I was in the middle of the city center and was hyperventilating and just trying to hide the fact that I was having a breakdown.

Since then its been getting worse and worse, my depression. I met another guy, but he ended up friend zoning me as well. 

It's been about 3 weeks in class and I find it extremely hard to try to talk to anybody in class first. People are all acquainted and talking and laughing but I feel like I can't join. It feels like when people talk to me they are looking at me but not at all listening, like they don't care. I want to be friends with people but I don't want them to see me as begging for a connection, even though I am. 

I just want a connection with someone, but the more you ask for that, the more you distance people from you. It's very hard. Classmates will tell me about how they went out with others from the class and it hurts my feelings because why couldn't I be invited? I wish it was easy to stay positive but it's hard. Feels like no one really wants to be associated with me.

We have a groupchat for the class and I really want to ask if anyone wants to hang out with me but I have a feeling no one would reply or just say they are busy or maybe talk about me behind my back and say how I'm desperate for friends.

My now ex girlfriend and I meet in Middle School started dating our freshman year of high school and by our senior year we had moved in together (I never got along with my parents are her parents didn't really care). After we graduated we lived together for 3 years before her ex boyfriend decide to show up at our house (to this day I'm still not sure how he found out where we lived) he was mentally and physically abusive to her when they were dating and for about a year after we started dating he tried to get her back and start fights and get into arguments with me. Then one day he just stopped at first we were concerned but then eventually we forgot about him until he showed up one day 3 years later. He tried to convince her that he had changed and to give him another chance. When she said no he became angry and threatened us before he left. That night my girlfriend and I talked about what we were going to do and we eventually decided to move states. We planned on moving anyways this just gave us a reason. We spent the next few months saving as much as we could. We both had low paying jobs so we wound up only having enough money to send one of us. So we sent her ahead to settle in find a job up there etc.  I stayed behind and kept working we made the long distance work every weekend I'd either drive (if I had 3 or more days together off) or fly up there I never made her come down to where I lived because she had enough to worry about she had college and a job she was taking care of our dog. So I figured she had enough to deal with. I did that for about a year saving whatever I could wherever I could working multiple jobs. Until a few months ago I finally had saved enough. I put in my two weeks at both my jobs and started packing up what little things we had left at our old apartment. The day finally came I packed everything into the car packed up the cat and drove. We wound up moving 4 states away so it was a long drive. I wound up finding a decent paying job but it required long hours and left me tired most days. That combined with the fact that I was never great with people and didn't like crowds. I didn't really make any friends. She had been there for a little over a year and was going to school so she made quite a few friends. Whenever we went out it would always be with one of her friends from work or school and it was fun I enjoyed it and would make small talk with them but none of them really ever became my friend. Fast forward a couple of months and we started arguing she didn't like that I worked so much and that I was ""emotionally draining"" I believe is how she put it (I'm bipolar and I admit I can be hard to deal with sometimes). A couple of weeks later we wound up breaking up. She's currently living with a friend and I'm living in our ( well I guess it's technically my) apartment. She stopped by the beginning of the week and collected the rest of her things while I was at work. Things didn't end well and I don't see us talking again anytime soon. So now I'm 4 states away from what few friends I have and I don't know a single person here. It's just me my job and my cat. And I just feel so alone.

825,SansaStarkers,1568898743,2,"I'm so tired of feeling like a constant nuisance to everyone. 

I'm 29F, and I work from home so I don't get the usual day-to-day interactions of being in an office or around people. I live with my boyfriend, who is wonderful and probably my best friend in the world, but I can't rely on him for all my social needs - it's not fair to either of us. He also has lots of friends and is very active with his own hobbies. So I try really hard to maintain the few friendships I have... but it's like everything I do just pushes people away even more? I have probably two 'close' friends (close in that I've known them for a long time and they live nearby) and one other who lives far away and is incredibly popular and very busy all the time. 

I'm really lonely and I feel like my life is kind of empty. I would so love to be more social, to do things with friends at the weekends, to have game nights and dinner parties, to be in whatsapp groups and be invited to events and parties. But nothing I do seems to help and I just want to give up. 

Here's what I've tried:  
1. Inviting people round for dinner/out for coffee/general activities which are free or cheap. People are either already busy, don't get back to me, flake on plans at the last minute or come to the thing but rush off quickly and spend the whole time on their phones. Inviting people to paid events is almost always a 'sorry can't afford it' situation.   
2. Going to stuff on my own and asking others if they want to join. I don't think I've ever once been taken up on this, even though I try to find events that I think they'll enjoy. So I go alone, every time.   
3. Talking to people at these events/trying to make new friendships. People just don't seem interested, and no-one else seems to go to things on their own, so they're already with groups of friends. More often than not, these things make me feel lonelier than ever.   
4. Texting/emailing people regularly. Okay, some people are just too tired/burnt out/busy to do stuff face to face - I'm definitely more on the introvert side of things myself, so I get it. So I try texting - not obsessively, not in a pestering way, but just to say hello, ask how they are, send a link to something I think they'll find funny or interesting. At most I'll get one or two texts back before the conversation dies. On the very rare occasion that someone just texts to say hi, I'm so grateful it's pathetic.  
5. Reaching out to people I haven't seen in a while, trying to turn acquaintances into friendships. This goes nowhere, we chat and I try to arrange a time to grab coffee or something and they say they'll get back to me and then I never hear from them again.   
6. Not trying at all. Going to classes and workshops and stuff on my own, not inviting anyone, not trying to make friends but being friendly/welcoming if people should talk to me (which they don't). This is the least painful option, I'm totally alone but at least I choose to be??

Lately I've just been thinking, what's the point? Honestly, why do I bother? I feel like everyone has someone else they'd rather be doing, people they'd rather be spending time with. On the rare occasions I do see people, they talk about the fun things they've been doing with other people or I see on their social media that they've been out to this place or hanging with this group. So I know they're not just sitting at home... It's me they don't have time for. 

A few weeks ago I hung out with one of my closest friends, just the two of us for the first time in ages. He spent the ENTIRE time texting his girlfriend while we watched TV. Last week I tried to arrange plans with another friend who I hadn't seen in ages, and she 'rain-checked' three times before I just gave up. Yesterday I sent out one last message to a bunch of people asking if they wanted to go to this really fun looking event at a cool new venue in the city. One person replied to say she was 'watching the pennies' (I'd have fucking paid for everyone at this point, and I know she's been out partying the past few weekends). No one else replied. 

I don't think I'm a massive freak or anything. I'm okay looking, healthy, I think I'm funny and good at listening to others. I ask lots of questions but I also tell my own stories. I have lots of interests, but I don't bang on about them relentlessly. I remember birthdays and send cards and flowers on special occasions. I love cooking for others and would throw dinner parties every week if anyone was remotely interested. 

But now I'm getting paranoid, wondering what I'm doing wrong. Because it has to be me, right? After I talk to people, I go back over our interactions and wonder if I was being boring or annoying, if I was a downer, if I asked enough questions and was fun to be around. The more unhappy I get, the more critical about myself I become. 

I feel like people can sense the desperation rising from me like a stink. 

I see so many people my own age going on holidays with big groups of friends, having regular supper nights together, texting back and forth in big groups all day. And my phone stays silent, my calendar empty. It's so embarrassing. I think I'm just going to embrace hermit-hood. I'm giving up. I think, if I commit to it, I can become okay with being alone... It's the constant humiliation of begging for attention, the almost certain rejection, that's too mortifying to put up with any more.

i'm sensitive, i'm emotional, i'm impulsive, i'm snippy, i don't think before i speak., i'm terrified of rejection, and i can't handle criticism. i just can't handle people. 

i've never been in a relationship, and there are multiple reasons why, but mostly it's because i reject everyone before giving them a chance. why? because every single fucking time i give someone a chance, i open up, express my feelings, be vulnerable, they say then won't hurt me and then they do. just happened again. 

but did they REALLY hurt me? no. i overreacted, over analyzed, freaked out, and sent something stupid and ridiculous without thinking, because when i get emotional my thoughts and rationale are blinded and i end up making a fool out of myself. then when they got mad and i wasn't seeing red, i was able to read and realize that I'M the one that looks psycho, not them. it's always me. i'm always the one who annoys someone because i can't control my emotions and i overthink, and i just can't deal with this. i'm so lonely, but it's just easier this way. everyone rejects me sooner or later. i remember every single criticism about my personality, character, and it just burns. i don't even know what to do anymore. i was infatuated with someone who thinks i'm immature and someone that plays games. i don't want to be that person. i just want to make someone happy and be in mutual love. is that too much to ask?",lonely,this is the same generic post everyone makes,2019-09-19 22:43:56

847,Antall050,1568868732,2,"I am a senior transfer student at a liberal arts college.  I am in a fraternity, yet I am hella lonely.

I think my problem is that I’m a people pleaser.  I follow the crowd because I am in an unfamiliar crowd, given that most students have already developed their friendship groups, and I just got here.  So I’m still trying to learn the ropes but in the process I do not make an impression.

I want to make an impression, because my whole life I haven’t.  I feel like I slide off peoples memory banks.  I once overheard someone say that I “fly under the radar” but I’m a “pretty nice guy”. 

I don’t want that.  I want to have an identity, like a brand people can identify me by.  There a few challenges to this: 
First, it’s hard to be identifiable when I don’t have a group of friends.  It seems like I need to already have a group of friends to make other friends.  Needing experience to get experience.
Second, the interests I have are not other people’s interests.  I like theatre most of all.  I try to get involved there, but I genuinely dislike the people in theatre.  Its like, even though I vibe with my fraternity brothers more, there’s less to bond over.  I don’t do substances as much or at least I don’t buy them myself (so I don’t develop a habit), i probably look like a follower to them and it’s ugly.  I like theatre more and talking about it but that’s a whole ‘nother crowd go get into, and they didn’t really accept me cause I’m not one of them.  I always felt I was too “sensitive” for the frat, but too “masculine” for theatre.  I dunno.  I think my frat brothers assume I’m with theatre, and everyone else assume I’m with the frat, so I’m not with anybody.  

I took acid and I didn’t really trip, which I read is a sign of autism, so I was convinced for a week, but I’m not that convinced anymore lol.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

859,Spaceboi115,1568857188,5,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

Currently a senior in highschool (). During middle school, i had quite a large group of friends, but only about 2-3 really close friends. Slowly they began hanging out with other people and I was almost always left out. I figured it would get better once i got into highschool, and it did for a couple years as i was in band and found friends there; but, most of them were older and graduated by the time i was a junior and as a result, i lost contact. Since then, i haven't really found anyone or any group of friends again, and everyday after school im usually just at home chilling or doing homework. After my friends from middle school left me though, i became very close to my siblings, as i have 4 and we are all relatively close in age. They are probably who id consider to be my closest ""friends,"" despite them being family as we hang out quite often. I definetly have people who i talk to within my classes and sit with at lunch; however no one ever really asks me to hangout or do anything outside of school and its extremely hard finding people who arent already in a tight-knit friend group. It's even worse when im asked who i hang out with because im always reluctant to say ""my siblings"" due to the weird reactions i get from people who'd expect me to name others within my grade. I feel as though im pretty normal and nice and not into anything out of the ordinary (PC gaming, space and futuristic technology, marvel movies and really almost any movies, the office, rick and morty, retro games, wide range of music from classical to hip-hop/rap, definetly zelda and fantasy games). Im already in a couple clubs as well, but like i stated, the people i talk to at school, while they consider me a classmate/friend, never invite me to anything outside of school as they all already have a friend group. I've been able to make semi-peace with the fact that my siblings are my best friends and my main friend group, but i cant help to feel like an outcast at school, and i cant help to worry about when me and my siblings all move out and no longer live in the same house (which has already started as my sister moved out earlier this year). Hopefully ill find more people in college and i wont feel so lonely, but for now i dont see much change.

873,Goddess_Ash,1568827651,0,"I am an affectionate woman in her 20s that has a sense of humor and loves to chat.

No, this is not prostitution or anything close to that; Yes, I am an actual breathing human female hoping to find someone that wants a mutually beneficial situation - whether it's for 10 minutes or long term.

**What I can offer:**

Listening: whether you need to vent or you just want to be heard without any judgement

Kindness &amp; Empathy: I’m an empath and genuinely caring is something that comes naturally to me – I’m the type that if I ask how you are I actually want to know the answer

Affection: cute names, full attention, cute photos (including adorable animals), good morning/night texts, flirty banter

Humor: memes, wit, sarcasm, puns, inappropriate &amp; dark humor, even some cringey jokes

Online games/mutual activities: Smash Bros Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Clash Royale, Kingdom of Heckfire, text based DND, online board games (like board game arena and tabletopia); I also love to read or watch tv/movies so if you want to watch any together let me know!

Advice – I’m the go-to person in friend groups for advice. (Though I never force advice on others and I respect when someone wants to vent without receiving feedback)

No ghosting! –I will never ghost you or disappear out of nowhere. The situation only ends when agreed upon or with notice

Control: You decide everything unless you designate anything to me. How often we chat/talk, what we talk about, I can even pretend to be someone else to your specifications – otherwise I’ll be my honest self

Freedom to be yourself: I have no issues with race, age, gender, height, weight, etc.

**I do not offer or allow: sex, full on sexting, nudity, or degradation/hateful speech towards me**

Pricing is $5+ depending on the situation and exactly what you’re wanting - not breaking any banks though

~
So, I need your guidance, my situation is that I'm currently attending a course which takes place on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I'm in no way enjoying this course and I can't get through a single day without having a breakdown. Socially, I have no friends in this class, I'm invisible to them and quite frankly, I don't want to be friends with them, they're rude and just not a nice group of people in general. 
~
My Mondays and Tuesdays are spent alone, doing the lessons and going home. I have nobody to go to when I'm on break and overall, life is shit. Wednesdays, however are a bit different. As I said, I have a single friend who attends college but unfortunately she attends Wednesdays to Fridays. So I can only see her once a week. Today she introduced me to her friend group and it was brilliant, I interacted with people. They noticed me and I smiled, I fucking smiled for the first time in what weeks. But alas, it was all over in an hour.
~
All of her friends are in the same course together (animal care) however, as I aspire to do something along the lines of possibly HGV driving or design. I'm worried that a qualification in animal care would mean nothing to potential employers.
~ 
My question to you Reddit, is this:
""Do I change my course to a less suitable one so I can have some real friends and be happy in college?""
~
Afternote: I've suffered from severe depression and severe anxiety for around 5-6 years now and I just want to feel happy again.

I would say I’m a fairly average guy, there isn’t anything noticeable about me you could pick out of a crowd. Im 21, have a decently paid job, a car etc.. yet underneath I’m so incredibly lonely.
The one friend that I did have decided I’m no longer worth his time and cut all contact without giving me a reason, I’ve tried reaching out to ask why but to no avail. Also a couple of months ago my girlfriend of 4 years and I decided to call it off as we started to realise we wanted different things and kind of ended on bad terms.

I suffer from extremely bad social anxiety so engaging with people can be a really difficult task. I spend all of my free time alone and have got myself into a routine that is slowly killing my soul. Wake up, work, home, shower, get high, watch whatever show I find interesting at the time and fall asleep.

I don’t have any co-workers I can even try to befriend as I work in a lone position. The few times that I really pushed myself out my comfort zone to try and make friends I was left feeling like no one would give me even a minute of their time in the end.

Is it so hard just to ask for a couple of decent people I could maybe develop some sort of social life with? Not everyone understands how it can be living with poor mental health and like to make judgments.

I have no goals or aspirations, No particular interests or hobbies and can’t really commit to much due to my working patterns. I feel like i’ll never have friends or relationships again and that this is my life now just on a constant loop where nothing gets better.

I wouldn't even care if the girl I took was ""the one"", it would just be nice to have a girlfriend for a while just so I can see how it is.

Homecoming is in mid-to-late October and I've already asked two girls; my friend Kristi and my friend Carly. Or, well, ""friends"". They're more or less just school friends that I never see outside or school. They both rejected me. Not harshly or anything, I hold no I'll will toward them nor do I blame them for anything. They simply said I was a good guy but wanted to remain friends. Besides them, I have literally nobody I can go with to the dance. It'll be me, my closest friend Kieran, my sort of close friend Mason (and his date, the lucky bastard) and a flask full of whiskey. I unfortunately suspect that this is simply a foreshadowing to how prom will go as well, the only difference being that none of my friends want to go either.

Well that'd be because I know I'd regret it if I didn't go later in life, and the last thing I need are more regrets. It just really sucks. It really, really sucks. I can't really even pick out a specific reason as to why this won't go my way. Am I simply undesirable? Am I too ugly, or my personality unbearable? Is it simply because I wasn't close enough to the girls I asked as well as the fact that I already have zero female friends? Or perhaps a mix of all those? I don't know. It's hard to pinpoint it.

A. Suddenly don't want to share their photo

Then I met someone unexpectedly and she was amazing! She understood me and actually liked me for me, I had never connected with someone like that before and fell completely in love with her. She made this the best summer I've had in a long time. Unfortunately it didn't last , we we're star crossed lovers to begin with and we had to stop seeing each other 💔.

900,hamartiated,1568780345,5,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26, guy, Europe - Clean audio chat - Looking for online friend, who needs regular conversation and emotional support - Depression, anxiety, arts, books, philosophy, music",2019-09-18 14:19:05

today while taking a break from studying a close friend (prob my only friend at college atm) and i started to talk about the kind of friends people can have. soon after she started listing off all the kinds of friends she has: she has someone she can rant to, someone she can share secrets with, someone she can call whenever, and her “day-ones”/“ride-or-dies”. she then told me that i was a person that motivates her to study and work daily. 

as she listed every kind of friend she had, i was just feeling more lonely by the second, because i have none of those friends, and at this point she’s the only friend i trust; it somewhat hurts to see that i see her as a close friend but she doesn’t really see me in the same way (i guess i’m more of an acquaintance to her).

911,Hippityhoppitybip,1568765496,2,"I remember when I was younger and I would love talking to my mom and my dad. I loved watching science documentaries (specifically astronomy and anthropology) or playing skyrim or WOW and just having fun with my friends playing video games or hanging out. I loved history documentaries. I loved to read (I remember reading the da Vinci code and dune and Harry Potter and lord of the rings and being immersed), I miss talking with my relatives and having something to look forward. 

Even though I'm young (senior in hs) I feel hopeless. Theres nothing to look forward to. Sure, college is nice, but the process is freaking me out and there doesnt seem like a way out. I can't even focus on my homework anymore, I just sit and stare out into space daydreaming, otherwise I get so sad I just lie down. I haven't been eating well, and as a result I've lost 20 pounds (although tbh it has been good for my health as I dropped from being obese to being borderline overweight/okay weight). I haven't been sleeping (an early night is 2 am), and I can't even bring myself to do anything I like to do, I just don't enjoy them anymore.

 I was just listening to ABBA and for some reason I've been on a nostalgia trip, so excuse my rant. I would've thought that by now i could have made some friends at my new school (moved here junior year) or have gotten out and had some more fun, but nope. 

Is it even worth it anymore? Why should I carry on? My counselors don't care and I don't want to bother them as they are too busy, I can't talk to this with my parents as it's a taboo subject in my culture, which further restricts my ability to get help, and I have no friends I can talk to about this either as they don't take me seriously. 

One thing I will say is, that I wish I looked more approachable. I feel one thing people think of when they see me is ""why is he so angry looking?""
I try not to be like this, but I can't really change my face. It doesn't help that I'm a big brown kid that goes to an all white school. I don't want people to be afraid of me, or to think I'm too high and mighty, but I don't want to reach out and be the weird kid who follows everyone on social media (just a little anxiety about socializing and seeming like the weird kid).


I mean, no ones going to read this and thankfully this is a throwaway account, but I just feel so down I havent gotten anything done although I feel a sense of impending doom.

One of my mates just doesn't seem enthusiastic around me. When he was paired with me in class for a project, I was visibly happy and he was really disappointed. I've done all of the work in that project so he doesn't feel bad, however he hasn't really noticed.

I'm very sorry that OP had a negative experience, but these safeguards were put into place in order to address this issue at hand.

The mod team's absolute highest priority is to ensure that the server remains a safe place/haven for people who seek emotional support and friendship to feel comfortable and free from personal attacks or threats.

Given that the population of members are in the literal thousands, it's a really awful thing to have to put these safeguards up for new people, but we try to focus on making sure that legitimate new members can join while taking whatever steps are necessary to preserve the 'safe space' environment for all our members, new or otherwise.

Also, many of the people who seek out our server tend to gravitate towards like-minded individuals with similar senses of humor, interests, values, or backgrounds.

930,HectorSolis02,1568746757,1,"May 23, 2014, Santa Barbara Police identified 22 year old Elliot Rodger as the man who killed six people during a Friday night rampage of stabbing and shooting near UC Santa Barbara.

Rodger was found dead in his car -- hours after a disturbing video titled ""Elliot Rodger's retribution"" was posted, a manifesto authorities said was a clear sign of ""premeditated mass murder.""

In Rodgers' YouTube video, he talks of ""loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires"" and blames women for rejecting him.

Rodgers had seen therapists off and on since he was nine years old and was reserved to the point of seeming to have trouble communicating with “an underlying sadness about him, a frustration”.

Alek Minassian, 25, was charged in a Toronto court with 10 counts of first degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder one day after a van rampage along the sidewalk of a busy Toronto street.

While the police did not disclose a motive for the rampage, interviews with former acquaintances of Mr. Minassian and his now-deleted Facebook account, portray a troubled young man who harbored resentments toward women and appeared determined to die.

The Facebook posting by Mr. Minassian praised Elliot Rodger and “incels,” or involuntary celibates, a term used in a Reddit group where men vented frustrations that tipped into misogyny.

“Incel” stands for “involuntarily celibate.”

When we talk about “incels,” we are not talking about all men who are not having sex. Instead, we are talking about a specific subculture of people in various internet forums — subreddits like r/braincels, the chat forum 4chan, and dedicated websites like incels.me.

Many of them are simply sad and lonely men, suffering from extreme social anxiety or deep depression.

Instead of trying to support each other and work through their issues as a group, the incels in certain communities allow their resentments to curdle. They see the world through the lens of entitlement: They are owed sex but cannot have it because “women are shallow.” This manifests in a deep and profound hatred for women as a group, which shows up on a very brief scan of some of the more extreme incel communities.

But it’s not just individual women that these radical incels hate — it’s society writ large, a society that allows their perceived sexual oppression to go on. 

How do individuals with antisocial lifestyles and a hatred of women and society come about?

Children socialized in family environments characterized by coercive exchanges and poor family management behaviors, in which positive social skills are not modeled or reinforced, learn to use coercive and aggressive strategies to influence others.

When children's use of coercive exchange from the family to peers outside the home occurs, children face rejection by their more socially skilled peers and become vulnerable to drifting into associations with peers who are similarly aggressive and unskilled.

Antisocial talk also appears to be an important and generally overlooked social influence process. This process also may be related to the persistence of criminal behavior from adolescence to young adulthood. 

The antisocial talk and positive affective response trained delinquency, by which delinquent peers encouraged each other to engage in new types of delinquent behavior and has been associated with increases in violent behaviors and substance use.

How can we fix this? Social skills. This term refers to skills that enable an individual to interact positively with the environment, which provides positive responses and avoiding negative ones.These skills allow individuals to satisfactorily adapt to the social environmental demands.

Individuals who lack social skills need to be trained in a structured manner and be presented with situations where the learned skill is to be used. In addition, they need to be exposed to increasingly socially complex situations. A particular group  who are especially prone to social deficits and who could greatly benefit from social skills training are individuals with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD).

Social skills interventions can help improve social abilities, such as cooperation, assertion, responsibility, empathy and self-control. 

Now for those who are interested in learning social skills, I think the best way to learn social skills is from a mentor. I have personally been learning and practicing social skills for 6 years and have been teaching social skills for about 1 year. If you're interested in learning social skills then I would highly recommend you sending me a DM.",lonely,How to Fix the Incel Epidemic with Social Skills,2019-09-18 04:59:17

I don't remember the last time I truly felt unconditionally happy but I think it might have been in like middle school. Im not very close with my father because he is pretty much incapable of showing emotion. The only thing he really ever talked to me about was cleaning my room and ""stop siting on your ass"".

942,Elem_Lucifage,1568727028,4,"Disclaimer ,  . And it’s gonna be a long story , that feels (at least for me) as if it was gotten from a movie , but no . It actually happened . 

When I was a toddler , I had a Russian nanny . She was super sweet and nice . She even always considered me her grandson (even though we are not connected in any way) . That granny had a granddaughter , who was actually around my age . Maybe half a year older . We were best friends at that time . Always together . 

Year later , that granny needed to move back to Russia . Of course , with her granddaughter . 

Now , a bit about my family . My father is a heavy drinker and mother is very narcissistic . They both neglected me . 
The only good memories I had were memories of me spending time with the granny and her granddaughter . 

Now I’m about 8 years old . I got very fat for my age . I never enjoyed sports , so I never went out of my apartment except for school and when parents needed to take me for something . 
The only entertainment I had were TV and my computer . And of course , the memories of me being a toddler (I have a good memory , so don’t be surprised) 

Now I’m 13 . Me and my family moved to another country . I lost all of my friends (3 people , just so you know) . Now is the time my parents forced me to go outside by myself , “play” or “hangout” with friends . My social skills are at 0(even now . I literally can not start a conversation with anyone, whom I don’t know) . Because they forced me to go out , it didn’t help me to become more sociable . 
So I still entertain myself with TV and video games . And of course , sweet memories . 

Year later , surprise . I lost weight . I became very tall , but skinny . I never really played any sport at that point , so understandable why . 
But again , my parents now were expecting me to play sports and enjoy them , while I was actually scared of getting hit with the ball , or just getting hurt .
What’s my leisure ? Video games , TV and memories . 

However surprise , summer time . Me , my sis and my mom decided to go on vacation . To Russia ! I could finally meet the girl I’ve been thinking about for so long ! 
We finally are at the place where we were supposed to meet our old family friends .
And then I see her .
She sat down right in front of me . 
We started talking , talking , laughing , talking . 
And suddenly , she started flirting . 
I got very surprised and because of my lack of sociability , I couldn’t really keep up the dialogue , so we went quiet . 
But I never forgot that moment . 

Now I’m 16 . Still skinny , but a lot better then I was before . I’ve been practicing my social skills , just so this time I would be able to keep up the conversation . 
I also started to educate myself a lot . Reading books , finding interesting facts . 
I became one of the smartest kids in my school . 
Why ? Because I got a new sweet memory , which made me fall in love with that girl . And I wanted to be better . For her . 

Summer . Again . 
Now we went to the sea . 
But surprise , our old family friends decided that this time they will join us . 
I knew that my love would come as well . 
I was really excited about it .
Our whole stay I tried to mostly talk to her in private . And it was fun , really fun . 
And now comes the departure day.....I get her phone number , say my farewells and.....confess how I feel about her . After she’s done listening and she realized I’m serious , I kissed her . On the cheek though , as I was not brave enough . 
Now I didn’t need to think about old memories ! I found love ! Right ?......right !?........

Apparently no . 
I kept chatting with her , everyday . 
But one week later she said that she is busy right now studying for university exams .
So I said okay and stopped chatting with her . 
She said she will text me when she’ll be free . 
Days passed , nothing .
Weeks , nothing . 
Months , nothing . 
Next week I know , she blocked me . 

I was really sad , but optimistic . Maybe she blocked me just so I wouldn’t distract her ? 
Here comes new year , 2018 . We are in Russia , just for a day , because we got a connection flight to go to . 
Again , I expect her to come and see us , see me . But nothing .
I ask her cousin why she is not responding me . 
Answer of the cousin destroyed me . 
«You didn’t know ? She hates you . Because Granny thought you were her only grandson , she spent most of her time with you . She literally thinks you stole her grandmother and she truly hate you»......
.............so much for nothing , eh ? 
......heh.........

And here I am now .  for the time being and will turn 18 soon . 
After that , I really couldn’t try and talk to another girl .
I am still trying my hardest to be educated (I just started my uni) , but.....this memory......haunts me . 

My whole life I thought “that’s it ! She is the one !” . I thought I’ll spend the rest of my life with her , but......heh . 
Life is unfair , isn’t it ? 
I tried to get into a relationship 2 more time (both of which are the stories for another time . ) . 
But here I am , writing it all to “lonely” subreddit . 
I still want to live a happy life in the future with a daughter , but......it really seems that I can’t . No girls are interested in me .",lonely,When you live your whole live just to finally confess to your childhood friend......just to get rejected .,2019-09-17 23:30:28

We had a fantastic loving and sexual relationship but after me married her libido faded and even little intimacies like kissing &amp; cuddling became like a chore for her. I thought having kids would help to bring us but our eldest is 16 now and my wife and I have not had sex for 5 years and I’m currently sleeping in the spare room.

I only have about 3 close friend who I only get to see about once a year but they and their wives are friends with my wife and I feel I can’t talk to them about my home life. They all think we have a perfect little family and I act like I’m the happiest guy in the world.

We are having counselling and my wife has admitted not feeling the same towards me anymore but we’ll stick things out for the sake of the kids but I’m really missing having someone to kiss, hug and make love. We’re still friends, we go out from time to time but conversation is about work &amp; kids and we go home to sleep in separate beds.

I feel like I want to find someone new but I’m terrified of so many things: How do I tell my wife, Will anyone want to date me if I still live with my wife, If I need to move out how will I afford it without my wife and kids suffering, How do I even go about finding someone after all these years.

I think I’ll probably have to wait until the kids are older and move out before I can even think about finding love and then it’s going to be even harder to find someone.

I’ve contemplated suicide. I’ve done huge amounts of research into methods of ending it all without risk of failing. I have a noose that I made with high quality rope and climbing hardware that will attach to almost anything I need it too but the thought of my kids having to deal with that stops me every time.

My wife doesn’t like me drinking so I wait until she goes to bed before I crack open the rum I have hidden away to help me sleep and stop me lying awake crying.

On top of this, being 23 my friends are at the point where they're off to university or settling down with girlfriends or getting swept up in work. My communication with them all has dwindled as of late since they're busy, or are talking to other people. It saddens me, but i don't have any negative feelings towards then for it. They're just getting on with their lives. If anything I'm a little envious.

All in all I lack the courage to speak to strangers, have panic attacks in public, am terrifyingly close to losing contact with the two people who have been my main sources of social interaction for about 6 years (we've been reduced to the odd three or four message conversation or happy birthday/new year messages this year), and even if i was able to walk around and speak to strangers, i can't exactly leave my nan alone. Wouldn't dream of it.

Trying not to be too negative but I'm lonely as fuck and don't see that changing. I'm seeing a psychologist and have an appointment scheduled for a sort of interview to put me on the airing list for a psychiatrist in order to help me with my anxiety and depression, but i can honestly see myself offing myself once nan passes, or a while later so my family has a recovery period between.

978,zeaNN1,1568682416,5,"I don't even know where to start...long rant incoming, I guess.

I have always been a shy kid in middle school, but I had many friends and a great support system. When I got to high school, I realized that I don't really get on with anyone, I kinda had a negative vibe, I guess. But when people got to know me in high school, many of them said that they actually enjoy hanging out with me (this doesn't happen anymore lmao) even though I didn't seem too friendly at first. I found my people eventually...they are the only ones whom I still talk to. Also, now I have extremely low self-esteem, which I managed to develop throughout ***the high school experience*** ™  a.k.a the best years of my life.

The last time I made friends with someone was in 9th grade. From then, I slowly isolated myself from most of my old friends and we stopped talking eventually.  Over the last few years, my social life started to go downhill and it didn't stop ever since. Now I have extreme social anxiety, a nice substance (xanax) abuse history - and major memory loss connected to that, few years of untreated depression, eating disorder and a sprinkle of insomnia. Sounds like the perfect recipe of your new best friend, right?

I also did really well in high school concerning my grades, but now I feel like I'm really suffering academically at uni. I was the bright, mature, quiet kid who was bad at everything else other than getting good grades. Fun fact: my parents did really bad in high school, and a few years ago, my psychologist (who I only visited 6-7 times, no more professional help in my life because I can't afford it) concluded that my parents try to compensate this with my studies - my grades were the most important for them, nothing else mattered. They didn't care that I'd spend my free time playing video games and studying, they just ""kept me"" so that they could tell their friends how awesome of a student I am and how well I am doing in school etc...you get the point.

**Here I am now, studying economics in a completely new country/school, 2 weeks into uni, 0 friends made, only talked to 2-3 people at orientation, skipped all of my seminars, zero social interaction last week.** Holy fuck, I can't even tell you how much I crave for some kind of social interaction and on the other hand - how much I don't want to leave my apartment at all.

I also turned 20 this weekend and celebrated by getting myself an apple pie the day before my actual birthday...and eating my birthday cake flavored ice cream at 2am today while listening to chill songs in bed. (I don't care how cringy it may sound, but I almost cried at how pathetic my life/this situation has become) I always celebrated with my family and then with my friends back at home, but now this is all I got here. I got 4 birthday wish messages from my family members, which made me a bit happier tho.

I know of a few things I might wanna do with my life, but I don't have the motivation to put in the hours to find out - ""just do it, be positive"" messages don't really help, but hey, you can always find them on r/thanksimcured. I always told myself that ""when I'd finish high school"", ""when I would move to my new place"", when ""I met my new classmates"" - I'd finally be content with my life. 

Others always said it *eventually* gets better. I don't believe them anymore. I mean c'mon, I can definitely imagine myself waking up next to my soulmate/girlfriend/wife (whatever you call it) in the morning, making pancakes in our cozy little apartment and having a corgi around:) - but we all know that won't happen.",lonely,I just realized that I'm more lonely than ever before...and it's not about to get better,2019-09-17 11:06:56

things developed with a friend, and we slept together a few times before i told him how i felt. we both agreed that a relationship between us wouldn't be healthy, due to both of our mental health. he slowly stopped contacting me, and eventually i met him while drunk and accused him of fucking with my head. he did nothing of the sort, i just convinced myself i was somehow the victim. the next day i messaged him to say i needed time away from him to process things, and he still hasn't read the message nearly three months later. i think that hurts more than the rejection. he really just doesn't care enough to even look.

while im still hurting over this, i spent nights with another friend, who is also a friend of my ex. because of this, and the fact he has a young child, i told him that it wouldn't lead to anything serious. i could see at the time that disappointed him, but was so lonely and selfish that i continued seeing him, reminding him frequently that we weren't an item. after a couple of months, he moved to the other end of the country for university, and won't be back for a year. so of course i made sure to tell him not to wait for me. but it hits me now that i really like him. we didn't get a proper goodbye, and i haven't had a message from him in days.

i don't know how i keep doing this to myself. it's like my subconscious is intent on me living alone. i miss physical affection, and i need someone to care, but any time i come close i seen to throw it away as quickly as i can. im just feeling really isolated and hopeless right now, and don't know how to fix any of this",lonely,"Abandoned, or pushing people away?",2019-09-17 11:02:31

991,Heavy_Duty_Spoons,1568670547,8,"Friday night, I was at a bar with a couple friends and my coworker walked in with a woman he had gone on several dates with already. Being that he's a total piece of shit, he got completely wasted, ditched his date to buy cocaine in the bathroom, and then spent the rest of the night hitting on literally anyone with a pulse. My friends and I felt bad, so we kept her company and danced with her while she waited for him. While chatting with her we found out she was actually very intelligent, well traveled, and had a great career. None of us could figure out what she was doing with him. This is a man who constantly talks about disturbing things, sexually harasses nearly everyone he meets (including flashing his genitals), says creepy things to children, constantly breaks the law and his been arrested multiple times, and is so dumb that he literally cannot even change a light bulb (I've actually seen him try). BUT, he is very tall, handsome, and charming so he has no trouble getting date after date with very nice women. And because he is a master manipulator, they often stick around way too long before realizing the truth about him.

Meanwhile there's me who couldn't get a date if his life depended on it, and it sucks so bad because I know that I have a lot to offer. I'm kind, intelligent, very talented in several different areas, and have a great sense of humor. BUT, I'm average to below average looking and have a somewhat goofy personality. I'm the opposite or cool or charming and as a result I'm 30 years old and chronically single. It's a strange situation because I can see that I have excellent traits, yet at the same time have extremely low self esteem because nobody will give me a chance. 

I don't know how I'm ever going to meet anyone. I'm not good enough looking to get any dates on apps, and even though I'm very outgoing I can't meet women out and about because I don't have the looks or charm to immediately attract a stranger, no matter what I say or how much we have in common.

Since the semester is starting soon, we have to go there personally to take care of some paperwork. We are also going to a hockey game at 5pm in the same town, so we planned to go there tommorow, manage the paperwork in the morning, go have a lunch and then find something to do in the afternoon before the game starts.

Now (11 pm) my friend called me that he won't be able to spend the afternoon with me since he's going out with some girl from Tinder. And since it's just the two of us going there tommorow, it looks I'll have to spend the time between lunch and the game wandering around the town alone.

Hey guys, girls, others.? It's me, your most hated, spamming dumb boy around here u/SovietRushB.

I was wondering why noone wants to hang out with me. I think I realised why. I ask people if they want to hang out with me too much. I think I'm just a big bother and that's why they don't want to be with me, because I'm annoying. I mean if they wanted to hang out with me they would ask... Right? Unfortunately the last time someone asked me if I want to hang out with them was few years ago. (I guess 3 or 4? I'm not sure maybe less and I just don't remember. But I know for sure it was more than 2 years.). It makes me kinda sad. I just feel worthless. Noone needs me.

I miss those good old days. When phones weren't a big thing yet. When kids played outside, played tag, played football. It was much better. I know I'm just a 16 years old kid with no life experience. But I still think life was better those 8 years ago. Or more.

(At least my) friends couldn't call me, they didn't had phones. They couldn't message you because we didn't used Internet, or Facebook. We didn't needed it. Indeed we played some online games but that was maximum of what we did on the Internet. I don't know what about others but at least I did that. Haha I remember playing shift heads or something like that. I loved the game. I don't know why but I did. I barely understood English yet I played.

Sorry for going off the main theme. I just wanted to say I miss one thing. Yelling my name. Yes, if you wanted to call someone out you had to stand in front of the block of flats, and yell someone's name, if they want to hang out. My name wasn't yelled so much, but still it was few times (wow so unexpected). I'm sorry I.. Kinda... Whatever.

996,readernugged,1568667562,30,"We lonely people can feel that our life has no meaning. This is why I felt inspired  by this quote from one of my favourite artists of all time, Stanley Kubrick:

""The very meaninglessness of life forces a man to create his own meaning. Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf; but as they grow older, the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre (a keen enjoyment of living), their idealism — and their assumption of immortality.

As a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But if he’s reasonably strong — and lucky — he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life’s élan (enthusiastic and assured vigor and liveliness).

Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining.

The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death — however mutable man may be able to make them — our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfillment. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light"".

1005,Zelda1433,1568659100,7,"For context, I’m 31.  I’ve always been very shy, but in high school I had a fantastic group of about five friends, and a separate person from that group who was my best friend.

From 2006-2010 I went to college 30 minutes away from my house, while all of my friends went away to college.  I never made any college friends because I didn’t live on campus.  I literally didn’t make one friend the whole four years.  I stayed friends with two of those people from high school.  The only way I coped with the loneliness was looking forward to when my friends came home for the holidays.

Fast forward to 2016.  My best friend and I parted ways because of wedding drama.  Haven’t talked since and never will.  That hit me hard.  Very hard.  It was my decision to end the friendship for many reasons.  I did what I had to do.  I still think about that person, all the time.  I think about what was lost and what will always be lost.

Fast forward again to 2019, now.  My maid of honor from my wedding (a coworker that became a good friend) doesn’t really talk to me anymore.  If I don’t text, she doesn’t either.  It’s been two months and nothing.  Another good friend, from that aforementioned group from high school, still talks to me but it’s rare and far between.  I have to literally beg her to hang out which makes me seem needy.

I had a baby at the start of this year.  My maid of honor and the other friend aren’t interested, even though I’ve asked to go out with them a number of times.  They never ask how I’m doing, don’t acknowledge the baby’s existence, just nothing.  The friendships are just disappearing and there doesn’t really seem to be anything I can do about it.  And part of me asks, why pursue friendships when they aren’t interested in my life now that I have a new little family member?

How did I get to the point where I literally have no friends?  I realized this suddenly last night.  It shook me to my core when I realized I have no one to call and no one to text.  I have my significant other, my family.... but friends?  No, I don’t have any friends.   And at this age, how the hell can I make new friends?

Sometimes it hurts so much I can feel it in my chest.  It twists and turns, like a knife.  Of course I changed when I had a baby.  It’s impossible not to.  But the very essence of ME, my personality, remains unchanged.  I just want to go out to dinner with someone, to TALK for god’s sake, to hang out and play video games, see a movie, have some drinks.  Anything.

If I ever display any intelligence over the IQ of 5 they all act so surprised like they didn't expect me to be better than a newborn. It just makes me feel so, so lonely. Maybe I push them away too.

After a while of just watching and observing the people that I'll be with for the rest of my years, I guess I sorta hate them and I push them away. I know a ton about these people but I bet I'm an anomaly to them.

1012,Parzalai,1568651790,30,"I'm a 15 year old kid, and, in a nutshell, my life is in bits. I feel so out out of touch with everything in the world, I have friends but I'm never taken seriously, my whole teenage life I've been a fucking clown. Tarnishing my character for some laughs, I can't socialise well, to go out with a girl is a miracle. I have not a thing in common, I like games, coding, skateboarding and lo fi. I'll never find anyone like that around my place. I can't find friends that I can properly bond with. There are a group that I love but, as I said, I'm their clown and although they may care I can't ask them to come watch The Joker, I can't ask if they wanna come to a skatepark.

Alot of the time I think of killing myself, I've been in a sad state since I was about 11, wrong friends and a wrong mindset. I only starting thinking about dying at 13. But I'm religious, which os where most my resilience comes. I'm scared to die, not becuase I don't want to, but because I'm scared of what God will think of me. I could never do it myself, I'm too much a pussy. Sometimes, on a bad day, I pray that I get approached by a theif, or kidnapped my terrorists, so they can kill me. And when I'm angry I get agitated, I beg God to kill me, dumb I know. There's been a few times where my life has gone so low that I'm intent on killing myself, I'd have a passion for it and would want it so bad. I don't self harm, farthest I'd go is punching my leg and scratching it.

For a few months I've been documenting my days on notes, speaking to my self day and night. Exclaiming the wonders of today and the fears of tommorow, its ok but I know it won't be an essential stress ball, I so much want for someone to hug me man, to tell me it's okay, someone who understands. I don't want some school therapist bullshit, they say what you want and get paid. I want a normal person to help. I feel so fucking lonely sometimes, I feel so so isolated, I just want someone I can love other than family, because we're from Balkans, they won't understand.

I don't know what to do at this point, I haven't passionately touched a person not from family in years, I know it sounds creepy but it is what it is. I think my personality and body sets my path (I'm a boy), I'm short fat, seemingly ugly, and I'm a clown, plain and simple, about 8 years now I have been. I went with it because I craved that importance, that significance, but now I want tranquility and peace of mind, I'm constantly struck, constantly pushed so I can get out a reaction. The culture of where I am tells you that only two or so friends in the group are the clowns, the rest do their thing. I want to be with people who won't consistently want a reaction. I want love to be honest, a passion.

Schools has been a big factor in my sadness, the massive weight pushed upon me just makes me so hopeless in life. In the UK we have GCSEs, a big exam grading you for future life. I'm dumb, I'm fucking dumb. I'm shit at maths, shit at sociology, shit at science and shit remembering dates for history. I wanted to be a game developer, but it's just another fantasy, my grades are bad and I awake with the fear of unemployment, poverty. So now, I always have the army in the back of my head, crawling around just hoping that I'm dumb enough to go die. That's mostly the point anyway. The army is a quick way to die, not by my hand but by some kid's.

I don't know what I was thinking coming into this subreddit, I guess I'm just a bit worried about my life, and crying and recording isn't helping anymore. I'd just like a person, an actual person to read this, not even to comment but to appreciate what it feels to be right, to live the normal life, normal job, normal friends. Or to just see through the eyes of a kid enclosed in this capsule of deception and lies held down by the expectations of society and other. If you've gotten to the end of this little vent, thank you, very fucking much, I hope you find the better in yourself and are able to care and reform into a better person and a healthier human, I sure as hell am not.",lonely,I'm scared for my life,2019-09-17 02:36:30

1032,BlackIceBlast,1568620887,3,"Every so often once like every two months they set up and plan a day to play D&amp;D and I go and I have fun and I try talking to them. I’ve known them since high school, kinda dropped them for a bit when I started going to school online, but now I’m back and I think we’re chill. But every time I try to reach out and talk to them I feel like they don’t want to talk to me. 

One of them claims she’s too forgetful to text me back, or she doesn’t like talking through certain things like discord or texts or calls, basically I feel blown off. The other acts sort of annoyed with me and anything I say. While the other two are friendly but don’t seem to really share my interests. Every now and then I try and start conversations in the discord server we have but it dies out pretty fast. 

Recently one of them was talking about another D&amp;D campaign they were planning and I got excited and we started talking about how to fit in my character. Only to find out the next time they showed up that they’ve already started that campaign without me. I figured it was because I’m not a very good role player. I prefer to read out my characters actions instead of act them out. I tried not taking it to heart. I even tried to design my own campaign just to try and invite them over more often. But they shrugged my idea off and told me I’d find a good group if I put myself out there. 

I don’t understand. These people were so encouraging with me and bought me my first dice, they act so friendly when we meet up but afterwards I might as well not exist. These are the only people who hang out with me. It’s so hard to find friends. I just feel like they have their own little gang and I show up as a background character every once in a while. 

I don’t think it’s my personality? I’ve tried to talk about things that we both find interesting or joke with them. They seem to like me when we’re all together. I’ve tried to start acting out my character but I just feel embarrassed like they find it funny. Anyways. That’s my rant I guess.",lonely,Do I Have Friends Or Not?? Rant I Guess.,2019-09-16 18:01:27

1034,hiddendelta,1568617683,10,"You’ve heard/read it before. Just a lonely guy who has never had anyone who loved him back. I feel like just getting it out there might ease the pain a bit, so why not? First things first, im 19 and quickly approaching 20. I’ve had a handful of romantic encounters over the last few years, but all have led basically nowhere. All except maybe a single relationship that lasted 3 months (which i will admit, was healthy, but barely fulfilling).

The first encounter was a long distance one. We met online and liked each other a lot. We were young and stupid like all teens, so we took it as far as planning a future together. Big mistake. A couple months in and communication got less frequent. It ended stale. We still talk sometimes and have since put the past behind us.

Some time later I met someone else online, but this time a lot closer to me. We hit it off and met up a few times. We were really into each other but never started an official relationship. Looking back, she was emotionally unavailable and could never agree to anything. I had my first kiss with her, but that was all. We cut things off a year and a half ago, and we haven’t spoken since. I hope it stays that way, and here’s why:

This may very well be the person I’ve given my most dedication to. In a way, I looked up to her because of how she had overcome her broken past. She seemed like a strong person, and i wanted to give her everything she deserved for it. I listened, I comforted, and I spoiled. To an extent, she did, too, but not very much. After pouring my heart out on this woman and having her cut me off despite it, I was left emotionally scarred. I no longer know if I have genuine feelings for someone because of how guarded I’ve become. I noticed this last summer when I thought I had feelings for an old friend of mine.

We’ve known each other since middle school, throughout which I cared for her a lot. We were best friends in high school even though we didn’t go to the same one. Still, though, we were close. Before I left for college, I wanted to spend more time with her and so I regularly visited her house. We opened up about our love lives, and found out we liked each other around the end of middle school. She had been struggling with her unofficial partner recently, and i helped as much as I could. They stopped talking that summer when the guy did something she didn’t like, so i had to step in and comfort her because of it.

We shared a couple of romantic moments that summer as we grew closer, but stopped talking altogether while I was at college. She could not get over the other guy, and I can’t blame her. Sometimes I think about how it would have turned out if I had stayed, but it hurts to think about. I don’t know if I ruined a friendship, but I’ve definitely put distance between us. 

This leads to my freshman year of college. At the end of our second quarter (a highly flawed calendar system that benefits only the institution, by the way), I met someone who I immediately thought I’d be a good match with. We were both single, so I asked her out and after a few dates she became my girlfriend. As I said before, it was a healthy relationship. She was loving and i was nothing short of the same. Around the end of the year, though, things changed. We became more distant and it was obvious that she didn’t feel the same anymore. She cut things off. We don’t talk anymore.

As she broke up with me, one of the things she said was that I fall in love too easily. I thought about it, and i do think its true. I think my romantic past has made me desperate for affection to the point where I don’t know if I truly have feelings for someone or I’m just taking what i can get. It frustrates the hell out of me and I can’t help but think the rest of my love life, if there is one at all, will come down to second guessing my feelings. 

That’s all, and if you’ve read this far, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. And if anyone has experienced something similar, I’m happy to talk about it or anything at all. Im here for y’all. Thanks!

1064,hamartiated,1568599425,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I know the standard answer is ‘talk to people’ but I have no idea how to start, I cannot keep a conversation with a stranger going for longer than 5 seconds, and when I do, it’s generally awkward as hell. 

I could just stick to focusing on school I guess, but christ, I fail to see the point anymore. I don’t mean that in like some depressed way, I just fail to see what the hell I’m striving for, if I have no-one to share any of my achievements with.

I don't know your situation, just here to post my thoughts. Maybe helps for someone.

Some of you say that you are nerds, virgins, fat etc. For me it is not a big deal, everyone is great in his/her on right. I just want to tell you, if something bothers you in your body, mindset - change it. Most of problems can be dealt with. Get inspired. And never blame life or anyone (even yourself) if you don't put in the work or you haven't made it yet. Less blaming, less negative thoughts -&gt;&gt; more energy to create life the way you want it to be.
 
If you will be happy, people will want to be around you. Regardless of you shape. 

And about loneliness. Everyone is alone. If a person gets a stop in the dream they are living in, aloneness is waiting around the corner. Everyone is doing their best to escape it. Not being enough joyful by yourself and pushing yourself to others seems very ego-centric.


Please I humbly invite to listen these channels, depression will start to fade away. The more depressed you are, the bigger impact you will see. You can search in YouTube : ""Sadhguru depression"", ""Mooji aloneness"" etc.

I don't know, what is ""haunting"" my head is the idea of having a girlfriend (yes, I think of having a person close to me a lot.) and just cuddling while trying to fall asleep. Having my head close to her chest, or just on her arm, receiving some sweet headrubs. Imagining this really helps me fall asleep. Really! I had trouble falling asleep when I was younger but since I started to imagine this it just helps me fall asleep (additionally some sweet words (Good boy etc.) or just some sweet talk.). I wish I could have a good imagination. Like kids have their imaginary friend I would have a imaginary girlfriend. Crazy right?

I don't think they'll ever love me, but they didn't close the door in that regard for good, if that makes sense. I don't know if ill ever be able to find another person that I care about and admire as much as them. They're the most beautiful person in the world to me, they're the smartest person I know, they're incredibly kind, theyre passionate and the most talented person I know, and their laugh lights up my life. I feel like with anyone else I'd be settling, but I also feel like I don't deserve them, and they could find some other guy who makes them 1 million times happier than I ever could. And I want them to be happy. I don't think I could make them that happy. And I'm trying to be someone good, someone worth being around, but even at my best they could probably find better. 

In hopes of finding someone to settle for, I checked my tinder for the first time in a while, and lo an behold, not a single person even likes me on there. Because I'm disgusting and don't have the personality to make up for it. And even if I do find someone on there, the odds of them being someone that I actually like, especially compared to this other person, are slim to none. I don't know, I feel fucked. This person is the only person who's ever found me physically attractive, but my personality still isn't enough, and they're not in a place where they want to be with anyone at all.

1086,BludgeonVIII,1568578274,7,"Aye, a couple of days ago, shortly after my birthday, I finally got my first match on Tinder, only to realize it was a bot fishing for private snapchat followers the moment it sent that stilted, pre-programmed message that attempts to sound seductive but really just comes across as creepily mechanical.  

The thing is, I've always had trouble with girls and stuff throughout my whole life. Closest thing I've done to doing something with a chick was dancing with one or two at a night club (and by dancing I mean grinding). I mean, it was really cool and all, but I've still yet to experience something as basic even kissing or cuddling or some shit.

I kinda blame myself for the most part tho cuz I used to be a Nice Guy^tm up until a year ago. A couple of life-changing experiences have forced me to confront my toxic personality issues. I've definitely improved since then, as I've been able to make more friends, reconcile with some of the friends I've hurt as a Nice Guy, strengthen the connections with friends I already have, and even just be more in the moment more often. 

However, I still struggle to not relapse back into my old creepy, entitled, passive-aggressive attitude that has caused me and the people I've affected so much pain and strife. It gets so hard to fight at times, especially when the desire to feel the warmth of another person laying close next to me becomes too unbearable for me to handle, when I start to question why I can't just bring myself to ask someone out without looking like a god damn creep. 

Then I start to think about how everyone else that I know is already starting to make something of their own lives while I still don't even know how to drive or land a job, let alone produce anything of real value. I keep thinking that people see that in me, that despite my sense of humor and insights into certain facets of life, that I should be kept at arms length because of my inability to produce anything of pragmatic value in the short term.

Then the paranoia and the crippling feelings of isolation take over, and I start to wish there was someone to lay down next to me and tell me everything's okay. 

Like, I know I need to be stronger, that I need to focus on myself first and foremost and all that jazz. But sometimes it feels like I've been in cooking in the oven for too long, and by the time I'm ""ready"", I'll just be burnt to a crisp before being thrown in the trash.

Why even bother? If people are made not to need anyone else, then why are we told to be kind, to socialize and make friends?

I'm a 21 year old guy who has had a pretty normal and boring life. I have always been shy and introvert, and i have always had difficulties making friends and meeting new people. 
Now i'm studying physics at university and I have a pretty active social life. 

However, I feel really lonely. I tried to explain my feelings to my friends many times, but it seems like they do not really understand. 

I have overcome my ""social anxiety"" in many ways, but I still fear not being accepted. I have always had good grades, and I feel really anxious about failing an exam because I fear people judging me and thinking I am a failure. However, I cannot concentrate on studying and I have a feeling that everything I do is pointless.

I have never had a girlfriend, I'd love to have one, but I am not able to get involved with a girl. Sometimes she's not interested, sometimes I'm too anxious to talk to her. I feel like I'm going to be alone all my life. I feel like a loser.

He approached her and they became friends. Not more. I think he went into the friendzone because thats at least 2-3 months ago. I don't want something bad to happen to him but I genuinly hope he gets rejected (don't judge me pls). Last week I started to approach her too. In class I tried to make eye contact with her and it worked quite sometimes. Also I started getting near her. I talked to her and that stuff. I didn't tell her that I love her. I'm so lonely and depressed  Because of my previous rejections I don't think I could handle another one. I thought of suicide before and honestly do everyday. I even attempted it one day in the past. Only me and one really close friend know that I'm suicidal. I just hope that she likes me too so bad. 2 months ago I started exercising in the gym. I'm quite thick but also have a decent amount of muscles. I already achieved something I lost about 5 kilograms. I couldn't handle another rejection what should I do? I'm afraid of myself because I think if she rejects me I will fall into a really deep depression and eventually kill myself. Btw my greatest fear in life is to die lonely.

Nobody ever tells me to leave them alone, or that they are busy or that they'd prefer if I wasn't messaging them. They acknowledge my existence but that's it. I keep asking questions, expanding on topics of conversation but NONE of them do that. 

I'm active in several friend making subreddits (different account), other discussion forums and even one dating website. It's all the same everywhere. 

I can sense in some of them that they have expectations of me but  then I turn out to be different and they lose interest.

1110,HenKenner,1568554933,5,"I used to have a decent social life. Every weekend at least someone wanted to meet up. We'd have a few drinks or go for a meal or cinema perhaps.  The problem is this has all changed. 

I'm married...but we never wanted children. I was 34 and he was 42 and we simply didn't feel that pull/urge. As a woman this has meant that I'm not walking the path that all my female friends are on. Literally all of them have children. Mostly primary school aged. 

I've tried really hard to maintain friendships. I've gone out my way to fit in with their new lives. I've remembered all their children's birthdays and travelled to meet the baby, etc. This effort hasn't been reciprocated though. I just feel they have all moved on. It hurts a lot that years of friendship have been lost. 

My husband hasn't suffered a similar fate. His friends still see him occasionally...not as often granted...but they do catch up. He doesn't even have to make a huge effort. A few texts and it is all arranged. Seems Dad's aren't as tied up as Mum's. I get that. This is why when I've contacted female friends I always offer to go to theirs or meet at a cafe or do something child friendly. They always have other plans. 

It hurts a lot to be honest. I wonder now why I spent years of my life on these friendships. I was close to them...or so I thought. 

It is then even harder to make new friends. I work long hours and the people at work are all in long established cliques. I'm not at all sporty and I'm often too exhausted in the working week to even consider doing a sport. It leaves weekends where I'm available. 

My husband is great and takes me for meals, cinema, etc and even offers for me to join him if he is meeting a friend...but they want to catch up and I don't want to feel a spare part. I just wish my friends wanted to catch up with me. It hurts like hell. I won't look at old photos now as I just end up crying. 

We have a few couples we see now and then...joint friends...this is nice...but we don't see them often as they live a long way away. Interestingly they are friends of his that I've become friends with over the years. 

I can't believe how much everything has changed. I don't think I'd hear from people if I didn't make the effort and chase them...but I'm fed up of this. Friendship ought to be a two way thing. 

This is a long rant. I had to get how I'm feeling off my chest.

I had a ton of friends while I was with my ex but I drifted apart from those people awhile ago. I've always appreciated being alone and for most of my life I've been friendless but lately I've began to worry myself with a new found habit. I talk to myself a lot, I sit in my room in pitch black besides my laptop screen light and mouth out words (without actually making any noise) and stare off into space as if someone is sitting next to me. I then imagine how someone would react to what I just 'told them' and 'respond' to them. I'm completely aware no one is there and I never do this in public but for some reason I get just as much satisfaction doing this as I would talking to another real human being. I can do this for hours on end while also doing something else like using my laptop or listening to music, frequently stopping to have a mini conversation with myself. I feel completely sane but this doesn't seem like a sane thing to do. I never really have real conversation unless it's a mandatory conversation with a peer or teacher.

It reminded me of the movie candyman where he took her in his arms and they just spun around. It was just as terrifying; however, it was so much more pleasant. No bees... no weird jacket... just this amazing woman. My dream woman. And she was kissing me. I could feel my pulse beat in my chest. She literally took my breath away. 

“I missed you.” I whispered in her ear and pulled her closer to me. 

I woke up in my bed and pondered about the dream. I sent her a message, “I really wish I could hold you right now,” I texted. “How can I miss you when we’ve never even met?” She responded shortly later with a “&lt;3”. 

I pulled the chair out from my desk and took a seat. I proceeded to search the interwebs for upcoming book tours. There she was. She was going to be just a measly four hours away. I travel that far to see my family when I can. I can barely tolerate them for a few hours without a migraine... this though... is something I sense in the pit of my being... At  the very core. . I’ve been watching a lot of her vlogs and listening to her podcasts. Somehow it makes me feel closer to her. Just being able to hear her voice... it’s so soothing. I smile every time I hear her voice or see her face. This woman is the most stunning and brilliant woman I think I’ve ever had the pleasure of talking with. 

I picked up the phone about a hundred times to call her. I put my phone back down onto the table and looked at it. I think I looked at it for about 3 hours. I thought to myself outloud, “this cannot be normal.” 

A dark cloud passed by and my feelings became bleak as well. My mom is right. Nothing is ever going to happen to me that matters. I’m going to die. In this room. In this place. Alone. And no one is going to give shit about it. 

And it would be the truth. This is why I shouldn’t get out of bed. I walked to my bedroom and played A guided meditation to myself. It comforted me because the voice sounds so much like hers.

But at the end of the day, it's just me talking to myself. I was merely pretending to be with them.  Meanwhile I'm sitting on a table by myself with not one person in front of me, pretending to do something on my phone so I look like I'm busy.

I thought we were going to remain good friends and an important part of each others lives based on our conversations but that’s not the case. We both go to the same university and are part of the pretty small music program, so we would see each other and most people in general every day. Once we got back from break things seemed normal, until she blocked my number. I tried to ask her about it but she avoided me multiple times. Filled with anxiety I went to meet her outside one of her classes and would not explain anything to me. Not why she was avoiding me, if she was even mad at me, nothing. It seemed like thing would get extra bad if I stayed and pressed, so I backed off and left. A few days later the anxiety and grief were so bad once again that I messaged her through a few different places to try to tell her how awful I felt and that I needed her. She was mad, and understandably so. If I was thinking rationally I probably wouldn’t have done what I did and I regret it. Still, she refused to explain to me what her reasoning or motives were and I was left defeated. I still love her so much. I worry about her health and her wellbeing, I wanna see her succeed, and I still care about her so much. I wanna tell her how I feel but I don’t know what to do. Things have gotten slightly better over the past couple of weeks. We’ve had a few good interactions, and have sat at the same table with friends twice now, but she still seems slightly uncomfortable and once people start to leave she leaves as quickly as she can.

1152,aka-OVP,1568507864,2,"Hey, so I'm pretty new to Reddit, made this account yesterday. I don't really know where to start with this post..  I feel emotionally and mentally unstable, and i have no one to talk to about it. It's just so exhausting..  I haven't always felt this lost, it all began to build up to the way i feel now around the year 2017. First i lost my job (the watch and jewellery store i worked for was shutting down, so all the employees got fired.) , then I got sick and lost so much weight. And when I'm already skinny from before, and then start loosing weight.. That just.. idk.. hits me hard..(It's hard for me to gain weight since i was born) And all of a sudden my friends just stopped talking to me (I don't feel like I'm a mean guy, maybe I'm just boring(?)), I don't go to many parties, I don't drink that much alcohol. I definitely don't have the energy for that now. I don't judge much, but i have standards for what i think a good human being is, so if I don't feel the vibe. I probably stay home instead of going out. So that might be a reason why my ""friends"" just stopped talking to me. Later my family started to ask me why I didn't have a job, and why i lost my job. I tried to explain them that it wasn't my fault, but they only said ""You're a failure, you should be more prepared! you should have known!"" And the thing is, we didn't get the warning that the store was closing, so it all came as a shock to us all.. I now don't live at home since my parents have already kicked me out like 3 times, and I don't want to live home anyways. I just get more and more  mentally sick by being home, but i miss my little sister so goddamn much (who is 12 years) So it's hard to not see her as often as i would like to.. And now this day today, i feel hopeless, lonely, anxious and just not stable at all. I'm still sick after going to the doctor so many times. I even tried to talk to a guy who i saw as a close friend about my sickness, and all he said was ""don't you think you're sick, because you're not doing anything) I feel like i have lost everything. So much more have happened, but i don't wanna make this post too long. Life have been hard and lonely.. But the main thing i wanted to do for this community is to reach out to lonely people, I want to be here for you. I'm a 22 year old guy, born in Norway, grew up with my real asian parents. I love music and playing instruments, i just love art in general. If you really need someone, talk to me.. I don't want you to feel this kinda pain. Let's go through this hard sh\*t together. I wouldn't mind being less lonely by talking to a lonely person. I don't care if you're 50 years older than me, or don't have any of the same interest as me. Let's try to make a friendship.

1159,harvestbrook,1568502947,24,"So this post is more of a personal vent since I don’t really have anyone to talk to irl, so feel free to completely ignore it. I just need to scream into the void.  My school district was k-12, so I stayed friends with some of the people I had befriended in fourth grade all the way up until graduation. I lost some friends, sure, but I always had at least SOMEBODY. All the friends I’ve made since then I’ve met because they were originally a friend of a friend.
However, I graduated this past May, and I went across the country for college, which was initially exciting for me. I was excited to make new friends, since I realized in the past year that the people I considered my best friends didn’t really consider me their close friend, but now that I’m in college I’ve realized how horribly over-optimistic I was. I have absolutely no idea how to make friends. I can make small talk with people and joke with people and get along great with them temporarily, but I am godawful at keeping up that communication, and often times they don’t even seem interested in me. I just have no idea how I’m supposed to do it.
But, if I was to be honest with myself, outside of the influence of others, I’m actual fine with this. I’m perfectly fine being on my own and having my own schedule and doing my own individual hobbies, and tbh I prefer doing most stuff by myself. But everyone is constantly going on about how the friends I make in college will be my friends for life, and how important it is to network and have bonds, and how important it is to have friends and be constantly doing stuff with them, and it seems like all the other freshman already have these close friends, and it all just stresses me out. I’m caught between this awkward  place where I’m perfectly fine not having friends, but I feel pressure to make friends, but I’m also completely unable to make friends, and it’s making me so depressed.
I’ve been trying to focus on what makes me happy and secure and comfortable, which is often times just doing my own thing without others since I don’t like other’s company, but idk I just needed to vent about this somewhere because everyone irl either doesn’t understand or wouldn’t understand (I mean, if I even had anyone outside my parents I felt comfortable reaching out to)
Sorry if this didn’t make sense. I’m bad at expressing my feelings.",lonely,"I haven’t had to make friends on my own since I was in 4th grade, and now I don’t know how to do it anymore, but I’m not sure I even want to",2019-09-15 09:15:47
1160,gainsMcSteady,1568501631,4,"Moved to a new city for a job out of college about 3 years ago. Have made a few aquiantences, but no one I would call a good friend down here. 

I'm fine talking to strangers one-on-one, but when around large groups of strangers who already know each other not so much. Back home I was always better in these situations if I had friends or family with me, in fact my sociability tends to be directly proportional to how many people I know personally compared to how many I don't. On the other side, I do tend to be very kind/friendly to people who are outcasts in my groups so to speak.

I've had opportunities to turn some of these acquaintances into friends, and opportunities to meet more people, but ever since I passed the point where I should have made friends ( a few months), I have felt a stigma when interacting with acquaintances and especially their friends. I feel like I can't be myself in these situations bc of a stigma of having no friends. Like everything comes through this filter of 'this guy has no friends, there must be something wrong with him' and so any unsafe things I'd say or do that would come off well in a group where I'm 'socially proven'  instead make me seem like that much more of a loser. It's frustrating bc I feel like I bring the same intent to socialize/be friendly, but I come off awkward/weird bc of the lack of social proof. 

I recently accepted a new job and am headed to a bigger city with much more opportunity to do social things I like to do, and I don't want to fall into the same pattern.

She claimed we could always hang out but every time I asked she never fulfilled it, and whenever I had an issue with her she would take it to heart as if I were trying to attack her or make her feel bad. She constantly treated me like shit yet I was dumb enough ton keep giving her chances and I will admit that's my fault.

Honestly, fuck her. She's done. Like I said, she's no better than the other kids I used to go to high school with.

New guy here, 
22 and I have no clue what's happening with my life.

 Can't say i havent ever had friends cause I had a couple of great ones, for short durations, but I had them. For now I don't have anyone at all though. 

If i have say something about myself then I am the person who'll enter a gathering of 100 and by the end of the day know everyone and have them call me a friend. A week later however almost no one will remember me. 

Don't know why, but, I keep making acquaintances and keep not getting friends. The last seat to fill in my office staff bus is invariably next to mine and I am the only one who knows everyone on that bus. And it's like they hate me. But none do. They just don't seem to like me that much.

Don't know what's wrong but something's broken and needs fixing. Cause no one wants to left out of trips they suggested, reunions they initiated, treats they demanded.  And don't want that seat next to me to remain empty.

1194,Aborigen123,1568457255,6,"So, not to make flowery emotional speech, I'll try to keep things short. The problem is that I can pretty well handle conversations with people who I don't know well and I usually (not really always) have something to ask and something to say. But in the end I just don't feel the ""connection"", it doesn't seem like we ""click"" and get closer to being real friends. Idk, maybe it's just me and other people actually feel that we could have some meaningful relationships, but that's just how things go.

And similar thing goes for my older friends. We either stop talking after I realise that this person is using me/dragging me down/badly influence me in general, or we just never get out of this ""kinda friends"" state where we talk from time to time and rarely hang out or don't hang out at all.

Whenever I try to talk to a girl for a period of time I just get vibes that she's not interested and slowly give up the conversations. As you can guess, they seldomly message by own initiative.

And even when I have a good time with some people, it usually ends where is ends. And now I'm sitting alone in a park in a city when I've never been before. The people who went here with me (we all went here for to visit a science conference) are hanging out somewhere. Two of them are bf and gf so they don't need any third wheel while the other guy is hanging out somewhere with his girl friend and they also don't seem to need someone else.

There are dozens of people around who are happy and having fun together with their families, friends or partners. And I'm just sitting with a dead expression on my face feeling like I'm gonna cry at any moment.

1206,hamartiated,1568438042,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I've alsways been an outsider, even as a kid. I chalked up my inability to make friends as the side effect of being a child of a service member. Always on the move and never making roots until i was in middle school. 

I had some friends in school. Went to social gatherings. But, it's just always had an ""off-ish"" type feeling to it. Like I would be there with people, but no one ever initiated conversation with me, or reciprocated when I tried to start a conversation. I felt like I was just invited out of social obligation. 

And that feeling has never gone away, and my ""social circle"" has all but dwindled down to nothing. 

I see all these posts on social media of people who have had best friends since they could remember. Tagging them in photos and making remarks about an inside joke they have. 

I feel like such a loser, the only comments I ever get on anything I post is from my mother.... 

Even people I thought were what was supposed to be a best friend, don't ever message me first or reply to a message I send.

I can't remember the last time I genuinely felt like I had company when I needed it. I have no best friend. I don't even have friends. I have a few acquaintances that I talk to once in a blue moon maybe. But I never have people that want to hang out with me. I don't get invited to do anything fun. No parties, no calm nights with a few friends or even one, not even studying with someone. Getting through the day is mechanical for me at this point; I just wake up, go to class alone, do homework alone, eat alone, and everything else alone. 

Sometimes I think it's okay, that I don't really need friends because I can just do whatever I please without having to worry about anyone else. But on days like today, that realization that I don't have a choice but doing my own thing really tears me down.

My 3 roommates are all at parties right now. All got invited to their own thing with their own friends. And I... well, today is just another day of sitting on the kitchen table by myself watching TV. I thought I was okay with this, but I'm not. I want to have a choice to spend time with people or do my own thing some of the time, but I don't.

Then i got into weed (1 year ago) and it helped me  a lot because i dont feel that much alone when im stoned, at first some people smoked with me and i thought i could gain friends because of that but it wasnt like that, i got addicted because i felt a lot better (im not smoking everyday but 3-4 times a week for sure)and then these ""friends"" started to talk shit about me although theyre smoking as well and arent better than me...

I promise I'll keep it short.

I just wish I had a girlfriend. Fuck freedom or whatever you call it, fuck free time or whatever you lose. I just wish I had a girl. I just wish I had someone that would call me a good boy. I know you won't probably understand my need but that's okay I don't expect you to understand it. The feelings of happiness and relief/ relaxation when the person close to your heart calls you a good boy must be just.. Awesome. It would be for me I suppose. After a day of serving my father, listening to his orders and commands with minimum thankfulness (I mean I understand that he doesn't want to do anything at home but at least he could be thankful.. Or am I getting it wrong?) hearing that I was a good boy would for sure cheer me up a bit, calm me down and just.. Help.

Another big need is hugs. In elementary school we had a girl that if you would kindly ask her she would give you a hug. You wouldn't believe how much it helps to just.. Relax or just.. Feel better. Feeling the arms around your body and the more or less tight hug, making you feel cared about.. Its really good.

Last of them are headrubs/headpats.

Idk why but I feel as if my soul craves a very deep connection with another individual but my mind's biggest fear is the thought that it may never come to happen :/

Perhaps this fear is because of growing up in a household deprived of love and affection. Or maybe it's just because I crave a form love and appreciation in what I do from someone else apart from my mom

I honestly wish life could get easier or life could at least give me a sign of what is to come because at this point I honestly have no clue as to what will happen now or even in the future

I suffer from social anxiety as well so social situations that are meant to be ""fun"" or ""lit"" or ""exciting"" really are the opposite to be honest

Loneliness has grabbed another from the bucket, and is chewing it like jerky. I apologize if I seem overdramatic. I suffer from Asperger’s Syndrome, I’m M, 16. 

This all began at the end of 8th grade. I parted with friends for the time, and had an awesome summer... until school came back.

Trust me, this seems normal,  but it got worse. 

My friends began getting girlfriends, ignoring me, not even answering texts or calls. I began to enter a depression. I have managed to put on a mask in order to keep going in my classes.

I want to find ""the one"" i want to experience love but for me i guess its just impossible. What seems like the norm for everyone that is finding someone you love and making them your wife is just an imaginary dream that i will never come close to. Im 19 and ive never even had a female friend let alone hold someones hand or hug someone, ill never know what its like to love someone unconditionally and they love me the same, to have someone to share my life with, to make happy and to make memories with, ive never experience being young and in love and i never will my youth was just sitting in my room alone.

The few friends i have left are all moving on with their lives going to different universities and different paths so we are all just growing apart. I have always had some form of friends since child hood to highschool and ive never had to make friends but this past year of starting at a uni has been the worst, i was completely alone, not a single person to call even a classmate id go to uni and me speaking one word would be more than the average, id constantly just try not to cry the whole day until i got home told my mum i was going to sleep and just cry until i couldnt. Id never been alone like that, this past year was literal hell for me and i dont know if i can do it again this year and im dreading next week when i go back.

I am completely unlovable, its probably the way i look and having anxiety doesnt help. I try so hard to be a good person but i guess at the end of the day it doesnt matter when your so ugly that random women look at you like your some creep just for existing, its not their fault though if everyone looks at me that why it must be something wrong with me,i guess i was just born unlucky and dont deserve to be happy, oh well ill just live out my days alone until theres no one left that cares about me then ill see, maybe it will get better in the meantime but i highly doubt it.

1231,andiooops,1568410238,2,"When I was in high school, my only friend was my boyfriend. That was it. I was very lonely and wished for friends. 

So, when I was off to college, I promised myself I would change that. I would get friends no matter how much I would have to go out of my comfort zone. 

It's exhausting. I can't enjoy socializing because I think too much about what I can say without them judging me for. 

My first friend was my roommate. Nothing was wrong. She withdrew. 

My second friend was a guy I met online who goes to my college. He loves to talk but as soon as I try to tell a story of my own, he zones out. He never invites me to hang out. He seems to enjoy hanging out but never asks me himself. He'll show me all of his jokes and memes but when I show him mine, he doesn't laugh, he ignores them half the time. He doesn't ask about me, like when I told him I was getting a piercing, he only said ""lol nice."" Not even asking what piercing I'm getting? Not the least bit curious?

My third friend is from high school. Now this is the only person I don't have totally bad news about. We were always just acquaintances that worked on projects together but we've been hanging out a lot more in college, I have a class with him and we each lunch together after that class. The only thing is that, because we were always acquaintances, I never showed my true personality. I put on all of my filters to make sure he wouldnt judge me, and because he was an acquaintance, it didn't matter to me. Now I feel fake and trapped inside a personality that isn't me while we keep hanging out more and more. I'm trying to slowly show my true personality but he seems taken aback every time. 

My fourth friend wears me down. She's very nice, I'm glad she spoke to me, but it's hard. We can't ever hang out without her bringing her boyfriend, who is great and all, but I just have nothing in common with him. We're only really friends to eat together at the dining hall. We don't even sit next to each other in class. 

My fifth friend I met in class. I really like him but I just can't seem to make him connect with me. He called me cool and asked to eat together the first day we met, which we couldn't make our schedules work out, but has never said anything good about me or asked to hang out since then. Now we mostly only talk in class besides our streaks on Snapchat which I didn't even want to do. I think I disappointed him. I don't know how to respond to his humor (dry, sarcastic and dark) so it's always awkward even though I do actually think he's really funny.

I'm exhausted. I'm such a disappointment. What's wrong with me? What don't I understand that everyone else does?

So now it's a Friday night. All of my friend's Snapchat stories are them going to parties and hanging with other friends. I'm stuck with a mountain of homework that's stressing me to no end but I can't focus on it because I hate myself.",lonely,"Now that I have friends, I'm experiencing a whole new type of loneliness and I don't know how to deal with this",2019-09-14 07:30:38

I had anxiety for a long time and couldn.t even talk normal to people (forget my name, panick attacks and others) but now i got over it thanks to a bunch of stuff i forced me to do. Now i can go to random people and start a conversation with no problem. 

The problem that still persists is that i just can.t feel like i.m integrating. It could also be from the fact that i don.t like the small talks and prefer deeper talking subjects? I have to admit i am very selective with the people i keep close because mostly i get bored when i feel like i am not challenged in a relation - friendship or other kinds. But even with the few ones that are close to me sometimes i feel weird. 
It doesn.t affect me that much on the surface, because i pretty much got used to loneliness. But i don.t understand if everyone is feeling this and pretend to be ok or it.s just me that is strange. 

And it.s not like people don.t want me around. I see they appreciate me for how i am and even admire what i do, but it.s always some sort of distance like a shield between me and everyone else. 

This is not a “special snowflake” problem. Nop. This is a problem i fight since 6-7 yo. Always felt like an outcast and always tried to integrate. Now i gave up “integrating”. I like being myself but i can.t stop wondering why am i always the outcast?",lonely,Outcast?,2019-09-14 07:19:40

&amp;#x200B;

I have been so fucking lonely since coming back to university. I'm in my junior year and have made one friend that I'm actually close to, but this year, her boyfriend decided to basically move in with us and he is here all the time/she is there all the time. When they hang out, it's always with her door closed. So now, I am left with no friends.

I hate walking around campus and seeing other girls with their friends walking around and then there's just me. I've done so much to try to find my place on campus. I'm in a social organization, I lead an organization that I started, and I am part of another club. I talk to people in my classes. I try so hard to be social but no one wants to hang out with me or talk to me. 

It's gotten to the point where all I do is complete my mandatory things for the day that I can't do from my bed and then I go home and get in bed. I sit there for probably 5 hours before I go to bed. I don't have anyone to talk to and I just feel so shitty that I isolate myself because I don't want to bring other people into this funk I've been in for the past month.

I’m so disappointed by friendship in general... I’ll admit I never cared much to have many friends, I always believed that it was better to have a few of them, but sincere. I’ve never needed someone to just ‘hang out’, I like to spend time with people I have something in common with, if you get what I mean.. who share interests with me beside the need to drink a beer with someone but... since I broke up with my boyfriend, after we spent together 17 years, all those I considered real friends just disappeared because me and my boyfriend weren’t there to plan a night out anymore and they chose to keep his friendship over mine, I guess.

Then three years ago I found a new job and I met this colleague... she was 27, just 6 years younger than me, but she was very insicure and her friends treated her badly. She had no self esteem but she was sweet and I immediately tried to help her, inviting her to hang out with me, I complimented her to help with her self esteem, I shared my interests to help her to find something that could make her feel stronger, more confident, and I tried my best to be with her when she needed someone to talk to. I thought I finally had found a best friend - I know it sound childish but I’m so envious of those who have this kind of friendship! - but recently she got herself a boyfriend, she grew more confident, she reconnected with her friends... and I realized suddenly that I’m no longer needed, and I am alone. 

When me and my boyfriend broke up I thought that at least I still had friends to hang out with, it broke my heart because I still love him unfortunately, but I was so sure that I’d never feel lonely, that I’d always have someone to hang out with.... that now I don’t know what to do. I’m like... stuck in this situation, I have two jobs and I work hard all day long but when I come home... I don’t even know who I could call to go out for a beer.

And right now I kinda feel embarrassed for all this speech, English isn’t my mother tongue and it’s probably full of mistakes but... I kinda hope that someone will stop and say hello. Just to know there’s someone out there that found my post, that I’m not talking to myself.

And she says sorry and then the girl next to her asked what we were taking about, she told her that I had a bug latched on to me, but then I corrected her awkwardly and said “it’s name is coco” I was poking fun in an awkward way since she kept calling it “the bug”

I never thought I would fit in with these other kids that knew each other their entire life. I never thought that they would openly accept me, a new kid, as their friend, but now that its at that point six years later, some of them are closer to me than the others. Over these past
six years and countless experiences and stories I have learned amazing and extreme leadership skills, how to cook, how to play ukulele which evolved with the help of my friends to be playing actual guitar, how to budget, how to be a man, how to be responsible, stuff like that. 
I was so surprised when they opened their arms towards me because when I first got their I saw that the fad was to be an unopenable vault type of clique but they didn't do that to *me*.
Anyways we are now moving across country again and I don't know what I'm going to do with myself. My birthday is in four days and I'm going to be 18 years old. I'm going to have my birthday and then we are going to move a week or two after. 
A lot of people tell me to stay and stuff but I can't do that because my family needs me.
I graduated already so I don't know how I'm going to meet people, and honestly, I don't know if I even want to meet people. The routine in my life is to dig up years worth of roots and I just cannot deal with all of that mentally again. 
I feel like my brain already decided not to let myself be truly close to any new people anymore because I hate losing people more than anything.

I was that person who used to say ‘oh, having no friends is nice. I can do whatever I want, go wherever I want. I only have to worry about *my own* opinion. I can read my books in peace’. This was when I was 17 and under. I used to believe that I was just *meant* to have no friends. 

Then I made some friends and spent a lot of time with them. It seriously made me fully realise how actually *depressing* is was to have no friends. I didn’t like it, I wasn’t fine with it, I was just *used* to it. I also tend to adopt ‘weirder’ behaviours when I’m more isolated because I only have my own opinion to count on. 

I feel like on Reddit, you get a lot of people justifying having no friends because ‘no drama’. But I wonder how many of those people are *actually* happy with having no friends. After a while of having no friends, you kind of have no choice but get used to it. It deludes you into thinking you ‘love your alone time’. 

I’ve unfortunately drifted apart from those friends, but their friendship has left a lasting impact on me. Nowadays, I put *a lot* more effort into talking to people. If I think someone’s kind or I admire them, I reach out and ask if they want to chat more, even if they’re 50 years older than me, or a teacher.

1258,killercrimes4,1568370776,2,"21 m. Live in a small mountain city 100,000 in the area. I never had any real friends in high school. Just a few people i ate lunch w/ its a very conservative area and about 1/3 the population is ultra conservitive (lds) i was raised in this religion but became a closet atheist my senior year. From there i just wanted to run away and start over. So i went to university in the UK with the goal of makeing just one friend. First semester was really rough i arrived almost 3 weeks late (visa), 4 of my flatmates didn't want anything to do w me the 5th and i seemed to hit it off but she would always say we would go out or that she would introduce me to people but never did (there's a bit more drama there but whatever) i tried meeting people in lectures and workshops. Met some cool people in one but it was just like highschool, friends of circumstance once the project was done it was back to waving as we passed by. Living in student housing didn't help. Alone in a tiny room. Listening to other people haveing fun at dozens of parties and pres. Accross the complex while you sit there trying to tune it out. Desperately trying to work on assignments just to forget about how empty i feel, go sit in the shower carving words in my skin. Or I'd just leave and wonder around the city at night just hopeing that something might happen. Idk. When winter break came it was nearly a month long.  i hadn't planned on going home for christmas but i was seriously starting to loose my shit. So i came home for a month, still nofriends at home but being with family helped. I very seriously considered staying home. But i decided to try again with a fresh look at semester two. A fresh crew of international students came in and was able to squirm my way into a fb group where i was able to make plans, travel more and meet people, amd yes i think i actually made a few friends. Plus i tried really hard, joined some clubs, met some people who might of actually hung out and even tried flirting with a few girls, (screwed up with the ladies tho cuz I'm a genuine idiot). Anyway it was allot better. ( still had some rought times tho) And i would have had a few friends had i gone back. Unfortunately my accademic preformance was not good. Lets just say that university isn't for me, so yeah I'm back home living w mom and dad. Without any friends i trying to get a job but honestly the thought of working at most places leave a hole in my stomach. I'm trying to get a job somewhere with allot of people working but just so i can try makeing friends. I don't have my own car rn so going places to meet people can be a bit difficult unless its at church. Theres a group of athiests that meet every sunday but i cant go because its at a time when i don't have access to a car. Thats really the only good thing about europe , everything is close. I dunno i was just sitting here   scrolled through insta, then i went to tinder to see if i matched w anyone but hontly don't know what people want from that app. I just want to have coffee w someone and have a convo. But basicly never get a response from anyone. Then i went to pintrest and just got thinking and now I'm  at the lowest I've been since i got home, i just keep hopeing things will get better but nights like these you just can't help but wonder, maybe they won't.

I've always had a bad relationship with friendships growing up, I've always held having a good friendship group in high regard, but I've never quite managed to get one. This has been a source of such pain for me over the years as I see my sisters, or people around me have friendships so easily. I've lost count over the times I've cried over being lonely. But I never seem to want to actually hang out with some of the potential friends, I like my own company, but feel so loney and like I need friends. catch-22. Either I had best friends growing up that I completely drifted apart from. Or in Uni I made some friends but either feel like deep down they don't like me or I actually don't even feel the want to hang out with them as I always feel I have to impress them etc.   


I'm 25 now and would say I have about 2-3 close friends here in the UK. I recently started a new job where I made a good friend, however the friendship deteriorated quickly and I ended up quitting my job and moving home because I felt out of place in the office and decided just to give up the job and go travelling/teach abroad.   


That was 4 months ago and fast forward to now and I've saved £4,000 and completed my TEFL course, ready to go travelling with my boyfriend and then settle in Taiwan to teach for a year, maybe more.   


However, yesterday I had this pang of fear. That going away for such an extended time would mean I lost any of the connections I have here in the UK. I know there is one person I could pick up where I left off with in the UK but the others will probably drop off so when I do come back to the UK again, I will be even more lonely. And as it's getting harder and harder to make close friends as I age, this may result in me being more depressed and lonely.   


However I don't know if I should just do the travelling 3 months and not teach abroad but come back to the UK so I can get back to a job and cultivate my friendships a bit more. Obviously travelling is incredible, and living abroad, but if it's going to result in me feeling even worse when I do return, is it a smart move?  


I know you could say I could meet even more amazing people abroad/when I'm teaching. However when I'm with m boyfriend we are very just a 1 on 1 kind of couple and don't really get a friendship group around us. I would probably have to go out of my way to spend less time with him to make the connections and would find myself just hanging out with him as it's easier. And as I've said, it's getting harder and harder to make friends as I grow up.

1274,Knightcapt,1568347994,0,"*A bit of backstory.*

I have a girlfriend who works at a hospital and she works 12 hour shifts. At first we handled everything well when she worked days. We'd both go to work, after I get off I'd go home and she'd stop by my house on her way home (don't live together obviously) and on weekends she'd spend the weekend at my house and if she worked, she'd just leave from here and come back when she got off. 
But maybe 2 months ago she decided to work nights because of the differential in pay, it only made sense for her to do it but in my head I was slightly worried at first because I was having really depressive moments when I was alone. But we worked it out and everything was fine the first few weeks. My routine on the days she worked was I'd go to work, come home and play games on xbox live with friends then go to bed. Rather simple but it was enough to keep my focus on other things.  Eventually I'd try to make plans with a few friends and at first it was ok but then they just constantly fell through. So work, games, sleep it became. And her off days we spent together. But the days she works, we barely talk because of her either sleep or at work. No biggie.

*And now we come to this week...*

I got off work the other night and was feeling much better than I had during the weekend (I was sick) and I sat on the couch and scrolled on my phone. As I'm scrolling through instagram, I see a suggested friend and it's this girl from highschool who was basically one of my best friends back then (like 2012-2014) but once we got to college, for some reason we just stopped talking completely and it's been years since I heard from her. So I send her a friend request and a message and we catch up. This was maybe Tuesday night. 

My girlfriend had to work Tuesday,  Wednesday and tonight, so our window to actually talk was rather small but we talked until she had to work and random texts while shes at work before I fall asleep.

So my old friend and I were sending messages back and forth since tuesday just talking, joking around and just having normal conversations.

 And tonight my girlfriend ended up calling out of work because she ended up getting sick so once I got off work, i went to see her and then came home and haven't heard from her since because she fell asleep. 

And my friend left me on read and when I say it really triggered one of my depressive moments when I just feel abandoned and alone, it got pretty bad. I sat on the couch for a bit constantly checking the phone every few minutes from a reply from someone and nothing.

It made me realise just how much I just miss conversation with someone. You may be thinking ""oh they're just sleep or something "" but you don't realize,  I haven't talked to a friend (like actual conversations) in so long and it made me feel better than I have in so long. I think its because majority of my ""friends"" now are only around when it is convenient for them and when I try to reach out, I guess it's a bother to them, idk

disclaimer: this is just a random vent over something thats been making me feel really lonely. this felt like the appropriate place; correct me if im wrong.

i am a lesbian. for the most part. technically, im bisexual - but i just prefer women so much its such a slim chance id ever want to be with a male. the term lesbian kind of makes me uncomfortable for some reason, though. i dont know why.

girls make me nervous. like butterflies nervous. im a pretty average person. im no model but im decent. i work full time and go to college. all my friends are sort of settling down, finding love, having kids;
and here i am selling Nikes and trying to dress my niece up as Princess Zelda for halloween with no weekend plans. (im so excited for fall !!! )

at first it was all fine- its just taking me longer but eventually ill meet the right girl. but no.. in fact i havent met ANY girls at all that like girls. and its weighing me down, dude. i wanted this fall to be the bees flippin’ knees but its been kinda lonely.

i have some friends, really i dont get out much despite being a pretty social person. i tried tinder once but.. i dont know i didnt like it. nothing ever felt genuine. i wanted to meet someone naturally but its not happening and its.. depressing.

im not perfect; but i feel like i have a lot to offer and that sucks. im working to save up a few thousand to move our on my own in a little over a year and its dawning on me how lonely its going to be. i never really stressed out about dating before because it never was an option; i live in ohio which is as cold as it is very straight. when i was younger i always hoped by now id have someone by my side to build a future with like partners in crime. and granted my cats pretty great. but a girl with a nice smile would be better.

Then one year ago I fell in love. He was perfect and he perfectly understood when I confessed my feelings to him (which obviously weren’t mutual). We stayed friends, best friends from my perspective and good friends from his. Fast forward to a month ago, I finally realized that I’m addicted and obsessed with him, that he’s toxic and I need to drain him from my life. It’s been some tough couple of weeks, but we went from talking every day to two dry weeks, and I feel like I’m losing my mind.

Today I made plans with another friend (which I met through the one mentioned above). We were really close for a time until she decided to prioritize her hook ups over me. We haven’t talked for a long time although I tried to make contact and have a conversation and offered to meet up today. She stood up to me cause she fell asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

But I've finally found a cool one, it's on a film set! (it's a reputable company don't worry, I would share the link but I don't wanna share my location I'm always paranoid about someone I know finding me). 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a short shoot for an LGBT film and they offered overnight accommodation (it's 2 nights) for out-of-city folk but I've accepted it too because I can't wait to get away and meet people like me and just be myself, I keep fantasising about making friends or even a partner but I don't wanna set my hopes up too high. I keep packing and re-packing my bag over and over, and trying to figure out which of my clothes are the nicest, I wish it was tomorrow!

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I still live at home – I'm 22 – and have parents who are extremely uncomfortable with my staying overnight at a strange place, i.e. it's not a hotel, it's the house that we're filming in. I get that it's scary but I've just spent far too long succumbing to my parents' will just so they're comfortable. I don't wanna sound like some rebellious angsty teenager but in my mind the fact is I need to start taking more risks. I've succumbed to my parents' anxieties about me for far too long, I even stayed in the same city to study for university, I abandoned so many other opportunities! And they still think me doing that was good for me!

&amp;#x200B;

And this isn't even a massive risk, the film company have safeguarding policies and it's a legitimate project. They keep saying they trust me, but if they really did then they would let me make my own decisions, especially at 22, but my parents think my age is irrelevant, I can't authorise my own decisions until I move out, which I can't do until I'm married. To a man, and yes I'm female, which should trigger the conversation about my sexuality except that's never gonna happen, what I'm hoping for at best is to send them a letter when I'm living far, far away from here. I get so jealous of coming out stories where the parent is just like ""yeah I knew, the whole family knows, we love you regardless"" because I promise you my parents are clueless (it's not like I show it off either) and highly against it.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother actually noticed it was an LGBT film (when I showed her the advert I hoped she wouldn't notice because her first language isn't English, but she did 🙄), and literally said she's worried about them influencing me, which completely disproves her trusting me. But yeah she's very homophobic. I had to lie to her and convince her it's nothing to do with LGBT stuff (""you read it wrong, every company does pro-LGBT stuff nowadays it doesn't mean anything"") because she was getting so stressed, and it deeply stresses me out too when they're stressed, I try to avoid it and tell myself they're being irrational but that just doesn't work, I'm emotionally bound to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on going regardless of whether I have their permission but I don't think they know that yet. I really think me telling them about this and being so defiant about it is the scariest thing I've ever done. But I'm sick of being lonely, and I'm sick of feeling like I'm not free. I wish I believed in a god or something so I could pray.

I have posted here the last few days and been talking about how  years sober and so pumped about it, but tonight I really want to talk to people and answer questions if I can. I love talking about my issues and talking to people about their issues and I absolutely love trying to have open discussions about what we struggle with collectively.

I think its so important to have an open conversation about mental health to show others that we are Not Alone. That has been a really big focus of mine for the past years and a half.

I struggle with anxiety, depression, seasonal affective disorder, and ADHD and am hoping to have my largest conversation yet tonight if everyone could tune in with me (: you can click my link and follow but the most important thing you could do is just **set a reminder to come watch tonight at 6:00 EST**

I try hard to stay afloat and work as hard as I can towards my projects. But research is not an easy road. I go through a hundred emotions everyday.. often feel burnt out, or sometimes really cheerful and productive.. and then there are days when I also feel like I am being exploited by my advisor.. it's all mentally-exhausting; the work and the overwhelming emotions that wash over me everyday.

I am trying hard to stay focussed on my goal, on my ""why"" but it's tough to not be able to depend on anyone for some emotional support. I don't want to bother my family with these issues of mine.

I feel lonely in a big, bad world that's out there to get me, never cooperate with me, use me to its advantage and leave me heartbroken with failure. Sure, who doesn't face challenges in their life?

I've been involved with a guy who is 35 years older (5 ft 3, 22 stone with a 46' waist) than me since I was 16, the day after my 18th birthday we got married and I moved in with him. The guy is/was my dad's best friend, my dad wasn't particularly happy about us but  accepted it (they are both now passed away)



We are in a full time 'owner / slave' relationship, he being the 'owner'. We are heavily into BDSM and he likes to let his mates use me as / when they want. The trouble is he is also my line manager at work, so for all purposes he is 'the boss' at all times. 

He is quite a demanding sexual partner, often having sex 3/4 times a day and me giving multiple blowjobs (usually at work under his desk - I don't mind this at all) 

However there have been a couple of instances where I've been made to feel stupid. One time he ""mistakenly"" sent a video of me around the work WhatsApp group. (I was tied to a fence post been fucked by 5 men, then I knelt down to swallow their 'produce' and them sodomised by a baseball bat - all consensual) but it made me feel about 2"" tall.

Thier have been a couple of instances where I've been tied up and been fucked by his mates, one of them being the cleaner at work who went around on the Monday after it happened showing everyone the video and showing off, again the sex / video was concesensual.

I now feel completely under his control, I've spoken about him backing down but he won't have it.

im 23 and will soon be 24 and havent done anything with my life or have any friends. i was severely abused and isolated as a child up until i turned 18, and as a result i have multiple disorders, and even though its been many years since ive been abused or mistreated, im still too scared to go outside on my own, too scared to eat without permission, and just terrified of everyone and everything in general.

Its taken a really really long time just to summon up the courage to make comments on the internet, or let myself have any fun with anything at all, but im still too timid to do something as simple as play a online game with others, so even though i have all the people in the world to talk to on the internet, i feel just as alone as i did as a child. it sort of feels like nothings actually changed.

after 5 years with very little progress in my recovery im starting to doubt ill ever be normal. i cant relate to anyone i meet, everyone seems so distant, like theyre from another world. ill never know what its like to be able to go to highschool, to have a career im passionate in, theres decades of movies/pop culture refrences i will never understand that everyone else knows. im just out of the loop.  and on top of all this im gay, which just alienates me from others further.

I’ve been experiencing these thoughts again, starting two months ago, when I basically changed everything big on my life (not on me, things just happened). It made me feel lonely everywhere, specially because one of these changes was a break up with my SO, who was just as lonely as me and totally understood me.

1346,hamartiated,1568254089,5,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26, guy, Europe - Clean audio chat - Looking for online friend, who needs regular conversation and emotional support - Depression, anxiety, arts, books, philosophy, music",2019-09-12 12:08:09
1347,Flyingpressure,1568252633,39,"Ok so I just want to vent and mostly I wanna know if anyone else is in my situation or can relate.

I've never had a really good friend in real life. Not a single one. by really good, I simply mean the *high standard* of wanting someone dependable. Someone to be kind to me today, tomorrow and in the future, and just be a good person in general. I've just never really met anything like that. I don't know why it seems I'm the one that's cursed. I can look on FB and find any number of people, photos either alone or with friends and a high number of reacts. It seems everyone else in the world can find a friend next door, meanwhile I'm left waiting for just one person in the world to show an interest. I did suffer from social anxiety disorder for the first 21 years of my life and overcame it through ccbt in my 22 year. After that I thought ""Ok this is it. I will finally have friends, a girlfriend, and have a social life."" Well, apparently I was too expectant as I can say 4 years after that that I have absolutely no one still.

I do have 5 good online friends. I added them through FB and chat with them on messenger. I thought this was really good at the time. I could keep in contact with these people and keep the idea in my head that people can like me and be friendly with me. However, it's been a year since I've known them and things are still the same for me. It kind of encourage me to think, ""Oh this is all I'm going to get."" I mean I love them but I obviously need physical people to touch/talk to/ have a life with.

My 5 online friends really are the best people I've ever met in my entire life. There's no question that their treatment of me greatly eclipses that of even my family, though that's not a particular feat. They are online and live on different continents than me, so it's not like I can ever feasibly see them. We all speak english (to varying degrees and the differences between them are so cute), so that's how we communicate. Thank god english is the most common language in the world.

I had two ""friends"" in high school. However I haven't heard from them in x years so I definitely wouldn't claim them as anything. I would only claim real friendships that last and make an effort. This was not that obviously.

Even at my last job, I tried making friends. It was a factory and it seemed everyone was having sex with each other, and I'm just over here, sexual and emotional needs left unmet. I don't know why I'm so different. I really don't but there seems to be something there. It wasn't just that job either, every job seemed to go that way. I always meet everyone with the same amount of respect until they give me a reason not to. I'm friendly and cordial to people and it just seems to get no results for me. And it does seem to be a particular problem with *me*, as I understand others can do that and make friends easily.

I use an online dating app and maybe get responses from &lt;10% of the people I start a conversation with. And nothing has ever come of those responses. I really don't know what turns girls off about me, but the data seems to imply that girls in general do not see me as a sexual or emotional partner, or even as a friend. What a life right. I'd honestly rather be dead than accept that as its something I don't wanna keep living without. I know sample size is important but I really don't see any girl taking an interest in me for any reason. It shouldn't be this hard for a girl to think about giving me a chance.

As for who I am, well, I'm a fairly laid back person. I am a gamer, which I used to have shame about but now I realize its a totally common hobby (even among girls) so it can definitely be used as a point of mutual interest. I am fairly well kept. I keep a normal haircut, shave off my terrible cheek hair and well trim my chin hair. Slightly chubby but not obese. Overall I'd give myself a 4/10 but that's hardly a bad score and shouldn't factor in to making a friend or having a girlfriend. 

So tell me guys. Whats up. Even tell me how I come across in my text. I am being completely honest and 100% real. I had hoped somebody would appreciate that, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Let me know.. really anything. Idk I'm just kinda done with the whole thing. I really don't see a person being friendly to me irl of their own free will.",lonely,"25M here, have never had a real friend irl",2019-09-12 11:43:53

1366,Madkatruss,1568228828,9,"Being a single newly out lesbian has brought me more mental health issues than I anticipated. Literally nobody close to me believes I’m gay which makes me start to question my sexuality again. I have a small dating pool which makes me more likely to be rejected, and the more I get rejected, the smaller my dating pool gets. My first lesbian dating situation was traumatic and I got abandoned. And then things like what’s in the title happens.

So I met G in February and we hit it off. We were both total nerds. Then one day out of the blue she hit me with “I’m just not ready for a relationship.” So I cried some. Then I met J in May (uses they/them pronouns). I had a crush on them before we matched on tinder. After we matched we talked all summer long. Then two weeks ago I get the same kind of text G sent me. Not interested in a relationship, “I got trauma”, etc. J and I hung out anyway the next day. And I message G casually about it because J mentioned her to me. And she said she and J were dating, that she spent three weeks at their house over the summer, and that they’ve been on multiple dates. G said they weren’t exclusive. But I was still jealous because they got to do things together I could only DREAM of doing with another woman. I brought this up to J. J said they were just “wanting to be gay with other women”. And I thought, “you know what? Screw relationships. I just really want to have sex to fill this void and feel like someone wants me.” So I told J I wanted to have sex, and they agreed to it. Texted them three days ago asking what day they wanted to do it. No response which means J and G are most likely exclusive now. Ghosted. Unwanted. Untouchable.

Yet here I am once again, finding myself blocked and ghosted by the last person in the world I might have considered a friend. And it wasn't some one time, small-term thing. I'd known her for months now, and she said she'd always be my friend. She knew about my issues and problems, and we even had plans for this week...yet I'm still here, and I don't even know what I did wrong.

Just a complete, out of the blue, blocking. And so now I'm alone, without anyone, as I deserve.

And this isn't me trying to spew bile her way, she was a wonderful person for even trying with me but I knew this had to come, it was inevitable. No matter how close I think I've gotten to someone, it's only a matter of time before I'm ignored or shunted off or directly told to go away. I've never blamed anyone for that.

I have nothing but appreciation and understanding that they want to say good riddance to bad rubbish, but that doesn't mean it doesn't still hurt.

It always hurts to know that no matter how close I think I am with someone, I'm just disposable. I'm a burden and a responsibility rather than someone anyone wants to know.

I don't think I am, but I must be. I must be so disgusting that I can't even process what's wrong with me if someone I was close to would desert me over what seems like absolutely nothing to me.

I don't get invited out because I don't drink. I like that they're respecting my decision but fuck can't I just come and drink juice with you guys.

My closest friend lives in another state, my home state, and she isn't sober either, so our conversations are rare, every couple of weeks I get one long message from her, but they're always good, yet I always see her active on facebook talking to people back home and it hurts knowing she just doesn't have time to talk to me, I wonder if she even thinks about me.

I can't get a date and I'm pretty sure it's 90% because of my face and 10% because I don't drink.

I can't stand being around my housemate who is home nearly 24/7 and is definitely a narcissist/on the spectrum/has ocd so I just stay in my room and only try and talk to her when I have to, and usually using the ""grey rock"" method. I know this sounds kinda mean but I've tried to have some kind of friendship with her, but she's a real piece of work.

I just wonder if this is all my fault though, I wonder if I'm subconsciously pushing myself away from people.

I loved that she made the first move towards a friendship by trying to help me with studies, it is just that I was wondering all these months whether or not all these little touches meant something. I figured now that they meant nothing and I was having false hope.

I asked her and she said that she isn't a relationship and wants to keep things friendly as of now. Which is fine by me. I just wish I would have known earlier, because then I would have saved myself from all these hopes and thoughts. To be honest it wasn't that bad, it was even kind of motivating but you know, I always feel pathetic afterwards, that is why I wish I would have known earlier because then I would have been more careful to not accidentally touch each other and things like that.

Studying together was very nice though and maybe we will keep going next semester, I don't know yet.

Good thing is, that I now know that we are nothing more than study partners which is ok.

Okay so, I started talking to this dude on tinder, he seemed pretty cool and stuff, we sent each other memes, very nice. Yesterday we were supposed to meet for the first time irl. I suggested a live music event at this very nice place (talented students from the local university playing swing and jazz). The meeting was set at 7pm. I text him at 6pm, if he'll be there, didn't respond. Okay, guess he doesn't have mobile data or no wifi. I seated myself at 7pm as was agreed. Wait till 8pm, okay, still no text, already drank my wine. Fuck this I'm leaving. I get on my bus home, 8:40pm, he texts me. He forgot, he had so much stuff to do. (We texted that morning btw, he said he forgot it was today, we laugh about it, I get it, he's got stuff to do, all cool.)  I text him that it was really nice, they played beautifully, the wine was great. Didn't respond to that. I guess from the morning he said what he said I knew in my head he wouldn't come, but I have these demons in my head all the time so I tried to not be so pessimistic, but again, my gut was right. And also I asked him two days prior that I know he has alot of work and if he wanted to reschedule to another day, maybe saturday or something, he said no, that he wanted to see me so much and couldn't wait any longer. What a bunch of bullshit lmao.

This of course is not the first time something liek this happened to me, yet I keep on doing it anyway.

 Got a second job, on a call  center, shit pay, short work schedule, had to make phone political surveys, didn't mind that much, met some nice people there, made my first friends on the country after about 6 months of isolation, met my first girlfriend, lost my virginity, started university after 4 years of failin on my original country, left the call center, been searching for a job ever since, my symptoms worsened, can't excersise, all the friends I made kinda drifted appart from each other, found out yesterday my gf cheated on me and is possibly pregnant, I have no money, have no friends, made one of the worst things i could do and looked up my symptoms on google, all roads lead to cancer for some freaking reason. Now I'm stuck in my appartment with little to no money, depressed, lonely, feeling betrayed, feeling ill, anxious if what i looked on google turned out to be true, I can't focus on my studies since all i can think about are my health issues and  don't know what to do.

1392,KenjiBenjii,1568184281,1,"Why is this happening? I just want it to let up just a little.

I had a really deep and personal conversation with one of my friends last week about a few things. Somehow it boiled down to her saying that us being physically close is just too much. Being a guy that expresses affection through physical touch, I... didn't know how to feel at first. She didn't have a problem with it for a good while now, and I have no idea where this came from.

Since then, whenever we hang out I always have the urge to pat her on the shoulder or something, but now I have to pinch my hand with the other in order to stop myself. The fact that I have tk even do that now just hurts so much. I can't bring myself to be near her anymore, either. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it breaks my heart a little.

We don't have conversations like we used to. I usually tried to initiate the conversations, and she would too, on occasion. Eventually, I just stopped initiating and she never tried, so I stopped trying, too.

Why is it that if I say something, she doesn't respond, but if my other friend says the exact same thing, she's absolutely elated? And no, she's not into the guy because she already has a boyfriend. But geez... what I would give to be that friend again...

1411,cough182,1568168437,1,"Hey guys, I came to ask a question. As could be expected, I don’t really have any friends in my life, but I do have acquaintances I guess? Like people that live in my dorm, fellow club members or classmates, etc. They all seem to like me whenever we’re around each other, they laugh at my jokes and don’t seem to mind including me. But they never explicitly invite me or ever try to contact me outside of those specific circumstances we usually see each other. 

If I overhear plans being made and ask if I can join, they’re all fine. But I feel like I can’t keep doing that forever - if they wanted me around, they’d ask, right? For example: I see this one group that I play board games and watch movies with, in communal areas of my dorm together quite often, doing these things without me. Before, I would come in and say hi and maybe chat while they played and get dealt into the next round. But the last few times I’ve seen them, I’ve just gone back to my room after saying hi and no one seemed to mind or ask me to stay. They certainly didn’t invite me when they were assembling to play/watch the movie in the first place either. 

I spent so much of middle/high school isolating myself and being told to just put myself out there. But after doing that for a full school year going onto the second, and making no real connections, I’m worried that I’m just annoying them but nobody wants to say anything. What other explanation could there be, yknow? I definitely feel like I’ve tried my very best to establish friendships and no one else has reciprocated. My question is: is it right for me to stop trying? It’s been long enough, if they wanted to get to know me they would have done so by now. It can’t be healthy to keep at it, right? 

Do any of you have any suggestions or insights on things I’m doing wrong? Do I just give up with these people and just try different clubs or something? I want so, so badly to not be lonely anymore. It’s just exhausting to keep trying over and over with no results.",lonely,How to know if/when to stop trying?,2019-09-11 12:20:37

Well I have one at work but it has the similar problem I have with every other person I try to be friends with. It all seems one-sided. I ask questions, I initiate conversations and I get nothing in return.

And while I am not normal, I don't think I am being creepy or anything like that, I ask random things like: How they are doing, how was the weekend, what they do for fun and it's them answering and that's it. Never ask me stuff like that.

I am not kidding when I say I have no had someone SMS me first in about 5 years. It's either me initiating it or nothing.

1413,LRN_Trickster,1568166195,5,"I may be alone, but I love to listen and I love to put my experiences into words. I think people pick up on this willingness and share their stories with me. I hear about a lot of things, but nine out of ten times I hear about bad relationships. Since we’re being honest about ourselves here, early on I would selfishly think about myself when I heard stories of these wonderful women with terrible, abusive men. “Serves them right for choosing shitty men.” Yeah, that was me. Not something I would readily admit to people who were used to a life of the love and support of a spouse or mate.

Later, as my life grew colder and colder (but my curiosity and love of stories only swelled) I would compare myself unfavorably to the monsters in the stories I was told. “I must be truly vile if women would chose these fucking nightmares over me.” I would often think about the Browning line:

“I never saw a brute I hated so. He must be wicked to deserve such pain.”

Nonetheless, maybe following some perverse, masochistic instinct to rip open my own wounds, I would gladly hear about the wounds of others. The suffering of others was merely a matter of empirical record that proved the world was broken. I was just another broken thing in it.

It was only five years back or so that I finally heard a story that got me out of my own disgustingly selfish mind. The story I was told first ended in blood. It was bad, for sure, but I pretended to empathize and wondered to myself sarcastically how long it would take the victim to offer herself back up to the beast. I had my answer in a few more weeks. The story ended with both the beast and the victim dead. I couldn’t bring myself to put myself up on the cross and weep for my own life when another life (a very promising one, from all I’d been told) was gone like the feelings of smug superiority that I used to feel. I was not some kind of better person walking a lone path of observation. I was a shitty guy that was soothed by the knowledge that someone was getting fucked up by life more than me.

Kinda more a confessional than my normal uplifting stuff. I’ll bet some of you will understand, though. Some of you will judge me harshly and be right to do so. 

Being alone, man, it’s like a slow burning acid. You look back and can see the scars it traces across your soul. As mangled as it has made me, I won’t let it make me cruel anymore. Life isn’t about what anyone deserves. I stopped pretending that someone or something was to blame for my lonely fate. I stopped fantasizing about a warm smile or the touch of a caring hand.

I feel like no one is attracted to me. I haven’t kissed anyone at all and all I see around me are people in relationships. I’m not too hopeful about my future either. Honestly, I think I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life. I haven’t had anyone as a girlfriend thus far and that’s probably foreshadowing things to come. If I don’t have a girlfriend now, if no one is attracted to me now, that seems like a sign that I’m going to be alone forever, if we’re following patterns.

I can’t deal with this at all.  I can’t cope with this. The only way out right now seems to be self harm, just to release all the pain. It feels like a bug inside of me and I just need to take it out.

Posting for the first time, and doing so for getting it out of my head, since there is none who would listen to me.
I'm 23, have a degree, have worked for an year, left the job and now applying for a Masters Degree. My family is amazing and they are amazing people to be with.

People have tried to approach me, but i become defensive even if someone is trying to get to know me. I've tried to make friends but again, its very hard for me to keep relations up. I don't have a Girlfriend (sorry i did not mention i'm a guy), so i don't have someone to talk about my innermost feelings too. As i mentioned, i do have an amazing family but i'm not close to them as a person. Only recently have i started to open up with my sister, but i don't want to open the flood gates of emotions on her. Its not her baggage to handle. I just want to solve my life right now asap. I'm still trying but sometimes I still do feel like i'm a robot and do not deserve to be with people. Any advice, stories or even some chatting is appreciated.

Some Instagram post once told me, when life is not going good for you, cheer others on, you'll be satisfied at least you could help someone.

I am struggling majorly with an on going feeling of not only feeling alone and pure loneliness but just feeling really worthless and sh*t about myself. 

I have tried to rebuild myself from very traumatic events as a child (abuse, violence, parent suicide and being in care) however as soon as I get to a good place I’m just knocked back and it reminds me of how much work I truly have to do. 

I keep attracting sh*t people who continue to fuck me over and whom I will never be a priority or good option to even though I pour my heart and soul into friendships and truly take care of people. 

I have been single two years but because I feel so ugly and unhappy with my appearance I keep holding onto an old toxic relationship because I feel it is all I deserve.

I started to think the problem was me. But I have never shared this with anyone including ‘friends’ I am always walked over Or the back up plan, I lend money and items far to often with no return - not for gain or respect but I’ve had nothing before and wouldn’t want someone to endure that pain. I give mental and emotional support constantly. 

I understand I will attract crap people because of my insecurities.

I am fed up of feeling like this. I feel I am incapable of making friends because no one cares enough to want to be my friend and I am incapable of love because I hate myself and everyone leaves me or neglected me.

Please please can someone tell me how I can heal as I have no one to speak to

I transferred schools in Year 6, and while I was successful in befriending new people - they were also the first people I noticed looked at me strangely. Whenever I spoke, they’d say something like “that’s so deep” “that’s really weird” “I don’t get it”. That has continued steadily ever since.

I’m quite intellectual, and do well academically - but don’t feel comfortable saying I’m really intelligent or anything, because (although I don’t know my IQ) I suspect I would only be very slightly above average.

It’s like I’m in a plane - thinking and creating and analysing, surrounded by stars and clouds in the sky. While I can enjoy the feeling of flying through the air, I don’t know how to land the plane. I don’t know how to not feel like I just landed a UFO when I talk to people.

I feel misunderstood most of the time, I have to explain myself all the time, people don’t “get” me, they find me difficult to read. It sucks.

I have good friends, but I can’t have the depth of conversation I would like. It feels like I’m always tense or nervous. 

It seems as if no one cares. People accuse me of being cold/not caring all the time because I’m somewhat aloof and not very emotional expressive (but I really try to be open when people let me), yet they’re more self-absorbed than me.

I don’t tell my friends about the darker parts of my childhood because they never understand it (just to preface that I’m in high school, so everyone’s very young and naive) and it’s hurtful.

I’m tired of understanding everything but never being understood - despite my extraneous efforts to reach out to people, learn about them, etc.

I was very socially anxious, and since I have autism I had a lot of trouble making new friends. Going to college scared me to death. I used to spend all my time at home and crying myself to sleep. Every time I would try to make friends they’d think I’m weird or they’d reject me. Now I live in a student home with amazing roommates that I am good friends with. I have a massive cirkle of friends and people that really care about me. I go on dates and go to festivals and things are better than I ever thought they could be. I am in artschool and all the people there are great.

The thing that really changed; I stopped giving a damn about what a failure I was and I started challenging myself. I would go out all by myself and try to talk to people. I learned to show interest in people and I also learned to be myself and not let people walk over me. I quit a long relationship with a narcissistic boyfriend that treated me like shit, which made me realise my self worth. I learned to stand up for myself, to be there, I learned when to do it and when to back off. 
Most of all I think I found my passion, you are more interesting to others if you know what you like and are proud of it. You should always dare to challenge yourself, go further, grow as a person. And you can. I went from a lonely depressed socially anxious weirdo to an outgoing happy passionate weirdo in just a few years. Give yourself some time, stop being your own worst enemy. You have yourself, even if you have no other friends. Be your own friend. Learn, grow, and find that you actually will get better. Keep holding on everyone, keep growing.

1447,Imthatguy0029,1568130347,3,"There's something I want to say in which words can not fully grasp, but I'll give it my best shot.

Have you ever been in or watched a conversation whether it be a light day-to-day banter, or a heavy philosophical discussion, and somehow the state of the world pops up. Overwhelming issues like corruption, poverty, global warming, violence, working jobs endlessly without progress, etc. You'll often hear the words ""The world is going to shit"" followed by sad eyes pushing this idea to the back of their mind. Many people seem to have lost hope, feeling that there is nothing they could do.

I personally don't believe the world is going to be destroyed by humanity or anything like that anytime soon, or that there is little we can do about these humongous, overwhelming problems. I firmly believe that a single person can make a bigger difference than anyone else I've talked to seems to really believe. I mean, consider this: our lives have wrapped around technology like the internet and cars so much so that we are forced to use them everyday, whether we want to or not. Yet, at some point in time these inventions would've been considered magic, or impossible. Imagine what's yet to come, and ask yourself what does it take to create such a world changing invention or idea? A single person. So it's been done before, and this is just one example among many.

Everyone does what they do for a reason. All the environment they grew up in leads up to their choices, whether it seems good or bad. Naturally though, I think people are good. There are things everyone and everything does that seem to oppose logic and nature. Ever heard of the cases in the wild where animals take up young from another species? Where's the logic in that? It seems like there's something in our basic instincts that give us morality, that make each and everyone of us naturally good people. It's our environment and perspectives that make some people do bad things or seem bad.

What I'm trying to get at here is I believe almost everyone is a good person, and that you all deserve better. I've been dedicating my life towards reinstilling that hope for the world into people's eyes by trying to make a difference myself, as big a difference as I can imagine as an inventor and aerospace engineer. I'll try to prove a single person's power to everyone. If nothing else, it's worth a shot to try. You deserve it. I've just been trudging through college so far, but it's been a slow and especially lonely process. One day, maybe I can make you all feel at least a little better. Til then I guess. Sorry if this is the wrong place to say this all, but you're really the only ones I have to talk to right now. I wish you all the best.

Im currently unemployed and that is my main goal but its the downtime between looking for jobs that i feel my worst. 

I'm on tinder (it seems to be the only way to talk to local people) and speak to a few people on there, i get the odd date here and there but nothing more then a one off and im cool with that, no one owes me their friendship and time or anything so I just try and enjoy the time i do have speaking to these people.

My last date was about 3 months ago and tbh, ive barely left the house since. I live in a rural area with my family. I dont go out much because lack of money. I havent really spoke to anyone outside my family in that time unless they work in a shop.

I dont really have interests, i love music, gaming, tv and movies but who doesnt? I live in a university town in the south east of kent so everyone is either younger then me or older with a career/job or at least, ambitions.. 

How do you start a conversation with someone if you have no money, no interests and live in the middle of nowhere.
I cant visit pubs or clubs as i dont drink because of my alcoholic father and the ""upbringing"" he gave us so that isnt an option.

1455,xenith000,1568120914,4,"Hi everyone. 

So I’m not going to bore everyone with the details of why I’m lonely or what has brought me to this point, I just want to share the feelings I’ve been experiencing lately. 

I’m slowly recovering from habitual marijuana use after about a decade of using the substance on a daily basis to try to escape the loneliness that was always there, even before I started smoking, and is now even more prevalent. 

I was always bullied in n school right from first grade all the way to graduation. I remember the time I went on school tour thinking it was going to be fun only to be made fun of throughout the entire trip. They would tease the way I spoke, my hobbies and passions (especially since I was a big movie buff back then), my clothes, even my brother they called names and insulted which still pisses me off to this day. And there’s nothing I can do about it.

I did have some friends throughout my school years but I’ve never had a “best friend” or anything like that. After I left school and started using drugs the only people I knew were ones who wanted to use me for the drugs I supplied them with, and not for me as a person. Since then I’ve made no new friends, let alone a single one who would appreciate me for who I am. 

After a long series of events that have taken place over the past 3 years, I woke up yesterday and realized that I have NOBODY. Even my parents look down on me and criticize my shortcomings. No friends, no job, no social life either in any way whatsoever. Basically im a hermit who can’t even muster up the energy that get out and go to the gym. Women look at me with pity in their eyes if they look at me at all, and pretty much I’m totally invisible to the world. 

Now the fact that the world doesn’t accept me is fine. I can deal with it even if it’s not the optimal situation to be in. The real issue is the physical pain I feel when I want to fit my in, to have a cool and fun group of friends, to have a girl in my life alongside whom I can share and create in the beauty of life together. 

It’s a pain that runs so deep I can feel it in my bones, the pit of my stomach, everywhere. I struggle at night the most. Violent outbursts of crying and shaking  in the early hours of the morning keeping me from getting sleep which impacts my mood the next day, which then feeds into my loneliness. It’s like a vicious cycle that I can’t escape from. 

In fact this loneliness may just be the most pain I’ve ever felt. And I am at rock bottom in every way other than I still have a roof over my head. 

But yeah, loneliness sucks and it runs far deeper than I ever could have imagined.",lonely,The pain of loneliness.,2019-09-10 23:08:34

But when EVERYONE moves on, it's like a knife to the gut. Summer of 2018 was my lowest point. I didnt speak to a single person outside my family for all of it. Not because I didnt want to, but because every friend I had either moved away or simply decided they didnt want to talk to me anymore.

Flash forwards to now. I start college and meet some genuinelly great people. For the first four months i mainly keep to myself as I'm a really shy guy but over time I really grew attached to these people. I only have about three or four friends, but that's enough me.

But then what I thought was my closest friend tells me shes going to America one day to go to university. At first it didnt hit me, but it slowly grew on me. Not even two years from now she'll be gone and I wont see her again. She probably wont even remember me. (Side note, I considered her my best friend but apparently I'm her 6th best friend. I mean fair enough. I mean I dont even like myself that much so i dont know why I thought anyone else would haha.)

At least I have the others right? Nope. After asking people about their futures I realise just about everyone plans to move on to someplace else.

 It wouldn't even be that bad if I had just ONE friend who stuck around. One friend for life that likes me as a person just as much as I like them. I am perfectly fine with spending my entire life single as long as I have just ONE close friend.

 But nope. All the people sticking around merely tolerate me. One year from now I'll be alone again, except this time for a lot longer than just a summer as I wont have the excuse of going to a place of education to make new friends. Knowing I'm going to be alone, makes me already feel alone.

*I also have a bit of a passion for writing, so preemptive apologies if this comes out too long, lol. Not sure if those are cool around here...*

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, me (35M) and a girl (22F) met/matched on a dating app that caters to...let's say fetish-oriented lifestyles. So right off the bat we had that pseudo-physical connection that Tinder-like apps provide and also very similar and compatible lifestyle interests. Only thing is....we learned we live 200 miles apart. In Florida. *Thanks app!*

Fast forward about 2 weeks, and we had sort of grown into snapping and texting each other steadily throughout the day, every day, and talking over the phone for hours each night until bed -- lots of NSFW stuff, but also lots of ""normal"" conversations that we bonded over. (Important to note that neither of us pushed for this... *it just happened*, as it does.)  
So, about a week ago we had hardcore planned and committed to a date for *this coming weekend* in a city that's a mutual distance away from each other (\~150 miles away), where we would rent an Airbnb downtown and just chill, explore the city, and have fun together. It was her idea, but I paid for the whole thing already. Annnnd I'm pretty sure you can see where this is going by now...

This morning she broke the routine we became comfortable with and basically told me that she can't do this and doesn't want this to go any further, stating that she feels mad turned off and uncomfortable meeting up now -- I assume because she's scared that we might catch feelings...? When we first started talking she made it abundantly clear that she only wanted to have fun and explore her sexuality with me, which I'm fine with (for now? idk), but I'm also acutely aware that I can be quite intense, so I also encouraged her to think about and pick a safe word for when she feels things are getting too emotionally intense for her (*which she never decided on until today -- and still hasn't actually used*).

**tl;dr**, *long-distance match* turns into *almost-long-distance something else* (I guess?) and then girl breaks it off after date/meetup was planned, agreed, and committed to, and paid for, because...she's afraid of what emotions she might feel? Idk. I'm confused as fuck and trying really fucking hard to not let it get to me or take it too personally, but wtf... how can I not feel hurt by this?

1473,GalacticWolf87,1568091352,5,"I moved to Tucson ~2 years ago. I moved into a 2 bedroom trailer home in my families property. My dad, my grandpa, my aunt and a couple cousins around my age (late 20s/early 30s) all live in the property in separate houses. I moved originally with my best friend, but half a year in he had to go back home to take care of his grandma. I’ve been in and out of a shitty relationship in between. Anyways recently I’ve felt really isolated and lonely. My female cousin I hang out had a different schedule so we don’t hang out as much and she’s going through some emotional stuff too, my two friends (who are married) have been doing their own thing, so I basically don’t interact with people that much except at work. I don’t have any go to friends, even my cousin were aren’t supppperr close. It just feels weird. To make things worse my best friend met a guy awhile back who he’s friends with benefits with but also has formed a friendship with and who hangs out with all the time. Since this has happened he has started talking to me less and less or when we do talk I get one word answers. I’m not into confrontation and he’s one not take things the best, he just gets upset. But I tried mentioning just if he was okay, was there something I did that’s been bothering him and that’s why he’s distancing himself but he said everything was good but didn’t really explain why he’s been distant. It made me feel really sad because I only have one best friend and I’m not close with anyone here enough to really go to to talk about these feelings because he was the person I’d go to. We’ve been best friends for over 10 years, super close, he’s like my soul mate (he’s gay so not a in love kind of situation). It just seems since he’s moved back we’ve been slowly falling out. It sucks. It sucks because I don’t really have close friends out here. My cousin and two married friends are more like close acquaintances. 
This is also the longest I’ve been single. Once I got passed a shitty relationship a year ago I haven’t dated since, I’m on dating sites because I don’t go out much and it’s been discouraging. I go back and forth between me feeling like “what if I’m placing the bar to high” and “no I shouldn’t settle if I don’t have enough attraction to this person to date them”. It’s been very depressing dating wise.

It’s all kind of hard because I’m from Los Angeles and had A LOT of friends in LA. I had guys I would date, I had fuck buddies, I had family and my best friend. To barely being friends with two people who aren’t related to me. 

With all this said I’m trying to flip this. I’m trying to think that if I can get through this, if I can make peace with isolation and this loneliness it’ll make me a stronger better person. That it’s okay to potentially be single you’re whole life. That I might never find a partner. But it’s okay. That I might live this lonely life. 

It’s scary as fuck to think all this but I’m trying to make peace with it.

Interests.  I love music.  I go to a lot of concerts.  I watch sports: baseball, basketball, football.  I like intellectual stuff; I'm a fan of the Joe Rogan podcast, which I consider somewhat intellectual.  I have minor chronic injuries that keep me from doing sports, but I like walking around and discovering new places.  I go to meetups like Tech in Motion.  I used to play 2K but I no longer have a playstation.

I recently got a therapist who has been helpful in spicing up my lifestyle.  So I have some ideas.  But I could use more.

Suggestions I've gotten so far are

* sports bars - doesn't seem like my thing; I don't drink or anything
* [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) \- I haven't had much luck with it
* hang out with work friends - I have a small office
* religious community - I'm not religious
* volunteering - I don't know what to do.  Most of the opportunities I've considered don't seem like they'd introduce me to interesting people.  For example, I could be a ""Big Brother"" or serve soup at a kitchen but I wouldn't meet anyone like me (my age).  So I'm not interested in any of the volunteering opportunities I've considered.

Maybe it’s technology. But I feel like because it’s being normalized to be depressed/lonely it’s less common for people to reach out to each other. Because they think “yeah that’s normal for that age”, or “that time in your life”.  Or just “same”.

I’m scared of loosing people. As soon as I genuinely connect with someone I want to cling to them 24/7. I see them as sand falling through my fingers.

This makes me want to know nobody. I push people away which only makes my fears of loneliness worse.

I want to be in a busy area to feel alive. Otherwise I feel almost non existent.

I care sm about everyone. The only thing that brings me true happiness is seeing strangers of people I love genuinely happy.

I’m too over emotional, weak and sensitive for the world .

This is my first post here and I'm kind of new to reddit but I wanted to share a project I've been working on in the dating field.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a podcast called The Dating Is Hard Podcast. The purpose of the podcast is to get people from all walks of life to come on and share their stories and theories about dating. How do I meet my guests? I created profiles on dating apps that said I'd like to have people on the podcast who have entertaining stories and theories about dating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel good about it so far and think there are some valuable lessons and entertaining stories on there. I hope you guys enjoy. I've linked to the podcasts below.

1500,xXJakeKeyXx,1568062413,18,"Hey everyone I am a first time poster.  So here's the backstory.

Growing up I was from a broken home.  I was the middle child. I had a father who drank and a mother who was with a man who lets just say...hated me.  Growing up my family never celebrated my birthday really. I know I had some as a baby because I saw a video of one and I think one year my mom cooked dinner for it but didn't even make something I remotely liked to eat.  Most my extended family never remembered my birthday though they always seemed to do stuff for my brother and sisters.  So to say the least I grew up going to people's birthdays and never knew what it was like to actually have one for me.

Flash forward to my 21st birthday when I was in college.  I decided 21 was a big deal that I'd finally try to do something for it.  Invited a bunch of friends over for a ton of alcohol and food.  And nobody showed up after all telling me I should do something and saying they would be there.  They all decided to go to another friends place for a ""going away party"" for which he'd be back in literally like a month.  That moment tore me to shreds and after that I figured I just wasn't supposed to be important to anyone.
Flash forward yet again to now.  I just turned 30 years old.  I have new friends at this point and we have all been super close.  Also a side note I am a man who's friend group is largely made up of women (just the kind of jobs I have I don't meet many men to hangout with).  After telling them all about how I had never had a birthday they all pretty much insisted I do something because 30 is a big mile marker.  After convincing I decided I'd give it one more go.  I spent all this money on the alcohol and food again.  It was going to be a housewarming/birthday since I just bought my first house.  Everyone said they were coming and kept asking about it and how the house was coming as I went on a mad blitz to get as much of the work on the house done as I could to have it ready. I was up at 5 in the morning that day cleaning everything up and buying the last few things I needed.

I was so sure this time would be different you guys.  The time came and one person showed up.  One other person messaged me and said they were sick and couldn't make it (which I found out at work two days later was a lie but hey at least they had the balls to message me) and everybody else just decided they weren't going to show up.

The rest is another story completely but this is just the icing on the cake (you know, the birthday cake I've never once had).  You guys I have never felt so shattered as I did in that moment when the one friend who came left and I slowly cleaned up the hoise, sat down, and drank the entire night by myself.  I've literally never felt more alone in my life that all these people who knew what this meant to me just decided I'm not worth it.  I spent all my extra money on this party and now I have to sit here and be reminded of it every day because I have to eat all this food by myself before it goes bad. And then at work two days later I had to try to keep a smile when people asked me how my birthday was. Not one person even acknowledged the fact that they just didn't show up or apologized or anything.  The funny part is I have helped as they have all thrown surprise birthday parties for each other over the past few years and everyone always showed up.  I even found out from one friend who couldn't make it (I knew beforehand she was going to be out of town) that her and the one that did show tried to do a surprise party for me and nobody else wanted to.  I honestly wish she hadn't told me because that honestly made it even worse.

I have since removed my birthday from all social media and I do not plan on ever attempting to celebrate my birthday ever again. I've gone 30 years without it....what's the point anymore.",lonely,Last shot,2019-09-10 06:53:33

1506,artlovertreehugger,1568057463,5,"there's a strange sort of comfort that comes from seeing all the posts for people articulating how i feel all the time. (the irony in feeling less alone by seeing others also feeling lonely.)

 i feel like people in my life don't ever fully get me. i've never really had long friendships. i often feel like i don't fit in with my peers and that i'm just sort of going through the motions of life. i don't care about so many things that the people around me care about. i genuinely don't give a shit about social media, material things, or what people think of me and i just feel a bit off put by the weight that others put on those things.

i also don't mean that caring about those things isn't good or that it's anything negative. i understand why people put weight on it and i can see it from their perspective, it makes sense. there's truly nothing wrong with being passionate about those things, it's just not a passion i can relate on. 

i've not had great experiences with social media, so i opt out of it which creates another layer of isolation, adding to feeling like others don't understand me. i don't get a lot of meme stuff or drama on twitter, but i just can't be bothered to care. and again i don't mean this in an unkind way, i'm just a bit numb to it and i have existential crisis' where i just want to scream because i don't think it matters. 

idk. i feel like none of this made sense, but if anyone sees this and feels similarly, it'd be nice to know.

For years now, I've been unwell, unable to work and stuck at my parent's house. I've been really stubborn with it and engaged in working whenever I've had chance. That isn't doable anymore, so recently my live-in girlfriend broke up with me, because I'm not being a ""man"". Needless to say, it hurt. 

She hasn't been in a great headspace both leading up to and following the split. And basically told me she planned on becoming a swinger with some random dude online. It nearly knocked me physically sick for various reasons. 

Since getting over the anxiety that image has conjured, I have decided I want to go out and have some fun of my own, maybe a little more beige than swinging mind... 

So I have joined a bunch of dating apps. I'm not a bad looking guy, so I do get right swipes, likes etc. But, as soon as I mention I'm ill or not working, conversation dies. I am a super honest person, so don't want to mislead anyone.

I was suicidal, went through a divorce, therapy, ghosted by several people, self-loathing, health problems, romantic rejection… I can’t talk to casual friends about these things openly. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is why she was so valuable to me. I could completely just be myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

We’d talk on the phone for hours at a time. We’d basically talk all night until we were too sleep deprived to continue. It was so easy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did all of this stuff to try to help her out. Buying stuff, making myself available, problem solving, research, you name it. I came to deeply care about her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’d continually feel horribly depressed or suicidal and talking to her would totally revitalize me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I’ve known her she’s been in a relationship. At first I thought the guy was okay, but as time went on she’d complain about him more and more. I stayed neutral, I’d give feedback but try not to meddle… but as time went on the list of red flags piled up and it became pretty clear this guy was utterly toxic. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was devastated by a failed LDR, she was the only one really there for me, and I would have been so much worse off had I been alone. Her own relationship problems reached a head and they broke up. I was proud of her, because she had finally stood up for herself against this toxic guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

She lives 6 hours away. I offered to come visit so that we could meet in person, and I could help cheer her up. It was quite spontaneous. Meeting her in person, she was exactly the same. We hung out and did a bunch of stuff. Probably spent more time sitting in my car just talking about the breakup than anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, by that time I’d fallen in love with her. I’d had feelings slowly developing for awhile. The way I treat this girl is basically the opposite of how he does, and we’d even joke about it. I confessed my feelings toward the end of my visit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I go back home. 2 days later they’re back together, after all of that drama and serious problems. She’s basically codependent. She knew how I felt, but she chose him anyway. She didn’t even consider how I’d feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her we couldn’t be friends anymore now. I told her I can’t support such an unhealthy relationship and I can’t just shut off my feelings. She took it badly. Turned on me pretty quickly. Then she started ignoring me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote her a letter explaining that regardless of what circumstance may keep us apart, she’ll always be my best friend deep down. 

&amp;#x200B;

A week or so passes and I’m near rock bottom. I consult one of my other friends, who had been in a similar emotionally abusive relationship. It messed her up really bad in her youth, and based on the description I gave confirmed that the guy is definitely bad news. 

&amp;#x200B;

That changes my perspective. I think less of my own needs and more of hers. I don’t want her to torture herself trying to force this sinking ship to float like I know she will. I want to support her no matter what choices she makes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I send an apology text and explain that I’d like to work things out. No reply.

&amp;#x200B;

Days pass, I realize I’m either being blocked or ignored. I’ve been ghosted before and it sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I send one email explaining my thoughts in full. I’m sorry for what I said, you mean a lot to me, I want to support you no matter what you do etc. I told her I’m not going to write her again if she doesn’t respond, and respect her wish to be left alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was a few days ago, and I’ve heard nothing. I can only conclude I’ve been ghosted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lost my best friend, a person I was in love with, and my primary means of support. I don’t even fully understand why. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was at least worth arguing with, or I at least had a chance to correct whatever issues I was causing. This type of ghosting situation has happened to me 4 separate times, on top of a divorce that ended poorly. I feel really hopeless and fallen back into making suicidal plans. Stuff like this really damages me deeply. Despite claims like “it gets better with time” and so forth, it really doesn’t. Stuff like this only gets better when some sort of change of circumstance takes place to make things better, I know that from experience. Time on its own just rottens things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m very lost and sad right now. I wish she would just fooking talk to me. I don’t know why I’m so disposable but it’s an ongoing trend. I miss her terribly and I’m in a lot of pain.",lonely,I’ve been ghosted again. Lost my best friend.,2019-09-09 18:33:44

And I just feel cold and indifferent at this point. I see opportunities to make friendships, to work hard to be special to someone. But I know that no matter what I do, the relationships only last so long. Friends forever isn't true. I am always alone, in the company of temporary relationships.

Soon, I realized that I would get hurt so I put on a mask and tried to blend in just to protect myself. So, truth is no one knew who I really am, ever. 

I moved out of the house and went on to college when I was 18 and I never really liked being with people. Mostly because I think I didn't want to trust anyone and also because I didn't feel connected to anyone. But, I was stubborn and fine on my own when I was young, I never thought I would feel lonely. 

Now, I am 25 years old and starting to feel like maybe I need someone to come home to or call up to hang out during a weekend. I live in isolation, I work in contracting so colleagues aren't too social and I live far. Only people I could call friends are the ones I made on the internet.

ive been through circumstances that would normally make people go insane, if not kill themselves. but thats okay, we all have different tolerances.

today, i realised i will never get the people i like back. i realised that people i help over my various accumulated aliases will never help me or consider tolerating me anymore.

everything ive done is basically for nothing. my parents would be disappointed, but thankfully never saw me properly to even consider if im this far gone.

everyone is all about ""me"". when someone nice tries to ask ""what about me"" youll get called all sorts of things. its a cycle you cannot stop. if you think you can then youre going to have to sit the whole ride to the end to realise you cant stop it, slow it maybe but you cant stop it.

in my experience, humanity is dead. any kindness is met with hostility, any hope is met with doubts and respective ""you're being stupid""s.

as for people who say ""hmu"" or ""willing to talk"", especially the ones who say ""anyone"" in their posts, please make some fucking effort to do that and not go on a ""oh shit youre not my type so ill just ghost u haha lol lmao so dumb"" act. want to leave lonely people? then say it properly, ""this is not going to work out"" or something.

humanity as a species is alive. thats the only considerable thing about it. anything else is dead. because in their opinion:

""who are you to me and why should i care when i can say what i want when i want you retarded fuck""

1547,hamartiated,1567995722,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I am a 19 year old girl, now three weeks into college life and I have never felt more alone. I’ve tried and failed at making friends, my roommate and I are on good terms but we never really talk to each other, she’s already made so many friends. 

I’ve gone to university run events and made no progress. I’ve gone to parties and still made no progress. Classes are no different. 

I find myself sitting in my dorm room alone because I have no reason to leave it, and when I do decide to leave I become overwhelmed.

My Life has been going downhill again recently, or at least the realization that it has been for quite a while just hit me. I used to have really good friends but recently it became more of a ""we know each other exist"" than a real friendship. My best friend lives a good drive away and because of my new job, I cant really make time to go over to his place. We used to play a lot of League of Legends with our mutual friend but he started really isolating himself from us, not responding in the group chat, not playing with us at all etc. I understand that he has his own problems and made a lot of new friends since he moved away, and I'm glad it worked out for him this way, but it still hurts.

 I stopped playing League actively because we just dont connect anymore, it just reminds me of the good times we had and that its basically over now. Our mutual friend still plays, which caused us to lose touch aswell. 

As I mentioned, I started a new job 2 months ago. It keeps me distracted, but I developed a pretty big crush on a colleague. She comes to shop a lot with her new BF in her free time and it just hurts every time I see them together. At home, I basically just sit around and play Video Games all the time when I have free time.

I started playing Classic WoW when it came out and had a pretty good time, found a cool guild to join etc.

But since my everyday mood went downhill again, I feel worse and worse about them because they all know eachother for a long time (coming from Live WoW together) and I just feel like a third (or more accurately sixth) wheel whenever I lurk around in our/their Teamspeak.

​

Just as the title says, this is not just depression anymore, I've experienced full on depression most of my youth and adult life, this is something totally different, this is raw detachment.

What I find interesting now, just recently my life has taken a direction that I was certain before would make a huge difference in dealing with depression, being a semi-solid circle of friends, but even still most are situational and starting a good career where as of right now I don't have to work that hard, but still it made no difference.

I wake up today, yesterday, tomorrow, feel just as dead as the week before, completely numb, but its gotten to a point where it honestly does not even bother me anymore, I play a character when I am in front of my co-workers, friends, family, no one knows me, the people that did before don't now, my personal life is a train wreck and I just fucking laugh at it, literally laugh out loud because now it just feels like an irrelevancy. I have been down the path of ""talking to professionals"" and the medication route in the past, it does not work, to be blunt.

​

I would not say I feel openly suicidal, but the thought does not bother me what so ever, life has no real purpose to me and humans in general are not met to live how we live, we aren't even really social creatures anymore.

At this point, I won't lie I have done risky shit just to try to feel something, drinking excessively, sleeping with women in relationships, reckless driving, i'm not proud of this but it doesn't really bug me either, just trying to feel anything.

​

A few months ago, I started talking to someone new (R), I really fell for her and she also felt the same, everything felt right like my life was going in the direction I wanted but this person couldn't see us as anything and loss interest in me completely to ignoring me and leaving me which is when I realized how manipulative of an asshole I am. I don't like being alone, I don't like people leaving me and the fact I had 0 chances on trying to make things work with this person, it just got out of hand and for it all, it's my fault that I know I destroyed every bit of it. As of currently, I'm trying to move forward on (R) because I know I need to, I don't deserve anything more from her but more ignorance from her because I believe thats what I deserve - I know, that sounds super negative.

Looking back at my past relationships with people which are all platonic (I've never been in a romantic relationship before), I'm so manipulative that its like a skill I desire. People have always left me by ghosting me and I can always remember the emotional distress I was in, I'm not trying to blame them for leaving but I feel thats why I've became so manipulative because like I said, I don't like people leaving me, even if they tell me why, I have a hard time accepting things and even telling myself that it's their loss isn't enough sometimes. 

There was a time I had a group of high school friends, 3 of them started ignoring me at the same time and I never knew why, then thats when my life got worse day by day, suicide thoughts leading to a suicide attempt at 16. Since that time of my life, people would come in and leave me and its been a constant problem for me for like 8 years now which again, that led me to two suicide attempts in a year (last year) :/

I know I said people ghosted me a lot and I may not know why exactly but I'm tired if I may be the reason why people leave, I'm tired if its my actions that hurt others, I just don't want to deal with people anymore, it's been too much and I just want a new personality. 

I'm glad I admitted I'm manipulative but I know that doesn't change anything to those people in my past who I became manipulative with.

I felt a little embarrassed I was alone so I just went to another group of friends who sat on the floor. I didn't talk to them, I just wanted to look like I had friends. None of them would really talk to me as well. 

During my senior year, it was time for prom. No one invited me. Then we had the senior trip where we travel to Disneyland, no one invited me. I thought to myself whatever. High school is almost over, I'll just forget about these people and get out of here. It will get better. 
I was wrong. 

The few friends I do have over online never invite me to games and I have to invite myself but I always have to start the conversation.

I am freshman in college, i have good grades, I go to a pretty good college for my major, my family is always there for me, I have friends and a handful of close ones, yet I can't help but feel lonely.

I feel like I'm always a side plate, the only texts I get are about school or that my data plan is renewing. I don't really get invited to any hangouts and I don't really like to invite myself to whatever my friends are doing. I am often ignored even when talking in person. I feel like an extra from a movie. 

I really don't like big parties or drinking, but my friends do a lot, and when i get invited to come, I either reject or end up hating it. Even though i get invited, I feel like no one is down to just chill in the dorm or have fun without drinking or going to parties to find girls/guys. Im kind of exhausted that everyone has the same mindset of partying/clubbing. I love my friends, but i cant help but feel left out.

1608,xdissapearingx,1567937224,1,"my mother is mildly irritating. she came downstairs to my () room at 4 in the morning, at first she turns on the lights and then she walks over, gets in my face and says:
 “You DiDnT CoME UpSTAIrs aT aLL yEsTERdAY. what is going on”
and i said, “i was tired”. 

flashback to yesterday when she went on a day trip with her new boyfriend and was confused why i didn’t want to come (i never want to come so i don’t know why this was surprising) and then eventually came home at 7pm, started getting wildly drunk &amp; loud and then had multiple other adult friends over, all being extremely loud &amp; drinking until 1:30 in the morning when their guests finally left and they stumbled off to bed.

as this was going on, i didn’t go upstairs once, i just didn’t want to get mixed up in that type of situation because it very quickly triggers me into a poor mood, so naturally i avoided that and just stayed in my room downstairs.

 she then preceded to say, “you’re coming out with us (her and her boyfriend) today, wherever we go. i don’t care what you say”

and considering i was literally completely sleeping just a minute before this and i’m confused as hell

i say, “what is going on right now, like what time is it”

and she goes, “it’s 4 in the fucking morning and i’m worried, i had a bad dream, ‘I’m A Mother’” - she always says this line ‘i’m a mother’ , i feel its some sort of reassurance for her

and in my head i’m just thinking, yeah you’re only a mother when things come to a complete worst.
i don’t get why she doesn’t understand that i don’t want to hangout with her and her boyfriend. both in their late 40s and she wonders why i don’t want to hangout with them and go places that do not interest me whatsoever. 
i’m an 18 year old girl, i do not want to “hangout” with you, even if you’re going to go do something that you think i would like, you could be going on a road trip &amp; hitting up lalapalooza and  naturally, i would not want to go with you. that’s just how it is

she then starts up with, “this isn’t ‘x’ town”, (we just moved from “X” town to a new town in july) 
 “you’re in college i thought you’d be making friends”

it’s honestly like she doesn’t even know me at all. 
 I NEVER BEEN ONE TO MAKE FRIENDS AND BE SOCIAL AND OUTGOING???? in my head i’m screaming “HAVE YOU NOT KNOWN ME FOR THE LAST 18 YEARS???” 
let alone it would be laughable for me to have made friends being 2 weeks into my freshman year at a community college i commute to, 2 days a week and never see the same person twice at.

i struggle with the relationship i have with my mother but her coming in here at 4 in the morning still drunk from the night before being weird &amp; pushing my comfort zone just made it so much worse. this is a new all time low for her. out of all the times she’s dampened my mood, she’s never done it starting at 4 in the morning before.

i just want to be left alone. when all of this was over she goes stumbling out of my room muttering to herself saying “get OuT oF ThAT fuCkInG RoOM”  and “yoUrE COmInG ouT WITh uS ToMOrROw”

i’ve been suffering with depression and feeling hopeless in life for the past few years and one of the most triggering things to me is seeing the simple , REPETITIVE, plot of how my mother and her boyfriend’s lives is laid out. it really puts life in perspective for me. it looks something like this-

work the same schedule at shitty jobs monday thru friday, come home and do the SAME shit every night, watch the SAME tv show, go to bed at the SAME time, drink the SAME fucking rum and coke EVERY NIGHT, hear my mom say SAME shit about packing their lunches for the next day and nagging her boyfriend about going to get his coffee cup out of the car, and then on fridays and saturdays ‘letting loose’ and staying up 2 hours later than normal, and drinking 4x as more alcohol than usual. 

watching her fall back into smoking cigarettes after 10+ years off of them all over again triggers me too. it’s like she’s reverting back to how she was when i was a child but it’s so much worse without my dad.

there's 3 of us. in the beginning of our friendship of 3, i felt equally close to both of them (let's call them L and N) and we were all equally close and called each other best friends. but later on, there were a lot of times where i felt like an outsider to L and N and even though they would both still tell me really personal stuff &amp; problems and i to them, L and N told each other stuff first. i wouldn't know til like a couple weeks later but i wouldnt really mind and was glad they trusted me enough to share with me but now it starts to hurt a little more. L and N send snaps to each other all the time, i used to send snaps to both of them until they sent me less and to each other more (&lt;--- this part feels childish rereading it LOL). its just crazy bc i dont think i really changed, i treated them both equally as my best, best friends but somehow the two of them grew closer.

the three of us hang out a lot together, occasionally in pairs, but every time i hang out with either L or N it was a time when the other person couldn't go. at times L and N would hang out unbeknownst to me before i would see it in a post where i could correctly guess the two were together. this happened three days ago. i didnt know they were hanging out, N's posts showed she was with someone but i couldnt tell who then L's posts revealed who. then N facetimed me later but i didnt answer bc i was in the shower. i texted N sorry for missing her call and she said it was fine, L and N wanted to talk and i said okay i can call u guys back in an hour but then N said it was fine and i just didnt ask what they wanted to talk about bc i didnt really care and i was thinking like what's the point, they didnt want me there with them anyways. i mean they don't have to tell me whenever spend time with each other or why they don't include me, that's their business but i keep letting myself get hurt by this. 

basically i always feel like a third, unimportant wheel, a background friend, that i don't really matter as much, that im a great friend to them both and i know they appreciate me but i think they would be really fine if i wasnt there. 

**here's a star for reading this far: ☆**

i think i played myself into thinking there are three-way friendships. there's always gonna be an odd one out and im not sure what i did to be and feel like the third. i guess L and N had a subsubgroup together without me as a part of it. i just wish i was someone's first choice. im dumb for thinking i can have two people both be my first choices in telling them important stuff that i want to share and im a clown for assuming they felt the same way. 

the thing is they're both awesome people and i love them a lot even tho they pain me and i know they don't intentionally want to make me feel excluded its just how it is. but i can't tell them how i feel im on the outside a lot of the times because i think it would hurt their feelings and if they did know how i felt it would certainly change the friendship and make me feel even more out. i think their efforts to include me would be unnatural to us all and even feel forced. but as i said i love them both and i still want them to be in my life or else who would share funny memes with, tell my problems to, people i can depend on and just be my best friends. im thankful for the memories we all shared together but (this sounds really bad) idk if they great feelings &amp; memories were worth feeling left out on the days when memories weren't made.

I have a lot going on at the moment and sometimes you just gotta let it out. This is probably gonna be a long ride so buckle up and grab a snack.

I’m 18 years old and I graduated high school this past May. I had some really good close friends, and for the first time in my life I felt like I fit in somewhere. I won’t get into crazy nitty gritty detail, but I had a very rough home life as a kid. My parents divorced when I was 11 and my mom moved myself and her halfway across the country into my abusive and manipulative grandparents’ house when I was 10. I grew up mostly by myself because before my parents divorced, they were always fighting and never had much time for their only child. I was very socially awkward and I wanted to make friends but I didn’t have much in the way of conversation skills. I got bullied A LOT as a kid and I kind of gave up after a while. When my mom and I moved, I was excited to start a new life in a different state. I thought maybe it would be my ticket to a new me. I was wrong. I was still bullied and teased quite frequently at my new school and since I didn’t have a lot of money compared to the other kids I wasn’t “cool” to hang around. I spent a lot of time by myself up until I was just about to turn 17 and had moved to a public school. By this point I was severely depressed and didn’t have anyone to talk to because my grandparents had kicked us out and my mom and I hadn’t been on the best of terms. I thought it would just be better if I were gone and no one had to deal with me. Right as things hit their worst, I met a few people that I really clicked with and started to come out of my shell a bit. By the beginning of senior year, I felt I truly had some strong friends. For the first time in my life I wasn’t completely alone and I had no idea how it felt to be included until then. I started to really be myself and found that I loved hanging out with people and just enjoying their company meant so much to me. When I graduated, we still had a strong friendship and I was happy despite things getting tougher at home.

Flash forward to today. I recently had to move out of my mothers house because I was miserable and she had become incredibly selfish. She barely cared for me after we moved and it got to the point where I went without a lot of things that I needed. I moved in with my father who still lives in the area that we did before my mom moved us. I’m excited to begin a new life and have a better quality of life, but I’m terrified because I realize I’m going to be alone again. My friends back home are slowly beginning to move on and they’re making new friends of their own. I’m genuinely happy for them and I’m thrilled that they’re thriving, but at the same time I’m nervous because I know in my heart that we probably will lose contact in the next year or so. I know it’s a part of life and it’s normal, and part of me tried to steel myself for it, but I was wayyyy more unprepared than I thought. I know I’ll eventually have friends again, but that time in between worries me.

It's been a really lonely summer. Like, *really* lonely. I only have two friends at the moment. One goes to school here but goes home to a different state in between semesters, and the other recently got a new boyfriend and spends ALL her free time hanging out with him. I'm really happy that she found someone so I feel bad complaining about it, but it's been months now and I just wish she'd stop cancelling our plans all the time. For example, we were planning this trip to this nearby city for weeks. But when we finally found a weekend to do it, she told me she was busy. Flash forward to that weekend, and her snapchat story was her with her boyfriend at the place we were planning on staying at. I don't know. I can't even type that out without feeling shitty, and then feeling shitty for feeling shitty because she deserves to have other friends and relationships too. Ugh. 

But then something else happened. This friend is also my co-worker. While I was still in the interview/background process, she told some of our other co-workers that I was recently hired. One of the guys jokingly asked if I was cute, and she told them that I'm a lesbian. 

Here's the thing. I never told her that I DIDN'T want to be out to my co-workers, but I would have preferred that she at least would have asked me if it was ok. Even though it's 2019, with new jobs I generally like to get a feel for the atmosphere myself before coming out. I tried to explain this to her, but she believes that she was ""doing me a favor"" so I wouldn't get hit on by the guys there. She may have meant well, but I at least would have liked her to acknowledge the reasons why I was kind of upset by this, even if I never made it explicitly clear that I didn't want to be out to these people I had never met before. 

I told my other friend (the out-of-state one) all this incident, and she looked me dead in the eye and said ""this girl is not your friend."" 

That really shook me. I'm still not ready to let go of co-worker friend though, because I honestly just don't have that many friends. And despite everything, I enjoy hanging out with her. Idk, I just wish she was more sensitive about things. I'm hoping this fall I can at least start to branch out and grow my friend network. I signed up for some more clubs, and finally made the mood to delete social media (seeing old acquaintances from high school with their big friend groups was honestly only fueling my depression and loneliness!).

I have friends, I know there's like 10 people I could talk to, but at the same time I just can't. Growing up I felt that I could never express or share my feelings due to how abusive my mother was. (Ex: when she found out that I was depressed in 7th grade, she would yell at me telling me that I have no reason to be feeling like that). Besides that, I felt that sharing my feelings meant placing a burden on someone. Whether it'd hurt their own, have them worry about me, etc. I'm a people-pleaser, the last thing I'd want is to cause hurt or stress on somebody else so instead I keep it all to myself. 

At the same time, I think me refusing to talk about my feelings or problems is a way of just not accepting the situation. I'd rather pretend that everything is perfect. It's what we all want, isn't it? To have a perfect family, a perfect lover, a perfect self. Once I realized my home life wasn't normal I began to have this dream of having a perfect xyz. 

I'm going through the process of accepting that nothing will ever be perfect. We're all human and life can be shitty. However, while thinking about things that happen, I question what flaws/mistakes am I supposed to let slide? Which is where I wish I could talk to someone about my problems. That leads back though to the same issues of not wanting to be a burden to anyone or bursting my ""perfect world"" dreams.

She lives abroad, and she came to stay at her’s for two months. I’ve been feeling left out ever since and I constantly see them express their love for each other, and the fact that “there’s no one more important in their lives”. I hear my best friend talk about her in the most amazing way, but I’ve been friends with her ever since we were in 5th grade and the only time she ever shows she appreciates me is when she had to write a b-day card for me. I know she is a closed person, isnt very much into showing vulnerability to a person, but I dont see how her cousin turned her into something else? Now I can’t help but think how I was never someone’s favorite person, and that I was never loved for who I am the way others are. I give all of me to certain people, to only get the bare minimum in return. She is my only best friend and I notice these things way more than any normal person does. I think I am the problem and that I am the person who no one ever appreciates or loves. 

Now I dont even know my spot in her life anymore, because the last time we went out (just the two of us) was 3 months ago. And now it feels awkward to even catch up on things because she replies shallowly or puts zero effort in making me feel better if I ever tell her a problem of mine. I discussed this with her plenty of times, but I was called dramatic and selfish, not understanding and insecure for asking for reassurance which imo, if it showed, I wouldn’t mention it.

I had a really really rough childhood and it continued through my teenage years. I struggled with massive ptsd and depression until age 26 when I finally got decent EMDR therapy. I only have one really good friend and a handful of aquintances. I moved around A Lot. 
I don't have any family at all as the few I had emigrated. I mostly struggle with the.. Void after depression. It's so wired into my brain that it's always something I have to work on every day. I sometimes compare it with an addict that has to be careful not to fall back into old habits. I feel like I have to try my best every day not to fall back into the temptation of the darkness. 
A few months ago a Coworker mentioned that she thinks I am very lonely. It hurt. I worked very hard to be where I am at now. I have a decent job as a nurse, a solid relationship, cats, I go to the gym, I have hobbies like gaming, arts and crafts, I really try my best to have a fun, fulfilling life.

But I’ve been at college for a grand total of one week and so far my mental health is really suffering for it. I debated about posting this on r/depression or r/anxiety because both of those things have really been a bitch lately, but I think this is the most fitting place. Because when it comes down to it, loneliness is what’s really contributing to both of them. Gut wrenching, mind numbing, really fucking painful loneliness. It hurts so bad. It hurts to see everyone making friends. It hurts to see my old friends from high school making friends. It hurts to keep eating my meals alone. It hurts to be in a group of people I feel no connection with because I forced myself to engage in social interaction. I’ve been doing that lately. Like I get so desperate for human connection that I eat with these people I honestly can’t stand. They basically ignore me anyway, either that or I barely speak because I feel so empty. But it still hurts. I think it’s actually more lonely to be in a group of people you feel so disconnected than to be alone. So a lot of times I choose alone. I realize that has both positive and negative ramifications. Anyway, it’s so hard being here. It’s not so much that I miss my family or being home. Or maybe I do. I guess I miss the familiarity a little bit. I like that I’m in a totally different environment now. But I haven’t really connected with anyone here and my failing mental health makes it so goddamn hard to try. You know that exhaustive cycle? You can barely get out of bed, so you don’t go out. You don’t meet people. Which makes it so much harder. So you keep laying in bed. And then you are that much more alone for that much longer. I’ve been trying as much as I can. I talk to people, get their phone numbers, reach out. I try to force myself to go events on campus when I can. But fuck, sometimes they make me feel worse. I know what many of you will say. I haven’t been here that long. Give it time. Trust me, I know. I do. Maybe there’s hope in the future. I can’t know for sure. So I guess I’m asking for some support for right now. Support through this crushing loneliness. This non stop need to sob my heart out. The anxiety attacks. The urges to self harm. The trapped feeling I get when I realize I have no where to go because my roommate is home and I can’t feel comfortable around her to let myself just be sad. The lack of will to eat.

The next day we were talking then she asked me “why do you sit at the back?”...I took that as a hint that she wanted me to sit closer to her which I did the following exam. Was I right to do that or did I throw myself onto her and came on a bit too strong? Anyways I sat closer to her the next time and after the exam she made a point not to leave immediately like she does every time and revised the exam with me. I just wanted to know what her question indicated that’s all. What do you guys think? I just want to know if her question indicated that she wanted me to sit closer to her. Would really appreciate some answers.


She also regularly looks at me when I’m not looking and always gives a wide smile every time I talk to her, also keeps the conversation going by asking questions etc but I don’t really believe in those ‘signs’.

Anyways, do you think she really wanted me to sit by her or just asked me that to cheat off me? I asked that somewhere and someone said that she was being nice just because she wanted me to do her a favor and copy my answers in the exam. The thing is, at the time I didn’t think of that possibility at all as she’s really, really shy and honestly when we sat closer to each other I was the one who always initiated the cheating, then she’d follow. Also, one of the things that happened that made rule out that possibility was that once before an exam started, she glanced at me a few times (my friend notified me of this) before coming over from the back to say hi with a wide smile...then left with her friend to sit at the back. This incident right there is why I didn’t think she was using me to cheat...I mean if she did then why would she leave with her friend to sit at the back (I was sat in the middle)?

I've always been the 'friend' that's excluded from stuff. The one that's forgotten about. The one that no one thinks to invite. 

I've always been that coworker that never goes out for work drinks because no one ever asks me. And I watch the new employees get asked in their first week. I asked one time why no one had asked me, and everyone went silent and looked at each other. In my old job, as a teenager, all my coworkers used to throw parties together, and they would lie to me about it, and I'd find out through Snapchat. I don't know what I ever did to them. 

I've always been that stranger that people don't even see, getting bumped into in elevators and when I'm walking. As if I'm invisible. 

I've always been that girl that guys hang out with for a month or two, and then lose interest, because I'm not as fun or exciting as they expected me to be. 

I've always been that caring person that's nice to everyone, and bends over backwards to help people out when they need it, that people can't even see.

1670,UneliasIhminen,1567853084,2,"I'm lonely. I have been feeling down for a while now, mostly because I don't have any friends. I mean, I have friends from my old school but they talk a lot behind my back. I thought going to new school would make everything better and I could make new, better friends but no. After a month, I'm still alone. I'm the only one in my class who has problems with making friends. 

I have online friends but it's not the same. Irl, everyone seems to hate me. I just wanna know what's wrong with me so I could change myself. My friends from the old school are often hanging out together but they never invite me. They say all those mean things with or without knowing they are hurting me.

I don't think I'm depressed. That's not possible. I'm not at the point where I can't get up in the morning. I'm not suicidal. I don't wanna die. But I feel like my loneliness is making me feeling worse every day. 

I started scratching myself with a blade (I don't count it as cutting). I do it when I feel bad or want to punish myself. I don't think it's serious because I'm not addicted to it. And I didn't have the urge to do it for a month but it came back a few days ago. Also, sometimes when I say or do something stupit, I have to hit my head to the wall. 

I think I would cut if I didn't have to worry about hiding the scars. Scratching is so much easier because I don't have to hide anything. I've hurt too many people, I just wanna cut and feel their pain. I wish I could learn how to be a good person. No matter what I try to do, it will never be enough. I will never be enough.

I have also lost some weight without trying to. I'm not sure is it normal or not. I'm under weight. I can't gain weight no matter how much I eat. I don't wanna see a doctor. They would probably just tell me to eat more. 

I guess I just wanna be enough. But I'm not. I'm alone. I'm tired of being lonely. Everyone leaves me and I just wanna know what I've done wrong. I wish I could change myself but I can't. But I get it, it's my fault. People have a reason to hate me. 

I just wanna be loved, that's everything I want. Maybe I wasn't meant to have friends. I was meant to be alone. I'm tired of crying myself to sleep. I just wanna wake up going that there's someone who wants to hang out with me after school. If you have friends, please, don't let them go. You're super lucky to have them.

Maybe i'm just seeking for attention because my life isn't that bad. I should be happy with my life and I think I am but the thing is I really hate myself; the way I look, the way I act... everything. I hate my personality. There's no single thing I'm good at.

All my life, from elementary to where I am now at the age of 21, I always seemed to be a loner in someway. Sure, I have and had friends but never really get invited by the old group anymore. It feels pretty exhausting to always be alone even though I can have fun on my own pretty well and used to be good at amusing myself. The last 5 years of my life I have been struggling with insecurity, stress and other mental problems which make me feel isolated. Physical symptoms of the tension I carry around seem to manifest in my stomach, pelvic muscles/hips and lower back. I am already speaking with a therapist about problems but I never have felt understood by others even though my communication and social skills do not lack that much at all and you would probably not even notice anything off. Sadly, I don't feel any connection with people around me and I had this feeling since I was about 16 years old. This was also the age where I slowly developed some bad habits like worrying about everything and becoming insecure over time which interferes with everything. I also have social anxiety and feel very self consious which makes it hard to really connect with others. It is like I am constantly living in my head. I do still have some friends but well, they barely have time or don't really want to go out and do something. I feel stuck with my thoughts a lot and expressing them does not really help me. Lately I was figuring out some more about mindfulness as a possible tool for relaxation on a mental and physical level so I can start working towards living a more fulfilling existence.

1678,YukimoTheVixen,1567842028,6,"Backstory: 
When I was in middle school I had knew so many people and thought of some as friends. One day I started getting these suicidal thoughts and couldn't understand them (later finding out my parents kinda caused it). I remembered asking each and everyone about it... I was kinda shocked by the responses. ""You're selfish"", ""You could've been in a worst situation(as in actually ending it)"", ""People have it rougher than you."", ""Are you serious? Stop asking for attention."", ""You just cry too much."". What are all these responses, why are these so similar? Is it really me? Growing up I became depressed and isolated everyone I learned more on how I felt and thought was not wrong..  I just wish I had support. I never thought of a reason to dislike me either, but still..  is it me?
 This haunts me even now. 

Present: 
5-6 yrs went by. I am starting college and wanted that ""fresh start"", I knew no one and no one really knew me. I told myself to distance myself, however I couldn't help it I wanted friends... Join a few clubs (gaming and another culture). I never felt like I belong... I don't know how to act. I try to socialize but it didn't seem to work. End up being in some love triangle... met a guy I thought was the one. Met his friends, join his club, he was like my best friend. Broke up with me unexpectedly to  someone who he just met not too long ago and recently got out of a relationship with. She wasn't even interested in him as she said since we were ""friends"". She didn't really feel like a friend, but she was a good person. Suddenly it hurts being around those I feel were my friends... he acted like a jerk and started going after my single ""friends"" who recently got out of a relationship. They all don't like him that way, probably because they all know about me and care about me. 
I feel like all these people are just nice and good people who do not want to hurt me even more... but they never felt like friends. Never ask how am I, never included me to group parties, never anything...
Even join this car crew( mabey ask because they knew me and need a girl with a nice car). It was nice and fun hanging with them all. But even at times I never felt included only just feeling like a shadow. 
Tonight : 
I try to believe I have friends.... 
In this culture club we have these ""families"" like a sorority and sisters, only smaller. They all have this party... a girl's night out... heh thanks for the invite. No one invited me, like the art painting party (when they even know I love art)... 
I think about that sound (drifted away by rebecca sugar) and how much I can relate. 

I just want a friend... someone I can have fun with and vice versa... 
Everyone says I'm nice and stuff... but no one ever want me to hang out. 
I try to invite them but they are always busy. 
It's hard to even think... seeing it all on social media is now painful. I just want to delete it all and disappear from this world. I really don't think anyone will miss me only see a tragic thing.

I’m a 20 M and I don’t really have a lot of friends. The friends I did have during my relationship became very toxic to me and put me down a lot. I feel I was always the but of the joke but because this was my first real friend group I tried really hard to try fit in. Anything I said on our gc somehow lead to a joke about me. Back to my relationship, my girlfriend had a pretty good friend group. They went out all the time and always had each other’s backs. I was afraid that without no friend my girlfriend would think of me as a loser, not to mention me losing almost all my self esteem. Every time she talked sbt what she did with her friends I used to get upset and jealous, causing me to act out, cause unnecessary fights and even sometimes ignore her. I put her through alot and I feel like she could never understand me. I constantly felt she would put her friends before me when that wasn’t really the case, she was just hanging out with her friends. This eventually lead to our breakup, even after begging her not to leave. Now I just feel really shitty, not having anyone to talk to but somehow beginning to make new friends and work on myself. I guess I didn’t really realise the result of my behaviour before it was too late. I’m still not sure if telling her about my friend situation would’ve been a good idea and I’m not sure how she would’ve reacted to it.

I had a great friend group in high school. Then we went to college and my best friend went to college in another country... we kept up but freshman year I joined a sorority and I had a group text and girls to go out with right off the bat.  
But as time went on that group faded and girls joined other groups and I found myself sort of ... alone? I have (now I'm a junior) good friends but not one solid group that I can text funny things and be myself around and those friends are also apart of their own friend groups that I don't quite mesh with or that I'm just simply not in (they're all usually already close). It's so frustrating because I feel like my friends from home have lives and a great new friend group just like what we had - which I'm happy about! But I have friends all in different friend groups here so I feel like I’m just kind of tagging along all the time? There’s group chats I’m in and things but I feel like it's just because they feel like they need to include me- I don't feel hated but I just don't feel loved... like I don't have my people if that makes sense.   
I also have one friend that I supposed to be my “best friend” but she acts a little standoffish when I crack a joke or something but goes on to do the same things with other girls that seem to love it, maybe it's just who I am? I love everyone I've met, I just kinda miss feeling the love back?

1685,hamartiated,1567836918,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

That friendship only brought out the worst in me. We fight all the time. Every little thing, we argued. I’ll say or do something, that friend would get annoyed. That friend always asks if I still want to be friends, and I say yes because that’s the truth. I held on as much as I can until one day, I just exploded. Finally, I said to myself, enough is enough. 

But after that, I can’t sleep. I can’t function. I’ve been crying since I left. It was my choice to leave because I can no longer handle it. But I feel like without that friend, I couldn’t handle that even more. 

I am the introverted type. I only have three friends, one of them is this friend. The other two were from college (10+ years) but we hardly speak to each other now as they have their own thing going on. We only see other for like two or three times a year, we chat once in a blue moon (when they feel like it). So, I am much closer to this friend even though we’re only friends for almost 3 years (it was like two and a half years fighting/arguing) because we are together all the time. We text each other all the time. We let each other know what’s going on all the time, even the smallest details. 

But the fights/arguments never end. Until one day, I got really fed up with those heavy emotions. It was exhausting. I tried to leave before but I reached out to patch things up, only for us to fight again. I feel like, this time, its’s for good. I’ve been keeping myself from reaching out because I know it will only do more harm than good. But I feel so terrible. My heart is beating so fast. I can’t sleep. I don’t have the energy to go on.

Let me start from the beginning, This happend about a year a go.  I and my friend went to see this girl and her cousin. Unknowingly they had been drinking for a little before we got there and i didn't even know them. Anywho they drank throughout the evening and this girl was been bit suggestive (sexually) even tho i turned her down.  I see her quite often sober and she is always this quiet and careful person like she'd been though something before.

Well past few weeks i have seen her more often drunk than sober and about a week ago she asked me to go drink with her and i had to pass cause i wasn't at home. Later that night she had sent me a photo on snapchat of an ER/hospital reception and i didn't think too much about it till few days later when my friend got an photo of her been back at the same ER/hospital. My friend tried to ask her friend what happen and didn't get an answer so he asked her and she told him that she had tried to commit suicide and apparently failed (fortunately). 

I've been thinking about her and asking if shes ok, but i haven't had the courage to do that and now i am feeling even more lonely and sad cause, i like her and i fear of her trying again.

My own parents pretty much disowned me for my sexuality, and came out about and I quote: 'Not being able to afford me when I was born'. Seems like no matter what I do, I always end up not being cared about. In past relationships, it seemed like I wasn't being loved at all but being used for something. And multiple times, that was the case. Everyone who has said that they love me or they care about me has ended up stabbing me right in the back, or flat out leaving me. 

   I wanna get better with my mental disorders but it seems like when I tell people about my PTSD, ADHD, etc., they always shy away and flat leave me. It's not my fault that I've been sexually molested, bullied and born with a developmental delay and such. It just feels like everyone wants it to be my fault, or I'm being pressured into thinking that it actually **IS** my fault. 

   So no, nobody cares nobody ever will. Nobody will ever love me, or is even capable of loving me. Or at least, that's what I've been conditioned to think my whole life. That I was just born for no reason and that I shouldn't exist anymore. Or, I don't matter nor do my opinions. If anyone tells me that I look good, I'm a good person, or that they love me.

I'm in med school and it's been a month or two here and I still do not have friends. I've been putting myself out there, going to social events, and talking to my roommates, but I just come off as awkward.

I don't have any friends from undergrad and I grew apart from my friends in high school. I'm 2 hours away from my family, but I don't have a car to see them. I do tend to cry a lot in my room and I call my parents and sisters but they hang up when they don't want to hear me crying. I don't reveal any emotions or talk about my problems because I was consistently told in undergrad by people I tried to be friends with that my problems are not bad and I have to stop venting or else I will never have friends. I just hold it all in and cry every day in my room alone.

This loneliness is really hurting. I'm trying to fight it by studying more, so the longer I study, the less time I have with my thoughts and more on the material. It hurts every time I try to talk to someone beyond academics and ask them if I can hang out with them, about their hobbies, about their life. I just come off as awkward.

I'm okay with being lonely for the rest of my life, is there anyone out there who is happy doing it? Will this ache of loneliness ever go away? It kind of hurts... a lot.

Hello, my name is Alex and I am 24 years old. 
I don’t know why I would post this on here, but what ever... 

I usually keep everything to myself. Well, long story short-I was diagnosed with brain tumor when I was 21..... THE WORLD STOPED WHEN I KNEW.....

Just to recap: before I got diagnosed i  studied, finished college, went to uni I would consider myself “normal” back then, life was great and I  had people I could talk / study together. Even some real friends I even got in relationship( it wasn’t good one, my partner had some serious mental issues it was hard for both of us so....) 

 My diagnosis was glioma type 4 tumor in my cerebellum, because of the tumor location I was EXTREMELY Dizzy AND Vomited just without even being sick if it makes sense? My head was so dizzy that I just vomited involuntarily every couple of minutes every day for two months while waiting for a surgery to remove my tumor. For obvious  reason I had to stop my uni and moved back home :( 

After the first operation I lost my hearing on my left side completely. And got the trigiminal neurologia( the extremely painful condition of the face, sometimes even called “suicide deasese” )  I did chemo and radio after that- and as you might already guessed nothin helped, it was biggest waste in my life on top of that  radio left me with thyroid problems so now I need to take hormonal therapy -.-

When I finished my chemo I was alright for some time and I met my new partner... I thought I was ok and Indeed i was ok for some  time... or I wanted to be “normal” again I guess.....then I got sick again... God why would I do that ? :( now he seeing me sick..

Second operation to remove the tumor left me face paralyzed ( my facial nerve was around my tumor so I guess they accidentally damaged it, but that left me half faced without smile, expression and emotions... like I am a zombie now I take the drugs that makes me forget stuff all the time, feel numb and not suicidal 

I feel like I am shell of my old-self and I can’t deal with everything at once.... money, hard relationship, not able to be sociable, I look ugly and I am scared to smile or even talk now... I am not sure where my future is and it is scary.

I am not sure why I am still here... it will only get worth in time. 

P.s I hope that  this  will make someone feel a bit better about themself or what they are going through  

Thank you for your attention 🙏",lonely,Please... I don’t want to do this anymore,2019-09-06 20:32:50

I have a deep set fear of intimacy (physical and emotional) from other people and struggle to be vulnerable with my emotions due to my mental health. I'm always the person who is level headed and strong. I never let things bother me and I'm difficult to upset. But the reality is I only appear that way because I'm not honest with people about my feelings. When someone hurts me, intentionally or unintentionally I just pretend that they didnt so I dont have to deal with showing them my true feelings. 

I long to find a person I can really be honest with, but I'm afraid that I never will find someone like that. I've never been in a relationship before, I've never even been kissed or gone on a date. And I know I'm still young and have my whole life ahead of me for that to happen, but there are times that all I want is for someone to want me like that. I keep having dreams about being in a relationship with someone who loves me, holds me, cares for me. And they're really wonderful. But then I wake up and they arent real and I'm left with the reminder that I'm still the only person I can rely on. 

It's a really painful state to be in. I keep thinking about trying to date and put myself out there but I'm also struggling with the thoughts that nobody can love me as I am right now and that I need to improve myself before I should even try.

And my gf, who I adore and am so lucky to have,  but I can't weigh her down with all my issues when she has her own things to sort through right now.

That's when I notice just how empty my days can feel sometimes. I have no one else to talk to about shared interests or basic day to day things. Or even someone whose concerns I can lend an ear to and who I know will be there for me, too.

So I look on certain friend making subreddits or other places online hoping to make a connection and in the end always end up feeling I worse than when I started.
So many people looking for friends and yet nearly none of  them respond, and the ones that do don't for long. I know I'm not the most interesting guy in the world, but damn.

This isn't a looking for a friend post. I don't expect that to happen for me at this point, but I felt the need to vent. I'm sure I'm not the only one who experienced this.

If they see me as a failure, that’s fine but I just want them to know that my blessing is with all of my family. I just need to adore someone or else I will bring myself to insanity. My friends have been keeping touch with me which has helped me through these past few years, they are the reason I’m here. I’d say that 80% of my friends from high school are not in connection with me anymore. I’ve known a couple of people that have committed because they couldn’t handle the pressure, I’m blessed to know that there is always a solution. No matter what I always keep my compassion and my love for everyone. I can’t be mean to anyone because I truly don’t know how it affects them. My father is a hard worker, he has worked hard for me and my family for his whole life, I never go by a day by thanking god that my father is always supporting me but I just can’t handle myself because I can’t function normally. I used to stop by the gym a lot, I saw a lady for the past year or two, this lady was around her late 20s and she starved herself to try to capture a body image that she strives to get. Her doctors always stopped by and said that she needed to eat, it had to even go to a point where she had to live off a machine, if I were to say an estimation of size, I’d say she was like 5’6 and 60 pounds, I could see her bone imprints on her skin, I had even offered to order her some Postmates to the gym but she had rejected and I couldn’t really help her. She doesn’t go to the gym anymore, I don’t know what happened after her after she had left to go for a jog outside. But I digress, I never want to push myself to do nothing I don’t want to do, stuff like that makes me want to commit suicide, I don’t even care if I make minimum wage, I want to do something I love. This is why people get stressed out day to day. I’d rather have a 12k salary while enjoying my life rather than a 60k salary and living in constant downward mentality. I never committed myself to relationships because I’ve always seen them as temporary. It might seem like I’m selfish but I just want to live happily with myself, by myself. I can’t see myself caring for another person simply because it’s too much work to do. I recently bought some AirPods, it was cool at first but I found myself not caring about money anymore, I’ve had 8-9kish in my safe but I’ve probably went through 2k in around a month, it’s probably not the AirPods but it’s probably my wrong mindset. Let me tell you a story, it’s about this kid named uhh, I’ll just call him Max, Max was 3 grades under me, I was in 10th, he was in 7th. I always had faith in him because he was a straight A student, he never failed any subject and always kept a good mindset about real life situations, he had started speaking about this kid named.. Let’s just call him Tariq. Tariq was a known drug dealer around the block for weed and stolen iPhones. Believe it or not, Tariq started selling weed in the 6th grade, he was in the same grade as Max so there was no age difference. Max found out about Tariq through class, I told Max, “Why are you getting involved with this shit? It just ruins you and is a money waster” I’m not against weed but I just don’t want this kid to take the wrong path after he had paved himself great lead to success, he said “I want to get high” I couldn’t believe this kid, next thing you know, Max starts buying ounces then soon pounds until Tariq sent one of his people out to rob him, over 1k of marijuana just snatched away from him and Tariq ended communications from messages, ig, whatsapp everything. Max learned his lesson but boy this surely hit harder, Max kept a knife from when he did weed in his backpack, random kid whistle blows about it and Max gets caught with a knife in school, police get a warrant to look through his phone and they find Tariq’s past texts with him. Next thing you know Max has 3 court dates he has to attend. As you can tell, Tariq isn’t so happy so he actually gets people to shoot up his home, around 6k of damages were caused like car windows, a tv and home windows. They also shot his ankle while he was laying down on the couch so you know this was no joke. Max ends up forking out 6k from his savings for legal fees and gets his sentence reduced to 3 years but Tariq not known to be seen ANYWHERE. Max had learned his lesson but doesn’t have any job opportunities anymore because of the jail time and had dropped out at age 17,  he is currently working as a iHop worker at the moment. I never want anyone to have the experience Mad did, he had transformed to a whole other person I hadn’t known. But I’m sorry for my chit chatting, I had just needed to open up about my life because I’m dealing with a great amount of stress. Whoever is reading this, I’m grateful for you and I hope amazing stuff come to you. My sister had just given me a Stussy shirt , it’s cool I guess but I want to be remembered like that, it’s not the brand but more of a symbol of my trust, saying I appreciate anyone that shows me they appreciate my existence and that it provide a sign that they know who I am.

I've suffered with depression all my life but never really dealt with it
Two years into college I'm actually quite happy despite the few depressive spells that come on rarely
I've had lost a few years studying a difficult course and failing and was at risk of being feeling very lesser than most people I came in contact with. But it was something I was good at dealing with most of the time.
Come final year in college I go crazy over this girl, she does start liking me back, but she plays it safe by not outright agreeing to a relationship but still being very close friends. This brings me emotional stress and I ended up kind of ghosting her. Looking back it was a bad move, but my mind was all sorts of fucked
Things with her get better later, but still things weren't working out, we couldn't find time to talk and there was this constant lack of communication, but I would still be there for her when she had issues
But it crumbles and we don't talk to each other play jealousy games and then college is over.
She gets over it pretty quick and it's almost one year in and I'm still struggling
So lately I decide to talk to my friend about it because there was just so much pain and stigma and I do feel better
But I also find out she was lying a lot and was just a pathological liar which made sense and which I was suspicious of. Looking back, I think this was responsible for the emotional stress.
Now I do feel better, but I feel very confused as to the person she was, all my time and effort and also I feel like whining about it all the time, but ofcourse that's helping no one.

Why? Two reasons, my day time job is depressing. I work alone in a stressed environment always looking over my shoulder if, my clients will pay me or not.

Second, I have no friends. I have never ever found people with similar interests. If I do by some rare luck find somebody (happened not in real life but on Internet only) they are not interested in a genuine friendship. Turns out it is always a use and throw intention. And thus, I have severe trust issues now.

Also, I am critically introvert. I dont do good in large groups or around people who are highly social and have a wide network of people they know. These people give me anxiety. I always aspire to have a close group of 2-3 sincere friends but never found even 1 person.

And that is the reason my love life is a disaster too. I have had previous relationships but they ended on such a sour note that I still wonder were those years of intimacy was simply a pretence.

I become addicted to gambling in September/October 2018, I was incredibly fortunate to have had a large win and walk away with 75k, however in the process I damaged countless relationships with family and friends because all I cared about was gambling. More importantly I destroyed the trust with my partner of nearly 6 years. I’m now 6 weeks clean and I feel no desire to gamble anymore. However I feel I’ve completely ruined my relationship with my boyfriend. He recently joined the Army and since then things haven’t been the same between us. He was away for 14 weeks during training and this was really difficult for me. We got through it and now he’s only away Monday-Friday but as he put it we aren’t in sync anymore. He tells me story’s about the other ‘lads’ going out drinking and sleeping around on the weekends and I honestly feel like he feels that he’s missed out on being a lad and acting this way. I personally just feel a burden to his life now and he has no need for me anymore. 

My career path was to join the RAF and unfortunately failed the medical due to a heart murmur I knew nothing about. This was an incredibly low point in my life and I fell into a state of depression.

After over a years testing they found my heart was wired slightly different but shouldn’t cause me any issues in later life.

It looks like I developed a pattern. Every few or something years, I have a miraculous streak of luck and even through my almost complete isolation I meet someone new. Always to fail spectacularly at keeping contact with these people, just to fall even deeper in my unwillingness to fight on and ever try again. 


This time, at least, it was fast. My only friend sends me a message saying that his roommate just broke up and could use some distraction. By chance, I just had some free movie coupons on me, so I invite both of them to a movie. It's nice. I talk to people IRL like this for the first time after more than a year. Next day, we play some games online. It's great. Next weekend, they invite me to their place for lunch. It's awesome. I stay even for dinner. I sharpen their kitchen knives, because that's my thing. First time someone actually took my offer to do it. I am ecstatic. I still have plenty of coupons left, so I start planning another movie night with them and the roommate seems interested in going without my friend and getting to know me better. Could this be it? Maybe, after rotting in my own room/flat alone for the last ten years, I could start finally hanging out with people.

Lol, of course not. Immediately after all this, the roommate stops responding to my messages and from my friend I learn she brought home some other guy. And suddenly, I remember all the feelings of worthlessness. Of inadequacy. Of being really just a distraction to people before they find other, better people. It's time to start building my loneliness bubble, that I tore down, once more so I can forget these feelings. I am getting really tired of this happening again and again and again... 


And yes, I still have my friend. It's the only thing keeping me barely afloat. He just isn't a ""hang out"" type of friend. Every second not spent on his computer is a second wasted. Getting him to a movie theater was a miracle on its own.

Posted on r/confession but it turns out they dont do no relationship stuff(well neither do i)
I wrote a big ass poem there but i cant access it on the phone so Im just gonna write it again.

I recently moved to big city. It was amazing at first, then i found out the hard thruth, i have one friend here whos in college and has to study/gf doesnt really wanna see me that much anyway.

Now apart from that, im trying to find a girl, but the thing is, its either im extremely unlucky or my brain is programmed to pick the ones that are in relationship/just got out of it, which is very fucking painful.


I had 3 dates in last couple of months(2 in old city and one few days ago in new one), was pumped for all 3, but they all turned out to be a big fuck you for me lol

First one went amazing, we kissed in the end, I was very happy with how it went, i asked her out few days after and she replied with ""im not looking for a serious relationship rn"" I was like what? Tried explaining her that its to early for that but that didnt go well and we stopped talking.

Second one was with a girl i knew from way back, asked her out and she said ye, went out and on the middle the date she told me that she recently broke up with her boyfriend, and well at that point i knew it was pretty much over, tried to kiss her on the end of the date and she just said ""i cant do this i just left a relationship"", and we just stopped talking.

Third and last one(the one in this beautiful city in which i know fucking nobody)i met her in some sort of social gathering and she seemed cool, we made plans for a date that night. And when date stsrted 5 mins into it she tells me some shit about her BOYFRIEND. Tho she is very friendly and i probably misunderstood her reaction, but basically it fucked me up for the rest of the night and it ended weird. So im guessing we're prpbably just gonna stop talking aswell.


Each time i go out same shit happens. Im literally THE WORST at dating and its killing me inside so much, each time it gets worse and worse.",lonely,my love life is a joke,2019-09-05 19:50:38

1801,haz87,1567668163,1,"Just need to put thoughts to text this morning. For so long I thought I’d come to terms with being alone. I’ve probably gone nigh on 9yrs now without friends - in that time making plenty of positive steps especially around my own physical health and lifestyle. 
But recently I thought I’d overcome my fear of further rejection by reaching out to those that were once closest (friends, not ex’s, lol). All of them were cases where life got in the way and we simply drifted. No ill feelings or spats etc. 
In every case bar one I’ve been outright ignored, and that one entertained 2 txts before then ignoring me. I haven’t chased in desperation, it is what it is - very sad, but you just have to swallow these things. 
Part of me thinks it’s hilarious that I went to such efforts to overcome the very outcome I’ve now ended up with. The other part of me is struggling massively. Not necessarily with the situation, but more the in my face reminder that I have nobody. Nobody that cared or cares enough in circa 10yrs to check in, ask how’s it going, to even check if I’m alive. 
As pathetic as it is, I feel like I could just do with a hug. The type where you know the other person “realllly” means it. 
I don’t know if I’ll ever come to terms with the fact that I am clearly one of those “unloveable” people. I’m not without flaws but I’m also not an arsehole. I’ve always put others first and maybe this was my downfall longterm - who knows. 
I know it’s a fairly fundamental part of being a human but jeez I wish someone loved me.

And that's the deadly duo of self-pity &amp; procrastination...

If you truly hate your life or yourself and want it to be better, then rise to the challenge and become better...

So that you can obliterate all your problems and be a happy person who can achieve whatever they want simply by putting will power and effort towards achieving!

Stop making excuses. Stop blaming others. Stop blaming yourself. Stop laying around pouting. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Stop the self-deprication!

And simply start working on yourself and your problems one at a time...

Seriously, go right now and get a pen and paper...

Don't use your phones notepad as you may get distracted...

Go old school on this one and get a pen and paper, then write down the following lists:

1. Everything you dislike about yourself
2. Everything others have said they dislike about you
3. All your psychological, spiritual, cognitive, physical, and emotional problems
4. All your situational and financial ordeals (problems)

And finally

5. Write down everything you want to become and what you want your life to be like

After you've done that, you're 1/3 of the way finished to achieving everything you want...

Next, write down the top 5 most important things you want fixed or changed about yourself or your life and focus on those first...

Afterwards, write down as many possible ways to solve or change each problem and then you're done with the 2nd step of 3...

The last and final step is to act!

Take action on all your ideas you wrote down and take it seriously, because, if you don't take yourself seriously, no one will ever take you seriously either!

So it's time to so this for you! Take care of yourself and act right now.

At the very least, get all of this written down after you read this and then act as soon as possible because the longer you stall or wait, the more you'll procrastinate and you'll never get anything accomplished...

Ask yourself... Do you want to look at yourself and see someone who's the real deal? A badass who conquered their own mind and seized their life heroically? Do you want others to look at you and be like, ""they really got it going on, WOW!"" OR... Do you want yourself and everyone else to continue seeing you as a pathetic joke that's going nowhere in life?

Writing all the problems down and brainstorming all the solutions is 2/3 the battle...

After you do that, act...

Because only you have the power to change your life...

And if after reading this, I can't convince you to at least try, then most likely no one and nothing ever will!

At least try everyone! ☺️",lonely,Help has arrived!,2019-09-05 14:00:09

1825,hamartiated,1567649164,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat),2019-09-05 12:06:04

I have never felt so alone. I’m in a new city that I never wanted to live in (because I had no where else to go back to after training). I work with complete strangers every day I go to work. Building friendships with co-workers is near impossible because it could be months before you run into them again. All of my friends I basically lost in the break up or they are now long distant friendships. I'm missing out on so many events.

1828,megaderpy8888,1567644857,3,"I've had a series of meaningful friendships both in person and online. The bulk of my most fulfilling friendships have been online, but my in person friendships have been amazing as well.

I'm 20 and started college 3 years ago as a Computer Science major. I had an amazing group of friends that I met through the major and we would have classes basically every semester together. That means we'd all see each other often and have been bonding for the last 3 years. I go to a commuter school so making friends can be incredibly hard since most people leave campus immediately after class, but I was grateful for the amazing friends I made. 

Due to personal circumstances I've decided to transfer to Economics in my 4th year (this school year) and because of that I no longer have any classes with my friends and they seem so distant now a days. We don't have that unifying force in common so this semester I feel so lonely looking around the lecture hall and seeing nobody I know. Most days I show up to school and don't say a word in the 8 or so hours I'm there because I have nobody to speak to. We just say hi and bye in the halls since our schedules are so wildly different now, and everyone is busy. : /

I had a super tight knit group chat of about 15-20 people I started spring 2016 and it peaked around Summer 2017 and has been slowly on the decline ever since. This summer, 2019, its basically completely dead and I dont really have any of those amazing friends I made anymore since they've all moved on. : (

My super tight knit group of high school friends are all turning/have turned 21 this year and they spend their days going out to bars and drinking and I don't vibe with that so they're effectively gone from my life too since all they want to do anymore is get drunk. 

Last but not least I made an amazing friend in January who I was basically soulmates with, but a few months ago they left me in the dust for someone new they met, completely out of the blue.

Losing all these friends and relationships within such a short span of time has made me feel incredibly lonely. I dread most days because I wake up and have nobody to turn to. 4 months ago everything was so amazing. I had all of these relationships thriving and active. Now they're basically gone and I don't have anyone. This sucks so much. :(",lonely,All of my friendships fell apart at once and I feel so lost : /,2019-09-05 10:54:17

Empathy: you feel what the other subject feels because you can relate to things YOU have felt or experience in life.

Jealousy: a feeling of resentment or desire based on what you wish YOUR life could be like

Hate: anger towards someone or something because YOU cannot relate to how that person acted or felt, in a way that causes you distress

My family and I have always been kind of close, but I don't even know when the flip switched, because a pang of loneliness just hit me today and I noticed my parents are either on an electronic device or hanging out with each other. Which is fine, they're a couple, they should hang out, but I don't remember the last time I was acknowledged, which should be a fucking challenge for them, because my dad doesn't have friends (he considers me and my mum friends, and that's fine), my mum has a few friends, but she had two heart attacks a couple of years ago and has been on sick leave ever since and doesn't want to hang out with them. She prefers to chat on the phone. And she doesn't work. 
By what I mean by prioritising each other, my dad loves me, more than my mum does. But recently, he's gone to work, hung out with my mum and gone to bed. My mum, well, I sit in the living room with her and she completely ignored my existence whilst she watches a movie and I sit starting at the wall waiting for her to finish (she doesn't like to be disturbed).

1853,-afterdark,1567613757,1,"Hi, I'm a socially isolated early-20-something. I am a real person, here in the world. I don't have any friends or social connections, I don't talk to anyone other than my close family members which amount to 3 people, two of which are dying, one of which dislikes me and I them. No one else knows who I am or that I exist, and anyone that did know me moved on a long time ago. I fell out of contact with the few people (3 at most) I was 'close' to (meaning hung out with casually) years ago -- the last time I had an IRL acquaintance was when I was 17, and the last time I had an actual friend was probably around 15. I don't ever go out anywhere, and haven't since I was 18, essentially making me a Hikikomori (a recluse). This'll change soon as I'll be moving out.  


People don't tend to like me very much, and I don't like them, so after a while I just said 'fuck it' and faded into the background. I've been there ever since. This happened in my late teens.  


I became a selective mute after not talking for such an extended period of time and now generally prefer not to talk. I don't feel as if it's me talking when I do, it's like my brain's conjured up an image to portray as a way to try to socialize with humans because it doesn't remember how to at this point, or as a defensive mechanism. I do this with my family, even if I don't want to. I have no idea how to be myself with anyone that isn't online. I try to be myself anonymously online by either quietly putting out different creations under pseudonyms, or interacting with people in limited ways, reserving my identity as much as possible. The time I've spent alone allowed me to develop a hobby or two and I tend to communicate through them. I've met numerous people online under different names and circumstances and gotten to know them, played games with them, made things with them, but in the end always end up separating from them, oftentimes suddenly and without warning. I do this when I feel they're 'too close'. As insane as this might sound I do have legitimate reasons for why I am this way, one in particular that ironically wouldn't make me sound like a nutjob and is completely rational being something I can't disclose.    


  For about 4 years I suffered with increasingly severe stress from the isolation that lead to what I can only describe as a kind of emotional agony. It got to the point that I was physically unable to cry myself to sleep anymore. My hair was shedding and I experienced real physical pain in response to emotional stress.  Nobody knows about this other than me. This was extremely difficult for me specifically because underneath my hardass exterior I'm an extremely emotionally vulnerable and sensitive person/ hopeless romantic, possibly the worst combination possible for someone where I am. In addition to this I have severe trust issues from being bullied in my youth, fighting in my teens and my bad experiences with people in general. I have been betrayed numerous times by everyone that was ever close to me and so literally don't trust anyone.   
This went away after I reached a breaking point and just kind of shutdown one day. The next morning I didn't feel lonely anymore, like the part of my brain that desires socialization turned itself off. This happened last year.

  
Recently though, for no apparent reason, it's come back, and all of a sudden I'm beginning to feel alone again.  I thought I'd be able to just keep on going forever, but .. I mean, shit -- here I am.  So yeah, I exist.. I'm alive, a real person. I guess I just wanted to confirm that, I have nowhere else to say it to. I haven't done this in years, so maybe it'll make me feel better and I can just delete this post and move on.",lonely,I.,2019-09-05 02:15:57

1858,exubaficent,1567611323,7,"So I went running today. I don't run often, but I try to keep it to at least once a fortnight. As I was running, I ran past some teenage (highschool) girls. One of them made mocking silly running motions while looking me in the eye and they all laughed. Now, they were just being silly, right? I don't actually run funny?

That's what I would've thought. But...this isn't the first time it's happened. A couple months ago a young girl, about 6 it looked like, did the same thing and her mother apologised as I ran past. And the most damning perhaps, was a couple months before that when I went running with my brother. He was having bit of a rough day and so was irritable, and he seemed kind of embarrassed to be running with me. I asked him what was up and he said something like ""it's just the way you run..."". I asked him to explain, so that if it's wrong or weird or whatever I can fix it. He just went quiet and dropped the conversation.

It feels so unfair. People make fun of me but won't tell me what I'm doing wrong. Is my sense of introspection utterly broken? From what I can tell I don't run strange. But I realised that this metaphor applies to most areas of my life, especially social interaction.

People just tend to treat me as if I'm doing something wrong. Nobody will tell me what, but they still do. It feels so unfair because it seems like they think they're being kind by shielding me from some truth that's invisible to me, but that's hypocrisy, because they still treat me differently. It's like their subconscious says ""ewww he does that differently, shun him"" but their conscious mind is like ""it would be unkind to tell him how mentally handicapped he is"" so the end result is them both shunning me and not telling me how to improve.

I kind of understand the feeling; like if someone has Down's syndrome and people treat them differently, are you going to explain to them the minutia of how fucked they are? No, that would be cruel. But I don't feel like there's anything wrong with me - I mean, there must be, but I don't see it, and nobody will tell me what it is, and that feels condescending and frustrating as fuck.

1884,heyanonnynonny,1567573528,3,"I grew up in a super emotionally unavailable family and went a very long time before I realized that we were so much less affectionate than most families. 
Most days I am happy and comfortable in my life. 

Recently though, I was talking to a guy who seemed like he checked all the right boxes for me. We were so alike, he really seemed like a real option for a long term relationship. I’m talking, almost so right, that I could’ve seen myself making a life with him. 
We started dating, I was ecstatic, and things were going well until a week went by and he hadn’t even tried to hold my hand. Another week goes by... nothing! We were dating a month and I finally just had to end it. He never once even tried to cross more than the “brief full hug” line. I am someone who is usually in charge and confident but still a person who wants other people to initiate as well. I resolved a long time ago that I wasn’t the kind of girl who would kiss first, or make the first move... it just isn’t me. (There is sooooooo nothing wrong with unconventional gender roles, I just wanna be true to myself.) 
When we first had the DTR talk, he told me he might be slow and awkward about physical affection. I told him we would just get there when we got there, because frankly, I was nervous too. I mean kissing... ITS WEIRD... WHERE DO YOUR TEETH GO? 
Anyway... I never dreamed that so many dates and opportunities would go by in the span of a month and he wouldn’t even try anything. I began wondering if he even wanted to touch me, or even if he did would it be because he felt pressured or obligated to. I would probably never trust his touch anyway... so, cut to me letting him off the hook and ending it. 

I feel self aware enough to realize this had nothing to do with me or my desirability. It was all his issue but I had no desire to stick around and wait for him to figure it out. I don’t know much about dating or relationships but I know enough about myself that I want someone who is fully convinced of their attraction to me, not someone I have to beg to touch me. It left me feeling like a brazen hussy, someone who was easy or fast. 

All this to say is that I realized that more than most things I want someone to just want to hold me. I want to feel so connected to someone that we both mutually want to be near and close to each other. I wonder if this is even something that exists? Will there ever be anyone who will want to wrap his arms around me and not rush away out of fear of vulnerability. My parents are not this way... this kind of love was never modeled to me. I’m some ways I don’t even feel deserving of a caring touch. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Up until no-touchy-nervous-Ned I have never dated anyone. I am over 25. 
I feel so incredibly angry at the fact that somehow he seemed so wonderful and the one thing I really deeply wanted he didn’t have. I feel teased. I don’t know what it’s like to have unconditional, non-threatening physical affection. I wonder if someone can actually be starved or deficient in human touch?

1886,Trickerfingers,1567571813,1,"I can say that loneliness is the main source to my mental problems. Im 16 years old and im turning 17 this december so maybe you can think that my problems are not that difficult to solve but anyways. I just started college 1 month ago and it has been really tough.

Loneliness has caused me depression, this is mainly affecting me on school, i have little to no energy whatsoever to go to school or do homework. I sleep everytime i can in school and when im not sleeping im all sleepy, so i can't concentrate in most of the classes and I just don't understand anything. When i get to home im just too tired to do anything.

About the loneliness itself, its weird for me, i hate not having friends and having social anxiety. I guess people is just not interestend in me, there was this girl that talked to me and tried to make a conversation with me on the first day of college, but my poor social skills just didnt allowed me to make a conversation so she just didn't speak to me again and i dont blame her.

At this point, in my classroom all the people have their little friend groups already formed, i just barely talk to the guys that are on my homework team who i also found to just not wanting me to be near them. I have realized that im going to stay alone for the rest of the semester and i have really no problem with that.

Now in the other hand, i really love how quiet and peacefull a is to be alone all day but im really afraid that this love i have for loneliness is going to get bigger and that im not going to be able to leave it anytime soon.

I've been having these problems for two years now, but im posting this now because i been thinking that maybe this is how im going to be for the next 5 years until i graduate from college if it is not the same after I graduated from university.

Thanks for reading, I want to know if someone has a similar situation and I am willing to talk if anyone wants to.

My problem is that I am too comfortable talking to girls I’m attracted to. I talk to them in a normal, non-flirty way that I would talk to my friends that are guys.

Maybe this is one of the reasons I’ve been single my whole life and never even gone on a date or hung with a girl.

I have plenty of friends (girls and guys) and I’m not socially akward or anything. But my friends don’t pay much attention to me other than laughing at my jokes. They make no effort to hang out with me.

I, also, make no effort to get into relationships which causes my loneliness to be depressing. I just talk to girls in a very outgoing and honest way. It’s just my personality I guess...

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

As the title suggests, I choose to be FA. This may get really sad and pathetic but it's something I've been wanting to vent about for such a long time.

I'm 19/F and in terms of looks, I'd say that I'm average. I'm not ugly but not pretty either. I'm not where I want to be in terms of weight and all of that but I'm so damn lazy I haven't been losing the amount of weight I've wanted to. I'm socially awkward and I suffer from a case of RBF (Resting Bitch Face). I think that makes me very unapproachable.

I realize that maybe, I'm just one of those people who isn't worthy of being loved. I mean, I'm a very difficult person. I have trust issues, daddy issues, I'm extremely insecure, I'm lazy and unmotivate, I have a hard time communicating my feelings and issues, and I'm extremely emotional. Like it's very easy to make me cry. These issues have caused problems for every relationship I've had. Mostly my family and friends. It caused problemsin my last relationship too and it just wasn't fair for him to deal with..

I have only been in two relationships and they both were LDR..they didn't last long either. I think they got bored of me honestly, or maybe tired. My last relationship had problems because I wasn't good at communication. I would over think the littlest of things and make up fake scenarios of the ""possibilities"" in my head. I hate that I do. But, I do. 

I just feel helpless. I met a guy who wanted to help but I pushed him away because I thought I wasn't ready for a relationship..but I don't think I'm not made for relationships.

I have a horrible habit of looking for attention from random men online. Just because it makes me feel good for a little. Its a never-ending cycle. I've been called ""easy"" by my ex and best friend and honestly they're probably right. The attention I get is nice temporarily but then the guilt and feeling gross kicks in later. It happens over and over again.

I honestly have a lot of other issues. But all in all, I choose to be FA because I think I'm doing everyone a favor of avoiding a toxic relationship with me. I don't want to hurt anyone or make a relationship way more difficult that it has to be because I have problems.  I feel I'm unlovable and I just really need to accept it.

I ask what is wrong and they tell me that we have came across a large amount of money and that we are rich. We were on the lower part of the middle class so this was a very crazy thing to happen. During the first month we couldn't tell anyone until everything was finalized, so the thoughts of all the things I could get, and all the friends I would get, and all the girls I would have all over me festered into my head. So as soon as school started I told anyone I could. Many people didn't believe me, and the people that did didn't care. Girls just laughed in my face.

It sucks because I really want to enjoy this too, like, I should be happy! a friendship that went bad years ago has finally been thrown in the trash, where it belongs! I'll no longer have to deal with being walked all over and having my problems and feelings shoved to the side by her! I'm slightly less of a pushover! I'm free, fuck you! but I'm just not feeling it.

I guess it's just bad timing on my part, I'm growing up, this will be my last summer as a ""kid"", I'm gonna be 18 in a few months, schools starting back up, a lot to dread, im not doubting that all that may have a hand in why this is hitting me so hard. Still, I know im being sorta irrational, but that doesn't really fix things, im just sitting here feeling stupid on top of feeling lonely.

I guess it just sucks because once upon a time, she was the only friend I really felt comfortable talking about my feelings to, and I don't really feel like anyone else has filled that void after she stopped caring, not yet at least, I can always hope that that perfect person will fall into my lap, cant i?

I’m a pretty bubbly and outgoing person but since being here I haven’t tried hard to make friends or talk much to those around me. Normally I just pop in some earbuds and walk about campus and no one talks to me at all.

Today, however, there was a guy walking behind me and he just started talking out loud. I was the only person near him and I had my earbuds in but when I heard him talking I took one out to hear what he was saying. He was just ranting about how far he has to walk for his classes but he did it in such a friendly and positive way. He seemed to want to keep talking to me but we had to split so we wished each other a good day and that was that. 

But my god what a fantastic interaction with someone I never thought I could interact with. Hot people are intimidating. I hope I see him again, but I’m sure I’m not the only stranger he converses with throughout the day, it seemed so natural for him.

So the thing is I'm unfortunately not from the USA, but from central Europe and i hate this place so much, like so fucking much. I always compare it to being closed in a cage i just feel like i'm wasting my life i still remember when it all started. I still remember when my friend encouraged me to listen to graduation, that was the first album i ever heard i was like 12 by the time, all happened at the school trip. Few days later i cracked daw (daws are basically programs to make music \[ye i wasn't rich somehow\]) and started making my own music i'm pretty sure i was happy back then, i remember we were even trying to start a band with friend (that ofc never happened). Nevertheless around 1 year later we had an argument and it all ended just like that before lessons, somehow i didn't really cared about it (he's chilling and having good time in England after moving out there same year if anyone's curious) and i don't have any idea why, but now i feel effects of this friendship a lot. He changed me, actually he made me a different person, and that became my problem now. Let me explain, in this country i believe 95% of people are same, either empty jerks wearing slim fit t-shirts and listening to pl rap, or people trying to pretend being emo listening to cloud rap/ 80s rock. And now there's this let's say 5% if you are in this 5% and what you like is for example watching nba, nfl, mlb, fashion (especially fashion, nobody cares about it here) or alternative music you are soooo lost and lonely here or you're lucky enough to find friend like i did but it's nearly impossible i'd say. And now it's moment why i decided to write this shit, cause i started high school today and something just... words can't describe it. I feel like i'm in class with 31 robots like literally everyone is the same, it's really fucking scary i left before last lesson i just couldn't stand being there, on the way back to my home i cried like 5 times, now i'm basically crying again in my room. I feel like something just broke inside me for the first time ever after 15 years of being cold blooded bitch i became one of the people i was getting fun of back then and i'm only 15 holy shit. I mean damn life is crazy, but i already got used to being lonely the only thing that i'm worried about is that after my mum found out there's something going on she started crying as well, she had fucking birthday yesterday. Now i don't know if i should start pretending like everything is ok, i also consider quitting this damn school, to spend more time on what i wanna do (making music), but i'm pretty sure i would have to leave this house then, cause everybody execept my mom would hate me. I mean after all that wouldn't be big deal, i don't have like any relation with my dad and sister, and my brother hates me haha. There is also another way and that is to pass first grade so i can go to high school in USA next year, but i don't think i'm able to survive 300 days sleeping 3 hours a day (i have huge sleeping problems) just, because i need to go to this damn building and sit with this bastards for 7 hours, also forget about learning anything, cause teachers are terrible (ofc not like 100% of them). I just don't know what to do for the first time in my life i would love to just cry for whole year.

1940,jayx468,1567504077,297,"I feel for all lonely people but I have come across quite the conundrum when trying to make friends. No one else has posted anything similar as far as I know so I may actually be truly alone in this.

I've had friends before with all genders. Most of those friendships were online but some were not. Most of my friends were men. My longest friendships were with men and all the friendships I had with ladies didn't last long for reasons I'll mention later. I feel it's easier for me to have more things in common and connect more with men than ladies.

I'm straight and I'm not after a relationship with anyone and that has caused problems when it comes to the friend search. When I say I'm looking for a friend I'm looking for only that, not low key looking for a relationship or friends with benefits. When I claim anywhere online I'm looking for friends I mainly get responses from men which isn't the issue. The problem is once you make it clear that you're only after friends and the chance of anything more or sexual isn't going to happen they're just gone. I understand that the desire for romance and sex is common and normal but it feels very isolating when you only want a friend. I just want some someone that genuinely likes me and enjoys my company and would be fine if our relationship progresses or stays the same. Usually if I have any friends it's just one and I don't feel comfortable dating my only friend. It's seems extremely risky and irrational to risk the only friendship you have hoping the same compatibilities you have as friends will carry over into a relationship and remain stable. Like what if you break up? Who are you going to turn to if you have nobody else? Things usually aren't the same when you break up with someone and even if you remain in contact with the person  things may not even go back to being to same as when you were just friends. Being friends with guys already in a relationship seems unnerving to me. I had friends get married and I never hear from them again afterwards and had friends drop me because they have a partner that didn't want them to have female friends because they see them as a threat. I know that shouldn't bother me but I had a lot of friendships end after they enter a relationship even when no one expressed the slightest romantic interest in the other.

When I try befriending ladies they often don't really seem interesting in talking. I've had 3 friendships with ladies and unfortunately our relationship either devolved into them only coming to me for advice about their problems, not taken the advice given and returning for more advice that won't be taken or suddenly disappearing for a while only to return with no explanation and the friendship reverts to just small talk and dies.

It feels so isolating to be on subreddits for lonely or forever alone people when you're not after sex or low key a romantic relationship. I'm a virgin and frankly I can do with or without sex. I know not wanting sex before marriage is underated and will most likely keep me single for a long time or forever and I accept that. I don't do one night stands or being required to have sex with someone just because I'm dating them. I see a bit more value in waiting until marriage to have sex but I know a lot of people look down on that or don't hold that sentiment. Guys say women will always be in demand and that's true but they aren't in demand just for platonic reasons only.

I am no longer looking for friends online and I'm tired of living in a metropolitan area. I want to move somewhere rural or suburban to hopefully be around more seemingly friendly people when I can afford to but after that I don't know what to do. I'm not saying my situation is completely hopeless but I do recognize it as a problem that may go unsolved until some sort of technological advancement if you get what I mean.",lonely,Trying to make friends as a friendless female is harder and more isolating than expected,2019-09-03 19:47:57

I crave intimacy but due to being in the closet it won’t ever happen. I can never be myself because I am not right in the head. I wake up, eat, go online, eat, and go to bed. I need someone so bad because I’ve never had the feeling before. My family looks at me with pity because I never had a girlfriend and secretly make jokes about me being a faggot. They hate homosexuals so it makes me feel even more defeated. Sometimes I just want to scream for what they did to my head without realizing I would never choose this life. It isn’t fucking fair. I have nothing to leave for. My family annoys me so I try to stay in as little contact with them as possible. They remind of my childhood and how pathetic I was and still am.

1948,filipa16t,1567488845,4,"So I just recently graduated Med School and I should be feeling great but all I can think about is how lonely I feel. I've had a tough highschool, with people bullying me and ignoring me, and it really took a toll on me. Even though I started to study more and started having better grades, I think that left me a bit scared and never healed completely. I've taken the same lifestyle throughout medicine, but I've actually made some friends and acquaintances. As time went by, I started to loose these connections and held on to this group of friends that I thought cared about me, but realized that they would cancel plans on me a lot, not invite me to stuff unless I invited myself, would exclude me.. I felt humiliated and a weirdo. I then got a boyfriend who was schizophrenic and had a lot of issues and kept breaking up with me and it shattered me. All my ""friends"" started to get away from me cause they couldn't handle being there for me, cause I was so low after the breakup. And I felt really heartbroken, cause it all came in once. I spent all my days alone, I had no one to talk to, and I was going crazy and was very depressed for months. I've done everything I possibly could to salvage this relationship but I still couldn't do it. I eventually met my current and amazing boyfriend on tinder and it's been quite amazing on that aspect. It's been over a year, but I still feel very lonely. I feel I've grown a lot, changed a lot, and got happier but I'm stuck in the same social situations for the last year and I can't get out. I keep seeing the same people and feel like a disaster for not having made any friends in these 6 years or in highschool. I only have like 2 close friends that live far away, cause the rest I kept losing over the years, no matter how hard I tried to keep them.
I feel very lonely and I think I'm gonna move soon and start over. But in the meantime if anyone wants to talk it would be amazing! I don't know how else to meet new people and it drives me crazy and all this time spent alone makes me feel very depressed sometimes. 
I'm sure there's some other people that feel the same way but are too scared or embarrassed to speak out.

1951,AregularRedit,1567487022,2,"This is my first time posting a story to Reddit so here we go:
I'm about to start school in a day by the time this is out but honestly I don't really care it's the same thing that I felt back then: not knowing everyone and just wandering the halls. My family has something with depression but they never show it. Both of my grandparents have different ways of showing it. One worked there ways up after immigrating here and now lives near a beach. The other ones are in the hood and are stuck there. My parents barely show it and I'm the only one in my family that shows it. Me and my family moved 3 different states before finding a place to stay. Elementary School was a mess and I'm still questioning why I graduated. And middle school was worse. I both juuled and smoked pot to help cope with it, but they did absolutely nothing. I also had a lot of people to ""help me"" and telling me that ""everything is going to be alright"" which is hasn't and the only people that have really helped me was my phycologist, my therapest, my English teacher and my parents but I've just lied to all of them telling myself I was fine when really I wasn't. I just needed help and my friend who I'm going to call liv was a person who was in the same boat as me. I met her though my friend Liam and I told her all my problems and she would help. But ever since she hanged out with her boyfriend more, she just stopped talking to me and idk why. I told her one day that I was crying and all she could say was ""all your other friends can help you"" which to me, said that she didn't want to talk anymore. Even when I'm around friends I always wanted to just walk away because I know that I have no talent to bring to the table. I ditched my other friends and now I am just alone and empty. But if I were to post a picture of me upset or tell them I was crying they would either try to comfort me and instead fed me to my emotions or not even respond or the worst: asking if... U GOOD? Like no I'm not good I just had an emotional breakdown but thanks for asking im just gonna keep crying and lie to you while you have the time of your life. I went to London and that was the only cool part of my summer and the rest was dogshit except for visiting my grandparents. I just stayed by myself playing GTA online and black opps 4. I've been crying in my bed at 12-3 am listening to Frank Sinatra and other sad songs. I can really connect with nature and the ocean because it helps calm me down. I'm not even attractive but I guess there is one girl that I talked to that apreaciates me for who I am and I think also for my looks. We would have some cute moments together but she's been no help either and same thing happened to my other friend: we just stopped talking and idk why. She always talked about a boyfriend which for me, I knew that I was the side chick and I don't know how to feel about this. I'm just in a empty place and just can't wait for high school to end. None of my friends help me, I keep lying to the people who want to help me and the people I trust I can't trust anymore. Anyway if you make it to the end thank you and hope my sad life can make yours a little bit better🙃💔",lonely,Loneliness,2019-09-03 15:03:42

I have a cousin who I play PlayStation with but he’s out having fun with his friends(going to each other’s house, playing basketball, etc) and I’m home talking to my self like a fucking moron. I’m going into my sophomore year and I have YET to find ONE FUCKING FRIEND besides one friend that found their own friend group. And what’s makes me sad is that I KNOW the feeling of being with friends. I’ve been to a friends house a couple times in my life with others and it was some of the best times of my life. And that was like only 2 times. And now it’s almost impossible I’ll ever get a moment like that again. I can’t even make any friends and socialize because of social anxiety and this ADD medicine that makes it even worse, but without the medicine i can’t focus in school that well. I’ve fell out of contact with 95 percent of people from my old middle school who I have known for years. I haven’t even made an effort to contact them. Then I just got accustomed to this loneliness so I don’t like being around other people which makes it WORSE. I have done jackshit this summer except self loathe and talk to myself. I don’t even know if I’m depressed or not I’m probably not because I’m prob just over exaggerating. I got off of Twitter because I realized that the community I centered myself around(Nintendo people mostly) I disagree with or just don’t like because of views and opinions and I feel like ever since I got off of Twitter I started having my own opinions which is good but now I don’t really feel any sense of community. It wouldn’t be that big a deal if I had some fucking real life friends instead of depending on the opinions of people on Twitter who don’t even know me. I’m just ranting because I have no one else to talk to except myself. I mean I have a great family who loves me a great living situation, I’m not bullied AT ALL, and yet I’m still fucking sad all the fucking time and it fucking sucks.

I just want someone I can talk to about everything. I don’t really have friends that I deeply connect with it’s more of a surface level friendship. I spend a lot of time alone. I just want someone that I can share music with and discuss it and vibe to it. I want to feel connected to someone. I want to share my poetry, my thoughts, my art, my passions with someone. I just want another soul to fill a space in my life where it feels empty. 

My last relationship was pretty abusive and it left me all types of fucked up which is probably why I don’t want to be in another one because I’m genuinely terrified of them. But, I do want to be with someone, like have a close companion. I’ve tried dating apps but I didn’t find what I was looking for. They were all surface level connections and it honestly gave me so much anxiety. The pressure of dating apps is weird and uncomfortable. I just want to connect with someone organically. I’m craving intellectual conversations and genuine connections. I guess I miss that part of a relationship but I don’t want the relationship. How do you cope with this?

Now that I'd like to meet someone new, my failed marriage seems to haunt me. The nagging question is, do I really want to put myself out like that again? The answer is ""yes"" after I realized my earlier mistakes. 

I overlooked a lot of character flaws because I wanted to be happy. When you are in that mindset you tend to ignore your better judgement and the opinions of those you trust the most. My friends didn't like her and my family was skeptical. Most of my friends skipped the wedding, which should have sent me a huge message. I knew the drinking, drugs, and tendency to want to cheat were huge red flags, but I thought I was in love. I've moved on from her and want to avoid the same mistakes.

1984,JoeyJoJoHQ,1567464359,19,"I need some sort of human contact. I need some sort of romantic and sexual fulfillment that I'm just not getting. I've been single for most of my life and it's really taken a serious toll on my self esteem. I have a good amount of loving friends that I care about so much, but I don't feel like any of them fully understand what I'm going through, and that makes me afraid to reach out to them when I'm not doing well.  

Every person I've ever had feelings for has rejected me. Most of them have chosen other, better-looking people over me. The few relationships I've been in haven't lasted for more than a few weeks, and haven't been even remotely met my emotional or physical needs. I don't feel like I've ever been anyone's first choice, and I honestly don't even know what to fucking do any more. It's so hard to watch most of my friends and most of the people I've been interested in in loving relationships and just not have anything. I've been making such an effort to be as productive as I can and improve myself. I lost 10 pounds over the summer and started lifting weights most days of the week, but ever since I've come back for my senior year of college I've just felt so miserable. Last night I woke up in the midst of a fucking panic attack over this shit and haven't been able to think straight all day. 

Any time I try to open up to someone the advice I'm given usually boils down to ""learn to be happy on your own"", but I just don't see how to do that. I've been through rejection after rejection since I was in middle school and feel so worthless because of it. I don't think I'm ever going to be in a position to feel complete or happy with myself until I can feel like I'm worth being someone's first choice.

Any time I try to meet new people it's met with radio silence. I've been using Tinder for over a year and haven't gotten a single date. I just don't think I'm photogenic or attractive enough for this sort of app. On the rare occasion that I do get a match the conversation usually devolves into me getting left with a ""haha lol"" or being ghosted. In the past day I've gotten like four matches that immediately unmatched with me before I could even write out something to say. The most likes I've ever been notified of have been 6... am I really only worth *6 people* on the entire planet thinking I'm potentially worth talking to?? 

I really don't know what to do at this point. Even now this post is probably just going to be met with ""that's rough :("". The counseling center on campus is pretty terrible, I'm afraid that if I go there and manage to open up to someone I'll just be told to ""try turning off stress-mode and just learn to enjoy yourself"" or some equally unproductive shit.

1987,KALALEX007,1567460699,2,"I am creating this post in order to gather opinions about the daily routine that focuses in the context of life balance of loneliness and productivity.

So my context is this (the question comes later on)

I am a very social person when I want to socialize, but there are certain days I like to be alone (it just happens randomly like one day or maybe week  like a personal need). 

In my daily routine i do the following, 

Work which i am super fond of and i love doing passionately.(+social)

Physical training, what ever type i feel like doing (alone no music no nothing). I mean okey there are people around (not gym) but i focus to myself when doing so breaths, rhythm etc... I might skip some days due to fatigue as it is logical.

Then afterwards maybe out with friends or home with family and pc (gaming time)

So the question is this:
I have some tasks/objectives that i need/want to complete, which obviously need to be after work. I really would like to get on with them but when ever i am home and there is someone next to me i just don’t feel like doing. But once i feel loneliness or alone like there is nobody at home I instantly get productive and motivated wtf is that?

I am not shy or I don’t want to do it in front of other people or get distracted or disturbed by the people in my house.

I just don’t feel like it, like for some reason i get bored of it suddenly. But when i am alone i can spend hours long doing those things.

It's true, I'm self employed so I don't go to work to see people. I don't keep in contact with high school or uni friends. I just live with my parents but never talk to them so I just work online, go for a walk, buy some food etc. I don't chat to strangers or have small talk with anyone at all while I'm out so most days I don't even speak a word out of my mouth to anyone. It's starting to feel like solitary confinement but the issue is I don't know where to begin in fixing this because it's almost like the desire to change isn't there kind of like how you get stuck in the same routine. This is not a lazy problem it's more of an issue where things would be fine if I was at school or work but I don't want to just randomly go out of my way to find friends in fact I've just become so awkward and have bad anxiety and a bad perspective on the world at this point (which I didn't have before) There's just been this big explosion to information on the internet so all the stories in the world just makes me depressed.

2020,stefefeh,1567400483,3,"I was driving home the other day and had a mild panic/anxiety attack. Almost crashing my pickup truck into the side of the road. Luckily I collected myself enough to get home and calm down. The reason for this was I realised something. I never have been and never will be good enough for anyone. 

I've had one relationship in my life and as soon as the opportunity came they cheated on me. Of course it all went down as soon as I left my home to go to another state for work. I've struggled with dating my whole life. Social awkwardness, pretty damn unattractive, not a party person, not a nightclub person, etc. 

I used to fantasize about having a significant other with a son and a farm to raise him with some dogs. Now I have hold myself back from tears. Knowing that's it's nothing more than that...a fantasy. Now I see my future in more realism. By myself, same farm and maybe a dog more. 

It makes me sad but life isn't supposed happy your keep on until you die. To put it into a simple Star Wars quote "" When your darkness finds you. You will face it alone!"" This came true as almost every single one of my friends have married or are about to and seem to not want to talk anymore. We used to play games together at least once every couple weeks. 

Now I have 2 friends left and they are to marry soon after that...its over. It's been a sense of impending doom in my mind. To make matters worse I was a groomsman in 2 other ""friends"" weddings. So I had to forcibly be happy when I knew what is to come. While yes I am very happy that they were able to find something I can never have, I still feel sad knowing what has indeed happened. 

Alot of times I wonder why I don't just end it all. After all it doesn't matter, I'll never feel the warm embrace of someone who loves you. Loves you like a significant other can. Idk what I did to deserve this but I'm paying for it nonetheless.😔",lonely,Coming to a realization,2019-09-02 15:01:23

**Who Are We?**

We are The Glory Hole, a group of nerds and loners from around the world with ages ranging from 16 to 35 that get together every day to hang out and pass the time. We are a server for meeting new people and making friends, and despite our numbers, we are still a pretty small close-knit group that would love to expand our circle with more unique and interesting people.

**What Do We Do?**

We are a mainly voice-active community, so we spend most of our time chatting together while we play games or go about our day. We run a popular weekly movie night, occasional game nights, Minecraft server, and other special events. There’s plenty of text and media channels to share your interests as well as a variety of voice channels for larger or smaller conversations, watching movies, or playing video games together. 

**Should You Join?**

The Glory Hole has provided us with genuine and long-lasting friendships, and we would love to provide this opportunity to others such as yourself. A group of people like this is an amazing way to make new friends or at the very least fill those lonely evenings up with lots of laughter and other voices. So if you're 16+ and at all interested in joining our group or poking your head in to see what’s up, I welcome you to follow this link to join: [https://discord.gg/H4w58Px](https://discord.gg/H4w58Px)",lonely,"The Glory Hole, a place to make genuine friendships or merely decrease the loneliness.",2019-09-02 12:32:04

2029,actinopterygiii,1567390034,37,"I'm  in high school and I never make friends. Whenever I join a new group or activity I always find myself on the outside looking in, never invited anywhere and excluded. I really try to be a nice person but it gets so exhausting when no one reciprocates. And I think I'm good to know. I'm kind and interested in art and video games, and I love to talk and do things. It's just that I really have zero friends. No one texts me back or even talks to me in real life. It's like they wouldn't care if I disappeared.
Im always eating lunch at school alone just because everyone has their already established friend groups and don't care to let me in. Like it seems like everyone's known each other for years and doesn't really care that I'm around. I feel rotten every time we do group projects and have to choose our own groups because I'm always the last one chosen, even though I get really good grades and I'm near the top of my class (I promise I'm not bragging here). I just wish I had some people who cared and really liked me. I want to feel important to someone. I'm introverted , I'll admit I don't need to always be with people. But it's so soul crushing to be alone day after day and never have plans. The reality is if I just stopped talking to people forever they wouldn't care. Im not noticed or liked.
Some days I just sit in my room and cry until I fall asleep. because I know the reality is I'm never going to be included or part of a group. My whole life is going to be lonely like this. It's probably my fault , anyway, since everyone tells me all the time what I'm doing wrong. All I want for this year is to maybe make a few friends and have a boyfriend.

2030,hamartiated,1567389725,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

For the past few months I have been keeping myself busy. This past few weeks was really great because I started making cards, sending and receiving them and it took my mind off any negative thoughts. But today, I broke down after finishing an episode of Go Go Squid! 
I am 27F and have been single my whole life. Never dated once, never had anyone flirt with me or just seem interested in me. The one best friend who doesn’t really care about relationships and love just got into a relationship(very sudden) last month. Surrounding me, my friends are either coupled, or engaged or married. 

I used to love romance - books, movies and the idea itself. However, I realised that it planted so much unrealistic expectations and thoughts in me that it broke me. I was ever so hopeful that by now I would have found someone. That someone that you see on TV; that someone who looks at you differently that everyone can tell he’s in love with you, that someone who would take a leap for you etc. Sometimes I don’t know if I like the idea of a boyfriend because I don’t want to be the odd one out, or I want to feel and be loved so badly.

Maybe it’s that my husband and I have frequent rough patches, or the cumulative stress of my family life that batters me down weekly.

I dunno. That’s a little self centered I guess. Part of me feels like I’d be better off alone. Hubby said he hadn’t been happy with me for a long time now the other day.

Afterall, I don't care about sharing my life with everyone else and I couldn't care less about other's lifes, so why have Instagram?

One week has passed and I can already *feel* the improvements on my life. I no longer waste time on social media, no longer have that addiction of constantly checking my feed, even in the middle of other hobbies and tasks, and most importantly I don't compare myself to others anymore because I have little to no information at all about other's lifes. Now I just talk to some friends through Whatsapp and that's it. That's what's needed to truly communicate anyways.

If any of you are having doubts about deletig Instagram or not, just do it. If it's not making you comfortable you should get rid of it. Your life will become so much better and calmer. You can completely stop worrying about it and you can just chill.",lonely,My life improved a lot after deleting Instagram,2019-09-02 04:00:48

I look around and all I can see or think of is her. My car, every room in the house, we share some kind of memory and it’s painful to think about. It’s funny that I didn’t realize how bad things have gotten until it was to late. I didn’t even know I how I really felt about her until she was already gone. However, now I figure it’s time for me to move on and go somewhere new.

Got a new job up north in some small town in Michigan. The pay is good, the town is very small, and my current wife only lives a few hours away from the new town. The real reason I’m getting this job is to hopefully prove to her that I’m willing to change and do what I can to win her back. Probably won’t happen, but I’m hopeful.

This new job and a new location is probably what I need tho. Sort of a fresh start. Even though I don’t know anyone or have anybody to talk to, it’s still a bit exciting to think about. Only real problem is the fact that it’s hard for me to make new friends in person. I’m one of those awkward social types.

Let's say I'm reason of your happiness, I can't leave you now.. Because you will shrink, you don't have happiness of your own. So I don't want this boundary. If I look at another person, if I go with another person you will suffer...

Lonely person's don't have happiness to give, all they want is to receive it from someone.

If you love some girl or guy just make them happy... And be happy that they're happy.. But you want them to love you otherwise you are not happy for them.. This is not love.

That's why it's necessary to love yourself, if you don't love yourself you can't love anyone else.

Even though after years of hating myself I've finally accepted myself and felt happy with who I am it's obviously not enough because no matter what I do I'm not good enough for anyone. It's never changed. Every time I meet a new group of people I'm always on the outside. Never anyone's favorite or best friend. I literally don't have friends even though I try so hard to talk to people. I'm constantly ignored and rejected by anyone I like. 
I can't take it anymore. I really can't do it. I'm lonely every second of my life and nothing will help. Just a hug from a friend, or a text, or something would do so much but I know I don't deserve anyone's sympathy or care. It's so crushing and unbearable. Because no matter what I do I know it won't replace or distract from how badly I want friends and people that value me. For once I want to be on the inside. To be the one people care about. Not just disposable and forgotten and excluded. No one cares about me. No one thinks about me when I'm gone and I know this for fact. No one would care if I just disappeared.
I feel like I have no right to be angry even though it's exactly how I feel. I'm angry that no one cares. That people feel they can treat me any kind of way. I want them to be sorry about the way they ignore me because I know I deserve better. But I probably don't anyway. 
Anyway I'm in high school and I just want to make it not such a waste. I want to make friends that will miss me when I go to college. I want to have a boyfriend that really loves and cares about me, even if it doesn't last forever. I just want to be cared about. I want to be good enough.

I recently adopted a puppy. Her name is Monkey. I'm not sure what breed(s) she is but she is a light brown short haired medium sized puppy. Since getting her and having her to greet me when I come home is VERY helpful and gives me someone to give and get true love and attention. 

I am single. About 3-5 months ago had a really bad break up. We had been together a good chunk of time. (almost 6 years) It devastated me. Crushed me in every imaginable sense. I still think about how good it felt to get a hug when I came home. Hold at night. Someone to just chill and be stupid like we are ment to be. I don't have the same drive to even live anymore much less to love anymore.

I am lost in this reality and I think that is OK. I hope it is.

2093,hughlyhuge,1567309777,3,"Now, I'm a young person. I'm going into my senior year of high school. Throughout my life, I've moved about 13 times, and in I've changed school systems in high school 3 times (freshman year, sophomore year, and now junior year where I am finishing my senior year). Being indian I should be connected to my culture, but I'm not. I've tried, but I feel like an outsider, i feel like i dont belong. I taught myself hindi, punjabi, urdu, but it didn't matter. People mock me for my accent when I speak hindi, so I dont speak to many people, and I just feel like I've been left without a community. I feel like a stump with no roots. While everyone who mocks me and looks down on me had and still has the support system to keep them grounded, to help them grow, I don't have anything. I hate complaining, in fact, I try to never complain about anything. I remember recovering from a tonsillectomy, and refusing to say I was in pain, as i didn't want to bother anyone. Im not worth it. Having moved so much, it was difficult to make friends (I was supposed to be the funny one who made people laugh), and I never got invited to things. I never had the experience of having a good group of friends, of partying in high school, or just having someone to talk to about anything really. Talking to my parents is nearly impossible, as although I love them they are either cold or condescending towards me. I understand though, that because of the culture they were raised with, that affection is difficult, and I still love them, but I feel emotionally starved. I mean, I've gotten this far, but I feel like it was all for nothing. I have good grades, I should be the ideal student,  but i feel almost dead inside. I feel trapped, running on a hamster wheel while I see everyone pass me. I feel like no one would care whether I was around or not. People push me down whenever they get the chance, whether it be using me as the butt end of the joke, or just snuffing me out of things or not giving credit when credit is due. I've never been told I meant anything to anyone, and when i see the kids at school with their supportive friends and friendly teachers who've known them all their lives (whereas since I've moved so much I know teachers for one year), with their supportive families, I feel like crying.  The nicest thing someone has said to me was that I was ""smarter than I looked"", although they meant it sarcastically. Im not supposed to need support, I'm supposed to be able to handle everything by myself, but it's just too difficult sometimes. I feel like all of my friendships are either one sided or they try to use me, and so I end up just staying in my room, reading, doing my homework, or staring into space hating myself. I don't usually sleep till 4 am, I can't fall asleep sooner because I've filled my mind with thoughts about myself (how useless i feel, how i don't matter, how no one ever talks to you because you're a waste of space, how youre a fat good for nothing pile of crap), and as a result I don't find any peace. I've tried to do things to help myself, but no one wants me. My family thinks I'm a disgrace (that's just how it feels, I don't talk to them anymore), and my parents are just disappointed in me. I feel like screaming, but it doesn't really matter anymore. No one listens. It doesn't feel like anything will get better, and I'll have to continue to bottle up how I feel every day, but I'm thankful that at least here I can vent anonymously. I just felt that I needed to get it off of my chest somewhere (anonymously thankfully). Now I know no one here cares, but I just felt it was the only place to just vent.

She knows more about me than any other human in existence and the same is applicable in reverse. I put my walls down and made myself vulnerable and I got a best friend. 

The other day when I was apologising for the 100th time for being a bother for worrying her because she noticed I've been down this past week, she told me ""You're not forcing me to worry about you, I'm not going anywhere and neither are you, because you're my best friend"". Now no one has called me that before, so my first reaction was ""why"" but I didn't tell her that. 

I'm really worried that my own self doubts will lead to me subconsciously sabotaging this friendship because I don't think I'm worth anyone's time.

2134,Anon2608,1567269082,3,"tl/dr: 22 y/o Male. Feels like he's forced to stay in his bedroom his whole life. Sees it as a prison. Attempts to make friends or anything to do with the outside world haveo failed. Also big alcohol problem.  I hate living this way.

22 y/o male. For starters, I have no friends. I've tried getting out of my shell multiple times. I went to multiple parties where i was invited by my brother or step brothers. Each time i got wasted and tried to ""make friends"". And of course it didn't work I just seemed like a pathetic loser. I've never understood how people make friends and never will understand it. 

I hate this life. My bedroom feels like a prison I can't escape. Living at home all my life and don't like interacting with my family means I feel super uncomfy leaving my room. Leaving the house makes me feel even more uncomfy because I have no business being in the outside world unless it's for a direct purpose such as grocery shopping. 

I just hate this!! Why can't things be like the movies. I wanna go to cool bars and drink and have adventures with friends and stuff. I've been confined to my bedroom my whole life... I also have a huge drinking problem. Like potentially-life-threatening-if-i-keep-it-up-for-10-more-years type alcoholism.  It just gets rid of the lonely feeling. I don't wanna quit necessarily, but I want to do it less often and only socially.",lonely,Is life supposed to be this boring...?,2019-09-01 02:31:22

When I went to school, there was a problem: I had no one to sit with at lunch. Now at my old school, I actually sat with some people (we didn’t really talk, I just sat there) so at least I could eat without being thought of as pathetic but here, on the first day, I sat alone and I was on my phone. At the end of lunch, my counselor (she’s really nice) asked me if I sat with anyone today and I said no.

That didn’t sit with her so basically the next day, she set me up with a lunch table and I basically had to sit next to the table in a chair (there was no space left). I, as you might’ve expected, did not talk and they didn’t either so it was more pathetic than me just sitting by myself.",lonely,I’m pathetic,2019-09-01 02:20:10
2136,wantingalife,1567267489,3,"I'm a 21 year old guy living in a rural part of the U.S. Growing up, there was nobody in my hometown the same age as me, no stores or places to go to for entertainment, nothing except being surrounded by trees. Overall it was a very quiet, conservative small town.

In high school, I had a class size of 36 students. We all came together from about 7 different neighboring towns. In school, we only had the basic classes, Math, English, Science, etc. No elective classes, no clubs, nothing to be a part of except for sports which weren't for me. Most of the student participated in at least one sport, while I just sat back and watched. The entire town our school was located in, would come to every soccer, basketball, and baseball game. Everyone knows everyone. Basically, if you did not play a sport, you were and outcast, that was me. I got to watch as my classmates made the most out of there high school years, while I just went home after school everyday with nobody to hang out with. In fact, every single weekend of my high school career, I never once had an opportunity to hang out with someone. I just sat in my bedroom staring at the wall, or wandering out in my backyard. That pretty much sums up my time in school.

I did go to college for one year. It was a small community college. I was really hoping this could be my chance to make a new friend. Nope. Everyone at that college was from the surrounding area, and everyone had their group of friends they brought with them. Pretty much the same as high school. I really did try to meet new people. I would walk around campus, to the cafe, library, through the halls, everywhere. There were a few clubs, but when I finally thought I had the courage to join one, I would walk by the doorway to the room, see all the people in there, then chicken out. My anxiety beat me again, and I just walk to my car and wait til the next class, which I did every day.

I got really tired of college, so I dropped out and got a decent job in a manufacturing facility. It was much better than my best day in high school or college. I work there 5 days a week, and take any overtime I can get. I am the youngest person working there, the next oldest is like 37. This is pretty much the first time people actually talk to me. And I loved it. I love working because it is my only time I get social interaction. In fact, for a while I didn't like not being at work because I had nobody to talk to. I got a promotion, and I am now a mechanic. Everything was going great for once.

I am also gay. I wish I wasn't but I am. There is a push on me to keep the family name going, as I am the last male in the family. Well, it's not going to happen. I really wish I could have a child. I am trying to accept all of this but it's really difficult. I have only told a few people my secret. I have also never been in a relationship either. The only gay guys I know are quite feminine (not that there's anything wrong with that) but not my type. Any dating app I've used is filled with people that just want to hook up, which I also don't want. I want a serious, long term, monogamous, relationship. Someone I can share my life with. And my looks aren't keeping that from happening, I am very confident with my appearance. 

So thus far in my life, I've had no friends. (I have people I talked to in school), and never been in a relationship. At least I have a job I like.

Over time, the enjoyment of work wore off, and I was feeling like my old depressed self. I took to drinking and pot, and pretty much used those as my only source of enjoyment. 

I still live near my hometown, and It kills me to see everyone I grew up with living there lives to the fullest, while I just sit in my living room chair and watch youtube, and waste my youth. People tell me to put myself out there, and meet new people. Well, that's easier said than done. Also, growing up, every adult in my life, loved the fact that I was so quiet and reserved, when all I wanted was to do stupid shit with the friends I wish I could have had. I always hated it when adults would call me a loner and a homebody, like it was a complement or something. I really didn't feel like I had anyone on my side, and still don't.

Right now, when I'm not at work, my fun consists of going to my mothers house to be in the company of another person. I am so sick of this endless, funless, cycle I'm in, and I don't know when it will end. I always have a little bit of hope that things will get better, but that hope is fading.

I do however, have one hobby I really enjoy. I have always loved music, and am currently learning to play guitar and piano. Almost everyday I imagine, creating a cool song, and playing in front of people, and hearing them say, ""He's a pretty cool guy!"" But that's probably just a dream.

I'm at the point now where I crave any human interaction I can get. I might take my time grocery shopping, hoping I might be able to be brave and strike up a conversation with a stranger. But it never happens. When my phone goes off my heart skips a beat hoping someone might be asking to hang out, but it's just my mother texting me about something I don't care about. I recently got a two bedroom apartment because there were a few people I know that want to get a roommate. I asked them if they'd live with me, they said they would, but they all backed out. So now I have a bigger lonelier apartment all to myself. 

I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm so lost. I have no memories to look back upon, nobody to go to when I'm having a bad day, and depression is taking away my one enjoyment which is music. The future seems scary to me. I don't know why all this is happening to me, I want to know what friendship is like, what love is like. There's obviously wrong with me. I'm a good looking guy, I have a steady job, I'm nice, respectful, and trustworthy. All I know is this loneliness is killing me. I have so much to offer, but no one to share life experiences with. It really hurts me when I hear people talk about crazy things they've done with their friends, and I do my best to hold back my tears because the things they talk about are things I have only dreamed of doing, but to them it's just another Friday night. 

I feel like I'm starting to go insane and it seems like there is no way out.",lonely,I feel like my life has gone to waste.,2019-09-01 02:04:49
2137,only-he-stands-here,1567266299,61,"I'm 37, male, have nobody I can really call a friend and feel extremely lonely.

1 year ago I moved from Canada to Europe, to live in the very large and lively city of Berlin. Since I've been here, I have realized I never really learned the social skills to make friends.

Even back home in Canada, I really only have 1 person I could actually say is my friend. You could consider me a workaholic. If I'm not at work I always busy myself with some other projects. Home repairs, motorcycles, bicycles, electronics projects, sewing, open source software, photography, hiking... ECT.

I have people I could ask to do things, but I never write or ask them to do something because I always feel like I would be bothering them by asking, or that they will think it's strange that I'm asking them to do something because we're not friends and honestly, I don't know why someone would even want to be my friend. I have the feeling constantly that people don't actually like me, and are only nice to me at work or in other social situations because they have to be. 

I suffer from imposter syndrome at work and always think my coworkers will somehow figure out I'm a fraud, even though I have 10 years of experience and am quite capable in my field.

I had a girlfriend for several years, but was never actually attracted to her or wanted to be in a relationship with her. I just didn't want to be alone. Everytime I've actually had genuine feelings for a woman, they have never been returned. This has left me thinking that there must be something broken in me because I always end up falling in love with women who don't love me back.

As a very young child my mother left me and moved several hundred Kilometers away. It just happened suddenly. One day I woke up and she was gone and I didn't see her again for several years afterwards.

In the meantime my father remarried. His wife turned out to be a horrible human being. She was very physically and emotionally abusive to my sister and I. Things like getting thrown down a flight of stairs when you are 7 years old leaves a mark.... nuff said. That marriage lasted until I was old enough to fight back. One day I decided to hit her back and broke her nose. She move out a few days after and I never heard from her again.

My dad was always at work and really just didn't pay attention to the situation. He just drank beer until he fell asleep. He has suffered from extreme depression his entire life.

In school I was bullied constantly and never had any friends. I was always angry and withdrawn, which was understandable considering what was going on at home. Because of this I never really learned how to socialize well. I eventually quit highschool because being there gave me so much anxiety I couldn't see straight.

As a teenager and into my early 20s I did copious amounts of Drugs. By 14 I was doing 8 balls of cocaine and selling weed to finance my habits.  I moved out at 16 to become a full time drug dealer with a woman who was 26 at the time. By 18 I was a full-time Crystal Meth user.

Somehow, at about 22 I pulled my head out of my ass, quit drugs, went back to school, and became an electrical engineer. At 22 years old I started at a grade 8 education level.


Career wise I've managed to be fairly successful, although no matter how many projects I successfuly complete, I always feel everything I do is shit, although my coworkers always comment about the high quality of my work.

Being here in a foreign country has made really think about who I am, and what it is I actually like. I'm trying to make friends by doing activities with various groups on a regular basis. (Playing frisbee, learning German, photography) but I always leave after the events are over as I always think people don't actually want me there.

I'm constantly plagued with the feeling that people won't like me, or that I'm not worth getting to know, because eventually they will find out that my life was quite fucked up and sad. They will probably correctly assume I have emotional problems because of it all.

I would also really like to start another relationship, and one day have a family, but how can that ever happen for me when I always feel I have nothing to offer.

I guess I wrote all that junk to give the claim ""I don't know how to make friends"" some context. I know I never learned the skills to nurture healthy relationships, and at 37 I'm just realizing this now.

As a side note, my life from the outside looks pretty good. Good job, fit, smart, I'm even quite an attractive guy, although I'm on the short side.

To give you an idea of my work ethic, I've managed to learn to speak German fluently inside of one year, with very little accent. Germans are constantly shocked at how good my German is. I've even been mistaken a few times for a native speaker.

Any advice is welcome. It was helpful just to write all this junk anyway.",lonely,Never learned how to make friends,2019-09-01 01:44:59
2138,doctahrank,1567265582,2,"Hey y'all. So lonliness is one of those things, for me, that I always wallow in, yet I don't seem to do anything to try and change my situation. In my head, I know that if I don't reach out to people in some way and put myself out there, the situation will never change for the better, but I seem incapable of actually making any effort. But! I know this has to change. It feels good sometimes to feel bad for yourself, but at some point, something's gotta give, right? 

So I thought it would be interesting to chronicle my journey to try and heave myself out of this ditch, and rejoin the living, in a way. I don't know how exactly I'm going to do that though. So I thought it would be cool if we could kind of give each other tips and advice on how to find your tribe (does such a thing even exist? it must, right?), and anyone who wants to could also kind of check in here on what they're doing to slowly fill that void, no matter how long it might take.
