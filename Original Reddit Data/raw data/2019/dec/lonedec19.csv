14,yoojin1222,1577785295,1,"I love to love and be loved. 
I don‚Äôt like to say this with my own mouth because it sounds like I‚Äôm trying to make myself look good but I‚Äôll say it. I am kind and caring. Two words that I used to look up and aspired to be but now feel like shackles and I‚Äôd rather be selfish and feel less. 

I am in no means trying to make myself look good, I‚Äôm just trying to paint the picture so please do stay if it doesn‚Äôt get too obnoxious.

I am in a sense kind. To me the kindest people in the world are those who do things even if they don‚Äôt want to. Let‚Äôs say there is a chair on the bus and someone stands up to give it to someone else. A person who doesn‚Äôt mind is kind but to me the kinder person is the one who really doesn‚Äôt want to but still does it. 
I am often in the middle. I take joy in knowing I am helping or making someone‚Äôs day better. I go out of my way to smile and treat people respectfully hoping to myself that these small acts will make someone‚Äôs day a bit better. 

But true kindness is doing things that wouldn‚Äôt be rewarded they say. 

I don‚Äôt expect lavish gifts or rewards for my actions but I do hope that whomever would at least be a bit grateful for me going out of my way to do something for someone even if I don‚Äôt really feel like it. And to strangers it‚Äôs all the same. I‚Äôm just hoping they may be a bit happier. 
But to friends and family? 

I go out of my way to stretch myself thin so as to be of help to my loved ones. For instances my family. I live far away from home, my family although is kinda financially stable it sure could see some better days. I work two jobs and ask no support from my parents. They say they‚Äôd send me some but I tell them to do so when we get more stable. I take care of the housework and try to help my brother in anyway. (I live with my older brother who although a good human being isn‚Äôt really a responsible person.) to be honest I came here for college so I could ease my parents worries about my brother who was living alone. I got into the third best university in korea to make my family proud. I try so hard to maintain a good appearance so that I could be a friend and family member to be proud of. 
I‚Äôd make time in a very busy schedule to hang out with friends and give them the attention, time, and effort. 
Example, it was my friends birthday. I had work in the morning and a test the next day but I just crammed as much study time the week before just to make time to properly be able to celebrate her birthday.
There are many more instances like these. With my aunt, with coworkers, etc. 
And in the end of the day I sit back and hope that they will appreciate my efforts.
But my birthday was on the 22nd my aunt whom I time and time again helped when she was in a pinch asked me to work an 9 hour shift when she tells me all the time how wonderful of a boss she is and how, when her other workers have birthdays she gives them a day off. But I who was there from the day she opened her business, was there to help her settle, I who crashed my health hoping that it would be easier for her, I who by the simple fact that I love my aunt would work 6-7 days a week so she could settle down, gets a worse treatment than a part timer who started a month back?? The same goes for my family and friends. All I got is a text of ‚Äúhappy birthday.‚Äù 
I know that I in sense am not kind if I expect a sort of reward. But today I got an angry call from my mother saying ‚Äúoh? So now that you are 20 you think your so grown up? You think that now that you are an adult you can do whatever you want?!‚Äù
And the answer is no. I am a child who craves love and recognition. I lay at night and cry myself to sleep because I am tired. So so very tired. I was thrown to adulthood and I am trying to do my best but things just slip by my fingers and I am sad how I am at the flower of my youth and I am wasting it away. 
I think I‚Äôm depressed to be honest. I‚Äôve been like this for the longest time, probably middle school. But I just want someone who appreciates the small and big things that I do. Someone who I am enough for. 
Someone to tell me that I‚Äôm doing good and that they are proud of my accomplishments. 
I just want to be loved. I have many friends and a wonderful family. 
But I have no one who looks at me. Like really looks at me. I am not the happy, pretty girl I show everyone. I study late into nights to get good grades. I work endless hours to support my brother and I. I work so so hard to be as attractive as I can be. And all for who? All for what? 
I guess this is all just angsty 20 year old talk but even if my brain understands that I might be being stupid the fact that I feel so empty and sad does not change. 
Does anyone else feel this way? Do you need me to listen to you just like you read through my ginormous monologue? Maybe we can hear each other and make ourselves a little less lonely? 
I don‚Äôt know all I want to say is thank you for reading this helluva of a long rant. I hope that for as sad as I am you the reader is as happy. 
Hoping the New Years is going to be a new start for all of us. 
Please be happy. And one last time thank you.",lonely,I feel so alone even if I have a lot of friends and a loving family.,2019-12-31 20:41:35

22,Shiprecker,1577780962,1,"In my head I dream of the perfect one, my true love, my other half. The one to make me whole, that gives me meaning and purpose.

Then realizing that I'm already enough, that it's all in my head. That I shouldn't let past failures and experiences get to me but they do...they sneak up on you like a shadow. Who just follows you wherever you loneliness leads in the grand expanse of your mind.

Your mind, a tool it is. Tools sometimes need mending and maintenance. Especially after going through intense ordeals, like a break up, a rejection, or out right heartbreak. 

You begin to hear thoughts like, your ugly, useless, pathetic, unworthy of love....that's not you...it's your shadow keeping you down. But it's there for a purpose, listen to your shadow. It's letting you know that there is something wrong, something that needs time to mend, to learn, and to grow beyond. 

You can wallow in self-pity or you can have healthy dialog with your shadow. Show it that deep down you are worthy. Worthy of love, recognition, respect, etc. 

Recognize that you are your own best friend, love yourself, especially in times of distress and loneliness. Where you think of thoughts of  sadness, heartbreak and even death/self harm.

It's not easy and takes practice, even then there are really bad days and moments where you just want everything to stop, end, begone, to no longer exist.

That is the time where you need to ask yourself, why do I feel like this? What happened that it's gotten so bad? What steps that I need to take to make myself feel better? To be happy again and not extremely lonely?

That is something each and everyone of us needs to do some introspection on and find the answer This is a solo journey in becoming whole on your own, well for me it is anyway....I see a therapist bi-weekly. But she can only do so much in a given time.

Any-who, just some thoughts I had as I was dealing with a big episode of feeling so lonely it physically started to hurt. Then I start to just type this post out and it ended up being advice/thought/ideas I really needed to just tell myself. To get out of that vicious downward spiral of  ""I'm worthless"" ""No women will ever find me attractive"" ""I'm unlovable""  ""What is the point of keeping going day after day"" ""I'll never be able to trust anyone again""  to the point where it just gets ridiculous and you know you need to get those thoughts out somehow before they kill you.

So yea, that was the point of this post. As I type this I'm feeling a bit better, the crippling loneliness is still there but it's no longer just building up and brooding inside.

Hope this helps someone else that is in the same boat as I am. Dm's are welcome if anyone needs to vent. I'll listen/help if/when I can.

 i have adhd and social anxiety. because of my adhd i can sometimes be quite unaware of many things happening, for example, in a social situation. usually my head is somewhere else, and when i talk with other people i sometimes get distracted midway so it take some time to make my point. my impulsiveness also leads to many awkward situations. 

around the age kids develope social and emotionally i got very overwhelmed, since i got bullied many times before + the lack of friends i had made me feel less valuable (?). when i was 12 i got diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. 

since then i just push people away. it's not that i don't want to be with them, it's just that i don't feel the energy to try, and i'm not sure if i'm able to give them a good time either. because of that i became even more socially akward. because of depression u stop taking good care of urself and it made people bully me even more. i didn't go to school because of that, ended up failing the schoolyear and had been sent to another one. that's where i picked everything up again, i got productive again and beat depression.

76,Axxygen,1577755476,1,"This text is long. It‚Äôs basically my life in the last ten years, my ups and downs. Feel free to read or ignore but I cleared my mind writing that and that‚Äôs already enough for me. 

In 2010 I was 10 years old, confident, innocent and happy I‚Äôm pretty sure. I guess when you‚Äôre that young there‚Äôs not much to worry about. I was really good in school, always had the best grades and parents couldn‚Äôt be prouder of me. 

Fast forward to 2012, I got accepted to the best high school in my region and I was excited to start a new page in my life. I remember being super confident and thinking that I was going to make loads of friends. At first it went like that, I met a lot of cool people and I felt connected to them. Something was off though, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was ever a part of them but more like outsider looking at them.

Next year, 2013, I was put in a new class, I liked the people I was with, they were funny and interesting but I still felt like I didn‚Äôt fit in. That‚Äôs also the year my grades started to be lower. For the first time in my life I was failing a class and I didn‚Äôt know how to tell my parents, I felt like such a disappointment to them. So like any kids would do, I tried to hide it, it worked for a while but then they found. I got grounded for afterwards and I started isolating myself from everyone. I wanted to have good grades but the pressure of succeeding was too much for me and I got really anxious. 

2014 was a low point in my life. Even though I met a friend that is still to this day my best friend, let‚Äôs call him H cause I will refer to him later in this story, that year was the worst. I remember going in this school year thinking I was going to get better but it just got worst. I kept failing every math test and my parents were clearly fed up with it. I knew how disappointing I was but no matter how hard I studied I kept failing. I also remember vividly a moment this year were I was in my kitchen, my parents weren‚Äôt home, and I just hold a knife to my throat, sobbing, and seriously thinking about just ending it all. Fortunately I gave up, I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to do that, I remember thinking at the time that I was a coward but today I‚Äôm grateful for it. Those suicidal thoughts kept happening for a couple of years, just wondering ""what if I just died right now""; ""would people even care?"". I was really, towards the end of the school year I managed to get my shit together and passed the year. This summer, I played soccer, I didn‚Äôt play it competitively since I was 9 or 10 so I was worried about it. Let me tell you, this didn‚Äôt help, my dad, whose really competitive, always had something bad to say about how I played no matter if we won or not. This has given me a lot of anxiety and lowered my self esteem by a lot. 

2015 is a year were I decided to let myself go a little bit. I was tired of being watched by my parents so I decided to care a lot less about everything. At least that‚Äôs what I told myself, on the inside I was still stressed about everything but I decided not to show it. The year went smoothly if were talking about grades, I wasn‚Äôt excellent but I passed everything which was an improvement. My friend H also showed me one his friend, let‚Äôs call him L. L was a nice guy but he seemed troubled, a bit like me, but I wasn‚Äôt showing it. I didn‚Äôt want to talk with him about that but it was clear. Us 3 met a lot that year and spent a lot of time together. For the first time in forever I felt free, free from responsibilities, free from anxiety, free from everything, in a way they might have saved me and they don‚Äôt even know that. 

2016 was the last year of high school, I was happy about that but scared about the future, what would happen to with the people I know from school? A friend of H and L who happens to be a girl started hanging out with us, let‚Äôs call her J. She was kind and always nice with me, over time I started developing some feelings for her but I was unsure about how I felt so I never said anything. In the middle of that she got a boyfriend and I thought to myself well there‚Äôs that. But two weeks later they broke up and I was kind of happy. I decided to talk with L and H about how I felt and they told me I should be honest with her. To be honest that‚Äôs not what I was looking for, I wanted them to tell me to not say anything. One afternoon I grew some balls and told her how I felt. She told me that like our friendship but didn‚Äôt think we should be more. I was hurt but I just shook my head and said that I understands that. As the year went by we talked less and less, I just felt like I fucked everything by saying that. That same year L made some new friends which me and H weren‚Äôt really trusting but couldn‚Äôt force him to leave them. He started doing drugs and drinking a lot, we tried to tell him to stop but he wasn‚Äôt listening

As 2017 began I was scared, I was now in college in a brand new environnement, with new people. The year had barely began that I read on the news that the cops were looking for a teen in our area who had disappeared, when I saw the picture my blood froze, it was L. Immediately I read the article, apparently he left his house late at night and never came back. I texted him but no answer. A couple of days later one of the people I knew from high school told me they found him he was okay but at home and his parents wouldn‚Äôt let anyone talk to him. I was stressed, what had happened? I tried to focus at school but couldn‚Äôt, H didn‚Äôt know much more either. Maybe a month after that incident H texted me a number and told me to call if I wanted to talk to L. I got out of one of my classes and called the number. It was psychiatric house, I asked for him and we talked. He explained to me that he went out of his house that day to meet his other friends, the smoked a lot and drank even more. He got in a fight somehow and was brought to the hospital where he punched a doctor because he thought the doctor was tryin to hurt him. He was later on diagnosed schizophrenic and had to be held in a psychiatric house for a long period of time, plus he had to go to court for assault on the doctor. Learning all that at the same time just made me speechless, I didn‚Äôt know what to say I felt responsible for not saying something before it was too late. I might have been able to help him I never said anything. I kept calling him every Friday, it was the only day he could receive calls, but it was hard talking to him knowing he was in such a bad state. This made me really depressive, I talked to some people in school, sometimes texted H, but other than that I just isolated myself from everyone. I didn‚Äôt want to deal with what the world had to offer.

2018 wasn‚Äôt much different, I would‚Äôve loved for it to be a positive year but it wasn‚Äôt. I honestly can‚Äôt recall hanging out with someone more than 2 or 3 times that year. I was scared. I didn‚Äôt want to go out, meet new people, even just text those people. That year I also turned 18, which is a pretty big deal here since I can legally drink, but I didn‚Äôt have the heart to do it, I didn‚Äôt want to turn out like L did. Most of the things teenagers would do like drinking, smoking and partying I decided to avoid. That year was pretty shit honestly, I was supposed to finish college but I failed some classes and had to do one more semester. My parents pretty much gave up on me that year, the golden boy that I once was was now replaced by this sad teenagers. Admittedly they know nothing that I just wrote about, I don‚Äôt like to share with them, I feel like I‚Äôm always judged by them. The year ended like it began, without hope. 

2019 felt like an important year. I got back in touch with L who‚Äôs doing well now and thinking about going back to school. H is still talking to me, we try to hang out but our schedule never really match. I should go to university next semester to study in psychology and I‚Äôm really happy about it. I started going to the gym at the beginning of November. I always heard about people saying how good for your morale it was to go train and I always felt skeptical of that. They might have been right cause I feel way better now. I also got back in touch with some high school friends and started hanging with them. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly regaining my confidence and it‚Äôs the best gift I could‚Äôve asked for. I haven‚Äôt done anything special but I‚Äôve never felt this good in long long time and this makes me hopeful for the future honestly. I‚Äôm still stressed but less anxious about stuff. For the first time I want to live my life, I used to say that I didn‚Äôt care if I was to die tomorrow but now I want to live and experiment, I want to make others happy and help people who struggle. I haven‚Äôt been the person in the last decade but O want to do more in the next one. I still think about that day when I was holding a knife to my throat ready to end it all and I‚Äôm so happy I didn‚Äôt have the balls to do it. I know how loneliness affects a person, how you can isolate yourself from people for no good reason but I also know that you‚Äôre the only one suffering for that. Everyone has to learn at their own pace, it may take you a year, 5 year or even 20 year, but we‚Äôre lucky to be here no matter how hard life is it deserved to be cherished. This was not supposed to be that long but it was great reminiscing about everything and it makes me even more grateful for life. Please everyone take care and I‚Äôll see you in another decade.",lonely,A reflection on my last decade,2019-12-31 12:24:36

This is probably a really dumb question to a lot of people, but how does one make friends online in this day and age. As part of my New Years Resoluton (yea, yea, I know) I am going to make somewhat of a better attempt to be more social. This could range from meeting more people IRL outside of work to simply just leaving a comment on a youtube video and everything inbetween. I have come to the realisation that I am the quintessential lurker. I browse social media, Reddit, etc. and never actually participate. All I do is read and move on. I can't remember the last time I spoke to someone online in particular. Even the games that I play in recent years have all been single player orientated so I can't even meet people with that old method. I look back on games I used to play when I was younger and marvel at the weird yet interesting conversations I used to have with people that I still remember to this day.

134,01-47am,1577711692,1,"So I'm 18 now and I'll be headed off to college soon. It's got me thinking about my life experiences in these three (relatively) close towns I've lived in. From my first crush, a girl named Ashely; my first friend, a girl named London; to where I stand now. I've been a lot of things-- in love, homeless, high, drunk, afraid, content, happy and lonely to name a few. Nothing profound, most people are these things at one time or another, maybe everyone is. 

The first time I kissed anyone I was 7 years old. Nothing spicy, I was chivalrous and kissed her on the hand. It was my best friend at the time, London. 

I wouldn't kiss again for 8 years after that. It was my freshman year of highschool. The experience was a bit rough at the time but in hindsight is quite funny. The girl was short and well I want expecting a kiss... She jumped up and chipped a tooth on mine. 

Nothing happens for the next almost two years. Then I meet a girl and God damn I didn't expect this one. All folklore and lo-fi, a wilted flower in a window and loose secondhand clothes. I still listen to her taste in music today. She had this taste, this hunger for the authentic and real. Things she could touch or feel, taste or smell, see or hear. She loved other's passions even if it was just for the sake of the passion and not the thing itself. Things sparked up and flared up, then burnt out. Just a summer in the heat I suppose. It ended when I said ""I love you.""

There's been a few people here or there. A boy crush or a few weeks of flirting that ended in nothing. 

Still, I have these scenes in my mind. All these little moments I've shared with people and they hint at something I can't quite grasp I don't think. If you're interested, I'll describe a few of them to you. 

Samantha and I. It's the homecoming football game. The crowd cheers and screens in the distance, the loud speakers blare the game narration. A ways from the game, Sam and I sit atop a building which is situated on a hill. We sit there watching the people roar then the crowds disperse into sunders. 

Bella and I. It's at a party, weed, beer and vodka pollute the air inside. I'm a few drinks into the night but God people are loud and so afraid to be different. I go to sit on the rooftop, the roof sits at an angle. An hour or so later Bella appears on the roof. One of the two prettiest girls in the school, the other was her identical twin. There she is all teary eyed on the peak of a suburban home. At least for a few hours, she wasn't afraid to be different. It's the little things about people, really. The color yellow and how she was always afraid to wear it. The music she loves but none of her friends like. We almost kissed, but she was drunk and I wasn't about to let her regret a drunk kiss.

Aiden and I. Nothing much, just an evening on a bean bag chair. Him stroking my hair and god I just felt so beautiful for a while there. 

Cass and I. We were close friends. One night we went to a bon fire, someone brought weed. We smoked a bit then after the fire, we went back to her house. We made out and all that. Nothing came of it. 

One last story if you're still interested. I've save the best for last. 

Isa and I. We met at a coffee shop around noon. Absolutely stunning. We drank some tea and went on a walk to a pond. We walked about the trails and the backstreets for a bit and then back to the area with street shops. A candy shop, a novelty store, a place which sold little rocks and necklaces. Then when the storm clouds rolled in, we climbed a fire escape. The building was on the side of a hill about halfway up, but it was high enough to see for miles and miles. All the car lights and the outlines of buildings all lined in white strings of stars. We played and sang songs on the roof for hours, throwing playing cards and ducking when cops rolled by. Then when the rain started, the cards got wet and weren't good for throwing. We laid there in the rain watching the clouds turn white-violet. Though the holes in the clouds we could see the sky turn dark and the stars show through the rain and storm. I fell in love with her. 

None of these moments changed much. Just stories now I suppose. I wonder why I can't have more than one story with anyone. It's always just the one.",lonely,"Thoughts on life, love and leaving",2019-12-31 00:14:52

Due me being on maternity, my husband is working a huge amount of hours, for which I‚Äôm very grateful, and have a huge amount of guilt for. 

Over the last couple of years, I try to arrange things with family and friends, anything from meeting up for a walk, visiting other family, lunch to mini breaks....all cancel on me. I try to go out my way and do all the organising for no benefit. My friends normally give excuses but then will post on social media that they are doing other things...with other friends. 

I tried to organise a lovely meal out, tbh everyone had something to complain out (even though they agreed the food was incredible) and that they should have stayed at home. 

I have had some serious health issues this year to the point that my life could have been on the line.....I am one to downplay things to people but most close friends knew the extent of my issues although they brushed it off. One even compared a 24hour stomach bug to my issues (4 week hospital stay), as in the bug would have been more serious. I wasn‚Äôt looking for sympathy or even mentioned my issues, they brought up the whole conversation. 

I can walk in a room of people I know and not a single one will acknowledge me and they‚Äôll just sit on their phones. 

I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm just being ungrateful for what I have got, as I know I‚Äôm very lucky but I just can‚Äôt get over this huge feeling of loneliness. I don‚Äôt feel like I have anyone to turn to anymore and I have lost the motivation to make an effort after years of trying with people.

149,GeneralWalters421,1577690664,1,"I just finished my first semester of university, and I actually enjoyed my subjects and did well in them. All throughout high school, I had no friends and was desperately lonely. I have Aspergers so it has always been very difficult for me, and these things never come ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù for me. Now, in university, I finally meet a couple people whom I connected with, and was hoping to become friends with, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôll work out anymore. Now with school over, i‚Äôm lonely, kinda depressed, and I don‚Äôt even have he motivation to get out of bed, let alone do hobbies. School will start again soon, but even so, this is not a healthy way to live, putting all my life around school, and having nothing but it. Honestly I don‚Äôt really want to start again, having to put effort into (platonic) relationships p once again only for them to drift away at the end of the semester. I‚Äôve never had a relationship last longer than a year since primary school. I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs just a numbers game, but I can‚Äôt keep doing this, it‚Äôs exhausting, I get overly attached to anyone I connect with and it hurts when they eventually drift apart. I‚Äôm seeing therapy, but so far the first session was kinda unproductive, and I felt like we were not understanding each other. I know it‚Äôll always be like that for the first few sessions but still, I don‚Äôt want to put all of my hope into an hour every week. I‚Äôm not really sure what to do, I have family over for Christmas and stuff but I can‚Äôt really relate well, and I feel like the third wheeler even with them. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I want my friends to know I‚Äôm lonely, but I know that‚Äôs selfish and would guilt them to be with me. I would like to progress these relationships but I don‚Äôt really know how.

One of the people I connected with is a girl I sat next to in class. Before this we got along well, talked with her at class and when we saw each other in the hall, and we also walked to the bus together. It turns out we shared a bunch of interests too. Essentially I invited he to a Starbucks together and spend a couple talking there. Afterwards I kinda invited her to see a movie, but I guess I unintentionally made it seem like I was trying to date her, but this was not really my intent. I kinda went down that path because I honestly did not know how else to progress relationships. She said she was too busy but I took it as a rejection at the time. Anyway, long story short we talked it over, and we agreed to be friends. Now we are friends on snapchat, and view each others stories. Unfortunately she will not share a class with me next semester, but I hope that will not stop us. Shes away at her parents for the holidays, but once she got back, I was hoping to try to watch a movie with her again. We both really like watching the Lord Of The Rings, so I thought it might be a good idea to see that together. 

I guess it‚Äôs kinda pathetic, but just having something like to look forward to kinda gives me hope. I guess I‚Äôm kinda ‚Äúobsessing‚Äù over one person, but I don‚Äôt really have anyone else, and I don‚Äôt want to once again abandon what I have. I am not sure what to do.

I finally moved out of my parents house (I'm 23)

I got an amazing job working in the ER of my local hospital and am going to be going to nursing school once I save up enough money for a car.

I cut back on my drinking and other substance use, and in a week I'll officially be 3 years and 7 months clean from opiates. 

I quit smoking. Finally. After 8 years, haven't touched a cigarette since September.

I'm finally losing weight and paying more attention to my looks instead of wearing jeans and a t-shirt every day.

I finally learned how to admit I was wrong, and worked to make up for all of the pain I caused to friends that were just trying to help me when I was lost in the dark.

Everyone in my life is so proud of me, so happy for me, I'm finally on the road to success and my family actually wants me around.

But here I sit, 12:30 AM. I have to get up for work in 6 hours, and all I can think about is the fact that I'm just so unbearably lonely. It blows my mind because I have plenty of friends, family and co-workers to keep me company nearly every day. I'm not sure if I'm just burnt out from work or what, but I just feel like I'm still not doing enough.

The city I‚Äôm from has a distinct ‚Äúcool hipster bar constantly hosting local bands‚Äù street and I became a resident there. I‚Äôm not one for bars too much now but I‚Äôd have pints with friends that I had constantly and everyone kind of looked up to me simply cause I was 18, and I was hanging out with my brother and his friends who were almost a decade older and I genuinely fit in. Maybe a bit more mature than most 18 year olds, and sense of humour that made it easy to talk to me. I dunno.

At the time I had this job (which I still have) but it was just temporary. Now, I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm a bid modest about it, but it‚Äôs another thing where people started looking up to me. It‚Äôs got about 30 guys give or take and I‚Äôm in line to be their foreman. At 23. I‚Äôve given my all to this job and so much of my social ability has been lost to this job I genuinely don‚Äôt know where to turn.

166,GeneralWalters421,1577676082,1,"I just finished my first semester of university, and I actually enjoyed my subjects and did well in them. All throughout high school, I had no friends and was desperately lonely. I have Aspergers so it has always been very difficult for me, and these things never come ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù for me. Now, in university, I finally meet a couple people whom I connected with, and was hoping to become friends with, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôll work out anymore. Now with school over, i‚Äôm lonely, kinda depressed, and I don‚Äôt even have he motivation to get out of bed, let alone do hobbies. School will start again soon, but even so, this is not a healthy way to live, putting all my life around school, and having nothing but it. Honestly I don‚Äôt really want to start again, having to put effort into (platonic) relationships p once again only for them to drift away at the end of the semester. I‚Äôve never had a relationship last longer than a year since primary school. I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs just a numbers game, but I can‚Äôt keep doing this, it‚Äôs exhausting, I get overly attached to anyone I connect with and it hurts when they eventually drift apart. I‚Äôm seeing therapy, but so far the first session was kinda unproductive, and I felt like we were not understanding each other. I know it‚Äôll always be like that for the first few sessions but still, I don‚Äôt want to put all of my hope into an hour every week. I‚Äôm not really sure what to do, I have family over for Christmas and stuff but I can‚Äôt really relate well, and I feel like the third wheeler even with them. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I want my friends to know I‚Äôm lonely, but I know that‚Äôs selfish and would guilt them to be with me. I would like to progress these relationships but I don‚Äôt really know how.

One of the people I connected with is a girl I sat next to in class. Before this we got along well, talked with her at class and when we saw each other in the hall, and we also walked to the bus together. It turns out we shared a bunch of interests too. Essentially I invited he to a Starbucks together and spend a couple talking there. Afterwards I kinda invited her to see a movie, but I guess I unintentionally made it seem like I was trying to date her, but this was not really my intent. I kinda went down that path because I honestly did not know how else to progress relationships. She said she was too busy but I took it as a rejection at the time. Anyway, long story short we talked it over, and we agreed to be friends. Now we are friends on snapchat, and view each others stories. Unfortunately she will not share a class with me next semester, but I hope that will not stop us. Shes away at her parents for the holidays, but once she got back, I was hoping to try to watch a movie with her again. We both really like watching the Lord Of The Rings, so I thought it might be a good idea to see that together. 

I guess it‚Äôs kinda pathetic, but just having something like to look forward to kinda gives me hope. I guess I‚Äôm kinda ‚Äúobsessing‚Äù over one person, but I don‚Äôt really have anyone else, and I don‚Äôt want to once again abandon what I have. I am not sure what to do. I need help and advice.",lonely,"I enjoy my university subject but now that it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm bored, kinda depressed and I have no motivation to do anything.

Most of us have great jobs with promising careers. Lonely is so much more than ""just go out and meet people"". I have no problems striking up conversations. Lonely is not so easily defined nor cured. It's something else. It's something deeper. It's worst for me as I lay to sleep in the quiet. My loneliness becomes restlessness, anxiety, depression  and sadness.  One feeling becomes more. Each one more gut wrenching and desperate than the one before. Can't sleep comes to stay the night and suddenly loneliness is the kindest of them all. 500 FBI friends?  2k Instagram followers?, wtf use is ""snapshit"" anyway?

170,hamartiated,1577673974,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-12-30 13:46:14
171,skempfire,1577673460,1,"Hello. I am a 16 year old guy currently in High School. I am not hated and don‚Äôt feel all that self conscious too often. However, I have incredible difficulty making friends. I went into 6th grade and made a best friend which quickly evaporated because I was a jerk. I don‚Äôt know why I was, but I felt the need to pick at his insecurities. He trusted me enough to open up and I, for some reason, felt the need to put him down. ( Keep in mind he was the nicest, kindest, kid I‚Äôve ever met; He would never hurt a soul). 

After this friendship evaporated, I knew I had messed up. The next 4 years I didn‚Äôt even try to make new friends. I was convinced I was an asshole and did not deserve anyone. I felt shame and guilt that was gut wrenching every time I thought about it and just could not pick myself up from it. Of course I apologized, and meant it more than you could know, but the friendship was far gone. 

High school came around and not much changed. I still felt the same guilt and shame. However, I always hid it and was relatively nice to people because I knew they deserved it. Eventually, mid 10th grade comes around and seemingly out of nowhere, I was in a big group of friends. 7-8 guys. They were AWESOME!!! We had a hilarious group chat and hung out literally every weekend. Life couldn‚Äôt be better. I became incredibly close with one of them and this continued for about 4 months.

Eventually I noticed the group ‚Äúleader‚Äù would poke at my insecurities and make back handed compliments disguised as ‚Äújokes‚Äù. I soon realized that he was a narcissist. (Doesn‚Äôt feel empathy, needs to put others down to feel powerful, pretty much fucks with your head). I had to cut off the group and they all started questioning why and I could not tell them because i didn‚Äôt want to smear the narcissist‚Äôs name or ‚Äútalk shit‚Äù. I was back to where I was for years... no friends... lonely.  That one person fucked all my other friendships and there is nothing I can do about it.

I wish, a girl or someone supportive could come around. I am an ‚Äúempath‚Äù (if you don‚Äôt know what that is, maybe google a little. But essentially I feel a high degree of empathy to the point that it can be physically draining) I can give all my energy to make someone feel happier and I just want someone to do the same for me. 

The loneliness hurts so bad. I just want someone to hold me. It feels so empty... Anybody...

175,inneedofkatharsis,1577670721,1,"Hi, this is my first post so please dont hate me 

It all started around 2017, I began talking to this girl and we hit it off surprisingly! We would usually just talk about random stuff or joke around in group chats, but late at night we would get into these really deep conversations and it was bliss. After some time we both realized that we had a crush on each other. This was probably the happiest I‚Äôve ever been

Fast forward to 2018, we both liked each other but nothing really happened between us. Still our conversations were the same but with a little bit of flirting. The year was pretty uneventful though.

Now in 2019 we have stopped talking, around May her replies started getting shorter and her voice more monotone. I realized that I was always starting the conversations and she didn‚Äôt seem interested so I wanted to see what happened if I just didn‚Äôt start a conversation, and that was the end of it.

Ever since then I‚Äôve just found everything dull and kinda boring, I really blame myself because if I would just have been better or kinder or just overall a better person she would not have stopped caring, after awhile I found out that she was talking to someone else the same way during all this time.

But on a happier note, for the first time in my life I have been invited to a party with my friends! I‚Äôm really hoping that things will only go upwards from here!

176,Its_Dat_SadBoi,1577670485,1,"I think it's a common theme in this sub that a lot of us given a social situation never feel like anyone's 1st choice whether platonic or romantic like never invited first or at all to things but still manage to be there feeling like we don't belong or aren't wanted. Ive never really come to terms with the idea of being alone forever but idk which is scarier being/dying alone or ending up with someone who doesn't really want me/we just dont want to be alone. I hate the idea of settling compromise is one thing but it sucks that we aren't able to choose our place in society, choose the people who'll care about us and where we fit in. This strange limbo of not being able to choose my own life path in terms of social existence pisses me off.

178,BriscWRLD,1577670276,1,"This past holiday was amazing. Christmas party with family and friends was super fun, memories being created. Playing video games and socializing, playing with the young kids. One of the girls I think a couple years older than me even said I was cute which made me very happy. My point is is that the day after, I was super sad and depressed that the holiday fun is over. I have no way of finding out the girl's instagram, no contact of her at all. We all have that stupid voice speaking in our head saying ""it is weird to contact her out of the blue."" ""It is not a good idea."" This mindset doesn't help at all for someone who has never had a girlfriend. And since I am a member of this subreddit, of course I don't have the most extroverted life out there, in fact the opposite. I never kissed a girl, I am a virgin which I don't really care for. I usually stay home and play video games if I'm not feeling the urge to go outside with my friends. I have 3 guy friends that i text in group chats. Not very lonely. I guess my point is, is that it would be really nice to have a female friend to talk to and be with. I've realized that money doesn't buy happiness at all. Very TEMPORARY happiness and that true happiness is having fun with friends and family. After the girl said that I was cute, I just have the urge to converse with the opposite sex because it seems so fun (as long as they have the similarities and are interested) but it is extremely hard to find one if you are just home all day on your free time playing video games.

Some of those cuts healed but left scars. Some time passed, 2 separate people in the group began dating then had a fairly ugly break up creating irreversible damage. They still aren‚Äôt talking.

What was once a proud group of ten has split into unsaid factions, none of which work together or against one another. Sounds alright on paper but outside if school there is little to no contact. Of course individuals stay in touch but it‚Äôs never really the same.

Cut to now, New Years. The end of the decade. It would have been great. No one planned anything, no one talked to anyone about anything. Nothing. Radio silence. And it‚Äôs only just now got me.

187,jonisbooty,1577665324,1,"Hi everyone i just have to get rid of this. I‚Äòm in my early twenties strongly extroverted and i have different groups of friends and some really close ones with whom i talk about everything. So in general i guess most would say I‚Äòm not a lonely person  but somehow i feel lonely all the time its just getting worse and worse with each day and i don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äòve talked to most of them about it but in general even though they try to help me i feel like its only getting worse! I crave closeness but somehow cannot accept it at all, in dating a destructive pattern always repeats. I meet women and start talking to them everything goes really good we exchange numbers maybe even go on a few dates and boom they either flake or ghost me out of no where. I honestly fell like someone (probably me) is running around and telling ever women i get interested in some lies about me that scare them of. But thats just dating i dont even want to try anymore really sometimes the loneliness  comes like a sledgehammer that hits me right in the chest all i want to do is cry but thats something i cant do somehow. When I‚Äòm with friends even when we have fun i feel like im far away its just frustrating af and I hate every fucking second... im not really depressed but its overwhelming once again right now and i had to vent im probably going to delete this post right away so if anyone read this thanks for putting the effort into my life and i hope you at least have a pleasant day!",lonely,Loneliness with an intact social environment,2019-12-30 11:22:04
188,philosykos_,1577664299,1,"Three months ago, I moved to a new country to study my dream subject. Since then, I've met a lot of people at the university, some people in other places, but none of them actually became a part of my life. I also went on a lot of dates during the past two months with men I met online, but NONE of them actually stayed in touch with me, even tough some of them declared the desire to do so. I became closer with one of them, we were intimate. He ghosted me after telling me he wants to meet the next day. 

During Christmas, I realised that I feel incredibly lonely. It also became apparent to me that I spent all that time and energy on meeting all those people, but not a single one actually sent me Christmas or birthday wishes (my birthday is right before Christmas).

Yesterday for example, my friend said we should hang or or something, I said ""Sure, are you free today or tomorrow?"" And she said not today because she had to work on an essay, and maybe tomorrow. 

That's understandable (obvisouly), but when I talked to her yesterday we eventually got on the topic of work. I asked her how her essay was going, and she said she never even started it. I was like, alright everyone has their tough days and she said tomorrow, so maybe we'll hang out tomorrow. 

I never got a single text from her today, let alone a ""hey want to hang out"". When I was checking out friends' stories on snapchat I stumbled onto hers, and it was a picture of her and someone else having lunch. I know I might be overreacting, but it made me really sad. She says she wants to hang out (multiple times) and then completely igores me? Even when I'm talking to her in person she seems so bored, and she'll leave to talk to someone else mid-sentence, I feel so replaceable and overlooked. We've been friends for 10 years, and we've been very close up until now, it feels like my friendships are falling apart. Does she not want to hang out with me anymore?

This Christmas I posed on my Snapchat and Instagram stories to the few friends I have made, and I like the idea. It's a good way to keep in touch with people without directly having to text them. I view there stories and they view mine, and I can comment whenever I have something to say. That being said, I have a pretty uninteresting life, so I don't really know what to post. I take pictures of stuff when I go for walks, but I kinda stop myself from posting cause it feels weird.

224,oghades420,1577637185,1,"Hello everyone! Let me introduce myself, I am a 19 year old guy from india. This is my very first time writing somewhere about how I feel. Okay so I am a single guy and never have dated anyone till date. It's not that I have a fear of talking to girls or I am hideous or I am weird. I just find it difficult to get close to people.

Let's start from the beginning folks. I used to be a fat kid actually an obese one. I had a rough childhood and am a single child. My parents too are single children themselves so I have no close family as such. Growing up was pretty rough. My parents fight every single day, from dawn till dusk. I grew up in a very toxic environment. Me and my parents were living in a small house, we had a lot of money problems and I was also a reason for their fighting still, and I grew up feeling very very fucking lonely all the fucking time. I was picked up on by kids a lot since I was a single child no one had my back and my parents never backed me. I hated going out in my society but I went every single day no matter what the other kids did to me because that was the only socialization I had. I had good grades in school and passed my 10th class with 80%. But after that I fell into some bad company. I started smoking a lot of pot. Used to smoke all day everyday. Class 11th and 12th, all I did was smoke pot, I don't remember those two years of my life. The pot was like a medicine for me, it helped me forget everything around me, it made my sadness go away, I didn't care about anything/anyone. All I wanted to do was get high all day everyday. Soon people found out that I was a major pothead and stopped interacting with me, p.s. consumption of pot is considered as a taboo in india. I did okay in class 11 and 12 and got admission in a good college. But I couldn't make any friends in college and continued to hang out with my stoner buddies. I eventually flunked my first year of college and my parents found out about my habit. They were really very mad at me about it. They used to lock me in the house to stop me from getting high. It took about 6 months for me to get rid of my addiction. I have been clean for about 2 months now. I had lost tremendous amount of weight due to smoking pot but in the past 6 months I have gained around 30 pounds since I was locked up in my house. I am again very depressed because of the way I look, not obese but overweight. It's like I have replaced my pot with food. I have no friends, to hang out with because all my earlier friends were stoners and I don't want to hang out with them.

Around a year back, I was in an accident and have an ACL tear in my knee and cannot run/do exercise so I can't join any activities around town and spend my time and am stuck in the house.

Also 2 weeks back my grandma was detected with cancer. Which was also a shock for my family. Now my parents fight a lot more because of the money problems we are having. 

I can't type this shit anymore, I have a lot to express but have no fucking words for it. 

It's like I have this heartache. A feeling, of my heart sinking. I want to hug someone and cry so fucking bad. My loneliness is killing me.

Please suggest me a way to turn my life around.",lonely,Everything seems to be falling apart.,2019-12-30 03:33:05

228,moisawesome,1577634629,1,"Ever since high school I have been isolated and don't have any friends. Yes, college is different in the sense that you are not stuck for 6 hours in school, and that makes me feel like I can focus my time on other things. I have never been able to relax or what my parents call ""chill"". I was bullied a lot in high school for being the skinny stick boy. Even in college, I don't stick around for very long as I have work from 1-7 pm. I have exchanged numbers with my classmates, but only for notes.  I spend most of the time reading books and exercising. The only friend I have is Netflix. I tend to avoid romantic specific genres as it envokes a sense of hopelessness and depression. Love is not something that I am searching for as it is not meant for everyone. It's only classified for the ""social people"", the people that can somehow connect with others in this ""god-gifted ability"". All social people have been blessed by God and God loves them. It's like everyone hates negative people so the ones who are going through a difficult time just get put down in life. The ones who are positive show how they are able to connect with others, share ideas, get into relationships, and talk about how grateful they are. If a man like me who is struggling because of isolation and loneliness wants to voice out, society will be like ""Why are you so pessimistic?"". It's like the world only cares about extroverts. If you are an introvert you will be labeled as the ""wise guy"". The introvert is supposed to give the extrovert advice for nothing in return. Doesn't this make you sick? Like you almost metaphorically want to puke? Why doesn't anyone want to help each other? We are supposed to be a community. It's as if the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I always wanted to be socially accepted but as I got to my 20s, I just gave up and started living my life as a lonely isolated introvert. I feel like I live off the grid, even though I live in a city with 500,000 residents. The only time that I speaking is about work or through the drive-thru intercom. I see kids younger than me getting accepted into top Universities. I see kids who were once younger than me, becoming fully independent and really ""living life"". They go on trips with their friends and family. They post pictures on Facebook and Instagram about how much fun they are having. Many have a significant other and are rubbing it in my face like look how grateful we are. No s@#t Sherlock. If life were that easy I would have been just as grateful as you. Even in my family, you have a bunch of rich people who share their vacation photos and personal photos just to make it seem like they are living it. Sometimes I wonder if its all staged. How can people be so happy and blessed? What is wrong with me?",lonely,Tired of being rejected by society,2019-12-30 02:50:29

1. I just started a new job and meet quite few new friends there. 
2. I am a lonely lesbian, basically like really easily attach lesbian.
3. Closeted lesbian, cant be a proud lesbian in public. Big no.

Okay the story is one of those new friends is from far away and have no one to spend time with and fequently told me that she doesnt have anyone, and invite me to spend time but I use excuse that she live quite far and we both cant drive. 

Usually I spend my time at home alone. But this new year I feel like I shouldnt be alone. It will feel suck. And I know she probably too. And I was thinking that I should ask her to spend time during the new year count down. 

The issues is

1. I dont know if thats okay, I not really good at spending time with people because people usually want to do lot of thing but I get socially exhausted pretty quick.
2. I not sure thats a good idea with mind that I might be attach to her. Which probably make it worst is that she is a touchy person. And yes I crave of it. And I am a lesbian. Not good.

237,sintrup,1577624612,1,"I'm no good at starting posts, but this is my attempt to let out a few feelings in regards of my loneliness - I hope this is not misplaced here.

So, after listening to my friend gushing about his crush for about an hour earlier today I feel a little,,,drained. Not only because him telling me who he has a crush on made me realize that I might've caught a few feelings for him. (I had no idea. But my heart kinda went /crack/. Just the slightest bit.) But I'm used to it. And I'm not mad about it either, because he deserves to be with someone as great as his crush! I just want my friend to be happy, after all!

But with everyone around me getting into relationships and falling in love I just feel more and more lonely.

I know that it's alright to not have a relationship, and that you don't need a relationship bla bla bla but I really want someone to trust and confide in on a much deeper emotional level than just friendship.

Because I do have a few great friends that I love from the bottom of my heart! It's not like I'm completely left alone.

But I just want someone who I can be entirely and unapologetically myself around. Someone I can talk to without judgement and without having to mask all my pain with jokes.

I want something intimate and soft. Someone who looks out for me and checks up on me - people are so used to my resting sad face since I've had depression for year so they just don't seem to notice anymore. 

I want mutual trust and understanding, cuddling and falling asleep in the arms of someone who I know wants to be with me. 

But I'm scared of opening up and being vulnerable - along with the fact that I have no idea how to meet new people. Well, I know a few ways but I'm very socially anxious and generally introverted and meeting new people drains all my energy. It's so exhausting. 

I'm also scared of getting hurt. But isn't everyone a little?

All I remember about my first 'relationship' (it was a long distance online thing, a lot of people don't think it counts. I don't even know if I do.) Is the feeling of falling out of love.
Else there's just been rejection.
And seeing crushes getting together with other people. 

I don't know where I'm getting with this. I'm 16, I shouldn't complain. Life's still ahead of me and I'll find someone eventually but that's no comfort. 

Right now the 'you'll find someone at some point' doesn't really help me either though.

I also feel bad for the people I've rejected - most of which were girls because I'm just not into girls (so I shouldn't feel bad for not wanting to be with them since I'm gay) and if there's ever a guy that likes me they're just not my type or generally unpleasant to talk to (or they get weird about it once they find out I'm ftm, and I don't need that shit)

My loneliness is my own fault. I'm probably just too picky. Too scared. Too lazy.

Rewind to 6 months ago. I met this girl, quiet and introverted and she loves gaming almost as much as me. For all its worth, she's me as the opposite sex. We game together almost every day and talk to each other every day, about all kinds of stuff. She'd had a couple of shitty relationships, as have I, and it made us closer. We could talk to each other about everything and anything. In no time at all, I had a new best friend. Hell, I even developed feelings for her... and that's where I fucked myself up. I thought it was mutual.

So we're both excited for Christmas for the first time in a couple of years. A few days ago we were chatting nonsense over messenger after a day of gaming. She tells me she's playing truth or dare with her friends and she admitted her crush to them. I stupidly thought she meant me, admitted I liked her and she tells me it's someone else and she had no idea I liked her that way.

So I had another shitty Christmas again this year. Drank myself stupid the last few days and don't know what to do with myself. We're still friends, but I'm absolutely devastated.

258,diipset,1577604037,1,"22 Male from New York. I just finished college and let me tell you, I didn‚Äôt make one friend that I consider a close one. I would walk the halls alone everyday praying someone would just even glance at me or want to talk to me. It made me feel even more like crap. I would sit in my dorm all day and sometimes not even leave the whole day. All a downward spiral. 

I have problems being alone. Always have. I‚Äôve had very bad luck with previous ‚Äúflings‚Äù if you want to call them that, or possible Girlfriends but, always got screwed over. One girl was flirting with me and using me to get to one of my good friends, they ended up hooking up. Another girl flirting with me and leading me on, and openly admitted to it to my face she only used me because her and the boyfriend broke up. Basically a rebound. Met another girl and we got along really well, but it was too much toxicity. Had to break it off this past summer. Couldn‚Äôt take the way she made me feel anymore, which was inadequate and always just played games with my head. 

I feel like I am constantly yearning for that relationship where I feel like the person is down for me and just me, someone that makes me feel appreciated, because of the past things that have happened to me. How much I would like to share my love with someone else and just feel that pure happiness that I look around and see others have. Someone I can just hug and look into their eyes, tell them they‚Äôre beautiful, make them smile, laugh, or even just be around. I‚Äôve seen boyfriends get so mad when their girlfriends try and hug them constantly or playfully ‚Äúannoy them‚Äù and Im here wishing I could even just get a glance or a hug from someone. 

I feel lonely everyday - that I will never find someone. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be alone forever, which I feel at 22 isn‚Äôt a good thought to have. 

Sorry if this all sounds so blah, and so me me me, but it felt good to write it out and get it off my chest. And maybe, other people feel the same way.

264,GeneralWalters421,1577596255,1,"I‚Äôm 17 years old, I moved to Canada some 5 years ago after my parents divorced and throughout high school I was super lonely and made no friends. I just finished my first semester of university, and I am doing well academically and enjoy my subjects. Despite this I still have no actual friends. I have a bunch of acquatances, as I‚Äôm not antisocial or have social anxiety or anything. I talk to people who sit next to me and stuff. 

I kinda made a couple people who are sorta more than acquatances. One of them a guy I sat next to, whom I shared a bunch of interests and studied for exams with. We‚Äôve kinda lost contact with each other after the semester though.

Another is a girl who sat next to me in history class whom I also shared a lot of interests with but I kinda screwed that up when I tried to date her, as it was the only way I really know how to progess relationships. We did get along well though, and shes pretty shy herself, though has a few close friends. Afterwards we agreed to be friends, and I believed her when she said that. We are friends on snapchat and we read each others stories (I recently started trying to use social media to try keep in touch with people without directly texting them), however she gives a lot of mixed signals like sometimes just not replying to my texts so I dunno if that will ever work out in terms of being friends. We both like the Lord of the Rings, and I honestly just wanted to watch that with her, (in a platonic matter) but something so simple seems so distant and difficult. I‚Äôd like to text her more often as I often have comments to make or things to say but I don‚Äôt because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just being annoying. I honestly can‚Äôt tell if she actually does not like me, or i‚Äôm just overthinking. 

I guess I have to try again because I‚Äôve been told friendship is a numbers game. I‚Äôm seeing counselling now but my first session seemed very unhelpful and like we did not really understand each other. Even if that does help I‚Äôm not sure what to do in the mean time. Constantly putting in so much effort into relationships after finally meeting someone I connect with (which is rare in itself) is so tiring. I cannot keep doing this if I get the same results every time. Relationships apparently take time to build, but I have not had one last longer than a year since primary school. What should I do? Where do I meet people? My counsellor tells me to diversify and look for friends outside of school but I honestly don‚Äôt know where? I have hobbies but none of them really get me out to meet people, and I don‚Äôt really know of any social hobbies I‚Äôd be interested in. I feel like I even struggle to relate to other lonely people, because it seems they are usually do socially anxious or depressed to  go out and meet people.

266,burn3rrrr,1577595660,1,"Apologies if this is really long and shitty, I never really post anything online and I saw this subreddit and found it a good place to maybe jot some words down and get my head straight. 

I recently left school after I finished my exams and got a placement at an advertising agency in the city about 2 years ago now. The job has been great and I‚Äôve really been enjoying it, it‚Äôs taken me out of my comfort zone because the industry is extremely social and a lot of it is about having connections and knowing certain people, so I‚Äôve been trying as much as I can to make friends with people a lot older than me, exerting a lot of my effort on trying to please and not only be good at my job, but come across somewhat entertaining too, which I‚Äôll admit has been quite a struggle as I‚Äôm massively introverted and prefer my own company 9 times out of 10. 

When I finished school I came out of a really toxic relationship with a girl that broke me down a lot and I‚Äôve had to build myself all the way back up, so had this to deal with my whole first year at work which wasn‚Äôt ideal, but that‚Äôs another story. 

I‚Äôve been trying to go to the gym to get myself in decent shape around 3 times a week and become more comfortable with myself, but all of this + work is really catching up on me. 

There‚Äôs no one really in my age bracket at work for me to talk to/relate with and I only see my closest friends during the holidays, and even then we don‚Äôt do that much because they don‚Äôt have jobs and are studying at university. The last two years of my life have been work, gym, home, dinner, sleep and if I‚Äôm honest it‚Äôs totally draining all the life out of me. I haven‚Äôt felt any form of affection in any of that time bar a fling with a girl at work that happened for around a week. I just don‚Äôt back myself as much of an exciting person, I go to gigs and comedy shows and would say I have a lot of (cool? dare I say) interests but again these are normally always alone. 

I‚Äôve tried dating apps and probably spoken to around 5-6 girls in the last three months, instigating some good conversation but none of it really leads anywhere, and it regularly just fills me with more self-doubt and a spiral of self-deprecation. I feel like the last two years of my life has just been me slaving away and telling myself that something exciting is only around the corner, for it to never happen and for me to build up this sense of false gratification, if that makes sense?

Im just fed up of feeling like this all the time and just massively craving a bit of affection, which feels a bit strange to type. 

If anyone has any tips or anything of things to get stuck into/involved in that could take my mind away from feeling like this most of the time that would be absolutely fab, but this mainly is just a vent to sort my head out a bit.

306,k9fine,1577572866,1,"I know that's been expressed a lot here. Hey, other lonesome souls, I see you. 

I'm back home from seeing *The Rise of Skywalker* (in Dolby, **ooooo my goooooooodness**). Went with my dad, who did say he enjoyed it, but he fell asleep for parts of it and we don't exactly talk with ease about a lot of stuff. It was a silent ride home. There's just so much there that I enjoyed. I felt like my heart was going to explode out of my chest through so many moments; now, that excitement is all still there, but I don't have anyone to share that excitement with. 

It's like this all the time with anything I discover, want to do, do actually do, etc. There's just nobody there. I don't have anyone to discuss books with, or these movies, or new adventures. For instance, I'd love to go to Galaxy's Edge someday, but I'm almost certain it will be on my own or something. I just don't click very well with people, or trust, I suppose. That inhibits me a lot from forming new relationships. Burned too many times in the past. Stutter and tumble when anyone does seem to actually want to talk or share company with me. It's just isolating. With the new year coming up and my birthday, I just don't have any plans. I'll work, maybe catch dinner with my mom and/or dad. I'm very grateful for them and the company I get to share with my parents, too. But still, you know? I don't have anyone I trust to talk to or feel comfortable enough to nerd out with over these exhilarating pieces of pop culture, and that excitement just fizzles into something along the lines of... bitterness? Sadness? Not sure. 

I've always been a pretty lonely kid, despite a few good (but ended) friendships there. Being in my 20s now, it just feels so isolating. I look at my calendar, and besides a few appointments, there's not much there. I don't need to be constantly, exhaustingly busy with people (I do like my time alone and space to breathe), but lunch with a good friend or two, meeting up at a bookstore, catching a movie, hell, just hanging out. I forget what that's like.

309,averagejoeman_24,1577570847,1,"So, I'm 26 years old, I have a decent paying job, but it's all online as I freelance. I live with my parents, and help them out around the house. I'm at home most the time than anything, though I take walks around the neighborhood when I get sick of being by myself.

As a result, a lot of my friends and people who talk or text with me are people that I've met online. I met them on social media like Tumblr. In fact, most of them are all girls. I even spent over $1.5K and took a vacation to the other side of the country this summer to meet one of these girls who I consider my best friend. She knows everything about me and vice versa, but we never met face to face until I went to visit her. I think I did it because I was feeling lonely and when I came back to my side of the country I felt even more lonely because I realized that I'll probably never meet anyone like her where I live. 

Anyway, I used to have lots of IRL friends, but most of them have become too busy and have forgotten me. Every one of them has also become more successful than me. They don't answer my texts or even bother to meet me up anymore. In fact, the guy who I considered my best friend in High School posts about meeting up other people, but doesn't even answer me when I ask if he wants to hangout. 

Also, most of my friends are teachers, engineers, etc. Even my cousins who I was one close to are more successful than me. They have more money, better jobs than I do. They're always boasting in front of my parents when I visit them, and I feel so stupid and lonely. 

Other people I know have their own lives and girlfriends or even married. And, yet, here I am, as a struggling writer, still living with my parents, with no IRL friends anymore.

I'm going to end up dying of depression or something. Because with all my IRL friends ignoring me, don't know where I'll make new ones.",lonely,"I feel like my life is entirely online, with no friends IRL. So lonely.",2019-12-29 09:07:27

I wish i had someone who considered me their #1 option ya know? Like everyone i've ever known always had better friends and only spoke to me when i spoke to them first. Only did stuff with me when i asked them to (and even then it was only like one out of 50 times, the stars had to align and all their better friends had to be offline or busy).

Maybe i'm asking for too much but idk, i'm a loner right now, i mean i've talked to a few people these past few days but those were casual conversations pretty much. 

I don't really want a casual ""let's chat every few days"" friend, i want a long-term friendship, someone i could call my best friend eventually (ik i have to develop a friendship first, i'm not expecting to be best friends right off the bat). I have a lot on my mind right now and i need to vent to someone, but nobody really cares or wants to listen. 

I'm not always like this, i just feel really shit right now. And if nobody knows how i feel, do i really exist? The mirror on the wall is the only proof i have that i exist.

Everyday i do the same thing and i can't tell anybody that i feel sick of my life because they'll just say the same generic lines ""oh others have it worse"" ""it's all in your head' etc. 

Anyway, sorry for making this so long. If you actually read through it then you're a genuinely nice person and i wish only the best for you.

I have a quick tip for all my fellow friends out there! if you‚Äôre like me, it always helps me fall asleep faster, or feel a bit more safe and comforted at night when there‚Äôs someones presence 

and the reason we‚Äôre all on reddit instead of sleeping, is that we obviously, don‚Äôt have that luxury

I've tried making mates to play xbox with (red dead redemption, dead by daylight etc) and sure I've had people add me but no one will actually play anything. I've tried making friends irl as well to the same effect. I do have 1 friend who I see once or twice a year and have a FWB but aside from the sex he doesn't really care to much to chat or hang out... Just want to have a connection with someone, doesn't have to be romantic just someone I can mess around and have fun with... I really enjoy being silly when I play online games so if we do that then be willing to accept a crazy personality, I literally call random players on rdr ""Blueberries"" coz of their markers on the map and I can get a little odd at time. You don't have to be like that as well just as long as you know how to have a laugh and are fine when I get a little cray. :)

Male, female, trans all welcome, gay straight bi doesn't matter to me all welcome and yeah I'm gay but don't care if you use the term gay ""that's so gay"" or call me a fag or whatever. There is a difference in joking and meaning it in a nasty way.

Me: [https://imgur.com/a/lwMa6Yc](https://imgur.com/a/lwMa6Yc)

Second, I'll give you some random facts about me and you can tell me if you think we'll click! I have my degree in Business Administration BUT started my college career majoring in Psychology with an emphasis in Human Sexuality and scouted models for an agency for a year. (Ex girlfriend modeled and got me the job!) I was a high school and college athlete, I played baseball and almost played for the Chicago Cubs but an untimely death in the family kind of ruined all of that from happening.

My favorite music is kind of hard to pinpoint, but I do think there's a pattern based on the concerts I've been to: My Chemical Romance, Cobra Starship, We the Kings, Staind, Creed, Blue October, Bowling for Soup.

I have sucked pretty hardcore lately when it comes to reading books but I do enjoy them. My favorite authors I'd say are Karen Rose, John Grisham, and Haruki Murakami.

My favorite video games would be Chrono Cross, Persona 4 and 5, the Yakuza franchise, and earlier-Final Fantasy. I recently got a Switch and have been pretty addicted to that as well.

He broke up with me. it was my first relationship. we got together while I had to take a quarter off of college to get my finances and papers together. I was lost. just got out of the hospital because of a suicide attempt.

He made me feel something I had never felt before. I felt connected. I felt like I was meaningful and that I had worth finally. I could dream things for my life that were never a possibility before. I had idealized him and the life I could live with him. 

I was foolish. But what can I say? it was my first time.

less than two months, I knew him. yet here I am, more than a year later, still hurting so deeply. before him I was calibrated to be functionally miserable. stray breakdown here and there, but functional. with him I was miserable but aspirationally seeking not to be. that was a swing higher than I had ever gone so when I tried to recalibrate to my normal, I ended up in devastating misery. I went to the hospital every 2 months for suicidal feelings and attempts.

fast forward through homelessness, physical assault, emotional manipulation, and rape, I end up where I am today. I wasn't able to go back to school. I wasn't able to get a job, I wasn't able to keep a friend.

I am alone.

I am writhing in loneliness. I think I can't get over him because today there is no one who will listen. no one who I can lean on. no one who will lean on me. so here I am left to conjure images of the last time someone said I was a part of them, I was meaningful, I was worth it. 

I have no one. I was handed a bad hand and that makes me feel as if I am intrinsically a bad person. because why else would I have to live out the torture of today? 

I am good, I am funny, I am beautiful, I am smart, I am empathetic, I am mature. I am human. yet, I have no one. It's not meant to be.

361,thealtmoon,1577514313,1,"hello. 

before i begin, i should say that i was here for the same reason most of you come to this sub. Distressed and incredibly lonely, scrolling through posts and looking for answers, desperate to find something to help. 

But the more I read each post, the more sad I became. Not because I felt less lonely, but because of the amount of people that feel this way, and I dont just mean feeling lonely.

I began to forget about how lonely I was, and it was replaced with a sadness that I was not the only one hurting like this. Eventually, I pm'ed someone I was worried about, asking them how they were doing and if they were okay, even though I had no clue who this person was. I wish I could do that with all of you, but this is probably the best I can do. 

There's nothing I could say or do to fix things for you. I won't tell you to endure, because if it was that easy, this subreddit wouldn't exist. I can't offer an action plan or a path to a better life. I'm not the person to ask where to find the light in the tunnel, because I don't know where it is, either. I'm no different than you are. I post about my issues, and keep checking my notifs to see what people reply and hope someone has an answer. There's no solution I can offer you.

But I need you to know that it's okay. I need you to know that whatever you're here for, I'm proud of you for making it this far and dealing with your issues. I'm proud you had the courage to reach out and be genuine with people you don't know. I'm proud of you for speaking your mind and trying to help one another. Our integrity is so fragile and precious, and you offer yours up to help and be helped. 

I need you to know that I care about you. That phrase might have lost it's meaning to you, but I don't care. It's my truth. I don't know who you are, but I care about you. I care about your story. I care that you aren't feeling okay, even if I don't know you. 

I know that I might never be able to do the things we both yearn to do with other people. I may never be able to see you or hug you or play games or make jokes with you. But, even if i dont know you,

- Music is what has kept me alive for so long, I listen to it, study it, and dream of the day I have the talent and patience to create some of my own.
- I pass most of my time playing video games, all sorts of games, on every console. I even work in the games industry, I'm super lucky, even though I probably dont deserve it.

I just finished my first semester of university, and I am doing well academically and enjoy my subjects. Despite this I still have no actual friends. I have a bunch of acquatances, as I‚Äôm not antisocial or have social anxiety or anything. I talk to people who sit next to me and stuff. 

I kinda made a couple people who are sorta more than acquatances. One of them a guy I sat next to, whom I shared a bunch of interests and studied for exams with. We‚Äôve kinda lost contact with each other after the semester though.

Another is a girl who sat next to me in history class whom I also shared a lot of interests with but I kinda screwed that up when I tried to date her, as it was the only way I really know how to progess relationships. We did get along well though, and shes pretty shy herself, though has a few close friends. Afterwards we agreed to be friends, and I believed her when she said that. We are friends on snapchat and we read each others stories (I recently started trying to use social media to try keep in touch with people without directly texting them), however she gives a lot of mixed signals like sometimes just not replying to my texts so I dunno if that will ever work out in terms of being friends. We both like the Lord of the Rings, and I honestly just wanted to watch that with her, (in a platonic matter) but something so simple seems so distant and difficult. I‚Äôd like to text her more often as I often have comments to make or things to say but I don‚Äôt because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just being annoying. I honestly can‚Äôt tell if she actually does not like me, or i‚Äôm just overthinking. 

I guess I have to try again because I‚Äôve been told friendship is a numbers game.

Constantly putting in so much effort into relationships after finally meeting someone I connect with (which is rare in itself) is so tiring. I cannot keep doing this if I get the same results every time. Relationships apparently take time to build, but I have not had one last longer than a year since primary school. What should I do? Where do I meet people? My counsellor tells me to diversify and look for friends outside of school but I honestly don‚Äôt know where? I have hobbies but none of them really get me out to meet people, and I don‚Äôt really know of any social hobbies I‚Äôd be interested in.

412,Arthur4Morgan,1577478301,1,"So I'm 18 back in highschool which was 3 years ago, I was first bullied in the first few years and in high school we have a total of 5 years. I was called nicknames most of the time but if anyone went physical with me like pushing me or hitting me I would've gotten pissed and hit them back. I had friends who were in my previous school in my class in highschool and they were nice at first in the 2 terms but eventually they saw other groups and decided to take the piss out of me just to look cool and join them. 

This happened for 2 years. In the third year I was in a dodgeball match and I am one of the few ones left in the match at the end and I suck at sports now but before I used to be good at Basketball and baseball. When I was in the dodgeball match and was the last one on my team in the match the teacher either calls it and the other team wins or if there wasn't much of them he would continue the match and people on my team were doubting me saying I'm shit he's gonna be eliminated just like that. I had the ball in my hand and decided to do a useless throw to show I knew I lost but I wanted the shot to eliminate that guy and it did cuz he didn't even catch the ball and then my teammates who were on the bench cheered a bit. 

I somehow managed to eliminate more of them but made just one mistake of getting the ball while they had one and they took the shot and I was eliminated. Everyone on my team went up to me giving high fives, fist bumps and saying that was awesome man etc. After that day I had less people bullying me now and this sounds off a bit but it's true it happened.

Another month after we we're playing cricket and I'm awful at bowling and my turn was up. People did have doubts again but my teacher gives me tips on how to bowl before I did it and my first bowl I did was slow but it was awesome as I eliminated the guy as it was straight and hit the wicket. Everyone cheered because we was loosing and all the top players had their turn but after a few more bowls I eliminated someone else and that was it. I remember going into the changing rooms with people giving me handshakes and then inviting me to hang out with them after like outside of school and I did.

Now I'm hanging out with friends who used to call me nicknames but in their words it was a joke but I know for a fact it wasn't but that's all behind us now. We hang out every other day and we have laughs and watch new movies or eat at a restaurant so it was awesome.",lonely,In highschool I was the the kid being bullied to becoming one of the most respected and popular kids at the end.,2019-12-28 07:25:01

416,alexgvincent,1577474489,1,"I left my country a bit over a year ago to come ""have an adventure"" in France.

Most of the time I am living an adventure. I have a great job, nice colleagues, a boyfriend who loves me, a family who accepted me as their own. I couldn't ask for more. Right?

Except that none of that feels real. I don't feel real. I am surrounded by people everyday and I still feel like I am alone. That's such a clich√©, but the thing is: being in a foreign country erases you in some way.

I have now an excellent level of French, but it will never be like speaking my language. People here don't know how funny, sarcastic and smart I can be. I used to be fun. With this new tricky language I can't make jokes, I have no punch lines and all of my efforts into being funny end up with people not quite understanding what I mean. Both because they don't even expect me to make a joke and because the humour here is so different.

I feel like I lost my personality.

I work in french, I make friends in french, I love in french, I fuck in french. There's something missing. The part of me that doesn't speak French is going insane.

Being the only one to speak another language (and no, it's not English either) makes me feel completely isolated. I can have the same conversation as I would have in my mother tongue, but I still feel like an outsider.

It's a whole different kind of loneliness. 

I meet people, I have people, I love people. But I can't be who I am around them.

I miss my country and my friends who understand me. But the worst thing is: I know that if I ever go back, I'll miss here just as much and I'll be just as lonely without my French.",lonely,How to spell lonely in french.,2019-12-28 06:21:29

418,iamnotaditya,1577473636,1,"If i really see deeply into it, I'm responsible for my current situation. I deleted my social media, i live by myself for more than a year now. 
I do go to my classes sometimes and that is the only way i interact socially and just reinstalled reddit after an year,
In my classes fortunately people do notice my presence. As i am good in studies but also really funny and too tall to be unnoticed. 
I have a good life, but i am not lucky, i worked really hard for it, improved my social skills, personality and even learned skills to impress.

I usually don't feel lonely, i study, watch good movies, learning Russian, sketching etc 
I have many hobbies to make myself busy and constantly learning something. 
I'm always available for my friends, if someone needs counseling or just get anything done, i really do help them and don't ever make them feel they owe me.

To the outside world, I'm seen as a guy who has his life figured out and is always cheerful. (its not delusion but i have been said this on many occasions)
I never asked for any help, even when my dad was in prison for 6 months and somedays (not consecutive) i didn't ate a thing because my savings were gone, i was not good with money then. 

I have been away from my family for many years to study further, i have been sick, have accidents that left scars, but never told them to my family or people who care until i recovered. 
I don't want them to worry as i know i can handle it but also i hide because i don't trust anyone with my feelings and people are always dealing with their own sorrow, so why bother anyone. 
I have people who care about me, but I'm afraid its conditional, and once in every 2 months i feel a bit alone, but even in these rare occasions i have no one to listen to me. 
I wish someone who really cared could just see through me and don't say anything about it. No remarks or sympathy, just nothing
It's ridiculous to expect but i wanted to say it. 
I'll never open up to people who know me because i don't want to feel vulnerable like i used to in the past. And i don't mind wearing masks because masks are cool. 
 
I deleted social media long ago because i got addicted to it, in fact i once quit everything i was addicted to alcohol, smoking, masturbation etc 
But recently i feel i'm hating myself again,i could do better and be better but i wasted two days doing nothing. I smoked after a long time today and jerked off because i just wanted this day to end soon.

When i started typing i was hating myself even more for acting like someone who craves a limelight from the crowd of people who will ridicule, but after two hours of writing, erasing and rewriting, i don't care anymore. 
In fact i feel better, and will possibly work for the thing for which i can leave everything

Love life has been non existent. I'd asked a girl out in school, mustered up a ton of courage, given I was relatively from a not so well to do family economically as her. She said she would never go out with me, it was my caste apparently, I wasn't born into a family pure enough for her. I stopped chasing girls around then, worked very very hard, eventually got a good job, paid off my families loans, paid my sister's divorce fees, and funded her marriage and the subsequent delivery of my beloved niece too. I donate a third of my savings every year to this orphanage near where I live, anonymously. 

In all this I never made deep friendships. I'd never been with someone. I'd asked out a couple of colleagues over the past three years but no one's said yes. I never ask again as I feel that's disrespectful. I fell for a friend involuntarily, only to realize she lied about her break up and was back in with her old guy. Years later, still a virgin, but I lie to my few friends that I've gotten laid before.

430,NAIYAS,1577464571,1,"I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about people saying how they get attached to someone who gives them 5 minutes of their attention. 
It's funny, I used to be like that but after so much time and disapointment I'm to numb to give a fuck. But why be completely misereble? Lets have fun by fucking with strangers, cracking jokes at cashiers and other people you meet troughout the day.
Ya know, one of the greatest life hacks for lonely folks is smiling. I discovered that recently on accident. I was in a waiting room minding my own buisness and then all of a sudden this cute girl comes in, like always I smile at her and say ""hi"". She send the cutest smile I have ever seen back and that made my day. Since then I used this super power a few times and it always makes my day. 
Another life hack is gratitude. When someone does something that makes your life a little easier remember their face and each time you see them give them a smile and wave at them.
These trick don't numb loneliness but they do make you cope with it a little easier. And once you accept your loneliness you'll be just fine.
Somehow I'm having the most fun I have ever had by making jokes with strangers. Of course not everyone can do that, I think I'm quite creative when it comes to having conversations, I think outside the box. So I encourage all of you loners out there to become funnier and to learn to enjoy your own jokes no matter how stupid they might be.
This is probably a dumb post and not the sort of thing you'd see on my profile but I'm quite fine right now, that might change an hour later and I'll be on a bridge trying to build the courage to jump.

433,Jimmy244,1577459855,1,"Well, the title pretty much sums it up fairly well but I will give more detail here. It's long sorry.

I'm a guy in my early 20s and I generally do not have many friends or interaction with much people unless I have to. Never had any relationships either, been on only 1 date ever. Ever since I was a kid I was always the shy, introverted, low self esteem guy with interests that are a bit abnormal, and as a result I find it hard to find commonn ground with people and generally just stay quiet. I have recently found out I may even be on the Autism Spectrum and after reading about it, things make perfect sense.

For years, I had this problem of getting a bit obsessed and fixated with people when they show me attention or I feel like they have a lot in common with me, especially with girls (even ones I don't find super attractive, or I may not even know what they look like at all but once I find they are a girl it drives up my curiosity even more). To the point I daydream about them and would like to get to know them and talk with them more, be their friend, or even more (with girls only though), but fear that maybe they will not like me once they know more about me so I don't even try talking.

This sucks because things get to the point where my stomach seems to tie in a knot, my face is red, and I start over analyzing everything with them like for example, when I comment on their things online, or on the rare chance they comment on my stuff, Subscribe, or follow me.

A recent example is with someone from YouTube who I've been a fan of for years and they actually subscribed to me and commented on a video of mine recently and I was so weirdly happy about it like a little fanboy. They are into very similar things as me and my channel, which is not big or super well known compared to them, is similar to theirs. I recently found that they are even subscribed to a good number of channels that I am and I am so infatuated with them. I feel like a stalker. I don't even know what they look like and I found that they are a girl fairly recently so that made me more obsessed. Almost like a crush on them that I want to be their friend at least, and maybe more.

I have actually been making online friends lately over the past few months which started from following and PM'ing them or them talking to me and I had similar infatuations and nervousness that I have with this YouTuber but they pretty much went away with my friends since I actually have conversations with them and feel less lonely that I forget about depression, anxiety, etc. I even briefly met one in person by accident actually and they didn't seem put off by my awkwardness lol. I do still daydream about them and wonder how it would feel hanging out with them and then I'd get nervous that what if they won't like me all that much if/when they meet me in person. These friends are guys except for one who's a girl which I was pretty infatuated with but knew she has a bf so that infatuation eased up a bit. I don't over spam them with messages if they don't respond for a long time. Now I don't feel too nervous if they don't respond, but before, it felt like the end of the world. And having different people, even if just online acquaintances, to talk to, kinda helps, even though not everyone is always responsive.

Sorry this was a long post but this has been making me feel a bit worse lately especially because I've been home for Christmas break.

Being single was much easier at that time, because i had feeling that i have people who care about me - even if it was fake. I was partying a lot, drinking, having fun.

It started out kind of wacky, as dreams tend to do. Somehow I found myself in some kind of a ‚Äúknocked up‚Äù situation, pregnant by some guy I didn‚Äôt know. Anyway, similar to the movie, we try to make it work but the guy is pretty cold and aloof. Eventually we end up warming up to each other. 


The last part of the dream I remember is laying down next to him, watching while he‚Äôs doing something on his phone. I feel pretty bold, so I scoot closer and put my head on his shoulder. At first he didn‚Äôt do anything but after a couple seconds he wraps his arms around me and leans his head against mine. 


That feeling of being held was incredible. I remember feeling warm and cared for and like things just felt right. This is around the time I woke up. The feeling of contentment was still so strong that I still felt warm and fuzzy even agreeing hitting snooze on my alarm a few times. 


And then reality sets in and I wake up alone in my cold bed in my empty house. I log into my laptop, work from home, not so much as speaking to another human being all day. Although, I do say thank you to my food delivery driver. 


Even though I still felt incredibly lonely, the memory of my dream was comforting today. Remembering laying in the arms of someone who cared about me, feeling warm and content. When in reality I haven‚Äôt physically touched a person outside my family in months. 


It was nice because I don‚Äôt typically remember my dreams at all but this one was so vivid I could remember it perfectly for hours. But now I‚Äôm laying in bed, dreading sleep and tomorrow for no particular reason. All I can think about is the dream, but it‚Äôs faded more now and I can barely remember the feeling.

I feel doomed to be lonely and depressed forever. I'm stuck in a relationship with a narcissist and I can't seem to break away from her without it costing me the chance to ever see my special needs daughter (19f) again.  we discussed, or rather argued about, divorce and she eventually told me she woud ove back home and keep my daughter away from me since we don't have have legal guardianship of her (she is a legal adult and her own guardian).   I started the guardianship process while telling her I'm not going anywhere, its the only way I convince her to go along with it.  This process is taking a lot longer than I expected.

I just want to be loved and I want to love someone.  I found someone I fell deeply in love with and I believe she fell in love with me.  she would only discuss dating me once I ended my obligation.  It was only fair to her that I follow her wish.  Unfortunately things are more complicated and I have not been able to end my obligation.

I forgot what it was like to be loved and to love someone.  I deeply care about this woman, but I have lost her and it really hurts a lot.   she was everything I have ever wanted in a woman.  she has the most beautiful green eyes, an amazing smile, and a cute laugh.  I loved everything about her, but just as everything in my world it has been messed up by my wife.

I'm sick of working my ass off with nothing to show for it. I work 2 jobs, she doesn't work at all.  she used to work a part time job until she got cancer and survived the treatment.  She never went back and doesn't contribute to the finances of the family.  she would rather volunteer than work yet complains that I work so much.  she does soend every penny that I make after I pay bills and then says I blew all the money.

As a whole I feel like I'm always alone. I have a great social circle and family but am still riddled with the fear of being alone. I had a boyfriend for 2 years and he completely ghosted me over TEXT. That has still fucked me up to this day and its been a good year. Anyways, Im the youngest out of 3 siblings (age gap being 3 and 10 years, respectively). All of my cousins are 5-9 years older than me, so I never really grew up with someone my age. I found friends through school because they were my age and they became my support system. My mom and dad are my best friends but they also work day to night so I only see them at the night time. Im in college now so I really don't see them at all. My sisters married and my brothers moved out as they both are finished college and I dont see them either.

When I was younger I'd never be allowed in the ""big kid room"", be able to hang out or do anything. They always left me out. I still remember the time I cried on the phone because my siblings and cousins tricked me and went to see the new Batman without me. I wasn't old enough to go but it still hurt. I digress, as I got older the family started to move apart, I guess that happens when everyone grows up? I keep ties with my cousins still though, but I feel like I'm the only one who trys to keep the connection alive. After my sister got married shit changed really quick. I was depressed my first year of college and I asked her to visit and she didn't even give me the time of day, said she was busy. This girl has traveled to maybe 50 countries with her husband and has all the time in the world and so many days off to see me and won't. I don't know what else to do or say to her. The three of us had a huge falling out over the summer because I finally admitted my sadness as to why I don't have a good relationship with my siblings and it didn't make a difference. She blamed my mother?! for the way we all ended up. And that was basically the last bit of respect I had for her.

Moving onto the friend part, now that I've came home for winter break, I feel as if no one wants to make time for me anymore.

517,72481750184751934,1577388976,1,"Due to a bunch of misunderstandings and friend drama, I no longer have friends my senior year of high school, which really sucks.

Using a throwaway, because some of the friends involved in the drama know my reddit account. I've also posted this on other subreddits because I really need advice on how to deal with suddenly having no friends whatsoever. 

A summary of the drama:

I had a three-person plan to hang out, which I initiated. Somehow, they neglect to tell me what time the movie is at. Twenty minutes into the movie, they tell me to come. I interpreted this as 1) they purposefully left me out or 2) they somehow completely forgot about me in this three-person plan, which means they don't care about me or value our friendship.

One of the person apologizes. The other says nothing. The other person (let's call her Anne) before has told me in a game (called Paranoia) that she vibes with me least.

Anyway, that day I hang out with other people and they ask me why I feel sad. I explain the situation. A few days after I ask someone for advice on what to do and if I should talk to Anne. One of these people I told must have said something to someone else, because by the time Anne knows she's furious because she thinks I've been talking behind her back and that she doesn't want to be friends anymore. I guess by the time it reached Anne that it sounded really bad, because she thinks I said something along the lines of ""Anne doesn't care about any of her friends.""

Everyone takes Anne's side, and I no longer have any friends.

537,Isflak,1577363129,1,"Hello! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everyone!

I kinda just want to write my thoughts and story off! It will be hell of wall of text, Sorry about that in advanced! I appreciate if you can read it all!


So, I will start at the beginning of this ""story"".  For about 5 Months or so, I had a female co-worker that got bullied by my best friend, he did do sighs every time He saw her, complained that he did not want her here, all she does is talk and do not work etc. Since both me and my friend are Team leaders, I knew he cannot treat someone like that no matter what his personal thoughts are on her. (No one should treat anyone with disrespect no matter what, don't get me wrong)

Unfortunately it got too far before I had any saying to my friend, She came crying towards the restrooms, I stopped her and asked her what was wrong, what happened etc. She did not want to tell me at first, but after consoling her with one other co-worker, she started to talk about how my best friend treated her, that she cannot take it anymore. She thought work was a place she could just be herself, go away from the personal problems she had. (Did not know what her problems where at the time).  I told her that I would go and talk to my best friend, that I know it has gone too far.

I did not find my friend, but I found the other Team leader of his department, So I told him everything and he said we should go together and talk to my best friend. So I explained what our female Co-worker had said to me, That they need to talk and sort this problem that they had.  Even told my friend it is bullying that he has been doing, His Co-team leader disagreed it was nothing like bullying, that she overreacted about everything. 

We found her, my best friend and his co-team leader and the female Co-worker talked, They did not want me in the conversation for some reason.. But I did not really care, as long as they sorted it out.

Later that day, the Female Co-worker came to me and said Thank you, that none has really stood up to her like I did, exceptionally against my best friend. I told her it was no problem, as long as everyone is in good terms. 

The next day, I got called my My friends Co-team leader that We need to have a short meeting. I went down to their department and we got into the office, We talked about what happened yesterday.
My friend is a bit introvert, so he was mostly quiet during the meeting. But his Co-team leader is very open and talkative, but he said its best that we keep this situation quiet so that others do believe we are bullies here. 
He even got angry at me for calling my best friend a bully. I Told them that its because he is my friend and he needs to know when hes doing something wrong. It might have been unintentional from his side, since he has that kind of jargon in that group. Not all can take it though.  My friend even told me in my face that hes not going to change his behavior towards her, since Hes not doing anything wrong (according to them). 

A bit background about their department, there has been 4 people leaving in short notice, 3 people sick-living and 1 just quits the job, since she cannot take it anymore. There has been a HR investigation about all this. (More about this later)
 They did not want more drama more than this, since they only cared more about their own personal image than peoples well being. (This is what made me angry in the paragraph above) Also, my best friend look up to his Co- team leader like a role model, don't know if it its good or bad. But from my point of view, its more about the image, both at work and personal life. They do not care about others. They say they do, but they do not.

Well, after the meeting I was going back to my department, the female co-worker saw me going in to the office with them and asked me what they talked about, I told her that we talked about what happened yesterday and she should just ignore my best friend for the time being.

I went back to work, All I was thinking about was the situation and how my friend has started to change, might not be for the better.

After few days, the female Co-worker came to me and said that nothing has changed, and its feels worse than before. I told her that my friend told me during the meeting that he is not going to change his behavior towards you.
She got angry, told me that hes being childish etc. She wanted to go to our boss and tell him about what was going on. I told her to just sit tight a bit it might be sorted out by the next week. Since I had planned to talk to my friend during the weekend.  The weekend came, But my friend was busy and did not have time for me. (Which has been like that for a while,  since I am bit of a loner myself, even more so when my best friend started getting more distant from me)

Sometime during the next week she came to me and told her that she had talked to my best friend again, and this time it felt more genuine since he apologized for his behavior and he knew what he did was wrong. I told her that is great, but she even told me that she had to switch to a different department this week. My thoughts was that I am not sure if this was their doing to shove away the problem rather than solving it.. 

Well, Since we started talk more during work, she started to eat with me during lunch etc. We noticed that my friend and co-team  leader started getting more distant from me or us. Since I started hang out more with her.

She said to me she want to go up to our CEO and tell him what has happened more than ever since she told me she had contact with those people who had left for sick leave. What their reason was for leaving/quit work. It was because of my friend and his co-team leader, their behavior, ostracizing.. Just what happened to her. She even showed me what they have written, to make sure that she was not lying. It baffled me, since it all made more sense about what has happened lately at their department , since all I got from my friend and his co-worker is that they were idiots etc.. 

Well, after this I had to make a decision, very hard one. In a professional standard I should go with her, but as a friend I was going behind his back. But since this was work-related and not personal. We scheduled a meeting with our CEO. We even got another co-worker who had few view points too.

Well, We got to our CEO and asked what we wanted to talk about. The female co-worker told him her story, and our CEO told directly that this is bullying, and if its true then he is going to fire my friend without hesitation, our CEO told me something he cannot tolerate is grown-up bullying. The other co-worker said about my friends work ethic was not great, he was lazy, did nothing, told others to do his stuff rather than him doing work himself, he has become very comfortably at his position, since his Co-team leader does all the team leading work.

Since I do not work with my best friend that close anymore, this was chocking.. Something has changed since he got the position as a team-leader, he has said to me that he does not want to be a team-leader, he got the position temporally when the others quit.  
Then the CEO asked us what he should do tomorrow about this, since he know we want something. Me for once, was chocked.. and did not want to do anything drastic, since hes still my best friend. I was defending my best friend, but still trying to make things right. The CEO noticed that. The female co-worker got a bit pissed at me for defending him, she wanted him gone for good. But at last we agreed that we sit tight and let see if it works out.

After meeting, the female co-worker said I was probably right about not doing anything drastic about it.

Well, I after that day, I got home, she wrote to me that she wanted to me and talk. So I went to her (She lived about 600 meters from me).  We went for a walk with her dog, told me about her problems with her brother, her boyfriend and that her sister is being a bit of a bully towards her. I felt so damn sorry for her and said that she now got me in her life if she need a friend to hang out with. Then she told me she does not have a lot of friends. I said I do have that many either.

To make it short here, we started to hang out more after work. We got a good connection. we became very close. I started to like her more than a friend, but I told myself she got a boyfriend, so I kept it that way for now..

But at work, she transferred then to my department, I got to hang out with her a bit more at work, I kinda liked it,since I kinda liked her and  she was doing great job, but I do admit that she did talk a bit too much during work, Told her that she should try not to talk too long, people did complain to me about her talking too much,

She told that she wanted a new meeting with our CEO about it the issues she had faced before..she could not let it go.. even though she did not work with them anymore.  Also since her contract was about to expire she wanted to make things right or others will probably quit due to my friend and his coworker. I told her fine, we can do that. She kinda persuade me.. Hey I like her, and I wanted what was going to be best for her! 

We got a meeting with our CEO on her last day.  During the meeting it was the same all over again.. I defended my friend and she had angry glare towards me during the meeting.
It led not nothing really, it was basically a rewind of what our first meeting was. Except Now I knew that HR was contacted that they going to make a investigation about the situation again. Also the CEO told me personally that last time HR was here, they had a assessment from HR where a woman ask question that they rated from 1-4. This scored got squared so my best friend and his co-team leader kept their job, since the workers that current was working there had no problem with them at all. (But since then, I've heard complaints)  After the meeting, it was late that day. I was waiting at the entrance for the female-coworker. She was really upset about everything. She told me to leave her alone, and she went into her car and drove off.


Later that night, she called me and said she wanted to meet up, she had something to tell me.

So She came to me, picked me up, we went for a drive. She said she wanted to tell me something, but she could not really say it to me. I told her, If I can guess, I believe that you like me, She said that was it. She had feelings towards me. 
I told her that I had feelings to her too. I felt happy, finally I told tell her how I felt. Then she told me she was going to break up with her boyfriend the next day. That she had been thinking about it for couple of weeks since she met me, she told me that she never had met someone that kind like me before. 
Then she asked me if she could come to my place after she broke up with him, I told her she could, then she said it might get late, since he was working until 12 am (shift worker). I told that was fine. 

She then came to me, we sat down in my couch and she told me it felt really good to break up, since they had been fighting for a year or so, a very toxic relationship (What I heard from her)..  She was surprised how well her ex took it. I told her he might have been ready to break up with you too, but did not have the courage to do so. Then she hugged me and said she was really happy that i am here for her, she made me feel like a hero(?) and told me that I took her as a storm (is this a phrase?). She said she rather be with me and her now ex boyfriend for a while. Then she told me about last time they broke up, when he broke up with her.. that she got eating disorder, took distant from her friends etc. isolated herself from everyone. I told her that is not going to happen again.

After few hours of talk about her ex, she told me what I knew about Borderline (BPD) I told her I knew very little, All i knew was that very drastic mood changes. She  told me she had that disorder, and told me little bit about what I should expect and do not take things personally. Since I was clueless at the time, I said it was no problem at all. 
Then she said she had to go home, it was late, and I was going to work in 2 hours.. I did not sleep that night, but I was happy, that I found someone that really liked me for who I was.. Since my history with relationships has not been great e.g: cheating and lying etc.  I've kept my distance from letting anyone in my personal life (love life), but due to what was going on at work, led me to open up more. It felt great at that time..

We started seeing each other everyday, she made me feel so special, she said all kind of things that made you feel superior, it was amazing feeling! It boosted up my confidence, I was more happy than I've been for years. Since she wanted to keep this secret that we are seeing each other from everyone.. she told me people should not get the wrong idea..  I said sure, we can keep it secret for a while.. see if it works out or not.

Then she started being more cold towards me, I asked her what is wrong.. She told me she just want to be alone. Later that day, she wrote to me that she wanted to get back to her Ex and that she loved him, she was the ""one"". I told her to fuck off for playing with my feelings. 

Then day after tomorrow she asked me if I was home, I told her I was with my brother, she asked me to get home, so I did. When i got home I wrote to her that I was home. (During the time I was waiting for an answer I was thinking that shes going to tell me that she is back together with her ex again) Then she knocked on the door, I opened and she told me  say nothing and just hug me please.. after the hug she said she wanted to explain everything she went through today..

She told me that she was going to her ex, but noticed a another car was there (she took a picture to send to her friend, and asked if he knew who that was) and her friend confirmed that her ex had a met a new woman already, then she showed me how she trashed talked about me, how I manipulated her to break up with her boyfriend to make her mine etc.. She told me she was soo sorry, that she made a mistake and I was right about her ex the whole time.

Since I always believe in second chances (not cheating etc) but mistakes, I forgave her, she spent the night at my place. During the weekend she made me feel special again, (lovebombing?) It felt great.. But my gut feeling told me this is going to end really bad. She noticed that I was looking a bit sad when we were cuddling, I told her it was nothing to worry about. But I was thinking this might be a mistake, I am going to get hurt. But she turned around (we were spooning) and hugged and kissed me that she feel so safe in my arms. That worry feeling went away.

Now, it actually started going down hill. Since she wanted to now what was being told about her at work, she wanted to know. I told her that i could do that for her.  Co-workers has said few bad things about her, that shes a psycho, talk too much etc. 
I told her what people said, not WHO said what, but what was said.. But she took it good, she said shes not there anymore, so why care. Then she wanted make amends with my best friend out of all sudden..
I Thought that was great,  Maybe I could tell my best friend that I was seeing her and not hiding it anymore. 

She started getting cold again, more frequently.. I asked her whats wrong etc, but she told me she wants to be alone. Then she tells me that her EX is in a new relationship already! I told her to not stalk her ex on Facebook, it will only make things worse for you, you broke up with him. You are with me now! She got really pissed off at me, told me that I do know how she feels or what shes going through. I told her that I know what she is going through, hell I have been through breakups before too. But in her world I cannot understand her at all. 

This made me ask myself what our relationship or what ever we had is, I confronted her and asked her, what are we, what are we going to be in the future?  She got angry, that she does not want to date anyone right now. I got angry and felt used, I was a rebound, I told her how I felt, she said I was not that at all. But I told her that is what it look like to me. This fight got worse and worse, we started going on personal attacks about past lives. Some stuff that really hurts, she knew exactly what to say to hurt me the most. I told her really bad things too. We did not speak with each other for over a week.  

Since we were going to a after work on a Saturday, we were both going (since this was planned when she worked at my job) so I wanted to solve our issues before we met up with others. But she did not want to. 
I went to the party and told who hosted the party that Me and her had a fight, its going to pretty tense between us and its not you that doing anything wrong. Even told her to keep this for herself. 

Later that party she came,  she was really  beautiful.. but then I struck me she was angry at me.. she said hello to everyone except me, then she sat down next to me.. but after few seconds she told the hostess that she could sit on the floor instead. That she could sit on the cough next to me instead. It was really tense, I did not speak much at all since she came, people noticed something was wrong..  I was looking at her and she was looking at me.. She opened beer after beer.. I wanted to tell her to slow down, but that would probably been opposite effect.. She then opened up a vodka.. I knew I needed to have an eye on her this evening..  

We then proceed to go to the club, where the guard were not letting her in at first, but I told the guard that she will be drinking water only the rest of the night.. She got in, Then a friend order a beer to both me and her.. I told her that is her last beer, then you drink water. She just nodded.. After her beer I got her glass of water, She drank the water really quickly.. then told me she needed to go to restroom.. I said sure..  During the time she was at the restroom a mutual friend told me that he knows everything about me and her, that I should just keep it cool and it will work out, This made me think, she wanted our relationship to be a secret for now, but now a mutual friend knew about us.. I said thanks of course, for the heads up.
But it got me.. shes been talking to him, I was told to not talking to anyone about us, not even my brother.. I kept my word.. (probably stupid thing to do, people do it anyway)

But After 25-30 minutes or so, she had not come back, I texted her where she was, I got a reply that shes on the toilet, vomiting. I told her to get out and I get her home.  She came back to me, gave me a hug and told me that she wants to go home, and I need to help her.  We said goodbye to everyone, We took our things and went our way, she told me she wanted to eat something, I said sure we can go to McDonald's.. While we were walking she kept saying to me, that I can not use her while shes in a condition like this (really drunk), I told her I would never do that to her, and where she even got that idea from..   Well, I paid for the food, we ate, got the cab and drove her home. She ran out from the cab to her door and yelled at me that I should just go home.. I told her to wait so I could pay the driver, Since I lived closed I could just walk from her, I wanted to say goodbye to her.. But she just went inside. I walked home, and told myself at least shes home safe.(This is the last time I've seen her physically)

The next day I texted her asked how she felt, she said had worst hangover ever.. Later that evening she asked me how much money she owe me, I said she did not have to pay me back.

I did weigh myself in, noticed that I've lost 3 kg's on 2 weeks, Which is a good thing(No appetite since our fighting) but my goal is to lose few kgs. I told her this, in a good way, but I forgot the DAMN smiley on the text. 
She took it as it was her fault that I lost few kg's. Then She went on a rampage with everything about us, work, my best friend her EX. 

After days of arguing again and again, I got so fed up with everything and told her That I will Tell my best friend about everything, about us, work. She then told me that she was going to tell him HER side of the story.
I got so angry that I punched a concrete wall, being frustrated, angry, sad and really no control over my own feelings, I am usually calm.. but she triggered me in a way that I really cant recognize myself anymore.

I went to my best friend, told him we needed to talk. I told him everything, about me going behind his back to our CEO, about me and her, what she has written to me (showed him few texts) and she was going to tell her side of the story..
He was scared and conflicted, told me that everything that has happened at work made more sense to him now too. 

Later that evening my best friend told me that she has written her side of the story, blaming everything on me... While my story I took most of the blame, but she was also at fault. So he said he believes my story more, and our stories are nothing a like. I told him, It might be hard for you to be my friend anymore, but he said it might take time for him to gain my trust again. Its fine, for me. 

Also, day after that co-workers and mutual friends started to text me saying that she has been sending our private texts to them, shes manipulating texts (cutting them) and make me look like the biggest douche alive. I confirmed this since someone sent me a picture of what she sent them, I then sent the whole paragraph of what she cut off. 

I then texted her she should stop sharing our private conversations, its between you and me. and KEEP your friends away from our DRAMA, you are just pushing them away from both me and you.  
She told me that I was walking around talking shit about her at work, I told her to fuck off with everything, I do not want anything with you anymore, you have manipulated me and almost destroyed friendships that I had for years.

Shes been sending me Threat texts about making a public statement on Facebook what shes been through, and showing our private conversation and making a police report for not leaving her alone.

Just 3 weeks ago, she sent another one, about the same message, except that she said that 3 other girls has same experience with me, that they had blocked me. Since I do not have social media (Only snapchat) I had no idea what she talked about.

Since I was trying get her a new contract at our workplace, had talking to my boss about these threatening texts, she destroyed her chance of getting back.. She either desperate to make people take her side, to get that acknowledgement that to make her feel good. Or she feels better to be angry than sad over her life situation right now.. 

I even started go to a psychologist, unfortunately at Christmas time, not much time available.. hopefully at the start of the next year!

As a off yesterday, I asked few friends what their New Years plans are, they going to a party.. where I am not invited, since the woman I was seeing is going to be there, and its our mutual friend that is hosting it.So I am pretty much alone for the new year, got no plans at all.  I keep asking what my real friends are? Do i have any?  I've actually talked to my friends about the situation, that I do not want anything with that woman at all. Even though, they know what she has done.. they still keep her in touch, ""Well I do not have that problem with her"" is one of the statements when i asked him why he still friends with her. 

I want friends that are on my side no matter what I've done, right or wrong.. Also I don't blame her for everything here, I know I've told her bad stuff, tried do damage control by talking to people about that she might written to them about our drama that they should just tell her to talk to me instead of them. 

But I feel more lonely than ever after this, few co-workers that she had good connection with has taken distance from me at work, friends that she had written to has also taken a bit of distance.. No one really start to talk to me anyore, unless I engage a conversation first. 

Its like my whole Life has been turned up side down, I am sitting mostly alone now, I planned vacation with that woman, now I am all alone at home for next 2 weeks.. 

Thank you if you read through all the text and sorry for spelling errors and grammar issues, I have never in my (30 years) been through anything like this before. 

Any feedback of what to do after this is really appreciated!

540,69_Im_gay_69,1577360523,1,"Holidays can be a drag. The images of happy people hanging out. Friends. Lovers. Families, and I find myself without it. It seems like I‚Äôm watching what could be through a window with a limited view. I‚Äôm sad. I‚Äôm lonely. If I wasn‚Äôt I wouldn‚Äôt be on this sub I suppose, but idk why. I think it‚Äôs because of my lack of companionship, the companionship of another that has evaded me for many many years, but I‚Äôm not sure. People I thought were my friends get together without me. People I thought liked me don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sick of this shit. It seems life repeats itself. The same mistakes we make will happen again. Whether it be a war or you stepping on someone‚Äôs foot. Everything cycles, and cycles continuously, and I‚Äôm sick of falling into the cycle. I lay here on my bed, because I‚Äôm afraid to sleep. Most of my nights have been spent tossing and turning, with lonesome nights spent after lonesome nights. When I do sleep I dream of a partner. The person is a mystery, but it‚Äôs not the person that matters, no. It‚Äôs the idea of the person. The idea that someone loves me the way I love them. They say someone‚Äôs out there for everyone. I‚Äôve been all over the US and I haven‚Äôt found that someone. I find people I think to be the one, to be lead on in some elaborate way, thus falling victim to life‚Äôs vicious cycle once more. Much like the Beatles song fixing a hole, I‚Äôve been taking up many different hobbies, I‚Äôve learned the guitar, the bass, the piano, I‚Äôve been painting, and of course playing video games. I try all these things to somehow work through my emotions by conveying it in music or art, but it‚Äôs fleeting. It‚Äôs not enough, and I‚Äôm worried it never will be. I find someone and then what? Would if it still won‚Äôt fill the void that‚Äôs been made in my heart. I won‚Äôt know unless I try it, but how am I to try it if no one is willing to try with me? When I find someone I‚Äôm interested in, things go good at first, but I feel like I‚Äôm not interesting enough, or that maybe I‚Äôm the only one putting in effort. And sometimes it is that way, and when it is, I realize and end things before it goes too far. However when it seems like we both are interested in the other, and things are going good, that‚Äôs when things hurt the most. I‚Äôm not mad at anyone, I‚Äôm sure you understand just as well as I that feelings suck. How can she help it if she doesn‚Äôt like me anymore? Feelings are something we cant control, and that makes it all the more frustrating. Who am I to be upset with when nobody is to blame? Myself? I‚Äôm still not sure, and like everyone else in the world I‚Äôm just trying to find my way. And yet the cycle continues. I have more recently met a girl that has my interest and it would seem I hers. She puts in effort, more than any girl I‚Äôve talked to in a while, and she‚Äôs very cute. Like the other girls we hit it off right away, and have been talking for almost a month, but we haven‚Äôt hung out, and I don‚Äôt want it to die. We hang out at school, but we both know that doesn‚Äôt count really. Her friends are my friends and they tell me she likes me. Again though every time I ask if she wants to hang it‚Äôs a clouded answer. She says she had nothing going on, so I ask if she wants to hang and she says maybe. We couldn‚Äôt link up because of Christmas and she spent time with her family, as did I, so nothing could happen. But when I ask what she‚Äôs doing today or later or whatever, I get the same responses. When I see these I think oh she must not be into me, I should back off, but then she says things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get any weird ideas, I want to hang out but just can‚Äôt‚Äù which I can understand, so I wait and ask again at a later date, to be met yet again with the same answers. If anyone knows what this means I‚Äôd be greatly appreciative, if you could help me out. I‚Äôm tired of the cycle. I hope this is the time I can break it. To anyone that read this whopping paragraph I thank you, and wish you a happy holidays. It may get hard sometimes. But stick to it, keep pushing. Even though it might not seem like it at times, I believe there truly is someone out there for everyone. And that means you too. Again thank you for reading",lonely,First post here.

My problem with online friends is that you'll never see them face to face. I used to have a realy close online friend but things went south since I caught feelings and she didn't feel the same. We used to text everyday and since that disapointment I absolutely loathe ""online friends"". I can't bring myself to text or talk to anyone online because I know it will always end in disapointment. It's different in real life. I'm the ""classclown"". I talk to everyone about nothing of importance, just jokes and thoughts I come up with on the spot because making myself laugh is the only way I can cope with my loneliness and I hate when the teacher says "" you are doing this for attention"".

This gonna sound like buhu my life shit, reee feel bad for me but honestly I just wanna get my thoughts out. Since I‚Äôve never ever done it before. I‚Äôve been happy my entire life, never understood why one another should be sad, like what‚Äôs the purpose right? Never understood self harm, self hatred, eating disorders, depression, insomnia, just wanting to be alone and suicidal thoughts. And I wish that the young innocent me spoke the truth when she said she would never be one of those. But here I am. My best friend, really were there for me, the only one I‚Äôve had. The second person I‚Äôve said I love. And I truly do, I still do.  Lied to me, and it came to my knowledge. Not only once, many times. This exact thing happened before. 
Idk why but some time during summer I just started feeling, empty? I was mostly sad when walking home from his house, cause he said somth? Honestly idk, idk what made me sad. Somewhere here my eating disorder started. Now, it‚Äôs come to eating=severe panic attacks, i hate myself so much, not only my body, I hate everything I say or do or think. I‚Äôve managed to hide the eating thing from my family but my friend know. He doesn‚Äôt really seem to bother, which is nice, makes it easier for me.

571,hamartiated,1577333318,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Before then, things were different.  In my mind, I felt people I knew were barely putting up with me - like they were just being friendly to be polite or out of pity.  I felt I didn‚Äôt belong or mattered, I was just someone you bumped into and forget about.  Even if I felt I had a decent conversation with someone, I‚Äôd walk away thinking it went horrible.

I felt lonely in the sense where I had people to interact with but my friendships with them felt superficial - from my perspective at least.

I just turned 31. I made a pact with myself in my late 20s that if I hadn't had any progress toward career, education, or relationship by 30 I'd kill myself. Spoiler alert I didn't. Ever since I turned 30 my light is gone. My fire for life. My idk essence? Nothing has meaning. I've done the life calculus and it all comes up too temporary to be worth all the work getting to. Also I've missed so much already I cant get back. What I wouldn't give to experience being 16 and in love for the first time. All the stupid overdramatic romanticizing that goes on. My dreams have all died, and I have no energy to find myself again. I'm so terribly lonely. I hug a pillow at night I'm so starved for attention.

596,cm44450,1577315087,1,"Sorry for the really long post,
I haven‚Äôt talked to anyone in years and Ive been in a really bad mood the past few days thinking about what to do, and I just need to vent. 

My whole life I‚Äôve been treated like shit. Wether it was by kids in school or by my family.
My mom gave up rights to me when I was a baby and I lived with my dad and step mom when I was little. I was abused by my step mom and my dad didn‚Äôt ever do or say anything about it. She would constantly tell me I was worthless and I will always be a disappointment and slap me and laugh in my face., and many other things. Things eventually ended between my dad and her and we moved in with my grandparents around the end of middle school. I only had two friends in elementary that followed into middle school. Then after moving in with my grandparents and starting at a new middle school in 6th grade, I haven‚Äôt had a single friend since. I was bullied for my appearance all through the last year of middle school and all of high school. Not for my weight, I had a growth spurt at the end of middle school, and Ive been the same 5‚Äô10 150~lb for the past 10 years. I just had bad acne (I still have some acne but its nowhere near as bad) and everyone would look at me and talk about me like I was a freak. I don‚Äôt why, I always showered every day after school, I tried things like proactive, but nothing seemed to work, Ive never been a fan of candy or chocolate, so I don‚Äôt know what caused my bad acne. My dad got a new girlfriend when I was a freshman in high school and he got a house with her and her son who was a grade higher than me at the same school. He left me at my grandparents and moved in with her, he told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me.
In school I was always forced into someones group for projects by the teacher because no one wanted to pick me. After school I would just come home and lay in bed and just listen to music, contemplating killing my self, but I was always too much of a coward to ever go through with it. Things didnt last with my dad and his girlfriend and he ended up having to move in with me and my grandparents at the end of my senior year, and he just pretended like everything was normal between us, but to this day I cant look at him without remembering what he said to me. After high school I went to a community college paid for by my grandparents who saved for me to go. I changed from going to campus to taking the courses online after two semesters because it was still the same thing, no one wanted to be my friend or work with me and people still looked at me like I was a freak. I did two years and dropped out, I felt terrible everyday and couldn‚Äôt focus on my work. I applied to nearly everything in my town and managed to get a full time job at a grocery store that paid minimum wage ($7.65 in Dallas, TX), and worked there for two years. But I lost my job at the end of 2017 when they let go almost everyone including management and got new management and hired new employees. And at the end of last year my grandparents moved into one of their other houses to get away from my dad and his girlfriend. And Im still stuck in this fucking house with my dad and her, I cant afford to move anywhere, and I haven‚Äôt been able to find a job. I have sold almost everything I own and I am down to my last hundred dollars and I don‚Äôt know what to do. But its probably for the best. I don‚Äôt think I can take another year living like this.

606,UtopianSoldier,1577308458,1,"Everything has been terrible. I always try to improve my life. But my life has always been one step forward, two-step backward.

I've a so called best friend of 1.5 years. I always care for her, go out of my way to be there for her. But she didn't even remember my birthday. I feel if you call someone your best friend, you should at least bother to remember their birthday. When I told her I am upset, she instead blame me and told me I should have reminded her. I thought I should stop going out of my way to do things for her in future, and asked her to move on and forgot what happened. But now she has been total prick. Like never initiating conversations,.. it's messing with my head so much.

Reminded me of my birthday 2 years ago I think. I had invited some friends (they were part of a city whatsapp group) to a party. And two of them were making out while I was standing on my birthday like a loser. I never felt so terrible and wanting to die. It's my birthday and my friends are making out and I am all alone. I literally ran away from my birthday party.

Also few years ago, I met a girl on an app while traveling. Next day her friend also joined her with a guy who she met online. But it was not enough. She also invited one more guy. Now they are 5 of us out in a bar. Now her friend and the guy start kissing each-other and I am looking at them like a loser. I ran away from there.

Also something happened few months ago. I met a girl with plan to go on hiking next morning. We promised that we will do it and made all the plan and were going to our hotels in a different direction. While that time, I saw her talking to some stranger guy while leaving. Fast forward after I packed and waked up early for hiking in the morning, I get a text from her that she went to a party last night and cannot join anymore. So why promise? Why make me wake at 5 in the morning? I just hate it.

Also, I don't understand how that guy approached her. I just can't apprach anyone ever in my life. I wish I had some personality.

Also this week. I am in a beach town for Christmas (see trying to improve my life). But all I see is happy couples in love. I feel so lonely here all the time. I've been trying to do sight-seeing but I feel so miserable and crying looking at the happy couples. I wish I was not all alone. I think I am a decent person if not very good. I care and respect, but nobody even gives me a chance. I feel if given chance, I can show, I am worth keeping. But never. Just walking all alone. 

Also regarding one step forward, two step backward. I am originally from a conservative country. After studying hard and working so much on my career, I managed to find a great job in Europe. But eventually my family forced me to come back. I thought maybe I can be a digital nomad and travel the world, but no, I am forbidden to travel outside my country. So I can travel only within my country.

I am diagnosed with moderate clinica depression and OCD. I don't know about ocd, but my parents are hugely responsible for depression. They never let my skills develop and then blamed for having no social skills. I was not allowed to hangout with my friends in evening, or play outside. My sister who was in my class, would snitch on me all the time. One time I talked to a girl in my class and my sister told them. So they decided to shame me so much and took away internet from me, and forced me to end friendship with a close friend because apparently he was a bad company for me.

It's no wonder I am loser like this who have no social skills esp when it comes to girls. Why would someone like me or want to kiss me. I don't want too much. I just want a decent person in my life who is also my best friend. I swear I will always take care of her and make her a priority and always be there for her. I don't want to walk on beaches alone, I don't want to sleep in bed alone, I don't want to travel alone. I wish I had somebody.

If you want to make fun of me or criticize me, please please stay away. I am feeling so terrible already and crying. I don't want you.",lonely,I feel like crying this whole week,2019-12-26 08:14:18

For whoever reads this (probably no one), I am simply writting this to try and understand what is wrong with me. I have no friends, no family, no girlfriend or wife. I am truly alone and by myself. I was never close to my family. As I simply never developed a connection to them. We were never active with extended family and we always did our own things in the house. Although I have 2 older brothers and my parents, I havent talked to them in years. When I did talk to them it was as short as possible so I could retreat back into my hole. My oldest brother molested me when I was six (never told anyone) and is a idiot who could never stay out of legal trouble while being the greatest human on earth, dont believe me, just ask him. He will tell you all about it. My middle brother was nice but I never spoke to him much. My Mother was a religious nut who always tried to force her religious beliefs on me (I am a anti-theist atheist) and we never saw eye to eye. She threw insults and smart ass remarks every moment she could and later disowned me and would call me the child of the devil. She was not a wife to my father and never did anything but suck the life out of everything she could lay her hands on. My Father was the best father anyone could ask for and gave everything he could to everyone. While getting everything sucked out of him from my mother. I never truely deserved my father and I know I must be a disappointment. Although I exceded academically I was bullied throughout elementary, middle, and highschool. It was hard to get friends and any friend I did make was short lived. As they grew and changed while I stayed the same, useless mass while they moved on and grew apart. I could never keep a friend for long. I tried so hard. I gave them space, I always said that we can do whatever they want and I was, often, more then willing to pay and was conscious of my ""needy-nesss"" level. When they asked if it was ok they do something else I always said yes and tried to be as easy going as possible. In my schooling years I was very suicidal and was admitted into the mental hospital multiple times being diagnosed with Severe Depression Disorder, a sleeping disorder, Serve social axiety, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (centered on repetitve thoughts) as far as girls and intimate relationships go I have never had one. I have had a few times when I talked regularly with girls and became close friends (for me anyways). I am a average looking smuch and I never approached them with the idea of intimacy. But there was always a bit of hope. Each of them asked me if it was ok if they see their, now, boyfriends and I always said yes and that as long as they are happy then thats all that matters. They always asked why I have never asked a girl out. The truth is, if I love someone then I should want whats best for them, and deep down I know that isn't me. They always said I was wrong and that I'm a sweet guy that anyone would be happy to be with. But I think it was just to make me feel better. I have only ever kissed and cuddled with  one girl. To my surprise she was the one who ignitiated it and thanked me for the night (we slept holding each other the entire night falling asleep below the stars). She is now dating someone else that she was interested in at the time. Saying that she isn't sure how she feels about me but knows she likes him and wants to try to date him. I have been giving her space the six or so months to try to not complicate her relationship with him and allow her and him more time. I find that I now have stopped contact with everyone and have no one. I don't have friends at work and I have no personal life. I often find myselfing wishing I had someone to share with. Someone to share my time, feelings, and love with. I'm not even talking about intimately. I just want a friend. Although I do dream of once again being able to hold a beautiful girl in my arms again. To feel her breathing and hearing her happy sleepy noises. To feel a kiss again. I woulf just settle fot a buddy. But I don't think that this is in my future... I think that I will forever be alone. Dreaming of friends and love. I am in a successful job and have plenty of money. But with no one to share it with I find little point to do anything but go to work and come home to my computer. I think I need to accept that I will forever be alone...I just need to get to that point.

641,Existing-Sandwich,1577277055,1,"I am moving out of home soon, while i don't want to live alone given my struggles with extreme loneliness i feel I desperately am in need a fresh start.
I have never had many friends though school, I did hang out with and talk to many people when i went to school but i only ever hung out with one friend outside of school and tbh i don't know why. Many people i grew up with where jealous of me and that has caused me a lot of trouble over the years. 

I now have been thinking my one true friend may also be jealous of me and have been the reason why i cannot make any other friends or find a girlfriend. I was at a party recently and i was talking to a girl i previously went to school with, not long after i started talking with her, my friend was tapping me on the shoulder trying to get my attention, calling my name and shoving his phone in my face so he could show me some video he found on Facebook. And only then did it click, he was always doing this to me when i am talking to anyone but him, especially girls. 
Recently i asked a girl to go on a date with me and she agreed, (my friend was there when i asked her) i saw her a few days later and we talked and she still seamed interested in going on a date. Later on I noticed my friend had been messaging her and after that she no longer replied to my messages. I used to trust him so i told him girls i was interested in or talking too and i always noticed if he didn't have them as a friend on social media he would add them after i talked to him. There is lots of little things i have been noticing. I remember when i had a bit of a fall out with a girl i was friends with at school, he sided with her which was fine but he tried to make her hate me more but making up things I supposedly said and then came back to hanging out with me link nothing happened. (I am mutual with this girl again, this happened at the beginning of the year)

Am i crazy or could he be sabotaging my relationships with people?

Anyway now that all that is behind me i am looking to more forward, because i am moving to an entirely new location i will need to meet new friends, the place is located by the sea so maybe i could meet someone there. 
Does anyone know of good places to be able to meet someone?

I work online so i wouldn't be meeting anyone though work. 

Also what could you say to a stranger if you approached them?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, to anyone who read this have a wonderful day :)",lonely,"Moving away from home and everyone i know + I think my only ""true friend"" has been sabotaging my relationships with others.",2019-12-25 23:30:55

So today was an incredibly hard day for me. I‚Äôm still getting over a rather heavy break up scenario from months ago, as well as this being the first year I haven‚Äôt had my typical friend group in my life. I could get into the details of all of this but I don‚Äôt want to lol, so I‚Äôll try to summarize as best as possible. 

The last week or two have really been difficult regarding loneliness for me, but today one of my friends accidentally spiked that by saying that my ex, Alicen, had some shit happen. Upon asking around, I found out her car was totaled in a crash, and that friend later added that she had posted about getting gifts from Danny and Ben (just naming them to keep track).

Both of these details really yanked at my heart. The crash because I still deeply care about her regardless of anything she did to me, and the other being that the gifts bring back many old memories I have with Danny and Ben, being that they are my ex friends. Essentially what happened between us was I was a good friend to Alicen after her and Danny broke up (it‚Äôs a really messy story but take my word I didn‚Äôt do any wrong, I basically just talked to her after her and Danny broke up), which then prompted Danny to kick me out of his life unless I stated wrongdoing. Ben is just a fuck who does exactly what Danny does. 

Last Christmas the four of us exchanged gifts together and I bought them all copies of Minecraft so we could all play. Roughly two months later is when the friend shit all went down. 

On top of these heartaches being brought to surface, my family also was stressing me out quite a bit making it hard for me to properly think through my emotions. And then we went into a game stop. 

Me and Danny had been friends since kindergarten, and we would often play video games together. Walking into that GameStop after all of that was nearly impossible, yet my sister really wanted to get a switch. I almost broke down crying thinking back to all the times me and Danny had gone into a GameStop to buy cheap co-op or multiplayer games. 

Today was incredibly tough. I feel like I have nobody to really go to to talk about any of this. I feel that I‚Äôd give anything to have everything back, even though I know it‚Äôd literally drive me to suicide to do that. I miss feeling cared about.

I realize that last paragraph is really dark and scary, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone on this problem. I think there‚Äôs probably a lot of people that are like me in this regard, fighting their own battles this holiday season. My hope is that if you read all of this and think you can relate somehow, that you realize you‚Äôre not alone either. If you‚Äôre feeling comfortable, then maybe comment your own experiences.

I really don‚Äôt know how useful this will be to anyone, but at the least, writing a post on reddit has been my go to way to figure out some emotional distress. Message me with absolutely anything you might want to talk about, I love replying to people. And happy holidays to everyone out there who thinks that‚Äôs an oxymoron.

671,hamartiated,1577246903,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-12-25 15:08:23

686,Existing-Career,1577240625,1,"Hi, so I‚Äôm 20 and a 3rd year student in university. I realized that I don‚Äôt have many friends. I had a boyfriend who I dated for 3 years since our senior year of high school but we broke up in our second year of university. During high school, my boyfriend at the time and I had many mutual friends so that‚Äôs how we knew each other and started dating. 3 years later, we broke up because I cheated... which I know was totally my fault. This was in October 2018 when we broke up. I started seeing a new guy in November 2018 and we started dating in January 2019. Throughout the few months and while I was seeing the new guys, things were falling apart with my friends as the story got out about how I cheated on him and almost all my friends from high school took his side. They were also friends with him too. It was weird because I messaged those friends form high school and they would never reply to me or left me on read and never invited me out to anything after. Our friend group that me and my boyfriend at the time (now ex) shared would use to all hang out together. We would do secret Santa, throw parties, go out to eat, celebrate birthdays, go bowling and etc. I didn‚Äôt really feel so lonely in the beginning and middle of 2019, but my new boyfriend I had broke up with me in September 2019. So ever since then I‚Äôve been so lonely. I only have one friend I would consider close and she‚Äôs the only one that I hang out with. I have made friends from school but the only problem is that they‚Äôre just ‚Äúschool‚Äù friends and not the type you hang out with outside of school. I‚Äôve tried really hard to make friends this semester but I felt like my personality did not really match other, but I did click with some people. During this Christmas break I texted 3 people and made plans with them but some of them ended up not following through or had something that came up. My close friend I have is the only one that I‚Äôve hung out with so far during Christmas break... 

I feel like it‚Äôs easy for me to make friends. I‚Äôm a nice person and I am someone that listens to you when you talk. I‚Äôm not ugly, I get many compliments from people about my looks. I dont mean to sound cocky or anything but people have told me things like I‚Äôm ‚Äúabsolutely gorgeous‚Äù, had TONs of men hit on me at the club and at raves and guys have looked back at me twice when walking by. So I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with my looks. But something that I have struggled with throughout my life is confidence. I use to be a very shy person. By very shy I mean in kindergarten other classmates would come up to me and say hi and try to be my friend but I would just ignore them because I was to shy to say something back. I‚Äôm 20 right now and I‚Äôm a nursing major, so it has really helped me to push me out of conform zone to talk to random patients. I feel I‚Äôm comfortable with talking to strangers, but I don‚Äôt know how to get started, like I‚Äôm not confident enough to go up to someone randomly and start talking to them. 


Could someone maybe help me out? I feel like I‚Äôm introverted by nature but people tell me that I‚Äôm very friendly. I enjoy going to raves and would love to have a group of friends who are girls to plan trips to Vegas with and go out on the weekends :( 

I was thinking of joining a sorority in my first year of uni, but I realized it was too much commitment and I didn‚Äôt have the time with schedule in school.",lonely,How to make new friends?,2019-12-25 13:23:45

Regarding the topic here, i'm a 20yo male and i don't have a great social circle, it's actually nonexistent  and i think this is happening because I feel in some way superior to other people. I perfectly know that i'm not superior to anybody but that is the excuse i have in my head to avoid social interaction with the people i think don't have anything related to me, they just bore me.

695,LonleyKnights,1577236778,1,"Yet another Christmas alone... come to think of it, I have never had an adult Christmas spent with someone I love.  I was raised in a religion that didn't celebrate Holidays, then I was foolish enough to spend most of my 20s in a toxic relationship with a married woman.  I was content to just feel some sort of love... and therefore never sought the real thing from a woman that I could actually be with.  So I spent all of my holidays alone... while she was enjoying life with her real family.  

Surprisingly to noone at all, that relationship failed when I was 28... and I fell into a deep depression, realizing I had wasted all of my 20s, when I could have been out with friends, meeting women and potential future wives, enjoying my life.  This depression gripped me even harder as the economy forced me to lose my very well paying job, and therefore the house I owned.  By the time I was 30, I had nothing.  I started gaining tons of weight... replacing the comfort of love and materialism, with food.  

This just made it even harder to leave the house, as I was so self conscious about my weight.  On a few occassions I even hid behind ladders and grocery isles when I spotted someone ""I used to know"" in public.  I was afraid for them to see how much of a failure my life had become.  This lead to more eating, and more depression... I went to work and came home.  Things that people take for granted... going to the movies, out to dinner, over to a friends house, a concert, camping... had all completely ceased, for years.  I lost all of my friends.

My drastic weight gain became a passive way to kill myself... knowing full well, as I hit 600 pounds at age 35, that my life would soon come to an end if I didn't make changes.  I came to grips with this, as I shoveled more tear soaked food into my mouth.

Health problems, that are surprisingly not related to my weight, took me out of work at 35.  I went on disability.  Though the health problems were not related to the weight, my weight did make recovering nearly impossible.  I have slowly become weaker, and more fatigued as these few jobless years have gone by.  At 37 I spend most of my day sleeping, getting out of bed for a few hours to kill time playing a few video games, and eating.  I haven't had sexual contact with a female in over 10 years now.  I have lost a little bit of weight, but nothing even remotely close to taking me out of the risk range for cardiac arrest before I hit 40.  At my size, losing even 100lbs still leaves you weighing 3x the normal person's weight.

Christmas roles around... in my quiet one bedroom apartment, I sit here watching youtube videos, thinking about all of those friends I left behind, somewhere off with their families, laughing, drinking, looking after their kids, and appreciating each other.  I have noone to call, noone to visit... I will receive no presents tomorrow.  Hell, i don't even know if I will wake up tomorrow.  My family all lives in far away states, and I have been distant from them physically and emotionally for far too long to think I will even talk to them over these holidays.

Every Christmas that goes by, I think to myself... ""Another lonely season.  Maybe next year will be different."" Yet, it never is.  I have no wife, no kids, and no self worth.  I remember the energetic, social, and rather attractive youth I used to be... and when I see myself in the mirror, at 540lbs, balding, alone, and aging... I can't help but think my life is over, at only 37.  I'm sorry if this brings anyone else down... this is seemingly my only way of having ""someone"" to talk to on this lonely Christmas Eve.",lonely,Feel Like My Life Is Over at 37,2019-12-25 12:19:38
696,gyubari,1577236517,1,"Recent lurker, and first time poster! Just wanted to get my feelings out somewhere. 

I've spent a couple of days with my family, as I am home for the holidays. Home for the holidays, I have been trying to shove the Christmas spirit down my throat. I've been baking for the past week, cleaning, reading, writing, watching Christmas movies, putting Christmas music on as much as I can. Healthy distractions. I have so much to be blessed about, so much to be grateful about. I graduated debt-free from undergrad in May, I start medical school in July, my parents just moved into a beautiful home, I survived my first real adult job during my gap year, and my extended family is healthy and well. I am able-bodied, financially stable, have parents who love me, and plenty of friends to spend the holidays with. I had a holiday gathering just the other day filled with laughter and hot chocolate with some of my close friends. I watched one of my favorite Christmas movies with my best friend last night, staying up and staring at a Yule log till late. I just finished a Christmas Eve dinner with my family tonight. 

But I feel so incredibly empty. Fighting chronic depression for 7 years now with so much therapy, feeling alone during the holidays seems almost inevitable. It's where the loneliness is highlighted and all of your insecurities are brought to the surface. Everything that you did wrong, everything that you have to be ashamed about is illuminated to tell you that you are not worthy of love or anything good. 

I crave the touch of somebody who isn't a relative, who isn't my best friend, who aren't my high school friends, or my college study group. I crave the safety of the relationship I lost, the security of a future of my own choosing that now seems so structured that I can't deviate from it. I didn't think I'd be swiping left and right on Tinder on Christmas Eve, listening to ""Blue Christmas"", and writing my heart out on Reddit. 

This is my 4th glass of wine, and I want to cry but the tears aren't coming.

Tomorrow is most likely going to be similar; being surrounded by family members that don't interact with me often. Wouldn't call myself shy, but it is really hard to just go up to a stranger and start a conversation. 

The feelings of loneliness have been confusing. Part of me really wants to be with even just one person, but the other part thinks being alone is for the best. I'm not boyfriend material  (emotionally unavailable, don't particularly want to commit to anyone, not the most empathetic), I'm a pretty bad friend all things considered, and I have long-standing trust issues that make it hard to introduce new people to my circle.

My partner broke up with me 6 months ago, ending a 5-year relationship. Yesterday, I got a pretty bad performance review at work and I think there is a real chance I'll lose my job. 

I can't help but think about where I was a year ago, celebrating Christmas in a warm and cozy setting with my partner. Everything was good at work. 

And one year later, I'm sad and feeling so much pain when thinking about the break up and how much I miss being in a loving relationship. I'm going on dates but nothing seems to be growing into a real connection. I don't understand why. 

I don't know how to make things better at work. I'm terrified of the prospect of losing my job. 

And to numb the pain, I'm doing the only thing I can - I eat. I stuff myself until it hurts in my stomach and the emotional pain goes away. 

I'm a big fan of self-growth, of taking a crisis and turning it into an opportunity. That is what I've been making the effort to do in the last 6 months. But today, something snapped in me and I cried while walking in the street, watching people around me laughing and holding hands and looking like they belong here. 

I feel so lonely. I'm trying to make friends, going to social events where I don't know anyone and talking to people. I've definitely made lots of acquaintances. But I can't seem to move past that to creating meaningful relationships. And I'm starting to think that maybe there is something wrong with me. I've always thought of myself and nice and kind and likable. But people don't want me as their friend, so that has to say something about me, right? And romantic relationships - I'm really eager to move on, I'm ready. But I just haven't met someone who is interested in me while I'm interested in them. It's always one or the other. And I don't get. I sit here, writing this, on my bed. Surrounded by a pile of clean clothes that I haven't put in the closet and empty wraps of chips and chocolate. Crying. Because it hurts to be so lonely and I don't understand why it is the way it is.

My dad and I went to H-E-B to buy some stuff for a Christmas barbecue family get-together tomorrow.  Well, as I was pushing the shopping cart, I saw somebody that I had a crush on that has never given me a chance, 15 years ago and just last month.  Well, this reaction manifested into a full-blown anxiety attack.  I don't know if this is silly or not, but my dad was there to observe the whole thing.

This is not the first time I've overtly averted someone who's hurt me in my search for a girlfriend, and responded to the sight of her as I would a mortal enemy, but this is the first time my own flesh and blood has observed this of me.

I like the idea of living abroad and independence, and while I miss my family I think I'd be sad and disappointed in myself if I went back. Regardless that doesn't mean I don't feel alone.

It also doesn't help that it being Norway the locals are difficult to socialize with.

Moving on, another reason is that I am gay and I had several negative experiences with girls when I was a kid. I still don't feel comfortable getting close to girls emotionally, so that means most of my friends are guys. This sucks. The gay ones make it all about sex, which doesn't alleviate my loneliness, and the straight ones clearly have a harder time vibing with you, which is understandable.
Additionally this makes it harder for me to feel comfortable around my family or just being myself in some contexts.

Finally, I guess I'm just a bit choosy. Sometimes I just don't wanna meet people that I'm sure are completely fine human specimens, just because I don't ""feel"" it. I know it's dumb, but I really ""felt"" it with my best friend (who has unfortunately long ago moved away) and it has made me rely on it sometimes to make the decision.
And I simply would rather be alone and lonely sometimes than force myself to hang out with people that aren't my cup of coffee. I know some people may surprise you, but I suppose I would be unable to conceal my awkwardness, or that it'd be more of a draining effort than just being alone.

It's christmas now, and first time in many many years, I am alone. I broke up with my girlfriend half year ago and it's the past now, but loneliness doesn't go away, or I am somehow lost. I have my family and I am respecting them, but there's something more. There is something on my heart but I don't know what. There's a hole that need to be filled.

I have a job, money, hobbies (gym, guitar, frisbeegolf. Thinking to start some martial artists), own apartment, friends. I am probably going to study again at next spring. I have some goals. I could have more friends. I don't have many friends and at this point it is not easy to get them.

I am introvert, but very very human-centric. I like to chat with people, but I am really bad at small talking. Conversations are not easy to begin unless I am doing it on internet. Or being drunk. But alcohol is not really a part of my life anymore.

I felt so long time that I will never get a crush again, because I don't want to hurt myself again. I have some bad dating experience in the past. Then I meet this girl on internet. She's basicly everything I want, so many same thoughts and values of life, music taste, etc.. And she's beautiful. We were in same school 14 years ago, it's crazy. I am 28 year old now btw. We met once and I am having a little crush. Just a little, like taking a step back now. Date didn't go that well because I was so nervous, she felt it. But she said she wanna see me again, if I agree too. But she's being busy now (she has 7 year old kid and 3-shift work, etc..). Meanwhile we can keep chatting. Well, haven't heard from her for 2, almost 3 days now. Feel like shes ghosting. This situation is making things worse right now so wanted to share it.

Anyway, after 28 years I thought that I am satisfied with myself, but no. But I am not exactly sure where I am lost. I want to find inner peace and **be happy alone**. First of all I need something new, but will it fix things? Should I talk to someone?

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4.

There was this girl working and i started seeing her more often there. at a certain time she started joking with me(without us ever having an actual conversation) because i was there so often. after that we started to talk whenever we saw each other and also through text and i didn't thought anything of it. Allthough she was the prettiest girl i've ever seen, i didn't try hitting on her cuz i liked talking to her and didn't want that to stop if i would ruin things by said hitting on her. after some time passed i caught myself catching feelings for her, and after like 2-3 months i told my friend that i had a crush on this girl. she happened to know the girl because of her brother who used to be in the same class as her in high school. another time has passed and i'm still crushing very hard on this girl. My friend, who's an idiot btw, went to her at the mcdonalds and started talking to her about boys and stuff. my friend is a girl who i met at work, so they easily talked about boys. my friend wanted to figure out is she had an boyfriend and what she looked for in a guy. she told her that she was single and that she wants someone who genuinly wants to spend time with her no matter where they are. liking sitting at home all day in pjs and just talking chilling and stuff. which is also what i want so i thought that it was great. after the convo my friend had with this girl she asked for her number cuz she had to tell her something important. she gave it to my friend. my friend later proceeded to text her that a guy was crushing on her. after some texts with her she wanted to know who it was and she told her that it was me. without me knowing anything about this thing going on. after she knew it was me she apparently didn't respond for a day or two. after she finally responded she told my friend that it was impossible for us to be together because of the age gap. She is 25 btw(i know, too old for me but what can i do, i just fell in love).

after this girl told my friend this, my idiot friend got my phone and started texting her through my phone. saying stuff like give me a chance you're like an angel when you smile, it's like everything else just fades away and some more cheesy stuff. even though i actually felt that way about her smile and stuff i was pissed that she sent her this. i thought that it was all over. i knew that we wouldn't be together because of the age gap and i had made peace with it, because after all i was talking to her almost daily. during this period i had a lot going on. school was very hard and at home i was always very stressed. but whenever i saw this girl and i heard her voice, i just forgot everything like it just faded away. she made me feel so calm and kind of happy. and after these text messages i thought that i would lose all these convorsations with her, and lose also this calm feeling. which i indeed lost. everytime i saw her since it was very awkward and we didn't talk at all.

after a month of this all happening i texted her saying something just wasn't right, and that i couldn't get my mind off her. i was hoping that she would say something like i don't like you in that way or you're just a friend of mine instead of just hearing the age gap. but thats just all she tells me. our age gap is too big. i know that, and it kind of breaks me inside thinking that if we would be the same age that it could work out between us. i even asked her if that we would be the same age that it maybe could turn into something, but she didn't gave me an answer. i know that she doesn't like me that way but still i needed to hear it from her, so that i could come peace with it if that tv any sense. she went on to say that she would just keep talking to me the way before she knew that i was crushin onher, but i knew that wouldn't happen again. 4 months has passed now since her finding out and this freakin girl is still on my mind most times of the day. i just wanna talk to her again like we used to, but i know that we will probarly never go back to that so i have to get her off my mind. but i have no clue how. 

I feel lonely ever since this happened and i know i have other friends and family who care about me and love me but i just can't help but feeling alone. Something about her made just happy by hearing her say hello. And now it's all gone and i don't know what to do anymore.

I hope you all have a great Christmas!

As for me, well, I feel really strange, and lonely.

I'm not physically lonely (I live in a house with my Mum, Sister, and there will be lots of Family coming over for Christmas to 'celebrate' it). But I feel completely disconnected with reality.

I've always been an introverted person, but I think I convinced myself (subconsciously) a while back that I was a BIG introvert. This means I've essentially hibernated socially for the last few years, which means my friends and other companions have been forming new friendships and broadening their horizons in life, whereas I haven't, and I've sort of fallen out of sync in life (it feels like it anyway).

When they ask me what 'plans' I have for Christmas and New Years Eve, I have to lie and come up with something vaguely interesting, because ""I'm doing nothing"" is just sad, and maybe lying to them makes me feel better as I'm setting up a fantasy in my own head.

I'm trying pretty hard to enjoy the festive period, even though it often feels forced, and I'm often caught daydreaming or drifting off mentally by my Mum who will often be looking at me and asking ""Is everything ok? You seem a bit down"". Well she's right, but I know she is unable to help me, as the things I need to do to improve my life can only come from within myself.

Anyway, this was a bit of an aimless ramble I'm afraid. So you get a gold star if you had the patience to read all of this.

Hi guys,

I‚Äôm a 19 year old boy from The Netherlands and this is the first time I‚Äôve actually created an account and posted something on Reddit, so let‚Äôs see how it goes

This year I got diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). It started off with simple mood swings but quickly grew to become a disorder that would determine most of the actions in my own life. It felt as if my mind was seperated into two different entities, with the ‚Äúbad‚Äù one taking most of the control.  I began to push friends and family away, began abusing substances such as weed, alcohol and cigarettes, and have unsafe sex. I quit school and started an 8 to 5 job, and moved back in with my dad (he lived in another city during the weekdays, because it was closer to his work, so essentially I still lived alone) This period in my life was the most alone and scared I had ever felt. I lost all my friends. Pushed my family away when they tried to get close. The worst part of it was, I was aware. I was totally aware my life was spiraling out of control because of my own actions yet there was nothing I could do about it

However, 2019 has also been the year where I got to meet the most special person in my life. Amidst all the chaos, I had the pleasure of meeting Myself. The only constant in my life, the one that has seen everything I have seen, cried with me, laughed with me. This may sound weird to some, but meeting myself has been the reason I was finally able to tell this ‚Äúother entity‚Äù no. Enough is enough. This is my life, and I‚Äôm going to live it the way I want to. Ofcourse this didn‚Äôt immediately fix all of my problems, but at least it gave me a base from where to start. I finally have the will and power to face my problems, and started working on resolving them

For every person who is going through the same or is feeling alone during this time of the year, please hang in there. Please feel free to send me a message any time, I‚Äôd love talk, or just casually chat, whatever you want :) I would love to help you in any way I can",lonely,The year I met the most special person in my entire life,2019-12-24 18:42:21

I gave up everything for that godawful marriage. Friends? Phased out and slowly cut off. I didn‚Äôt have *real* friends anyway. Family? Alienated. My parents and I have really reconnected in the last year but you know deep down that it will never be the same. Hobbies? I didn‚Äôt really have any before. I liked video games and other assorted nerd stuff. All of which I slowly gave up for her. 

I just want a hug. 

Now she‚Äôs gone. She‚Äôs with *him*. And I don‚Äôt know what to do any more. I scroll through my phone and don‚Äôt see one person I can open up to. The only people I‚Äôve spoken to in the last year besides her family are my parents. I realize that none of the people from church (which I hated but went to for her) have spoken to me since the divorce. The few that I‚Äôve texted never responded. I fire up Warframe, fart around with my mods for a little bit, then turn it back off. I open a book, but I cant care about it and close it back within minutes. I scroll one loop through Netflix and then the tv off. I type out my 100th Reddit sadpost of the day and (usually) delete it. 

I just want a hug. I want someone rub my head and tell me that everything is ok the way she used to. To hold my hand and tell me ‚ÄúBobby, you‚Äôre not stupid. You deserve to be loved.‚Äù To fall asleep on my chest and say that I make them feel safe. I want to have someone really listen to me and feel like I can let out all of the worst things that I keep bottled inside. Will I ever be able to do that again? Will I ever be able to trust someone like I used to trust her? It was all fake before. Why should I believe it the next time.

I just have all this affection sitting around, waiting to give it to someone. 

On the positive side of things, I did ask someone out for the first time a month ago. And at first I got a yes, which made me feel incredible. But the next morning it became a ‚Äòim not looking for anything more then friends‚Äô. Which sucks yeah, but I was ok with it. But even then, we only hung out once, and it was with someone else. Not that it wasn‚Äôt a good time or anything. I was just really proud of myself to finally do something like that, and it sucked to have the joy sucked out from it.

So yeah, I‚Äôm back to the drawing board. Hopefully thinking I might find something on a dating app. Hoping that I might run into someone that I end up liking enough to ask out, and then hoping things go well after that. 

But until then, I got nothing. And yeah I know things will happen eventually, things take time, all that Jazz. It‚Äôs nothing I haven‚Äôt already heard. And I‚Äôm not asking for dating advice either. I‚Äôve gotten enough of that as it is, and it‚Äôs all the same at this point.

797,portmantoblerone,1577159432,1,"Semi-long distance relationship of only a few months. Everything was going amazingly. I was supposed to be driving to visit him now. Instead, he very suddenly developed what seems to be severe bipolar mania. After the initial crisis a couple weeks ago, things seemed ok and he saw some doctors but refused medication. Suddenly a few days ago it happened again. 

In the last couple days, he's gone off the deep end, alienating his friends and family, and getting banned from businesses left and right, and engaging in dangerous behaviors driven by paranoia and delusion (heard about this from his mom who's absolutely bewildered, as are all his close friends). I spoke with him once on the phone and he was mean and aggressive without any logical flow. Any attempts at even gently suggesting seeing a doctor have been met with rage. 

I feel terrible for him and have been doing my best to be supportive and calm when talking to him or his mom, but inside I'm falling apart. I'm not sure if I'm even in a relationship anymore-- out of nowhere he sent me a bunch of very mean and insulting texts which I chose to ignore and tried not to take personally.

799,hamartiated,1577158961,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Truthfully and intentionally, I am sorry! I have always loved you and always will. I am sorry my love looked like judgement, condemnation and cruel.

I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression of what true uncondirional love looks and feels like. This is on me entirely! 

You my dear child were a gift to be cherished and celebrated because of everything you are and everything you do.

When you spilt the milk, scratched my new car or snuck out at night to meet you love. These were also gifts for me to lovingly share just how scared I was because of the overwhelming love I felt for you. So much love that I cried myself to sleep at times hoping I wouldn't mess you up too badly.

I accept I have made mistakes, some small and some huge and everyone felt like a betrayal to you. I am sorry with all of my heart.

Sometimes, as ridiculous as it sounds, we parents feel like we have failed you, when we see you doing something that may cause you pain. Even though your choices may be the best thing for you.

Your first love, I scared off so they wouldn't break your heart. When you came out as LGBTQ and all I could think about was fear. Fear of the prejudices you would hear. Fear of the insecurities that may come up.

However, Any of these situations, if they came up would have been a lot easier to handle, if you knew to your bones that Dad loved you and was proud of you and that you could call anytime for us to share a good cry. So I could tell you it would be alright because it always will be again.

I am sorry I didn't give you exactly what you needed  when you needed it.

Know today and always and especially during the holidays and times of happiness, time of concern and absolute fear that this Dad loves you with every ounce of my being.

You are perfectly, imperfect just as you were meant to be. I couldn't love you anymore. I think of you every day and hope you love yourself completely. Thank you for completing my life.

814,MysticMozzStixx,1577151743,1,"Hi. I am 23/f. I managed to push all of my friends out of my life but my very best friend by the time I got out of high school (self-fulfilling proficiency of losing all of my high school friends). My best friend and I were really like sisters and she even moved in with me briefly at one point. I had a serious boyfriend at the time, my first one (we were together 5 years total) and we all know how easy it can be to get wrapped up in them and them alone. But I never let that happen, I was always conscious of her and always made sure she never felt left out of my life or pushed aside. After high school (2014), my best friend and I grew apart a little bit, due to us both having serious boyfriends. Obviously I expected this. But over the years we just grew more and more distant, and not for my lack of trying. I should mention we only live 30 mins for eachother. That's when it started to feel like she didnt really care about me anymore. My boyfriend and I broke up in 2016, and that's when I just felt so lost. I didnt have any friends, my boyfriend, or even my best friend, whom of which I never imagined our relationship would change so drastically. We still talk sometimes, but at this point she's really just more of an acquaintance with the title of best friend, because she's the only one I ""have"". I have felt so lonely ever since. My next serious relationship began in 2017. We love eachother very much and we are still currently dating. But it still doesn't tame the loneliness because I still have no friends. While he is amazing and we're super close, it still sucks to not have anyone to talk to but your boyfriend. Now, I can't even really talk to him because he just left for Marine boot camp. I have family, but they're not really the type I can talk to about anything or reveal much of my true self too. I love them so much but they can be extremely judgemental. I just feel extremely lonely and isolated right now, and quite frankly like I might go insane lol. 

Anyway, I dont know what my point of writing this really was. I guess I honestly just needed someone or something to vent to. And maybe people to talk to. 

Also, I'm here to lend an ear to anyone else who might be feeling lonely. Merry Christmas!",lonely,I need friends.,2019-12-24 12:42:23

I am alone so I am unused to being around others my age, which causes people to prioritose others because I am not good with people.

What people either do not understand or do not care about is that I want someone to listen, and that in turn I would listen back. That is what a friend is. Someone to talk to without fear of prejudice and in turn someone who would talk back, expecting no prejudice. That is what I think I could give.

I have been alone for about 6 years now. I am in my first year of university, studying computer science. I like being outside and want someone to walk with through the forest I live in. I have walked through the surrounding area a lot by myself.  months from turning 20 and my teenage years have been wasted and hollowed. I need someone but no one is there.

Really I am just looking for anyone else I could reasonably get to, aged either 18 or 19, that I could spend some time with for the remainder of my last year a teenager.

818,EdGyMachine,1577147924,1,"Hey fellow lonely hearts, 

I have never ever posted something like this and don't even know how to start, but I just wanna come clean with myself. 

The last 2 years have been really hard for me. I'm usually a very social person, I have a lot of friends and never felt quite lonely until the point I met someone very special. Whilst being on Vacation I met the girl of my dreams 3 days before my flight home. I never would have even approached her, because I thought that I was way out of her league. However, it was she who told me that she really liked me. We spent the last 3 days together. It was like something out of a movie. Watching sunsets, kissing whilst doing so... it was like a dream &amp; I never experienced anything quite like this before. Those 3 days went by so quickly, but are still, to this day the best 3 days of my life. Unfortunately, I live in Germany and she lives in Spain. I had 2 relationships before, but I think this was the first time I was actually really in love with someone. I confessed to her &amp; she said she loved me, too. I was really flattered but didn't know what to do. After my flight home, we tried to keep contact up, but because of the distance and the wealth-state of her and my family we weren't really able to afford a meeting + I was in the middle of my A-levels then. The contact kind of broke down, after she told me, that ""she wasn't really ready for such kind of a relationship"", but also told me that she really ""loved me"". I haven't spoken to her in over 1 year. I had 1 relationship and plenty of dates until now because I hate being alone, but somehow I start comparing everyone to her. Not any of those dates &amp; not even the relationship felt like love for me. I sometimes wasn't even able to make love, because there was that feeling inside of me telling me that this is wrong and not even the person I actually love. No one matched her and I think my body just tried to fight the loneliness or try to cope with the loss of hers. I know you are not supposed to look at what happened, but I just can't. It's also very hard to express this feeling it makes me feel lonely when I'm home alone, even tho I have plenty of friends and being socially active. I know it sounds very childish and like some 14-year-olds love story, but I'm actually 20 now and this is still something I'm trying to figure out within myself. I can not stop thinking about her even tho I know it's only gonna f'ck me up.  I think I will never be able to find anyone like her and I hate myself for letting her go so easily. 

I'm here to seek help from those who might have experienced similar things. How do I handle this? How can I find someone who matches my expectations? Why do I feel so lonely, even tho I am not?",lonely,I don't know what to do.,2019-12-24 11:38:44

Recently, my 'girl' admitted to me that she is acting as my girlfriend for the sake of my happiness and was scared to admit that I would be sad again. I told her I am fully happy (and I love her truly from the bottom of my heart) and she replied a casual, ""Yay!"". 

Next day, I saw pictures of her and her new boyfriend (a lot quicker than I thought it would be) and I'm actually not too sad about lying to her about being happy. At least I gave space for her true love... Well, if you truly love someone who has done so much for you regardless if the intentions weren't the ones you expected, you'd do everything for them.

I actually do not know what to do anymore. I haven't necessarily talked to anyone because I don't have anymore friends other than her who needs to be with her true love.

I say females because I do already have a solid group of guy friends from my other online hobbies so sorry. I just recently discovered the world of reddit and I am 100% hooked. Sooo much information, and sooo many groups for anything of interest. You can kind of say that I am hooked. A little about me. I am a attached (married) Asian male, 27 (is that mid 20s, or late 20s? I dont even know LOL), 5'10"" descently attractive but can use more time at the gym, sweet, caring, and high energy when it comes to conversation. I would say I am an extreme oddball extrovert because I LOVE people, but i easily get deterred because of my lack of confidence does not allow me to easily make friends out of the blue unless they are online. Ive always been that way ever since I was growing up. Talking to people online or over text was so much easier than chatting in person. Probably because I am absolutely horrible at thinking of things on the fly. So texting allows me to think about my words before I say them I guess?  ok. back to me. I work in the great garden state of New Jersey as a project manager for a nice consulting company. Its a standard 8-4 easy going white collared office job with descent pay and lots of room to keep climbing the ladder. I love what I do but sometimes I feel like I overgive and overcommit to crazy deadlines. I like to take a lot of mental breaks throughout my day so I would go on twitter, IG or fb, and now recently mostly reddit to take mental breaks. On days that I don't have crazy projects to do, I can respond alot on discord or kik. I have been told recently but a couple of reddit friends that I am veryyyy chatty. Some find it endearing, and others will find it borderline annoying. Please, be warned. If you send me a message or text, ill probably get back to you within a minute if I see it. Because I am such a high need extrovert but dont have alot of outlets, I guess I am looking for some female friends for all definitions of ""friendship"". You can be cool, down to earth, flirty, bossy, I dont really mind, but I am still a guy right, so I do prefer the flirtier types. I am super flirty myself. As I noted earlier, I am married. I love my wife dearly but shes a super introvert and has previously restricted in our early dating days from talking to ladies. But now we are married so she trusts that I can be a good boy :) She's wasn't wrong to do so but you can only starve an animal so long before they go on a rampage right? I do have permission to take it in a little bit at a time. Just a little about me regarding interests, I recently have been obsessed with making cash via reselling sneakers and earning credit card points for traveling. I also watch a ton of subbed anime (black clover, fairy tail, Holy Grail Wars, and many many more) and play COD and LoL. I am well rounded because I do have a sporty side too with a little bit of laccrosse, basketball, and even going to the range to practice my aim. Oh, I also LOVEEE food of any culture. I can be boujee and eat a Wagyu or have a date night with a 4 for $4 at Wendy's :D . Harmless fun is suggested and just enough to satiate my hunger for attention would be appreciated. If you have made it this far into reading, thank you. I hope I still have your attention and we can chat. East Coast girls are better for the timezone but anywhere in the US is fine too :). I have kik but discord works 100% better for me. If my long winded post interests you, please send a DM and I will surely respond in a timely , probably 5 min, fashion :) Have a great weekend everyone and thank you for reading.",lonely,A little lonely 27 [m4f] NJ Descently Attractive Unicorn of an Asian guy for friends and more in US Please read all of my post,2019-12-24 00:18:33

893,kadepozniak,1577076764,1,"Boundaries. Boundaries are the biggest enemy of a human being. Boundaries where people trick your mind into limiting yourself to boundaries where people cross to humiliate you, make you feel in a certain way crossing the limits of a human being's humanity and morals disgracing the core values of humanity sending a person into a state of Anxiety and Depression. This has been the case with me and every person who goes through anxiety and Depression.

The human brain is not predictable so isn't it's thinking, but one thing can surely be said that most people can easily get into people's words and get discouraged easily, after all words cut sharper than knives inside the brain if taken to seriously and again that's something that happened with me too. A human forgets his/her true self and dwells into the discouraging thoughts these cruel people give rise to inside the brain through their hurtful, disgraceful and awful actions and the words they say to hurt people and they succeed when a person gives up and goes into his/her dark corners pulling himself away from the reality lost somewhere in the lost ruins of his/her mind. 

The thing here is, we tend to give up more easily and more often when easily persuaded and discouraged by people who like hurting people and make for their very own entertainment and jealousy of not wanting to see you excel in your life.

This inturn lowers a person's self confidence and in turn gives birth to to a state or depression and what arises in his/her brain through the change in their confidence and courage thereafter is known as ""ANXIETY"" which which comes in the way of everything, could come in many ways either through breakdowns, sudden heart beat rising out of increased fear due to lack of confidence when infront of a huge crowd or among people or sudden shivering, body turning cold and trembling and lowers his/her strength. 

This happened with me again.

In the end there's one thing a person should think and pull themselves back before it's too late. That what these people says and what the world wants you to be can't decide your way of living life or finding happiness and can't change your thinking, strengths and can't affect your aims because in the end you are like phoenix rising from your very own ashes everytime they try to burn you down because it's never too late even when you are cornered, all alone or even if it's you vs the world where you are all alone so be it and do whatever it takes and stand back on your feet rising up above and fighting it all for the world to witness your rise while these people remain where they are and realize in the end that hadn't they wasted their time into disgracing and pulling you down they'd have been somewhere better where you are and their shame, jealousy and regrets will be their end while you succeed.

Just chime in with your strengths and be that courageous master of your own life as you stand by giving your haters no attention what they want and those people coming in your way a gaze that will lower their confidence not yours because you don't deserve the anxiety and depression they want you to have . Nobody does. Find that one little thing that pulls you back in with more confidence and bounce back into this life that is precious and long enough to learn from and to grew into a stronger and better person.

I just did that. I found that one thing in my brain that arose in this darkest time, that one thing that I had that was going to revive me and that was my humor that was birthed in my brain during this darkest time when i had to find it and it made me feel happy and I felt as long as it makes me happy it's great and I don't care bout the rest when they come to pull me down they'll get a greater share of my actions. That's when I realized all of this what i talked to you about right now about depression and anxiety and stopped caring about what they said or did and if they ever came in my way I always give them that evil smirk and that gaze that lowers their confidence and an unending humorous take on them that makes lose their confidence and give up, declare me to be a mad person, mentally unstable or something else but deep down they now know that they cannot defeat me and that's where I have succeeded in driving them away from my life even when they get in my way through my strength, courage, unending faith in myself and this new found self.

You just gotta be strong. In the end you will succeed. All the very best for your life! And I'm always here to talk if you want to! :)

897,speared_cactus,1577072836,1,"I‚Äôve struggled with depression, anxiety, ocd, and an eating disorder for a long time. I‚Äôm also extremely lonely. I live 1500 miles away from my entire family (including extended family), and haven‚Äôt really made close friends in my new city. I‚Äôve struggled with loneliness long before I moved to a new state, however. Lately that and depression have been the main themes of my life. One way I‚Äôve always dealt with this is over-sharing on social media. I think It‚Äôs just an intense craving for connection and for someone to relate to what I‚Äôm going through. In the past I‚Äôve shared about my mental health in detail, struggles I was going through at the time, and certain things that were bothering me. For some reason it‚Äôs easier to word vomit all over social media than it is to ask someone close to me if I can talk to them. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not expecting a response with social media, and I‚Äôm not forcing someone to listen to my problems and have something to say back to me. Instead, people can just scroll through my post and ignore it if they want. In the past, posting like this was somewhat empowering for me. I got to get emotions off my chest, and the posts were always well received. Lately however, when I get the urge to post and go through with it, I get extremely anxious and feel physically sick 10 minutes after posting. Thinking about how many people know deep things about me makes me super uneasy. I think this started when someone from work used a post about my anxiety against me. Anyway, I always end up deleting the posts.  Now that this outlet is gone, I feel like everything is building up inside me and I‚Äôve been feeling really tense, negative, and sad. It makes me feel 100x more lonely. I just don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúthat girl‚Äù anymore. These people don‚Äôt deserve to know me so intimately.

899,hamartiated,1577071271,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-12-23 14:21:11

I'm trying to think of ways to implement this idea that people would be open to and would be easily implemented and actually used by people. How could we advertise this to places and where? Starbucks? In my head it's like, ""corner where you meet new people"", which I see happening. Do you think there'd be any safety implications?

eventually secondary school (high school) came around and it was worse, year on year i jumped to any group that would take me which eventually landed me in a group that i was bullied in. 
summer of this year was the worst time in my life, i was completely isolated, i felt like i couldn‚Äôt even talk to my family as they wouldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt understand and often thought of death. 
but after 3 months of preparing myself to ask i finally asked my mam could i go to therapy where i got diagnosed with anxiety and social anxiety. i now go every 2 weeks and while the whole friends thing is still a work in progress i am finally building my life up again and slowly building relationships

911,gabmgonzo,1577065416,1,"This is really hard for me to come to terms with and even talk about. I have been getting depressive/suicidal thoughts because of events happening more recently. I never have felt a part of a group or activity, or even had my own consistent thing. Ever since I was younger, i was never a part of anything for more than a year or so and my family could never keep up with the same thing. They would let me try out different things but never would continue them. I used to be a part of Girl Scouts for a few years and that stopped, I tried different sports like soccer and ice hockey and that stopped, we used to go ice skating with our family friends every Sunday and that stopped. Some of my favorite things stopped and I never got to form hobbies other than playing Pok√©mon on my Gameboy and DS for most of my childhood but even that stopped.  My family has been described as extremely scattered by people I know which is kind of hurtful because I never really thought of them that way but it‚Äôs true. We never know what to do and when we do something, if that fails, we move onto the next thing almost instantly. None of our relatives talk to us. I have a few aunts and uncles on each side with older cousins and I never see them anymore or throughout most of my adolescence childhood. I never felt like I had my own ‚Äúclan‚Äù. Even my own family does separate things in the same household so we never really connect as a whole and have things we like to do together other than shopping and go out for food but we are becoming broke so they don‚Äôt want to do that as often anymore which I can understand. My family friends don‚Äôt talk to me that much as friends anymore which makes me really sad because I was raised with them and I will reach out to try to talk and most of the time they won‚Äôt respond. Throughout high school I never had a set group of friends. Each year I would have a different pair of people and they would stop talking to me the next year. I thought I made some good friends my senior year but even then most of them except for one stopped talking to me and even blocked me without explanation. I‚Äôve been to college for 2 years and last year I thought I finally made some friends that would stick for longer than a year. This year my friends one by one stopped inviting me out, stopped replying to texts, and stopped talking to me in person even if I saw them. My roommate doesn‚Äôt even talk to me anymore and I let her move in with me because I thought we were friends. She ended up taking all my friends and now they all hang out together leaving me out of the picture and I am constantly alone. I have tried to talk to other people and even they stopped talking to me after a few weeks. I constantly feel alone by not having anyone to talk to or hang out with. I‚Äôve told my parents this and that I want to transfer to a different school but it‚Äôs been difficult. I can‚Äôt seem to find a school that has what I want to pursue. I have good grades and I am passionate about my career, I have a good opportunity for an internship that I really want to do and I hope I get it because that‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôm looking forward to. My mom made me really upset today because she said maybe things don‚Äôt work out for me and people don‚Äôt want to talk to me because of me, how I am myself, because this loneliness seems to follow me wherever I go. This made me feel extremely alone because they don‚Äôt see how hard I try to keep friends, they don‚Äôt understand the situations I‚Äôm put in where people can drop me like I‚Äôm nothing, they don‚Äôt get what it‚Äôs like to be me. My mom doesn‚Äôt seem to have a lot of friends either so its made me think maybe the apple doesn‚Äôt stray that far from the tree. I have recently thought about taking my life because I feel so worthless and the only reason I don‚Äôt is because I want to stay for my parents and I want to have my dream job and I want to be with the guy I love. I am not even sure if I will ever be able to be with him because we live on opposite sides of the country and when he talks to me, he doesn‚Äôt seem that interested since the last time I saw him in person during thanksgiving time. I feel like I‚Äôm never going to be important to anyone and I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm begging for attention. I feel like nobody. My best friend from college who recently stopped talking to me even said that nobody is ever going to love me because I‚Äôm easy. I have never let anyone‚Äôs hurtful comments get to me until this. My moms comment too has made me feel extremely alone. I don‚Äôt know why people decide to stop talking to me, I tend to put my problems upon people and ask them for help but that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt know who else to go to. I‚Äôve been going to therapy and I haven‚Äôt told her any of this yet because things haven‚Äôt gotten bad up until now. I feel like a complete waste of space and I‚Äôm not going to do anything to myself besides cry about it so don‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt self harm and I stopped smoking weed as often. I need advice on how to keep going even if I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart.

928,lonelykate21,1577053657,1,"I'm posting this out of the curiosity that anyone else has felt the same severe loneliness that I have been feeling after several months of traveling. 

To give you some background, I am a 21 year old girl that has been travelling for work pretty much non-stop for the past two years. I stay in one spot for about two weeks and I travel between the US and Canada. Although, I do interact with a lot of people during my stays, I am constantly reminded that every interaction I have with the wonderful people of Earth, maybe my last and that I will most likely never see them again after I leave the city. 

I have no friends in my home town accept for one, who is overwhelmed with school and work and for the maybe 2 weeks that I am in my hometown, we never make it to see each other. 

I start to wonder to myself a lot if there is something wrong with me, if I am that clingy, forced friendly interaction type person that I loathed growing up. But then I think to myself how many dear friends I have made traveling I am just no longer around to continue the relationship. 

But then I begin to doubt any friendship, is it only because two people are forced together in a certain environment and have to interact? You have to find something you like about the people around you otherwise, existence would be miserable? Does anyone truly enjoy another's company or is it just a primitive survival tactic?

Honestly, at this point. No matter what it is. I am severely lonely. Craving real life interactions, with people I enjoy, frankly, just straight vibing. If anyone else has experienced this, please let me know.",lonely,travelling can be so lonely,2019-12-23 09:27:37

Reality is based about having a career making sure your part of society  (useful to society). And perhaps maybe just maybe some person thinks your special but occasionally your just one parasite from society just like the others there are no snowflakes .

Just that it's frustrating , depressing and a bunch of other words that would create quite a list .

934,emotionalrec,1577043641,1,"My parents have been punishing me for about a month now. I'm not allowed to go outside at all, my phone is taken cutting me from all outside interactions with my friends (I never connected my iCloud to my Mac which I'm using right now) so I'm left to just sit in this empty house alone while they go out everyday doing I don't know what. It's all because of my grades and the fact that I was smoking weed. I understand that is more than enough reason to punish a child but this has been going on for a month. What hurts more is that I had so many things planned for my two week break which started two days ago. I thought they would have some sympathy since it's Christmas time but no. 

The day break started my mother drove me home from school and I had asked if my friend could come over the house (they previously had let her before) and my mom coldly replied no and started cursing at me. I started to cry, not because she said no but because I had just seen a class full of kids excited for their holiday break, to hang out with their friends, go iceskating, open gifts. But for me that no indicated that this long ass break will be just like how Thanksgiving break was. Alone. 

Thanksgiving break was the most terrible point in time for me. I had fallen into such a deep depression. I don't think its okay for anyone to be stuck in a house for days on end with no human interaction. I slept my days away not doing anything because there was nothing to do. I felt like I was in prison. 

Every time I try to explain to my parents why I smoke weed they tell me it's a excuse. I have struggled with depression and anxiety ever since middle school. I have told my parents this ever since middle school. However I live in a ethnic household, and especially hispanic people don't believe in mental illness. They think my generation is just crazy. But the crazy part is mental illness runs in my family. My uncle is in a mental hospital in Florida due to schizophrenia, and most of my family are ex crack-addicts due to mental illness.  The only time Ive ever seen my parents look the tiniest bit empathetic for me was years ago when I used to cut myself and my mother found a bloody razor. But that was years ago. Now when I cry they look at me with disgust. When I tell them I want to die they turn and walk away. It feels as though they will only believe these feelings of mine are true when I kill myself.

Anyway back to the first day of break, I was crying. I went to my room and tried to sleep.  I sleep whenever I feel sad so I don't have to think because when I think I start to cry endlessly without being able to stop. My dad busted my door open and told me to take my contacts off. He obviously knew I was going through something at the moment and now was not the time to argue, or so I thought. I had a really bad day overall but I said okay, expecting him to leave. However he stayed at my door staring at me. So I asked what? He told me you don't take them off when you want you take them off now. I don't understand them. Why does it matter when I take them off?  I feel as though they have a superiority complex, if anything I do isn't done exactly when they say so, exactly on their timing, even something as pointless and stupid as this, that doesn't affect them in anyway, they will flip out. And that's exactly what happened. Anyways, I told him I will take them off and he closed the door and left. I went back to closing my eyes and trying to calm myself. I had a blanket over my head so when my dad had snuck into my room again and grabbed me I didn't realize what was happening. Mind you, I'm a petite 5 foot highschool female, and my father is a 5'11 muscular man who goes to the gym. He grabbed me out of my bed, slammed me onto the floor and pulled me by my hair. He choked me and hit me. I have a long red scratch from my jaw to my neck which I have no idea how I am going to hide it from the rest of my family on Christmas. 

My mom is  familiar with my dad's outbursts. When I was younger and he used to relapse a lot more (he's a ex addict even though he probably hasn't been clean for over 2 months max). He used to do that to her instead of me. My mom came rushing in telling him to stop. He kept yelling and screaming like a animal for her to get the fuck out over and over and that he was gonna hit me making fists. He told her that it was her fault I was scared of him. After about 10 minutes of this  he left. My mom then came in my room screaming at me. Telling me it's all my fault, that I must love this stuff. I was crying asking her does she really think I deserve this? I couldn't breathe, I was so scared. I couldn't get anything out. I just kept begging for her to get me out of the house I was begging, telling her I was scared, saying please please just let me live somewhere else. They had let my brother live with my aunt for a while when he was younger so I thought they could do the same for me. While I was sobbing and begging she was just telling me to shut the fuck up and that it's not okay when he does it to her but it's okay for me. She said I'm just spoiled and parents beat their kids. This isn't the first time this has happened with my Dad. What hurt the most was her shutting the door on me when I said ""Im scared Mom please"". Leaving me alone. 

My mom hits me a lot and I put up with it because it's my mom and she's a woman. I understand for ethnic households that's normal. But for a Father to touch their daughter like that? I have bruises and scars, I don't feel like this is okay. When I told her that he choked me and showed her my neck she said he'd only scratched me and brushed it off.

I feel so scared and alone in this house, I have no way out and no way to contact anyone I know. I'm forced to sit alone in this house.

I have no say in anything that goes on in my life, I can't even decide when I want to take off my contacts! They believe every decision I have should be made by them, but then complain about me being irresponsible. How am I supposed to know how to be independent when I never had the chance to? I used to have a job, and go everyday on time and just do my work. But my mother made me give all my paychecks to her, I've never even touch a cent of the money I've ever made in my life. She made me quit my job as a part of my punishment. 

Im young, still in highschool so it's expected that sometimes I may act irrationally because I' a teenager right? Any normal parent would have a understanding of teenage angst and hormones right? Well not my parents. My whole life since I was young I'd have to make sure that I control how I express my emotions because my parents can't handle that, they will lash out instead of being adults and being the bigger person. I have never ever been able to just be a kid and have those moments of irrational outbursts, because I am too busy being the bigger person for them when they threaten me constantly for every little thing I do. I had to mature quickly and just tell them to calm down when their anger issues flare up. Shouldn't it be opposite, shouldn't they be the ones trying to calm me? It doesn't feel right.

942,wiigov,1577035662,1,"I am 23 years old, and spending my first ever Christmas all alone. I'm feeling really bad about it, which is why I decided to vent here.

So my father passed away three years ago, and before that we used to have these big family holidays that he loved to host every year. After his passing my siblings started to spend Christmas with their own families and it has been just me and my mom for the past few years.

Earlier this year my mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer and this Christmas is probably going to be the last one for her. So we were supposed to spend it together with all my family: me, mom, my siblings and their kids and my sister's spouse.

First we were going to spend it in my home town at my mom's place, but that had to be cancelled due to some private reasons. Then we planned my family would just travel to where I live and I'd host the Christmas this year. I was super excited about it, planning it already, when my siblings informed me last week that they could not come all the way here after all. 

So it would've been just me and mom. But I got sick! Of course. And since my mom has been getting chemo for the past six months, she cannot be around sick people due to high infection risk. So she cancelled as well, obviously.

It all happened on such a short notice that my partner couldn't cancel his plans with his family, and he left the city today as well. 

So here I am, alone in an empty flat, with too much food stuffed in the fridge, too much effort put into decorations, and just feeling like it all went horribly wrong. I feel so sad seeing and hearing about my friends with their big family gatherings and all the joy they have. 

Also, I am not very close with my family and we don't see often, so I was really looking forward to catch on and spend some time together. 

So yeah. Just needed to get it out of the system. I'm sure I'll be fine on my own - just gotta stay out of social media the entire time! 

(And if anyone else's in any similar situation, I'm so sorry for you, I hope you can still enjoy it even a little bit.) üéÑ",lonely,First ever Christmas alone,2019-12-23 04:27:42
943,KaiiHan-Kun37946,1577033439,1,"Hi, this sounds super shallow and stupid. I'm bored and extremely lonely. I'm a younger college student and I found out that my friends always have something to criticise me about (""you go out alone, whenever you go out you should always ask people out. "" I think it's ok to go out myself every once in a while, or, ""why are you trying to cut your hair like that, don't!"" ""Eww, you like *band*?"" ""You're so stupid for feeling *some emotion* stop being a wussie and get over it."" ""I don't get how you and your highschool friends are soo spoiled""). So I decided to distance myself away from them and now my only friend is a younger lecturer who always accepts me unconditionally and as a result, motivates me to try harder in her classes. But now since I try not to get too involved with that group of friends, I find myself always just hanging out with whoever just once, and bouncing to a different group of friends and now I technically have just piled up a bunch of acquaintances but never exactly a friend. So my dumbass decides to hit it online to go talk to some people.

I was hoping I can strike a few conversations or maybe even an awesome friendship here.

So let me talk about myself a bit, I'm Vii and I love drawing! I'm single and bored. I have a broken home and I never really talk to my dad and my mom wants a lot from me and my dad too, he just expresses it through my mom. I don't only love drawing but also love to just laze around and watch YouTube and just have a good laugh in my dorm! Alone so far though.... I also love turtles and bunnies! In fact, I want to get 2 bunnies once I'm back from spring break! I actually think I'm a pathetic piece of shit because I was an asshole growing up and I would get so easily offended so now I always think that people are secretly annoyed at me even though they always said they are not. I'm trying to be better though! 

And being a bit repetitive, I've been feeling a bit lonely recently and I have just been staying in my room if I'm not having class. So I just hope that I can find someone to just chill with and maybe have some virtual hugs every once in a while when needed! I only have an instagram and tumblr aside from reddit just incase we want to move to another sm platform. I don't really plan on having new social media accounts because I always end up ditching them. So if you are interested, feel free to chat me here, introduce yourself down below, anything! I know this will get burried anyways but I hope someone sees this. Well, I hooe to see you guys üíôü§ç",lonely,Heyyy anoyone bored? Hmu?,2019-12-23 03:50:39

967,Hardyscott,1576999247,1,"Boundaries. Boundaries are the biggest enemy of a human being. Boundaries where people trick your mind into limiting yourself to boundaries where people cross to humiliate you, make you feel in a certain way crossing the limits of a human being's humanity and morals disgracing the core values of humanity sending a person into a state of Anxiety and Depression. This has been the case with me and every person who goes through anxiety and Depression.

The human brain is not predictable so isn't it's thinking, but one thing can surely be said that most people can easily get into people's words and get discouraged easily, after all words cut sharper than knives inside the brain if taken to seriously and again that's something that happened with me too. A human forgets his/her true self and dwells into the discouraging thoughts these cruel people give rise to inside the brain through their hurtful, disgraceful and awful actions and the words they say to hurt people and they succeed when a person gives up and goes into his/her dark corners pulling himself away from the reality lost somewhere in the lost ruins of his/her mind. 

The thing here is, we tend to give up more easily and more often when easily persuaded and discouraged by people who like hurting people and make for their very own entertainment and jealousy of not wanting to see you excel in your life.

This inturn lowers a person's self confidence and in turn gives birth to to a state or depression and what arises in his/her brain through the change in their confidence and courage thereafter is known as ""ANXIETY"" which which comes in the way of everything, could come in many ways either through breakdowns, sudden heart beat rising out of increased fear due to lack of confidence when infront of a huge crowd or among people or sudden shivering, body turning cold and trembling and lowers his/her strength. 

This happened with me again.

In the end there's one thing a person should think and pull themselves back before it's too late. That what these people says and what the world wants you to be can't decide your way of living life or finding happiness and can't change your thinking, strengths and can't affect your aims because in the end you are like phoenix rising from your very own ashes everytime they try to burn you down because it's never too late even when you are cornered, all alone or even if it's you vs the world where you are all alone so be it and do whatever it takes and stand back on your feet rising up above and fighting it all for the world to witness your rise while these people remain where they are and realize in the end that hadn't they wasted their time into disgracing and pulling you down they'd have been somewhere better where you are and their shame, jealousy and regrets will be their end while you succeed.

Just chime in with your strengths and be that courageous master of your own life as you stand by giving your haters no attention what they want and those people coming in your way a gaze that will lower their confidence not yours because you don't deserve the anxiety and depression they want you to have . Nobody does. Find that one little thing that pulls you back in with more confidence and bounce back into this life that is precious and long enough to learn from and to grew into a stronger and better person.

I just did that. I found that one thing in my brain that arose in this darkest time, that one thing that I had that was going to revive me and that was my humor that was birthed in my brain during this darkest time when i had to find it and it made me feel happy and I felt as long as it makes me happy it's great and I don't care bout the rest when they come to pull me down they'll get a greater share of my actions. That's when I realized all of this what i talked to you about right now about depression and anxiety and stopped caring about what they said or did and if they ever came in my way I always give them that evil smirk and that gaze that lowers their confidence and an unending humorous take on them that makes lose their confidence and give up, declare me to be a mad person, mentally unstable or something else but deep down they now know that they cannot defeat me and that's where I have succeeded in driving them away from my life even when they get in my way through my strength, courage, unending faith in myself and this new found self.

You just gotta be strong. In the end you will succeed. All the very best for your life! And I'm always here to talk if you want to! :)

983,notsohappy96,1576984493,1,"I am currently 23 years old and I have no one. That of course is a slight exaggeration, I have an 'on again, off again' bestfriend. Right now, things are rocky and I'm very hesitate to open back up to her. It's heart wrenching every time.. She has always been my happy place/my safe place, and the only one I feel truly understood by (most of the time). SOO with that being said, I'm sure you can imagine how lost and defeated I feel when an ordeal goes down. I just feel extra alone, knowing that she has a bunch of love and support on her side, and I'm left crying in the mirror, alone. I truly don't understand why our relationship is so fragile, we've been through a lot together growing up... and I genuinely care for her well-being.  A part of me believes she is so quick to cut me off because she doesn't need me. She has her boyfriend and 7 other bestfriends. I'm easily replaced. Which is one SHITTY feeling. Especially when she is a key component as to why I didn't kill myself for so long. I realized that we had a co-dependant relationship while we were kids but that all changed when we got in a fight over a lie that was told and went our separate ways. In that time, I starting dated a older guy, got a place with him. And learned that he was abusive in everyway. A year of that bullshit almost killed me, weakened, stressed, and wanting to die. I reached back out to my 'bestfriend' and we reunited, and it was blissful. I was so happy and hopeful. Eventually, I got rid of my ex. Got back in therapy and started meds again, signed up to see a psychiatrists. During this time my friend gets into a relationship and I become non-existent. I have terrible crippling anxiety so I could only hang out with her one-on-one. SO obvisously she stopped inviting me to social gatherings long ago. But that's ok because I never feel welcomed anyway. Despite all that I still cherished the time I got with her. Helped her move into her boyfriends, loved her, supported her, even putting her needs before mine at times. In this time I still feel that she is m other-half, but things aren't the same. It became easier for her to roll me off other her shoulders in a disagreement. She was there for me emotionally anymore. One night some guy was messaging me trying hit on me and randomly brings up the fact that my ex cheated on me all the time. This brought back terrible memories, and I began to fee really depressed and sick to my stomach. I text my 'bestfriend' in hopes to get a little love, because I knew that would make me feel better. Even though we were already texting each other, when I brought up feeling like shit because of my ex Jacob, she completely ghosted for the rest of the evening. I was calm with it, and even expected it because I knew she was with her boyfriend. The next morning, I was expecting a response from her, because all she does is play on her phone and laptop at work, but nothing. She had nothing to say until I brought it up again. She then gave me a short unmeaningful paragraph, basically saying she said all that she could say to me about the matter, and if I can't work it out on my own, I should talk to my therapist about it. That of course angered me further and more questionable things were said on her end. She never wants to be around me when I'm feeling low because 'it brings her down' but vise versa, i'm there for her to listen, to cheer her up, to be there. I've always been the more passive person in our relationship because she is so easily rattled and vicious. Most things would go her way because I'm more laid back and don't really care as along as we're together but also there were things I didn't want to do but did it anyway. Like the last time we saw each other, I'm not a big drinker because I act a fool and feel the effects for days after. But that night she just randomly sprung that she wanted to get drunk that night, so we did. I took a cab home and everything was fine... until the next morning. I realized that I forgot my purse and I was urgent to get it back as it had my health card and house key. My family made me feel like shit about the key and demanded I got it back that day. Anxious, hungover little me went overboard with trying to contact and get a response out of my friend, but I was getting nothing which made me more anxious because now I'm thinking, 'what in the fuck did I do last night?'. 7+ hours later she said she had just got her phone and she was in the hospital. Right away, I apologized and made sure she wasn't alone. The texting stopped soon after that. The next day comes around and I'm just receiving snaps of her being extra. I checked up on her and so on. Now it's thanks giving day and since her boyfriends parents live up by me, she was able to drop off some of my things. CoolCool. She asked me for money because I guess I broke her boyfriends bowl to a bong. So I sent the money that it cost to replace it and right then I realized she wasn't happy with me. Soo I'm like whatever... nothing serious happened. But the day after I get this long text about how I didn't say sorry for anything and I made her feel like shit when she was in the hospital, and that she basically needed time from me, but she's not mad at me or anything. I questioned her and she very rudely said 'I said I need time, why are you still talking to me'. So that was that but as it began to get colder out, I messaged her about getting my favorite scarf back in a kind way (even thought I was heated inside). She's Like 'ya I have it, but I don't think I can drop it off today because I'm busy'. Busy. A phrase I would hear from her a lot when she didn't want to do something. I let it slide and I waited through the weekend and days after. I message her again, asking if she could drop it of today after work. and she went on about how tired she is. Sick of waiting around for her I decided to pick it up myself. We traded scarfs the year before but I didn't bring hers when I went to pick mine, as a last minute petty decision. I felt because she kept me waiting, made me ask more than once and put me through hoops of getting that same scarf back months prior. I'd make her come to my place to pick it up. I gave her a dose of her own medication and she did not like that. She continued to scream that I was a bitch and to never speak to her again. I didn't turn back, just kept going. 4 hours later I get a text from her saying that 'I can keep her scarf as symbol of our friendship (or something) because I clearly didn't want to be friends anymore'. I ignored the shit out of that dramatic ass text for days. But it was on the top of my mind everyday so I finally answered. Basically saying that this is not what I wanted but I cant convince her to see how much I care and that I can't change her way of thinking, so I wasn't going to chase her and that I was ready to let people in my life that value me. She sends me another paragraph, first stating she didn't read a word I said and went on discrediting me and saying that I've been a bad friend a lot throughout our friendship, saying she doesn't want to be surrounded by shitty people anymore and ending with 'I no longer want to continue this friendship'. I responded I'm not a shitty person but that was a shitty response. Blocked her number and died inside. She obviously went back and read what I sent to her after that because she's been trying to reach out to me since. BuT I couldn't let her back in right away. Everything was so uncalled her. We're starting to message again but I don't know if I want to let her back in. I feel like things can't be the same. Not if she can say I've been a bad friend to her... wheres the trust? whats the truth? This all makes me really sad and I just don't know if it would be worth it to hang out with her again. She's a good person but I know I'm going to get hurt. But I'm so alone without her. I don't know what to do..",lonely,I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

991,comm0dities,1576979307,1,"For starters I have dealt with social anxiety and self isolation for a really long time. Im a 26 year old female and for the longest time I would always think that people did not like me, that I was not good enough to sustain long term friendships, that I‚Äôm forgetful and not cool enough, I don‚Äôt try hard enough to make friends, etc.. I‚Äôve always internalized everything. 

I‚Äôve started going to therapy, I‚Äôve started trying to ‚Äúput myself out there more‚Äù, Ive been practicing positive self talk, and I‚Äôve been trying reeeeally hard not to internalize things that have nothing to do with me. Another big thing is genuinely asking myself if what I‚Äôm thinking about myself is true, or if the issue is not me. If I‚Äôm being honest with myself about what the issue actually is, I should be able to find some clarity. This has been life changing and I had an epiphany just now.

Ive come to realize that the issue is a lot of these people I‚Äôve come to call my friends are actually just really inconsiderate and genuinely do not seem to give a damn about me. We‚Äôre just not compatible. I need to stop being so desperate to be friends with these people and branch out and make new friends on my own. 

Today I told myself *ok instead of sitting in my apartment alone, I should grow a pair and reach out to one of my friends to hang out.* I reached out to a girl I will call A. I asked if she wanted to meet up and go get drinks. She genuinely sounded like she was interested.  She told me she‚Äôd love to and to text her when I was done getting ready so that we could meet up. She even named a few places she thought would be good to go to and I thought great, the balls rolling.

I took a shower and got dressed, did my hair and makeup(which takes a bit of time), and then I texted her. I said *hey, I‚Äôm going to be heading out in a few minutes. Which bar did you want to meet at?*

Half an hour goes by and I get no answer. 

As someone with social anxiety it doesn‚Äôt take much for the negative self talk to start. I started thinking to myself *wow I suck as a human being. She hates me. Everyone hates me, I have no friends.* 

I started the process of talking myself down and out of this mindset since it‚Äôs obviously not healthy. *Maybe she‚Äôs in the shower, maybe she‚Äôs driving, maybe she‚Äôs at a bar and it‚Äôs loud so she didn‚Äôt hear her phone....*


I kid you not, two hours later she texted me like *hey! I‚Äôm on a date at ______! Rain check?*

I was so confused. Why would this chick tell me she‚Äôs down to meet up and then ghost me for two hours only to respond telling me basically she can‚Äôt meet up because she‚Äôs on a date? If she knew she had a date why agree? If she didn‚Äôt want to hang out, why agree? 

This is the type of shit that people do these days that seems to be common practice. People have no manners anymore. Mind you this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve experienced something like this with a so called friend. When other people hit me up to hang out, I‚Äôm there. However when I    reach out to other people it‚Äôs like suddenly they cannot be bothered. Case in point - I remember when I was 24 I made sure to show up to all of my friends birthday parties. When my birthday rolled around only 2 people came. 

I really just need to make new friends. I‚Äôm too old for this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

  
I feel like pure utter shit right now. I have like 4 friends, they are the only friends I have and recently I've thought about it, and I can't think about how they give a single shit about me. Its always been like this but I've never really noticed it.

  
They all go out separately without me all the time, they never ask me to hang out directly and only ever ask everyone together in a group chat. The main one though is that they never go out of their way for me one bit, I do it all the time for them when someone needs someone to spot some cash, ill do it, someone doesn't want to be squashed in the back of the car, ill do it, yet I never get the same kindness in return.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Up until today, I thought maybe it was just my overthinking, and maybe when they hang without me its because I live a little further away so they don't bother but that's so fucking stupid. Do I matter that little that a 20 or 30-minute drive is too much, 2 of my friends drive and they drop everyone but me because I like a little further away, is that normal? because I know for sure that even if they lived an hour away I would drop them off home no matter what. Today was the day I've had enough, I went out with them and they did something that made me know that they don't care about me (would rather not talk about it) and then in the pouring rain I take the bus home when they both have cars, they ask me if I want a lift but id had enough and just went home, they didn't even realise what they had done so I just stayed silent till I could leave. There's no way this is my anxiety or overthinking anymore its right in front of my eyes now.

&amp;#x200B;

  
I know its wrong and would make me selfish to say all of this but I feel so fucking betrayed, the amount of stuff I do for these people I thought were my friends, the amount I care for them, these people are supposed to be my best friends, I fucking helped one of them get through their depression, gave him constant advice, cared so much about him and told him all the time, no one even fucking asks me if im okay, anytime any of them needs something from me I do it because I care about them but they never do anything for me.

  
I don't know why I choose to be their friends, I have no one else and if I wasn't their friends I would legitimately have 0 people in my life other than my parents but im starting to think that's better. I haven't said anything and IDK if I ever will but I feel so done.

No matter how depressed and lonely I've ever felt I've never been able to cry no matter how much I wanted to but today I got home and just couldn't stop the tears coming out of my eyes.

I just wish I had somebody that loved me and vice versa to spend time with during the ""happiest time of the year"". I just want to feel needed. I've never felt needed, and it makes me feel so useless. I feel like I could die any second of any day and jack shit would change. I just want to have a Christmas where I'm happy. Maybe I have a girlfriend that I spend it with, I invite my best friend as well as a few other close friends over to spend the day with, we all exchange presents and eat a nice big meal, then as the day concludes I'd watch Christmas specials with a girl that loves me for who I am and vice versa. That would be the most perfect Christmas ever. But I doubt I'll ever have one like that. I doubt I'll ever truly be happy. When you're as miserable as myself (and as miserable as we are) you sort of look past the magic of Christmas and see it for what it is; a capitalist consumer-driven corruption of an ancient pagan fertility holiday that's run by suit-dummies in coperate America.

Hey, I‚Äôve (F19)just joined the lonelyfam! I have dealt with loneliness for quite some time, but no one seems to have the same problem as me. You see,  I had two close friends growing up, from 6-16 years, but we never talked about deep or private stuff, like boys, periods or feelings. Looking back at it now, it was kind of a toxic relationship bc they were closer (they were twins so) and way more smarter, so I used to be the dumb one. 

After I started high school, I got some new friends, who were really fun to hang out with. We were in the same class, so we had a lot in commoner that time. We drank together in our free time, etc etc. But I never became really close to any of the girls (there were 5 girls and 4 guys in our gang). But they sure got close with each other. They were in the same friend circle and such, so they would always hang or party together. So basically, my old friends got new friends and my new friends had old friends they could hang with. I wouldn‚Äôt complain at the time, since we were all partying together, hanging out at school, which was enough for me since I am an introvert who‚Äôs social battery runs out quickly. 
Now, I‚Äôm in college with new friends who‚Äôs got their old friends/ closer with each other, old friends which never invite me to anything unless it‚Äôs ‚Äúreunion‚Äù with the whole group, and me who‚Äôs all alone on a Saturday night feeling bitter about it. 

On one hand I understand that my high school friends don‚Äôt invite me bc I am really not on their wavelength, they are more exited and enthusiastic, while I am not. Plus, being an introvert with a little social anxiety doesn‚Äôt help either.

This was really just a rant, but if anyone has any motivational speech or tips, I would be grateful.",lonely,To have so many ¬´friends¬ª and still be lonely. Wtd?,2019-12-22 09:52:22

1012,Gondal90,1576964691,1,"For me I define a genuine relationship as someone who truly wants you and wants to be with you. Someone who genuinely cares about what happens to you and genuinely enjoys being with you. Someone that you are important to and thinks about you.

Sadly I have no one that fits this definition in my life. People usually come and go. Someone may seem a little interested in me at first but after a while they leave. Sometimes for a reason and sometimes without even an explanation. I genuinely do feel like there is something about me that causes this but I‚Äôm not sure what exactly. 

About 2 years ago I was in much worse shape than I am now. I was very determined to change my life so I started working hard. 

- I used to be obese 2 years ago. Now I‚Äôm happy to say I bought my weight down to a normal BMI and am no longer overweight

- I have been in Therapy for over 2 years now. I have consistently worked on my Mental Health. I used to be very mentally unhealthy 2 years ago. Now I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm in very good Mental shape thanks to therapy and have learned good coping skills.

- I forced myself to step out of my comfort zone and start to talk to people in the real world. I‚Äôm happy to say now I am much more confident being around large groups of people. I used to be severely socially anxious. Now I can talk in front of large groups of people with relative ease and little anxiety. Another accomplishment for me.

 Clearly I‚Äôve been working hard and made an effort to change. I‚Äôve been successful in many ways and have made lots of progress. I‚Äôve come a long way from how I used to be and that‚Äôs good.

1047,David-Blowie,1576930661,1,"There‚Äôs a special kind of loneliness where on paper you‚Äôre social, but emotionally you are completely isolated. 

You go to parties, you‚Äôve had a fair share of hookups and fuckbuddies, you‚Äôre invited to things, you‚Äôre in circles but you have some close knit friends too who you love endlessly.

But the moment you go deeper or think about it for more than 5 seconds you realise it‚Äôs all confetti, under all that shiny stuff it‚Äôs dark because no matter how happy or safe you feel, there is always a guard or shield up in your head, and you‚Äôre playing a persona 

That guard never comes down because your asshole-monkey-brain has the bright idea that vulnerability = threat or danger.  A shitty childhood coping mechanism from a history of abuse and hurt.

In every relationship I‚Äôve had in my life there is always a degree of disconnection, some more and some less. That separation is meant to be there to help me because yadda yadda vulnerability = bad but it stops me from actual, genuine human connection. Or love. Or validation. Or just about any essential for a healthy emotional state.

I can articulate my feelings and problems properly, talked to enough shrinks that it‚Äôs become a script at this point, but I never let myself *feel* what I‚Äôm feeling because it‚Äôs like a built up dam at this point, if I let it go for one second it‚Äôll just explode.

I thought I have found aloneness, but it was a lie. 

How many times I saw someone asking for help, asking for partnership, even to be friends with... But people usually ""ohh, don't give up, there is always someone for you"" ""keep going, keep going, someone will come along"" 

Someone.. But not me, I don't have time for you.. This is everyone's answer. 

In this group no female was bothered about guy, if he's virgin and alone, he is a loser and I don't want to be with loser. His life? I don't care. Mine is more important... Best I can is to give encouragement and advice...

:( all the pain I felt for working out, for people telling me I'm not good enough and from rejection from the one I fall in love with. 

I understand, nature is forcing us to match with someone better, for survival. 

You either have looks from the start or not. 

You either are lucky and you have happiness, or you are unlucky and have misery.

You don't choose this body, you don't choose your parents, you don't choose your deseases... You have no free will.

Within next 24 hour my life will be over. It is my own choose. I've tried everything, but failed.

Be compassionate towards each other, if you really want to help someone, let go of your stupid pride.
Don't think 24/7 for yourselves... Go out and help people.

OK if there's anyone out there I apologize because this is not going to be a fun read. I have a problem. He is laying 2 feet to my left. 

Began as a hot and heavy romance, 6 months into our relationship I see a change. Or actually I realize he is an alcoholic. Although his substance abuse does not stop there. And for some reason he's not the happy drunk I've been shooting Crown with. This is when he got dark... This is where I start becoming abused in a sense. No black eyes just more like pushing my head back forcefully, throwing elbows at my ribs, slamming the car door on me, straddling and choking me 2 months after having a C-section. Yeah, I have a beautiful  old daughter with him.. talk about good choices. While I do not regret her, he has had a strong hand in fucking me up, and I regret him. I fucked up. And I keep fucking up because I've been with him for 3 years this December.

Last December, I was 8 months pregnant. Hospitalized. With a herpes outbreak... he spoils me, what can I say?  In that moment I felt like he fucking ruined me. I was being told by my specialist and the infectious disease doctor the baby could have brain damage had the infection gotten to her. I had decided I was just going to kill myself post birth, had that been the case. But here I am... She was born perfect with no health issues a month later. 

He pays attention to me when he's horny, otherwise, no real connection. It's fake every time. I keep falling for it. During intercourse, I can't confirm 

She is the only person I have. She's my best friend. She's 10 months old watching me sob uncontrollably. Seeing him call me a stupid c*nt. And like a kicked puppy, what do I do? ""Please, please let me hug you. I love you dont treat me like this"" he shoves me away ""get the fuck off of me, you are childish."" 

Why the fuck am I like this? It's humiliating to know someone will read this. 

I am NOT the type of girl this happens to. I consider myself to be intelligent, especially considering my hometown (moved away 5yr ago) the methiest podunk town Florida has to offer.  I consider myself pretty. I have always been genuinely liked by coworkers, I am kind and nurturing so why am I tolerating this? He is only verbally abusive when he is drunk and only physically abusive, (I don't count the shoving anymore), twice since the straddle and choke deal about 8 months ago.

I just need someone to be gentle with me. I just need someone to fucking care about me. I hurt in a  way I can not even describe and I need something foreign to me.

I turned 26 last week. Didn't get really any messages. Just a text from my father reminding me I am off his insurance now and to look into it, along with a few facebook posts from people who don't talk to me any other day in the year. Recently my boyfriend, the only person who I think cares whether I'm breathing still or not, moved to be with sick family in Colombia. So now I'm alone. I had a mental break and didn't work for 1.5 months. I'm a flight attendant. The thought of helping people, being happy when I am not, stuck on a loud plane with no escape, and dealing with difficult passengers taking their travel stress out on me caused a wild panic attack every time I went to call back in. I got my doctor to sign off on the call out so I wouldn't get in trouble and I'll return to work in the new year. However.. All this time laying in bed, usually in the dark, getting heavier, and watching what little I had in savings drain away.. It's been hard. And now I don't have my boyfriend to talk to on my ""dark days"" because he's busy in another country and so here I am. lonely.

I just needed someone. A (kinda lame) reddit search of ""I am so lonely"" brought me here. I was hoping one of you could tell me it's normal to be this old and this alone?

My team and I got an A and had a fun time doing it, but the whole time my brain was more or less forced to acknowledge the presence of someone I‚Äôve been trying to get over for a while now. The story with her is long and complicated, but the short version is just that I love her and have invested so much into her and she said she loves me back but can‚Äôt be in a relationship due to past experiences and mental afflictions. I haven‚Äôt been speaking to or trying to look at her for almost 3 weeks, and today it was really rough. I almost cried off the makeup my team put on me. 

I walked home by myself once school got out and played Counter Strike for what I can only guess was around 3-4 hours. I was doing terribly today, worse than normal. Eventually I lost the motivation to speak and spoke very rarely in my last couple of matches, only using my mic to apologize when I lost a clutch and disappointed my teammates.

Now listen, I wanna tell you that first of all, it don't matter how old you are. You're still young. got plenty of life left in ya. I don't care that you're 40 or 50 going on 41 or 51, or 18, or whatever. That's a lot of life left.

And you can bet your arse that big brother here's been through some pretty bad times.

you know what? I'll even divulge to you that I've been a pretty lonesome guy most of my life.

Now, i won't go prattling on about how ""it gets better"" or anything. Things will only get better once they start changing, and that can be so random, it's unreliable to stress on a singular point.

See, big bro here is smart. First thing he learnt is how to be comfortable being alone and lonely. two really different things, but once you've got the hang of waking up and smiling for no particular reason than being alive, and looking forward to your independent day, then you're well on your way.

yeah-i know, i do have some hobbies now, and i sure do treasure my family, and it really helps, but whenever Im alone, I can look in the mirror and smile, knowing that I am all I need, will ever need in any given situation, and that me and my thoughts will think towards tomorrow.

I made lots of posts here and sometimes I get messages asking about my current status so I'm making this last post in hopes if people see my other posts they'll also see this one and won't have to question me.

I'm not looking for any type of relationship anymore. No romance, no friendships, no nothing. It's just not healthy for me anymore. I've been looking for friends regularly for over a decade and the results always start or end bad regardless of how good I try to be. I kept trying longer than I should have and it caused more harm than good. 

I decided the best thing I can do for myself is live in solitude to salvage and restore my mental. I'm not bitter or upset but I no longer have the desire to know anyone or to be known. I just want to make money, buy what I want, go where I want &amp; do what I want. I've had enough with the constant disappointment, heartbreak and abandonment. It's just not worth it at this point. Normally I take whatever time needed for some sense of recovery or vent here because I have no one and occasionally have people discredit my problems because I'm a woman (**nice guys by the way**) I thought since being lonely was a broad issue &amp; all genders were welcome but that doesn't appear to be the case so maybe a separate sub is needed.

I don't know who or what gave me the idea that things will get better when I recovered from depression but I can't continue with life wondering whose last choice I'm going to be. Don't tell me to keep trying because it's not rational. Everytime I gave up someone wanted me to give them a chance and I gave in and ended up making the wrong choice. I always end up wrong when I deviate from my decision and I refuse to make anymore mistakes. I know not everyone is the same but I can't trust me or anyone else anymore. I think it's absurd to think since there are 7 billion people in the world that there's someone for everyone.

I feel like my family is cursed. Doomed to be alone or to wonder into relationships one after another just to be abandoned or treated poorly. No one in my family has friends and the ones in romantic relationships are not satisfied but keep it going just so they won't be alone. I hope no one in my family will have children so when everyone dies the family line will be done and it'll finally be over. It's the only thing I know that can make things alright and prevent future suffering. I will never commit suicide or encourage others to do so but I recognize there really are some things only death can fix. I feel like I'm genetically designed to be tossed or ignored regardless of what I do. There is absolutely no value in being different. Whoever says so is a liar.

I tried to start off fresh but I can't do that with another person. I hope by the time technology advances to address this problem I'll still be alive.

Accepting I'm gonna someday leave this world as if I never existed was initially a tough pill to swallow but since then I feel a weird sense of relief as if I don't have to do anything about it now. I have found a sense of contentment (or complacency) in the world but I know I most likely won't find the type of happiness I truly wanted to achieve.

When I die I want to be cremated and if possible have the ashes destroyed as well. I feel like cleansing away everything will take away whatever made me undesirable and will hopefully lessen the chance someone else will have the same problem.

I don't know if reincarnation exists but if I am to be reborn I just want to have a normal life and relationships like the majority of society has instead of instead of being entangled in this web of absurdity I have to handle myself.

**If you read this and think ""I wanna talk to this person"" or ""I wanna try to be this person's friend."" I implore you not to.** I couldn't stop myself from wasting my time but I can at least try to prevent you from wasting yours.


While this might seem majorly depressing for anyone that's reading but this is only mildly saddening for me. A sniffle here, a sob there then I put on my big girl pants and get back in the game to deal with things as adults are expected to. =/ I'm not trying to be patronizing. As much as I would love to throw a pity party and have someone console me it's not gonna happen and I can't delude myself again into thinking it will happen someday. I apply these tough standards to myself only and it's the only way I can keep myself going as ""well"" as I can.

I wish there was somewhere besides my imagination to escape to. The internet was better in the early 2000's when not that many of people were on it. Back then escaping your problems with the internet was easy but now since the nature of society has changed and lots of people are on the net there is no where to escape to.

I think I made this too long so I might delete this and type it over so it's more coherent. Regardless, I hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and Christmas.",lonely,I'm not trying anymore.,2019-12-21 14:37:31

I‚Äôm not quite sure how to get this out and it‚Äôs quite the lengthy, irrelevant sap story but any means of release is healthy release - right?- so why not use this platform as a desperate attempt to vent and heal? 
* sighs in knowing regret * 

I‚Äôm 17 years old (but sometimes I feel so much more older than that) but this particular narrative is placed about a year ago. I was living in South Africa and went to this prominent All Girls Boarding School which was by far the most self-actualising and thrilling time of my life. I was surrounded by close friends and like-minded people whom I bonded with on a visceral, sisterly level. I have nothing but fond and goofy memories of those halls that somehow always smelt of burnt popcorn and noodles. You can only imagine that when sharing your living space with at least 50 other individuals while simultaneously going to school with them and having them involved in every other aspect of your life, your bond grows into a near unbreakable one. Similar to Van Der Waal forces, the more there are, the stronger the bonds. I can confidently say that I had many sisters and an entire support system behind me - a family. They pushed me to be the best I could be. I got the best grades, excelled in sports, had a healthy social life and still came back to giggles in my pjs with my friends. It was a fantasy life to say the least. My knowledge of the world and it‚Äôs pain was quite sheltered living in this Utopia. 

So one can only imagine the pure shock and utter despair I felt when I was told we‚Äôd be relocating to England. At first, it didn‚Äôt feel quite real - just words without substance, ya know - but as the months rolled by, it became more obvious that this wasn‚Äôt just loud barking but a harsh bite that would drag me to the other side of the equator. 
Instead of being sorrowful about it though, I decided to enjoy my last few months with my friends. Truth be told, we went crazy and overboard with trying to make memories but things can be so painful when you‚Äôre forcefully trying to be happy while well knowing that there‚Äôs an underlying lie behind the euphoria. Up until this point I had never had a boyfriend (and still to this day haven‚Äôt even had so much as a kiss) so I decided that having my first boyfriend before I leave would be something great to add to the bucket list. 
* sighs deeply * 

One evening, during a school event, I met this stupidly amazing young man from our brother school. I‚Äôll never forget that faithful night. I had just won 2nd place at a public speaking event and he had come up to congratulate me, and as fate would have it, I met my best friend that day, three months before my departure. Everything in me told me not to do what I knew I wanted to do but at the same time, everything in me screamed ‚Äúheck!‚Äù 

We had started ‚Äútalking‚Äù, just being friends. I know it was cruel to lead him on as i knew I‚Äôd be leaving soon but sometimes, one can‚Äôt help but succumb to these bugger little things called feelings. Long story extremely shortened, we ended up dating for a while and I say this  with a heavy heart and a head swimming with regret, I fell in love. Come November (t minus one month) I came clean and told him that we had to break up. I was reluctant to say why as I myself couldn‚Äôt come to terms with it but after many, many break downs I finally did. I remember him being utterly speechless and not reacting the way I would‚Äôve liked (I got super angry because he didn‚Äôt cry when I told him üòÇ) but he said that me moving wasn‚Äôt a reason to stop trying. You‚Äôve never seen the twinkle and hope in a desperate child‚Äôs eyes until you saw the look I gave him. 

To put some weight behind this, and as cheesy as it sounds, our relationship wasn‚Äôt a basic, modern, teenage romance that fleeted and was fuelled by hormones. I actually believe that he was the ying to my yang how alike we were. Our relationship was purely intellectual, we had never even done so much as kiss. All we did was talk late into the early hours of the morning about all the ways we were going to change the world. I honestly loved him. So when he said that he wanted to try a long distance relationship, I jumped at the opportunity because at that moment, I knew he felt the same way I did. 

To make a long story even shorter, I relocated and it was not the fairy tale Great British Adventure that I thought it would be. I was bullied profoundly (mainly for the basis that I was from ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù ) and had not a single friend. My old friends back in South Africa were the only roots that stabilised my sanity and he was my entire reason for waking up every morning and trying over and over again. I never told him about what was happening as I didn‚Äôt want him to worry or think less of me so he and everyone else assumed I was doing great but it was quite the contrary. My friends began to steadily drift away from me as they carried on with their lives but mine completely stopped, all I did was obsess over what once was.  That boy got me through so much pain and depression and I‚Äôll forever be grateful to him for that because I don‚Äôt know what I would‚Äôve done without him. 

Anyways, I began to hear rumours from friends that he had another girlfriend, someone shit tonnes prettier than me, and that many people had seen them kissing. That particular detail broke my heart as we hadn‚Äôt even shared our first kiss yet. Two days after Valentines Day, he broke up with me and moved on and I hear he‚Äôs happier for it now. 

I carried on with my tired, monotonous and difficult existence and thought about him everyday. As I went through all the pain of losing my home, my life, my friends and all I knew, I suffered my first ever break up alone. 
I‚Äôve never told anyone this and quite frankly, it feels good to let it out. I know no one will find the time to read all this utter gibberish but this has been therapeutic. 

I guess what can be deduced from this rambling is that I‚Äôm hurt. I fully put my love and trust in this boy during the most vulnerable time of my life and he just threw it away like it was noting and carried on like I meant nothing. Did I mean nothing? Why‚Äôs it that he doesn‚Äôt get to feel the same pain as me? Why‚Äôs it that a year later, I‚Äôm still crying over some stupid boy in a foreign country where I‚Äôm alone while he‚Äôs comfortably feeding off my friends who‚Äôve all drifted from me? I haven‚Äôt spoken to anyone in months. I feel so alone and broken... a single atom floating in this vast space, all my bonds broken.",lonely,Regret and all that fun stuff,2019-12-21 11:49:21

In primary/elementary school I had noticed that all of my classmates had made friends and I would always be left out. Fast forward to high school I find myself in the same position. This is extremely challenging as we are required to carry out group tasks. This results in the teacher placing me in a group with all of the trouble makers which results in me doing a lot of the work whilst they just sit back. I also don't understand why people feel awkward whilst talking to me as I am friendly and ok to talk to. 

The school thought that there might be something wrong with me and suggested that I could be autistic. However this wasn't true and the school has now left it as they are not interested anymore.

I will graduate from high school this year and worried about how I will manage in the real world.

Means a lot.

I am a male, 27 years old. 

I've been in a relationship since February and she broke up with me last week.

Since the beginning of this relationship I tried to to do anything I could to make her happy, sacrificed a lot and moved to her town.

She is a very introverted person and needs to be alone a lot, which I respected (I tried not to be at home after her coming home from work, to give her her time.)

She had bad experiences from her past relationship, cause of how much of an Introvert she is. 

The problem is we are still living together and I love her. And both of those things won't change anytime soon.

I gave her anything  a woman/ human beeing could want and to my sadness, even more.

She never truly appreciated what I did.
But I still loved her and did the best I could do.

On one morning she kisses before going to work and smiles, on the same day she says she doesn't love me anymore and totally blindsights me.

I feel like vomiting every day.

She turned extremely cold from one moment to the other. 

It's eating me alive, this incredible tense heartache and the feeling of beeing betrayed and left alone. 

Since the initial break up, I am trying to convince her that we can do it. Writing letters, speaking to her. 

I feel lost and alone in a town I moved a couple of months ago. Life doesn't seems worth anything. 

I feel like dying, on the inside.

She just lives her live as we live together.

And I am here, slowly rotting away.",lonely,Just..i don't know anymore,2019-12-21 07:22:39
1112,ViscidPlague78,1576873255,1,"Came to a striking realization that I will be lonely for the remainder of my time on this rock.  

I'm in a 19+ year marriage, known her for 22 years.  But the last couple have been awful for me.  She basically has relegated me to a life of working to support her and the kids(16/10) and that's my life.  Work to earn money to provide her with her convenient lifestyle so that she never has to really exert herself.  This is my fault for allowing this for so long.  

I'm not happy, I no longer love her.  But due to our situation where we live, etc, divorce and what it would cost me would be a near death sentence for me.  At least now I get to exist.  

But I saw a picture yesterday on FB of a woman I have known for a few years.  Her and I get on like...literally it's just near perfect how we get along.  But she's in her relationship, I'm in mine.  She lives about 200 miles away from me too.  I believe if we were both single something might come of it.  But the picture said it all...she's never, ever going to be available to me.  

As they say plenty of fish in the sea...but this is a unicorn.  She's a unicorn.  Who knows...might not work out even if....but the hop has been there for a while that maybe if I can get a couple ducks in a row, and escape without becoming homeless that something could develop....but this picture just crushed that loneliness home that I will never, ever be in a happy relationship.  Not one that I deserve.

I'm kinda sad and slightly depressed, because next year I'll be 18. I've never been in relationship or never been kissed by girl even through girls often say that I'm pretty good and charming guy. I can speak to girls but I can't talk to my crush or even say some nice romantic things because I'm shy.

So... With start of 2020 (new decade) I'll try to change a lot of things. I'm not a fool, I actually have my style of clothes and I think I'm pretty interesting and gentle person (my dream is to be a true classy fashioned gentleman). Also I'm gonna move from my mother's to my dad's house, so that will be start of my improvement. I'll try to meet new girls, be less shy and maybe even find a gf. I have a lot of plans for 2020.

I have always been a good guy at school, nice, charismatic, calm and so on
The classic ""friend of all"", approximately
Despite this, both in high school and now at university, every time I come home I feel alone and excluded from everyone 
As long as I follow the lessons, I'm in class and I'm in the university with the old classmates I know from high school, I keep laughing and joking, I'm in company and I'm fine

Then when I get home I realize I'm alone. Nobody chat with me, unless rare situations, or call me
And it makes me sick, it makes me feel lonely
Every time I start thinking that all of this is useless, at the end of everything I will be alone and that, the group of people that I know since high school, when it will be everything over, will go

On the other side, if I keep it to myself, it‚Äôs pretty damaging. Idk who to talk to so I think I‚Äôll just vent here.

The past few nights I‚Äôve been having a lot of body issues. A. Lot. I‚Äôve been weighing the pros and cons of starving myself. If I do, then I would get my ideal body. However I would negatively impact my health. But I have this obsession and need to be a thinner person than I am right now. I could die of starvation if I take it too far.

I‚Äôve also been bingeing a shit ton. I hate myself for it but I can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with an eating disorder. I don‚Äôt want to self diagnose like I‚Äôve seen others do before from one look on webmd. But I really wonder sometimes. Is my relationship with food just strange? Or is something wrong with me? 

I was also thinking about how I want to starve myself and how it‚Äôs maybe a form of self harm for me. It‚Äôs scary to think that I‚Äôm in a place like this where I feel the need to do this. But I. I feel really hopeless. Ya know.. I have never been one to harm myself until recently. I know I have so much to live for. Sometimes I feel really confident in myself. Sometimes I feel happy and that I‚Äôm just as beautiful. But other times I look in the mirror and see myself as a dysfunctional michelin man. 

I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital 2 months ago and it didn‚Äôt help at all. And I have this horrible fear of going back. But somehow in my fucked up mind, that fear turns into depression and guilt and then I have these self destructive thoughts. I‚Äôve told a friend and they calmed me down in the midst of a depressive episode but it keeps continuing. Nights after nights. I can‚Äôt go back to the hospital.

Oh no, you're going to binge eat so bad that you nearly throw up. Saturday comes, time to go expel all that nasty food by exercising til your feet hurt hiking 20 miles. Come home, time to abuse my body again with marijuana and binge eating, anything to distract from that loneliness. 

Sunday? No work or exercise, just get stoned and forget about being lonely once again. Fuck it's Monday again and I have to go to work, oh well, start the cycle again. 

I have a good life, good physical health which I'm slowly destroying, plenty of money, no debt, big house in the expensive city, no worries.

Is it too much to ask that one's best friend calls them back when they say they will? Or that they send a simple ""hey, I'm busy"" text when I call and they don't answer? So many times, we'll be on the phone and they'll cut it short, then act as if they're going to call me back later but never do 90% of the time. I feel like I have one ""actual"" friend and they don't even like me that much. Usually I'd blame myself (I'm definitely to blame for the loss of some past friendships) but they have often randomly told me what a good friend I am, and I certainly try, so I'm positive it's nothing I've done this time.

Is this more normal than I think? Do most best friends act like this? I feel legitimately embarrassed to contact them now because I feel stupid when they don't answer, which is most of the time.

1169,hamartiated,1576811394,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-12-20 14:09:54

She was there for me through everything for a year. Several mental breakdown, one of them extremely severe. A lot of what I thought was emotional growth on my part, but it turns out I was just going soft.      
     
But then we had an argument the other day. She wanted to blame me for something that I had nothing to do with. And I argued back, trying to defend my innocence. And in the end it was too much for her, and just like everyone else in my life, she left. I've been blocked on all social media, most of which I created purely as a way to keep up with her when we couldn't meet up. I don't blame her, though. At some point, when something's happened often enough, you've got to start looking at the common denominator for the situation. And that just so happens to be me. It's not her fault I'm difficult to put up with. It's not her fault I'm an idiot. It's not her fault that dealing with me wears on people. If anything, she should be applauded for making it almost a full year. I just wish I wasn't such a freak and could handle people better. I just wish I wasn't such a freak and could find ways to not bug anyone. I just wish I wasn't such a freak and could actually figure out how to make people happy. But that's all I am. A freak. That's what everyone has always told me. My family when the decided I was too much. Every friend I've tried to make when it didn't work out. And they were all right. I'm a freak.

Anyways I managed to get her number (asked her irl) and sent her a text about class which again she would ignore. 

After a while I felt a bit disrespected and would completely blank her in real life when we see each other. You can tell she would look my way to say hi but I wouldn‚Äôt even give her eye contact. This continued for a few days, and one other time I felt like I overdid it because we were talking in a group and I was flirting with everyone in the room (mostly girls) without acknowledging her, and you can tell she was visibly upset. When I ignored her multiple times irl, I eventually greeted her. Then I sent her a bunch of texts basically apologizing but indirectly, saying ‚ÄúThis is the last year of college, I don‚Äôt want you to be mad at me...i‚Äôll delete your number and I don‚Äôt need you to respond, just be safe and good luck.‚Äù...she read the texts and actually called me on the phone, she was nice and explained to me that the reason she ignored my texts before was because she had a boyfriend and she is trying to respect their relationship by not talking to other male friends (even though my texts were only ever about class, it‚Äôs worth noting). I made sure I was understanding and we ended the call on a really good note. I honestly thought that was it...that she had a bf and I wouldn‚Äôt contact her ever, which I didn‚Äôt. 

But then another week later she texts me herself out of the blue and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a great person and if you need anything for class feel free to hit me up‚Äù, all after we had already cleared the air and everything was over (on a good note).

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4.

I don't know if I did something wrong, or said something wrong, but I'm getting tired of trying with them.

1242,ItsOnlyKaren,1576730841,1,"I have always had low confidence and have been shy but during 2019 I have been making a big effort to break out of my shell. 

I joined bumble back in August when my friend suggested I join and started meeting people off of there and going on dates. I have been on and off the app ever since in a cycle of deleting the app when I am frustrated and downloading it when I am lonely.

After going out with guys from various backgrounds I learned a lot about other cultures and potential hobbies. 

It was an interesting experience and I no longer am scared of first dates but it did chip away at my self esteem.

I can never get past 2 dates besides the one time I was lucky enough to go on a third. Usually I end up getting ghosted. 

I asked one guy what happened and he told me that I came of as wanting to just be friends.

In middle school and high school I was never anyones crush and I didn‚Äôt start dating until I was 18 and reconnected with an old friend via Facebook who later became my boyfriend and now ex. So my dating expertise sucks. 

I can‚Äôt flirt for one thing and I am not receptive to it. For me to realize that a guy is interested in me I need him to outright say it so I find internet dating so convenient because its pre established after the first swipe.  I am not comfortable touching a guy I am just getting to know unless its a hug because generally I am not a touchy feely person. My compliments don‚Äôt go beyond a compliment on my dates outfit. 

I have done the calculations and  concluded that there is a 21% chance my date and I will kiss regardless of the amount of dates we go on. 

After much thought I realized that dates for me are similar to when I go out with my friends but I would like to have at least some resemblance of a friendship before I feel comfortable doing any sort of PDA or sexual contact.

This as a result has led to me being ghosted and I recognize that I am not fast enough.

It hurts though because I feel like I am not relationship material. 

Although I have a diverse group of friends to go out with that I have maintained for years. It does hurt to know that I can‚Äôt go out with someone for more than a few weeks before it fizzles into nothing.

I workout, improved my diet, have gained new hobbies, and have worked on my professional life but the one thing that hurts is the fact that I am not enough.",lonely,I Am Only Friend Material and it Hurts,2019-12-19 15:47:21

The invention of money solved the problem of barter, that is, the problem of the coincidence of wants. I have what they want and they have what I want. In my life when I met others that had what I wanted, themselves of course, I did not have what they wanted (my self was not what they wanted.) If only there were a common thing that we could trade our value for and then use it to get what we desired from others so that there didn't need to be this coincidence of wants. Trade was so hard before money was created. And this problem regarding love has not been resolved so we can go our entire lives without finding someone with whom to trade ourselves and in so doing experience true love and true harmony. Life will be so much more worth living in the day that this can be overcome. As for now, if my life completes without ever finding at least one true case of a coincidence of deep desire with a mate then it will have been a strange life indeed. There are few places outside of relationship to find the significance that relationships possess for us. Great achievements might but they are rare and difficult. If someone does find a person of significance though they would probably not trade that person for the greatest achievement you can think of.

1250,hamartiated,1576724843,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-12-19 14:07:23

1252,EverRosegold,1576721058,1,"So my 21st birthday is coming up after Christmas, and I'm paranoid and panicked at the prospect of possibly having to spend it alone. Me and my boyfriend broke up earlier this year, and I feel worthless, empty, and perpetually lonely in a way I can't ignore.

A little backstory - after ruining my reputation in my hometown following a traumatic event in my early teens that I'd rather not get into, I finished high school and knew I had to get AWAY for college. I got a great scholarship offer to a far-away 2-year college and immediately fell in love with the school. Even though I loved everything about the college, my freshman year kind of sucked due to me being incredibly awkward, horrible at meeting people and making real friends, and I guess just not the type of person most people like to be friends with, not even my roommate who I actually already knew even though she went to a different high school. Honestly, my boyfriend was what kept me holding on.

A little bit into my sophomore year, however, everything changed. Through my new roommate who was a year behind me in school but chronologically a few weeks older, I met the most absolutely amazing, incredible people. Having this group of friends quite literally gave me the will to live and the strength to stop relying on self-harm while I was away at school. When me and my boyfriend broke up, I lost all sense of self-worth and have since felt like I'm just making everyone's lives just a little bit shittier by existing. To be honest, if it wasn't for these friends, I have no idea how I would have gotten through me and my boyfriend's split. 

All of that joy, security, and sense of belonging I got from being there was ripped away from me when I had to transfer to a 4-year college to finish my degree back home in Illinois. I initially loved the idea of starting at a 2-year since this particular one had agreements with so many 4-years, so it was okay that I didn't know exactly where I wanted to finish my degree. Now, I feel like my life has just been a slow but sure downward spiral since leaving my first college. None of my friends or family know this, but I have been making myself throw up after eating occasionally and relapsed into self-harm again just to get through all the emotional pain.

My BFF from the first college and I have talked quite a bit about going out together for my 21st since she's already 21. I want so badly for this to happen, but she lives just over an hour away and I'm scared possible winter weather is going to ruin the chance of that happening. Also, the last time we talked, she just didn't seem very excited about it anymore, idk. I only talk to 3 people from back home, and two of them are going to be out of the state visiting family, and the other has to work at night so could only join in for a short while for dinner or something. I'm also completely terrified that BFF will end up thinking I'm a loser for only having 1 (or possibly 0) friends to join in in my hometown. Other friends from my first college aren't really a possibility because so many of them live so far away, and some of them are fighting amongst each other right now, which utterly breaks my heart.

I just feel like spending my 21st alone will force me to acknowledge that I'll never have my relationship back and never have a group of friends like that again, which, in my mind, translates to me being lonely and sad forever. The one BFF I mentioned (possibly 1 other person? idk) is the only person I feel comfortable enough reaching out to and actually trying to spend time with. If I tried to reach out to the others, who I love just as much, I would just feel like I was being annoying. A couple people are actually transferring to the same college I'm at now, but I know we won't be there forever. We'll inevitably go our separate ways and, as bad as I want to, I won't be able to hold onto them forever. I'm too fucked up and sad to keep going indefinitely, and I feel like I'm just postponing it at this point. It's so pathetic that there are people out there who would kill to be living in my life, and I'm just lonely and sad and cutting myself all the time. I feel like I'm taking up valuable space in this world while just being a complete inconvenience to everyone. 

If this happens, then I have to acknowledge that me finding these people and feeling worth something for once was just a fluke. I'm just too fucked up in the head (and other places) to keep living. I'm one of those people that is just naturally annoying and repulsive, and I haven't been able to figure out how to change that so far. It's just that for a short little while there happened to be a few people able to see past it.

I would never tell anyone that I'm feeling this way, because that's entirely too much pressure to put on someone's friendship. I can't keep denying that my life is going to be a lonely one, and the nightmares won't stop. I can feel my will to live slowly slipping away, and I won't be able to hold on much longer if I end up alone on what is supposed to be a celebration of life with the ones you care about. 

I guess I'm just posting here to see if anyone has any similar experiences or can relate at all. I promise I'm not looking for sympathy even if it may read that way.

Tl;dr: If circumstances cause me to spend my 21st alone, I'll have to acknowledge that I've always been lonely and fucked up as a person, and always will be. There's only one awful, terrifying way out.",lonely,I don't know how I'll keep going if I end up alone on my 21st.,2019-12-19 13:04:18

I don't feel more superior than anyone here, especially as this is rare for me. For the first time a friend noticed that I unfriended her on Facebook, and she realised this... she actually realised I unfriended her and sent me another friend request.

All my previous friends just up and left, once my head got in a dark place I wasn't able to respond to their messages as much, and this is usually what ends up destroying the friendships I've once had. If I can't contribute to the conversation, then it's making everything collapse. So instead of burdening her, I decided that maybe I'll save her the trouble and unfriend her myself, because I don't feel anyone would want to be around me when my mood's low. Not like this, it's unfair and wrong. 

But no, she realised that I removed her from Facebook. I never said anything, but she still noticed that I wasn't there. I feel guilt... it wasn't right for me to unfriend her, but this was never expected. I've never had a friend who cared this way, who cared enough to even bother. Usually if I stop messaging first, it's a que for them to leave. Suddenly they realise I'm not that important, so this would've been the perfect opportunity for her to leave, and I wouldn't have argued or hated her for it either... I would respect her choice and quietly wish her the best.

We hung out for awhile and then I wanted to take things in a romantic direction because she seemed to be enjoying my company. She not only turned me down flat, but told me she thought overweight people were disgusting. Now, I have posted a lot on this board so you guys may know that I‚Äôm rapidly dropping weight and went from almost 400 pounds to around 250. Still 50 pounds overweight, but working on it. The point of explaining that is that the weight comment was not devastating or anything. I‚Äôve heard muuuuch worse and have had a lot of women interested in me since losing so much weight.

So, yeah, it hurt to be reminded by someone I was getting along so well with that I was still not ideal, but here‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt matter:

She asked if I was upset and I said I was sad. She asked why and I explained that I was really into her her rebuke was disappointing. We parted and I went to the gym and then home. Life kept going. Today I had a really cute checker I work with grab my arm and say I was starting to get ripped. I am moving forward. The injuries still hurt, but loneliness is not a foregone conclusion anymore.

1276,Hardyscott,1576693317,1,"Boundaries. Boundaries are to be the biggest enemy of a human being. Boundaries where people trick your mind into limiting yourself to boundaries where people cross to humiliate you, make you feel in a certain way crossing the limits of a human being's humanity and morals disgracing the core values of humanity sending a person into a state of Anxiety and Depression. This has been the case with me and every person who goes through anxiety and Depression.

The human brain is not predictable so isn't it's thinking, but one thing can surely be said that most people can easily get into people's words and get discouraged easily, after all words cut sharper than knives inside the brain if taken to seriously and again that's something that happened with me too. A human forgets his/her true self and dwells into the discouraging thoughts these cruel people give rise to inside the brain through their hurtful, disgraceful and awful actions and the words they say to hurt people and they succeed when a person gives up and goes into his/her dark corners pulling himself away from the reality lost somewhere in the lost ruins of his/her mind. 

The thing here is, we tend to give up more easily and more often when easily persuaded and discouraged by people who like hurting people and make for their very own entertainment and jealousy of not wanting to see you excel in your life.

This inturn lowers a person's self confidence and in turn gives birth to to a state or depression and what arises in his/her brain through the change in their confidence and courage thereafter is known as ""ANXIETY"" which which comes in the way of everything, could come in many ways either through breakdowns, sudden heart beat rising out of increased fear due to lack of confidence when infront of a huge crowd or among people or sudden shivering, body turning cold and trembling and lowers his/her strength. 

Again happened with me!

In the end there's one thing a person should think and pull themselves back before it's too late. That what these people says and what the world wants you to be can't decide your way of living life or finding happiness and can't change your thinking, strengths and can't affect your aims because in the end you are like phoenix rising from your very own ashes everytime they try to burn you down because it's never too late even when you are cornered, all alone or even if it's you vs the world where you are all alone so be it and do whatever it takes and stand back on your feet rising up above and fighting it all for the world to witness your rise while these people remain where they are and realize in the end that hadn't they wasted their time into disgracing and pulling you down they'd have been somewhere better where you are and their shame, jealousy and regrets will be their end while you succeed.

Just chime in with your strengths and be that courageous master of your own life as you stand by giving your haters no attention what they want and those people coming in your way a gaze that will lower their confidence not yours because you don't deserve the anxiety and depression they want you to have . Nobody does. Find that one little thing that pulls you back in with more confidence and bounce back into this life that is precious and long enough to learn from and to grew into a stronger and better person.

I just did that. I found that one thing in my brain that arose in this darkest time, that one thing that I had that was going to revive me and that was my humor that was birthed in my brain during this darkest time when i had to find it and it made me feel happy and I felt as long as it makes me happy it's great and I don't care bout the rest when they come to pull me down they'll get a greater share of my actions. That's when I realized all of this what i talked to you about right now about depression and anxiety and stopped caring about what they said or did and if they ever came in my way I always give them that evil smirk and that gaze that lowers their confidence and an unending humorous take on them that makes lose their confidence and give up, declare me to be a mad person, mentally unstable or something else but deep down they now know that they cannot defeat me and that's where I have succeeded in driving them away from my life even when they get in my way through my strength, courage, unending faith in myself and this new found self.

You just gotta be strong. In the end you will succeed. All the very best for your life! And I'm always here to talk if you want to! :)

I am ok with going places alone and being alone. I will spend the rest of my 30's traveling meeting people having fun going to concerts art museums fishing etc

When I am 40 I will buy a xbox and just hang out smoke weed and chill

I have nieces I can help raise and expose to sci art etc. I have already been doing that cause one of them has terrible parents. 

I have seen so many bad relationships that I am ok with being free.

Don't get me wrong it's not like I have a choice. I am not mgtow. I am mstow. Men sent their own way.  But I figure if no one is gonna wanna date me I should at least have fun and be happy.

I won't spend all my money on it and I know it's shallow and gross but I can always party with strippers. 

It's my fault I am being lonely. (This does not apply to everyone just me) I am so annoying and I am working on it. I googled how not to be annoying and found some great advice. 

I am fat and want to change that.

Every time I had friends I pushed them away with my terrible personalty and then I wondered why I couldn't find anyone to travel with.

NYE I am hoping a old friend who is maybe my last real one will go party with me. If not I will go party alone. I can keep from being annoying long enough to go out and party. I have done it before and had a great time and actually  partied with strangers. 

the only friends I have left are Scott who hates me and treats me like dirt so I only go to his house to buy weed. Plus Scott only cares about video games and never wants to leave his house Ken who is awesome but super busy cause we are in our 30's I am 32 and Steve who is a huge drunk and ruins everything I try to do with him. He has no job and only cares about drinking. 

I still love exploring the world and going to big music events and I am so happy I got off my knees years ago and decided not to beg for a women's approval. 

I don't hate women. There are some I look up to some who make amazing music I love and I don't care who they date or what they do as long as they make great art or make amazing sci breakthroughs. Women are just people and deserve to live a great life too. I have seen men be monsters so I know some women can feel so lonely even if they have a man. 

I am so happy I didn't have Reddit growing up or I might have found the Incel subs and got stuck in a terrible awful black hole. Plus I know life is unfair and hard because I saw my dad have to be a man in the face of a cruel world so I know I am not owed anything and if I can chill in a warm place I am lucky. 

I want to be a good person and help people so I also try and spend my time doing that but I am MLK Jr. Music reminds me I need to do this though. 

Of course I still have a great family great mom and dad and I can't imagine how hard it is for those who don't.

Don't take anyone elses word for it.  If there is anyone we both know has said anything about me, it isn't necessarily true.  I'm the only one who truly knows my plan, but I am willing to share it with you and only you.

I have never tried to avoid you, I'm just keeping my distance while I am going through my plan.  My heart pounds so hard when ever there is a chance that our paths  cross.  I get so nervous too.  I am keeping my distance so I can focus on completing my plan and not get distracted because I need to complete it as soon as I can.

I only know one thing and that is I am risking everything, but I have to do this.  I may have completely lost my chance with you forever and that hurts a lot, but the alternative is going to drive me to places I don't want to go.

This plan is making me lonely and depressed, but the result keeps me driving forward.  This plan is going to make a lot of people mad, which could include you, but I'm going to have to risk it and ask for forgiveness later.

I just hope that what ever damage there already is and any damage that may happen in the future is repairable.  I've told you before how I feel about you and I still feel the same way about you.  I just pray that you are there too at the end of my journey.

Do you remember the question you asked me that I wanted to say ""Yes"" to but couldn't?  I hope that in the future sometime after my plan is complete, or almost complete, you will ask me that question again because I will say ""Yes"".  I regret saying no every single day.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I was raised alone by my Father who did the best job he could with what he had, by one reason or another we would move houses and towns frequently, maybe once every 14 months on average and I really feel like this has impacted my approach when it comes to my social interaction. In the sense that, on a psychological level, I‚Äôm prone to not invest in people as friends because I‚Äôm used to having to leave all the time. 

I‚Äôm keenly interested in child psychology and I‚Äôm betting that not having any other long term bond other than my father has really shifted my perception on healthy relationships. I didn‚Äôt have any long term interaction with anyone apart from my father and grandmother. I was unintentionally kept from both my father and mother's side of the family because of the frequency that we would change location. 

I have definitely noticed this later on in my life as I started talking to girls. Anytime I liked one I would keep them an arms reach away or longer because of my subconscious need to not be attached to anyone other than my father, the one I knew wouldn‚Äôt leave.

I have noticed that I have been set up for mental and emotional failure now that I‚Äôm 21 with a somewhat adult brain able to conceptualize the effects of my upbringing. With a huge lack of an immediate and physical support network I‚Äôve been left to figure out how to deal with life through the lense of one man which isn‚Äôt healthy in my opinion. 

There‚Äôs a reason people say it takes a village to raise a child, but most of my life up till I was 11 has been spent alone in my room.

I'm 26. ive never had sex. Ive only been in one realtionship, if you removed 3 or 4 days from my life you would remove all the physical in person interaction Ive had with a women romantically. I can talk to women fine, several friends are women and its good. but I just don't know how romance works.

I'm pretty religious at times. Don't want to talk about that AT ALL. But its relevant for the next part.

I started watching porn when I was younger. about 4 or 5 years ago I started talking to women online, sometimes sexually. I just feel so absurdly lonely that I don't know how to deal with it. I just want to feel a connection with someone.

I got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperienced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect.when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I litterally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

That fills me with guilt. But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty  womans voice tell me im not a horrible disgusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself. Sometimes I go online and try to find a woman to help me get over this I post something like this 

&gt;I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embaressment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word. Like she would be EXTREMLY kind and caring towards me without being condesnding, but just truely wanting to help me get comfortable with sexuality

1334,shit_wrongplanet,1576620731,1,"I'm not saying I was ""born in the wrong generation"" or something silly like that, but I don't fit in at all and no one likes me. My whole life I have felt isolated and defective, and other people reinforce this. Everyone thinks I'm weird and creepy no matter how much I try to act normal, and even though I'm kind to people they just throw it back in my face. 

Most people in my peer group are so cold and selfish and treat me like crap. They're boring and vapid, when I ask them about their hobbies and interests and goals they have almost none, unless you count excercise, social media and getting drunk which I don't. 

Their lives are a tedious parade of drama, gossip, sex and parties. I have been to three parties and they were all lame, a lot of guys sexually harassed me and tried to pressure or trick me into drinking alcohol and got mad when I politely declined. The girls did some dancing but not even with passion, they just awkwardly bobbed up and down like they were being forced to dance at gunpoint. 

I find myself making excuses for the people who have bullied and harassed me over the years. They're hormonal and insecure, they can't help being horrible. But I'm even younger than most of them and I'm not horrible to people; I have never gone out of my way to be cruel to someone. People at my school used to kick and shove me unprovoked, chase me every day, threaten to break my legs, tell me to kill myself, throw things at me, scream, forcefully hug me (I know that sounds ridiculous but I was afraid of being touched), film the bullying on their phones, call me autist and schizo and say so many sickening things about my body and what they wanted to do to me. They wouldn't stop until I was crying and shaking. And no the school did not help. On TV someone always swoops in to save victims of bullying, but that's rare in real life. Massive crowds would gather and usually everyone just laughed and jeered. 

How can people be so pointlessly mean, so sadistic and self absorbed, so careless and narrow minded? It's so hard to make friends, forget ever finding a boyfriend. Everyone thinks I'm a stuck up prude because I want a serious romantic relationship and not just some casual sex.

3 years ago give or take, I went through a terrible falling out with a person who I thought was the one. It hurt me more than I imagined. And ever since then I've been on a downward spiral. For a while I was afraid to talk to women cuz I was afraid of being hurt ( I've had an abusive older sister who I very recently cut off from ). Also I wanted to cut off all my relationships cuz I thought I was an obligation to them. Was never able to cry for some reason so was never able to vent out my frustrations/sadness. Soon enough lost all my friends. Was depressed for 2 whole years. It was terrible cuz it took a toll on my health - physical and mental. Gained weight consequently and lost most of my hair. Which pushed me further down. 
But I did snap out of it kind off. I just told myself every morning that I was the only person who could make myself happy and I couldn't rely on anybody 'rescuing' me. I no longer feel sad all the time. But I do have nightmares pretty often of being stabbed in the back till date. 
I've been on a downward spiral for 3 years now. But I feel like I've somehow stopped the fall all by myself. But now I've no clue how to climb my way out. Still figuring out things.

im about to get bad grades this term in college as a result of my mental state. im expected to usually get a  3.4 gpa...think im gonna get a 2.7 this term which never happened to me before. i skipped so many classes due to my social anxiety. now gonna have to lie my way out of it because if my father finds out he'll go crazy on me as usual. 

at college, nobody in my small department knows who i am, no one in class knows my name. im just ignored like im not even there. also ignored when i pass by people i worked with in previous semesters in projects. being ignored is such a terrible feeling to experience.

 i have no one to talk to and no one to love or be loved by. its so depressing seeing couples on campus knowing this is the best time to find a partner (in my region of the world at least), yet i dont have a chance due to my looks. 

i know im ugly, got told i was a 4/10 on one of those rating subreddits. self-confidence is nonexistent as a result. just a total and complete failure really


i always think of just offing myself anytime im under stress. it's been like a weekly thing now. idk how long this will keep up, but dont worry, i don't  have the guts to do something like that. i also dont have the guts to go to a therapist either because of my social anxiety.

Long story short, before highschool i had my heart broken a couple of times,and then i had to gk through my parents's divorce,which was not pretty.My dad had a couple of times where he beat my mom to the point where she had to go to the hospital.My parents were always abusive to me and everyday they tell me i'm fat,dumb,that i'm wierd and so on.

In my first year of hs i met this girl and she was the most wonderful thing on the planet.I felt like she cared about me,we had conversations till 4 am and because of her i'm the person that i'm today.I loved her more than anything at that time,and i tought that she was my soulmate(maybe deep down i still belive/hope that).But there was this guy who was friends with the both of us and i felt insecure because he always made her laugh.I tried to be friends with him,i even told him that i liked that girl,but he didn't care.He is the person i hate second most in this world. At the end of freshman year i had an argument with both of them and until new years i didn't spoke with neither of them.After that i spoke with that girl and she was sorry and i felt like she missed our conversations,and we became friends again.The same thing happend  and i had to take a few months to find myself because i didn't know who i was without her.And i found my love for movies and cinema.In my 3rd year of hs i tried to start a film club in my school,and i made it,but those to wanted to ""help me"",which started a whole new fight and the end of that club



now i'm in my final year of highshool. I don't know if i'm 100% over that girl,but now i'm so much better,i have new friends that,not always,but most of the time i feel like they really care about me and that they really like to hang out with me.And there is this new girl that at first i didn't knew that well,but we became closer and closer and now i'm in love with her.The problem is that she used to really like my best friend,who to put it in a few words is a fuckboy who didn't give a fuck abour her. Then,at first,when i started liking her she started dating another a-hole,who treated her like shit and they broke up after 3 weeks.
I talk to her everyday,and i see that she cares about me,but sometimes i also feel like she gets tired of me  .I don't want to tell her how i feel bc i can't go trough another heartbreak,i can't lose another friend,especially since i have to go to college next year.I don't know what to do.",lonely,I just want to feel like I'm important to someone,2019-12-18 05:52:25

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

1373,ashless401,1576594897,1,"When I first joined. I found a lot of like minded and confused people. We were looking for ways to make friends or meet up and not feel so isolated in such a big world. We had grown up lonely or maybe just noticed it happening over time and were trying to find ways to fix it. To get back in with a person or a group. Reconnect or figure out what was wrong with ourself that put people off and do something about. A group of people-who didn‚Äôt want to wallow in self pity and blame the world for their faults.  

Unfortunately im noticing a trend on here recently. Some people are posting how lonely they are but that they are also miserable self-pitying and no fun to be around. What are we supposed to do with that? If nobody wants to be around and you and you make half-ass attempts at correcting your outlook and negativity what‚Äôs the point in whining? What do you want from people? Obviously not a friend to share in things because you wouldnt give them the support they need.  When it‚Äôs only about yourself then it‚Äôs selfish to complain as well. If you are not someone others want to be around stop blaming society and stop giving each other a pass. Unless that‚Äôs the kind of friend you want then by all means start your own group of angry dejected people who‚Äôs only joy in life is complaining about how bad it is. I guess it‚Äôs true misery loves company. So if my only option for friends are a bunch of emotional-vampires I guess I‚Äôll just stay lonely. 
I used to like trying to help people on here. Made me feel less lonely. But now so many on here won‚Äôt even help themselves. Theyll say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even know me!

Ive only been in one relationship, if you removed 3 or 4 days from my life you would remove all the physical in person interaction Ive had with a women romantically. I can talk to women fine, several friends are women and its good. but I just don't know how romance works.

I'm pretty religious at times. Don't want to talk about that AT ALL. But its relevant for the next part.

I started watching porn when I was younger. about 4 or 5 years ago I started talking to women online, sometimes sexually. I just feel so absurdly lonely that I don't know how to deal with it. I just want to feel a connection with someone.

I got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperinced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect. when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I literally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

That fills me with guilt. But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty womans voice tell me im not a horrible disgusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself.




-------------

I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embaressment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word.

1395,Goodbye-Allison,1576561427,1,"One day when Allison was nine she left the confession box with blood running down her leg. ‚ÄòThe nun saw me and she called me over really roughly. And she gave me a rag, she said, ‚ÄúGet in there and clean yourself up‚Äù. She said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so disgusting and don‚Äôt you come out of there till you‚Äôre cleaned up‚Äù ... And I didn‚Äôt do that. He did.‚Äô

Allison could not tell her parents about the abuse because they were often drunk and abusive themselves, and she couldn‚Äôt tell the nuns at school because they would call her ‚Äòdirty‚Äô and ‚Äòdisgusting‚Äô. But Allison believed that policemen were soldiers who could ‚Äòfix anything‚Äô. Knowing what Gregory was doing was wrong, she saw a policeman and tried to explain what was happening to her.

‚ÄòHe knelt down to my level, he looked right at me and he said to me, ‚ÄúYou are a naughty, naughty little girl‚Äù. And I remember it, I‚Äôll never forget it. I can see him now, the policeman. I wanted him to save me.‚Äô
The abuse continued until Allison left for high school. As a young adult, She became restless and unable to stay in the same job for very long despite enjoying the work. She had difficulty trusting people and had problems with intimacy.

‚ÄòIt really does make you bitter and twisted ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt find much to smile about, there‚Äôs nothing to laugh about. I stick to myself, I like to be by myself. I don‚Äôt like too many people around me.

‚ÄòThis is what it‚Äôs done to me. When I did have my first child, I didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant until I was five-and-a-half months pregnant. And I asked the doctor, ‚ÄúPlease get it out of me, just get it out‚Äù.

'I wanted him to take it out of me, get it out because I was so filthy. I felt so disgusting. And today I still feel filthy. Although I shower three times a day I still feel filthy. I cannot get myself clean.‚Äô

At age 19 Allison started receiving counselling and later became pregnant again. She had a second child who she was very protective of.

‚ÄòI made sure no-one, absolutely no-one went near him to have that chance to do something horrible to him.‚Äô To this day she has a good relationship with her now adult son and his children.

Allison suffers from insomnia and has been prescribed sleeping tablets which only give her four hours of sleep every night. She has also tried to commit suicide on numerous occasions.

‚ÄòThey really wrecked me, they really, really wrecked me.‚Äô

Allison has not sought compensation for the abuse because she couldn‚Äôt see what good it would do her. However, recently she has had a change of heart and believes she might be able to accomplish some good with any settlement received.

‚ÄòBecause they did this to me, yes I will go for that claim. But you know what I want done with that money? I don‚Äôt want that filthy money. I don‚Äôt dare want it. But I‚Äôd like that money to go to the little boys and the little girls that are little children today. I want that money to go to them to help them. I don‚Äôt want no one going through to end up like this. I don‚Äôt want no-one to end up like me.‚Äô

Allison still receives counselling, which she said ‚Äòmakes you feel a bit better, especially you know someone believes you. And that‚Äôs so nice because no-one before believed you‚Äô.

‚ÄòI‚Äôm getting believed. It‚Äôs such a relief.‚Äô",lonely,My real life story part 2 (Allison)‚ù§Ô∏è,2019-12-17 16:43:47
1396,Goodbye-Allison,1576560819,1,"Allison was the youngest child in a Catholic family living in Sydney‚Äôs western suburbs in the 1980s. Both parents were born in eastern Europe, had limited English skills and were heavy drinkers. Allison‚Äôs  father abused the children, which their mother knew about but did not try to stop.

When she was eight, Allison was sent to a Catholic school run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph and their parish priest, Father Gregory. The nuns were very cruel and dealt severe punishments to students for the slightest misdemeanour. She still has several scars from violence inflicted on her by the nuns.

On one very windy day the lid from a metal rubbish bin flew up in the air and hit a nun on the head. The children in the playground laughed at this but it was Allison who the Sister decided to punish, and sent her to visit Father Gregory.

Allison was alone with Gregory in the confessional where he undid his pants. After she confessed to the incident in the playground, he told her she was a ‚Äònaughty girl‚Äô and her penance was to touch his penis.

‚ÄòWell, I did what I was told but all I remember was I didn‚Äôt like it ... I was made to play with it for a while and I did that. He let me go out and the nun told me that if I was naughty again that the devil was going to come and get me. And I was so scared because I didn‚Äôt want the devil to get me.‚Äô

After that incident Allison was sexually abused by Gregory almost daily. Her two closest friends were also abused. Allison recalled an occasion when all three girls were sent to the confessional box one by one, and one by one they all came out crying.

‚ÄòThen he said to us, ‚ÄúYou girls go out and play. You don‚Äôt tell nobody. I‚Äôm going to talk to God now. I‚Äôm going to talk to God and see what God wants me to do next‚Äù.

‚ÄòEvery day it was a survival. And I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be extra good today‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt want to go in there to the priest. But you know what, it doesn‚Äôt matter how good I was, I still ended up in there a lot.‚Äô

In addition to forcing Allison to finger her vagina and perform oral sex on him, Gregory digitally penetrated and eventually raped her in the church building.

‚ÄòI thought he put something inside me like a pencil. But it wasn‚Äôt, it was his finger. And God, the pain ... I had to do it. If I didn‚Äôt he was going to tell God, and God‚Äôs going to send the devil to come and get me, and take me into hell where I‚Äôm going to burn because I was very naughty.

‚ÄòHe got me into the church. Nobody was there. Out the back, up the altar and around there to the side. And he started to have sex with me. And I tell you, I was stiff, I was eight. Oh God, I was eight, I was eight years old.

‚ÄòThe priest started to try and have sex with me and all I can remember, I was laying down and he was telling me, ‚ÄúNow you be quiet, you don‚Äôt want to wake up Jesus‚Äù ‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôm laying there and he was trying to put his penis inside me and oh boy I tell you what, all I can remember ‚Äì pain.‚Äô

Allison told the Commissioner that Gregory‚Äôs rape was more painful than childbirth.

One day when Allison was nine she left the confession box with blood running down her leg. ‚ÄòThe nun saw me and she called me over really roughly. And she gave me a rag, she said, ‚ÄúGet in there and clean yourself up‚Äù. She said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so disgusting and don‚Äôt you come out of there till you‚Äôre cleaned up‚Äù ... And I didn‚Äôt do that. He did.‚Äô

Everyone that I‚Äôve been close to has either used me or left me. I‚Äôve been bullied for years and verbally abused by both bullies, ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, and significant others. And I‚Äôve been ignored and forgotten by people who I had always been there for. People know I‚Äôm weak and use me for it. I‚Äôve been changed to match what people wanted me to be and I‚Äôve been sexually assaulted and I still can‚Äôt find it my heart to be mean to them. The best I can do is ignore them. Like they‚Äôve ignored me. I have a group of friends yes but I always take care of them. I don‚Äôt mind of course. I just want them to be happy. But it often makes me feel as if no one could care for me like I do for them. My brother and sister are both way older than me and either never can or want to hangout or talk to me. My parents really just only see one side of me and haven‚Äôt even been home these past three months. I‚Äôve practically been living on my own for these past months because my older brother is always tired and busy, when one parent is gone the other pretty much forgets my existence, and the one week my grandma came out to watch and take care of me while both my parents were gone my alcoholic and druggie uncle was also out to watch me and I ended up having to call the police on him after he threatened my grandma and I in the car. My birthday was a week ago and I felt forgotten and like it was even my birthday. We had actually celebrated someone‚Äôs birthday that was a couple of days before mine in my birthday and of course I was fine with it. As long as they were happy. And I always seem to somehow make people like me. Like, like like me. And I hate it because they say they love me then leave me within a week because they‚Äôre done using me. They‚Äôve had their fun controlling, verbally abusing, and once using...my body for their own enjoyment. Then they leave. They always do. Or I somehow find the courage to leave them. Which is quite rare. Sorry for the long essay.

I was lonely for a super long time. I know this might sound childish, but almost every day for a year after school I used to go to my room and just cry. I was and I still am picked on a lot at school, probably due to my high functioning autism and ADHD, but the main reason why I would cry was because of having literally no friends. All my friends either moved away or became rude to me, and I was super lonely. I‚Äôd just get home and start crying because I felt like no one cared about me. No one wanted me to be happy. I felt like a useless human being. I was at the point of wanting to kill myself, then something happened that changed my life. It all started with a Discord server invite from a student at my school. We have talked before, but we never really got to know each other enough to become friends. When I accepted the invite, we started talking a lot more. He invited me to some group chats that he was in, and eventually we became best friends. We are both in chorus now, and I love him so much (no homo). He doesn‚Äôt know this, but he indirectly saved my life. I‚Äôm telling you all this for one reason. If you feel lonely, don‚Äôt give up yet.

1414,hamartiated,1576551376,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Some have treated me with respect when I say no to hooking up, but others have gotten nasty.   I‚Äôm planning on getting out more socially and meeting people the old fashioned way, it just gets disheartening.  I miss sex a lot but I‚Äôm not going to make poor decisions just because of loneliness.  I‚Äôd rather be true to myself, but I often feel that I‚Äôm in the minority (I know that‚Äôs probably not the case but sometimes it can feel that way).

I took it really badly at the time but I‚Äôve been doing much better recently. However just now I went on an old social account I forgot we shared and saw his updated pics of him at the gym and stuff. 

It‚Äôs so trivial but immediately it somehow took me right back to how I felt on day 1. I guess it made me realise he‚Äôs moving on with his life same as me.

One of these guys would be considered a ""popular guy"", I'm not saying this with any malice and I truly do love him as I do my other friends but it really drives me nuts sometimes. We've been friends for so long but everything is so different now, we live in such completely different worlds, he has so many friends and groups that he hangs with other than us, yet he's the only person I hang with. I don't understand why he is friends with me, we barely have anything in common,  he's attractive, a social butterfly, and extrovert and Im the opposite of all of those. Im honestly thinking he's just my friend because he knows I have no other friends. He always talks about girls and new mates he's made that university and all I can do is stay silent, sometimes we hang out with some other old high school friends with whom im not as close as and they talk about girls and stuff and I can't say anything but I can see how much more fun he has with them.

It doesn't really matter anymore though, we barely hang out, I go weeks alone in my room and alone at college whilst he's having so much fun, Im happy for him, but at the same time Im so jealous and I hate that I am.

My other two friends are more like me but the ""popular guy""(don't really like calling him that seems weird) is the only reason we hang out, we basically never hang out without him for some reason.

1436,Aedri333,1576532053,1,"Hi everyone,

I just felt like I would post this here. I hope I'm doing this right. I'm not extremely familiar with this platform. 

So, this year has felt like everything has gone wrong, even though it started promising. I was even expecting to get engaged to my partner. I got a new job, got a car as soon as January started. i just felt like this was going to be my year.

Oh boy, was I wrong...

This year proved to be the worst year in my life. My family has been cut off as they kept interfering in my relationship and they didn't take this well. They have always been very demanding and abusive but I've never expected them to go to extreme lengths to do me harm if I said ""that's enough. no more"". They tried to destroy my relationship, my friendships because I wouldn't let them continue with their behavior.

Anyway.. once they have been removed - blocked and ignored from every social media platform and address book, my relationship went down next. My partner has had enough of the drama and felt disappointed with me as a person and wanted a break. Currently, we're on a break and he's moved out. 

I'm on my own and living each day as it is but I feel lost completely.

I forgot to mention that all of my friends are in my native country and I can't see them. 

My finances have taken a blow as my partner moved out and we have to cover the rent where he is, the utilities here as well as the rent here. It's horrible, everything is going down.

I've started having issues as work because of all the stress I'm under and my boss gave me the lovely advice to pull myself together as I could risk losing my job. So that's amazing as well.

Long story short, I try to talk to my friends from back home, but at the end of the day, I am here on my own, even though I see my partner once per week (on a break, not broken up) I feel like I am on my own and am very very lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been the sort of person who would look out for others, but now when I am at my lowest, I feel so abandoned and nothing seems fair. Sometimes I keep my optimism high but other times I just lose it completely. 

I just want to feel a bit appreciated and have someone tell me for once that it will be okay and everything will pass. It feels very lonely when I get home from work and see the now half-empty house.

1438,WakaWaka123321,1576530878,1,"I had a realization today. I spend a lot of time scrolling through facebook every day, or through reddit. Sometimes I'm read blogs. I had a realization about all of this. I do this because I'm lonely. I'm trying to get that 'hit"" of socialization. 

Its strange cause I have friends in real life, I hangout with them often. I don't always feel like I can fully be me around them though. I feel like they don't really and truly know my hurts and pains. My life is very segmented. There is the me that I show the world, and the me that is on the inside. 

I'm religious and have strong convictions about how I should live my life. I don't have a desire to force those convictions on others but also find i have to self censor a lot because I know they just wouldn't understand my views. There is a hopelessness in my life as well. I feel like I will never find love. I'm 26 and more than anything I crave a significant other. I want affection in my life. Ive considered getting a massage because I desperately need to relax but also because I crave human touch. Dear God I crave human contact. None of my friends are huggy and even if they were its not like we would be cuddling or anything. At least a massage would get a persons hands on me, granted it wouldn't be in a sexual (or even affectionate) way. I'm not sure I want to pay for human touch though, thats....that seems a dangerous road to go down.

My personality Isolates me from others. Not that I'm an ass (i'm not, i don't think), but I just don't value what others do. I have no drive to get some super well paying job (Though I want to have a comfortable life). I don't seek power or money or even recognition. 

My inward convictions also make me ashamned cause I don't live up to them. I get angry at people when I want to be kind, I feel hurt when i shouldn't, I feel lustful and desire to be desired anyway I can.

1461,Negative_Plastic,1576490905,1,"Sometimes I wonder if I'm not as lonely as I think, and that this is just what adulthood is like. It's weird transitioning from very social and insular cultures like high school and college, to workplaces where people are less prone to interacting with one another in an attempt to develop friendships. 

So when I wake up at almost 5AM in apartment, where only I live, and I feel alone, I also sometimes wonder if adults just don't really have friends in general. Yes, part of me would like a solid group of people to text throughout the day and go out for drinks. But then another part of me wonders if that's what people do once they've reached their mid-20s and settled down in their careers. 

A lot of adults in my life, my age and older, also seem to not ""go out"" much. My dad, for example, has never really had friends he went out with. He spent much of my life alone in his room.

So I just wonder if that's more normal than I think. And if I'm still using a college yardstick to measure my current social life, which is pretty barren. I mean, am I too old to expect that I'll still be texting friends throughout the day and going out for drinks biweekly?

I go to another town to get them since friends and workmates from my town might see me. This time I went by day, and I got the ""full experience"" of seeing the face and body of the hooker I was paying for a long time.

I got to see the tired face (but not after she went wet) and the scars of her body. Stinking armpits and pussy and extremely hairy. I saw how her pussy rubbed against the backseat of the car and got disgusted of her looks. She looked so old and ugly and worked out. I was contributing to that.

I sucked her titty and some juice came out , kissed her, tried not to use her as a cum dumpster as she is. I treated the like humans. I don't know whether I'll get a disease from it. I even tongue kissed her. i didn't think ""how many dicks she sucked"" . I came in another street hooker raw because I wanted to know how it feels. It felt awesome.

I don't know if I got something yet, I took STD tests after two weeks turns out I got nothing. I'll repeat them 3 months from now.

1486,hamartiated,1576464489,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Everyone in my major seems to have friends; I talk to one guy but out of convenience alone. Outside of class I go to the gym and cook and sleep. The friends I met to begin my college experience I've maintained out of fear of being alone. I visit them and hang out but I don't feel as if I belong. Even 'friends' that I've spoken to in an 'intimate' manner, I don't feel a connection with them. If they all disappeared tomorrow or I went to a different city, I would not be affected. I stuff my mind full of self-improvement/discipline/enjoyment content in my free time to make my situation as bearable as possible. At this point, it seems to be a waste. I see people doing similar things but I see them as less (must be projecting). I just feel empty. I know it gets better, but I'm tired of waiting. I just want to accelerate what should be the natural way of things, real relationships.

No one ever wishes me a happy birthday or happy holiday, no one ever puts any effort or cares about me.

I try to stay positive. ""You'll be happy one day.""

It's a horrible feeling realizing that not one person would care if I died.

Some kid I know got hurt and almost died. He had multiple people go 4 hours away to be by his bedside. And I cried because I know if I were to be hurt, not one person would be there.

I am the stereotypical going to die alone in my house without friends.

I have 0 value to people. And people continue to tell me to be positive.

How can I stay positive when I have 0 friends, no one calls or texts me, and I'm going to be spending christmas alone?

1506,PlanetSquare,1576444789,1,"Sometimes planning for the future makes me feel better about my sad life. It sucks right now but keeping an eye what I want and working towards it helps me feel motivated to keep going.

I wanna be rich or comfortably upper middle class. I want to own land and have a farm and have a cool custom gothic mansion that I design. I have never felt truly at home in any of the places I have lived in, and it always felt like a temporary arrangement (and often it was). I wan't something permanent and personal to me.

I want a wife. I will look after my health and appearance and I hope she would do the same so we could gracefully grow old together. We should be open and honest about everything, no secrets, no lies. If we ever run into a problem, I would hate for it to spiral into a mess of vindictiveness, spite or resentment. Hopefully everything could be worked through with a compromise in a loving and respectful way. Never yelling at each other (I don't yell and sort of shut down when people yell at me) or doing anything purposely cruel. I would want her to curious about the world, and be able to talk to her all night about our ideas, theories, interesting things we learned, and to learn things together because even when you're old there will always be more to learn. Before we settle down with a family it would be nice to travel together and just experience new things and new cultures. I would want her to be goal oriented and aim for success, and I would hope that her version of success is compatible with mine. I would want her to have a fulfilling job that she likes. I don't see minimum wage jobs like being a cashier as a fulfilling career so I think that would bother me if they didn't have any plans beyond that. Something like being a nurse, artist, scientist, or teacher or even volunteering time to help the less fortunate, it might just be me projecting my own values but I think those are the kind of things that are going to make a person happy in their career. If she wants to stay at home that's fine too, there will probably be a lot of work to do there as well.

I want a lot of children. I think 12 children would be cool. I would like to biologically have 2 or 3, preferably have both a boy and a girl but it doesn't really matter. I don't have much of a family so having a huge family that I create appeals to me a lot. The rest could be foster children or adopted or the spawn of my wife.

I kind of want to have my own farm aswell, growing flowers (because it's beautiful and profitable) and also livestock, like sheep (because they are cute and profitable) and someone also gave me the idea to get bees, and that would be pretty cool. I would like to have some teenage foster sons, both because nobody really wants a teenaged boy so they rarely ever get homes and also I imagine that they could help tend to the farm and could learn work ethic and learn to manage money. I think I would like to foster an autistic child as well because I know that children with special needs often don't get very good homes if they get placed at all and while I am high functioning, I still empathize with those less fortunate and I think I would be able to understand their needs better than a neurotypical parent. 

I would want us to eat dinner at the table every night with very little exception. I never really got to do this with my family, but I experienced it when I was in foster care and I really liked it. I want to put my future kids into stuff like ballet, piano, karate or like whatever they are interested in so that they can develop a passion for something because I think that's important. I wanna have an open and honest relationship with my future kids so that they never feel afraid to confide in me. I wouldn't punish them for the sake of establishing dominance, consequences would just follow behavior so they can learn that they can't just get away with bad behavior in life.

I would really like to enforce structure, partially because I had very little growing up, everything was very chaotic. I would want dinner to occur roughly around the same time every night but breakfast and lunch could have more flexibility because of school, work and other obligations. I would want to teach my future children responsibilities and independence like cleaning up after themselves starting at when they are toddlers, giving them a small allowance, maybe sometime like a quarter a week for 6 year olds because I remember thinking of that as a lot of money and they can learn to save up for things they want like a snack or stickers or something like that.

I would like to go out and do things as a family like go to the zoo, disneyland, see museums, go to art galleries, have picnics at the park, go camping. Going out once a month seems doable. Also doing things as a family like game nights where we play monopoly, cards against humanities for the teenagers, and stuff like that sounds amazing. 

Wanna teach them how to cook and everyone could take turns helping with cooking. I would want us to have healthy home cooked meals and practice meal prep (where you make a lot of food and then freeze it for later) to save time and money. But maybe every now and then we could get something like pizza and ice cream. 

I think TV, and electronics should be limited. Could do this by only having one TV instead of having TV's in people's bedrooms so that the television time can be monitored more. We could have a desktop in the living room too so it will be less likely for them to look up weird stuff and it would be used mostly for homework and related things. We could also have all the latest gaming equipment like virtual reality head gear and what not, and they could use it for as long as they want as long as their chores and homework is done.  If possible they will only get flip phones to use to call me or their other mom if they need to get picked up from school or maybe their friends parents if something was arranged with them. Basically a phone that can call and text but doesn't have any apps until maybe like 16, partly because by then they would be able to get jobs and buy their own phone anyways.

I also want to teach them about sex and relationships so they have a healthy view on it. I always thought it was weird that people lie to their kids where babies come from?",lonely,What I want for my future and what I want my future family to be like,2019-12-16 08:19:49

However I have people tell me that I‚Äôm beautiful and kind, and I believe them. But it just seems like finding a social scene or making friends beyond a few people is next to impossible. 

I essentially just ended a 1 1/2 year LDR because my boyfriend (whom I met online) wasn‚Äôt a member of my church, isnt a US citizen, and my parents didn‚Äôt know about him until they found out (I didn‚Äôt tell them). Needless to say this was emotionally traumatizing but they basically told me to breakup with him because I didn‚Äôt really know who he is, isnt a member of my church, etc. He is the first guy that made me feel loved and seen for who I am, and we got along so well. But the truth is, I didn‚Äôt truly see myself marrying him (due to other reasons) so it‚Äôs probably for the best. 

I have felt almost my whole life, since I was about 8-9 years old, that making friends is harder for me than it seems to be for other people. 

I hear about other girls getting all of this attention from guys in real life, but I haven‚Äôt really experienced this except for a few that I would never want to date (they are great guys and I‚Äôm nice to them, but I‚Äôm just not interested). 

I know that being fat is a turn off for many guys, and even other people in general because who wants to be friends with the fat girl? Nevertheless I see overweight women with handsome boyfriends and plenty of friends. 

I am not autistic. I am not socially anxious now, per se although I definitely had textbook social anxiety throughout my teen years and through undergrad. 

My I met my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù boyfriend‚Äù my first semester of my freshman year of undergrad. He turned out to be a piece of shit and told me he was gay to make breaking up with me ‚Äúeasier.‚Äù (He later told me this and that it was a lie that he was gay.) 

With my second boyfriend, I made pretty much all the effort with him and he ended up throwing me away for someone else anyway. 

My third, well, I told you the story earlier in this post. 

I feel lonely in general. There are a few lovely young women in my program that I‚Äôve become acquaintances with, and a high school friend that I‚Äôve gotten back in touch with that goes to a university close by, but none of them seem to have the time to actually get together. 

All the people at my church are either old (60s-70s) or close to my age, but married with kids. They don‚Äôt consider me ‚Äúone of them‚Äù because I‚Äôm not married. If I say hi to them, they don‚Äôt bother to try and carry a conversation even if I ask them about themselves and their families. 

A lot of the on-campus activities happen when I have to work. 

All in all, I guess I just wanted to know that I‚Äôm not alone in feeling lonely, and scared that I won‚Äôt find anyone interested in me. 

I‚Äôm confident ‚Äúenough‚Äù most days, but I definitely can‚Äôt compete with these beautiful, fit girls I see on campus. Also I haven‚Äôt met any guys that i would be interested in. I don‚Äôt want to try dating apps yet because I‚Äôm still recovering from this recent breakup, but I guess I just feel like at 23, soon to be 24, I‚Äôm running out of fucking time to get married and find the ‚Äúone.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to be in my 30‚Äôs still single, and only have my desperate male counterparts available. I guess that sounds hypocritical but I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on what should be a normal social life and normal social development for a young woman my age. I feel like I‚Äôm just not quite normal. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm an only child, which makes the feelings of loneliness worse sometimes since I see others having these awesome relationships with their sisters and brothers, which is something I‚Äôll never have. I‚Äôve had friends that I‚Äôve tried to make into substitute siblings, but that just ends up being too much for them and they don‚Äôt feel the same amount of affection for me as I do them. 

I just feel socially pathetic, I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I‚Äôm tired of older folks from my religious community telling me to just have more faith, participate, and talk to other people when that seems to have not helped anything. 

I was hoping to meet my future husband in undergrad. I‚Äôm waiting until marriage but I can‚Äôt help from time to time being insanely jealous of these married couples that get to have sex every day with the person they love while I can‚Äôt even find one guy to actually date in real life. 

I‚Äôm tired of seeing these groups of friends talking about how they‚Äôre ‚Äúfriends forever‚Äù or taking trips together and taking care of each other like family, when my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù forgets to even text me back for weeks. 

Am I pathetic? This is definitely a rant and I try to keep positive most days. But I just feel extremely lonely sometimes and it just bubbles over into this sense of fear that I‚Äôll be alone my whole life.",lonely,23 and running out of time,2019-12-16 03:59:25

Having alot of friends? did that(although that was way back in like middle school so idk if it counts). Talking to people but still feeling alone? Been there, done that.. Having no friends at all? That's pretty much my life 
Actually having friends? Well that's what I'm here to talk about. I knows a lot of people on here are looking for a gf/bf, for me that's way too far a dream.
Anyways from my very little experience, no one is here to stay. It doesn't matter what they say people will leave you behind. You know what sucks even more than having no friends? When you think you finally have a friend and watching them slowly replace you with someone else. Watching the friendship slowly die and someone you really care about lose interest in you hurts like a bitch. Or maybe it's just that I haven't had a close friend for a long, long time idk. Friendly piece of advice, try your best to not¬† have just one close friend because trust me, it doesn't matter how close you are, at the end of the day people are living for themselves. And you might need someone else to go to.

I've felt alone all my life.
I don't know if it is because no one fits me or i'm too picky. 
I'm surrounded by people everyday. My family and classmates, but everyone seems so fucking far away from me, from the way i think, from the way i perceive life. From humor to sorrow. 
Like Robin williams said ""I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone"" 

My best friend got mad at me because i was in love with her. I lost her in every aspect, tbh she took a part of me with her. She was like the closest person i've ever had, but since she left me i've been withouth no one, not even a close friend, just random people. And i think it's gonna be a hard time to find someone to be that close. 
But i would really love to have someone traveling with me throught life's ups and downs. 
In college i feel very isolated, my classmates are inpersonal and in other frequence. 
And i can't figure out if no one wants to connect with people anymore. 
Everyone is on their phone, everyone is cold and moody. They call me weird, but to me they are weird. 
The other day i was in a comic store, there were two guys looking mangas, they took Berserk and didn't knew what that was. So in a friendly way i recommended that manga to them, i received for answer some insults and laughts. 
Then i said to the girl on the cash registrer: ""there's not a lot of polite people these days, isn't it"", she said ""whatever"". 
I left the store watching at my comics and asking myself: ""why these drawings act more human than real humans"" 
I was kinda dissapointed on humanity, and modern relationships. 
I dream every night woth a better world, withouth wars and suicides and killings. 
Withouth people being shit to each other. 
Withouth disconnection.

At this rate, I'm probably just going to start ghosting them back, it's becoming kinda stressful to be putting in effort into one-sided friendship, especially if it's multiple one-sided friendships. I'm so tired, and sick, and emotionally drained from their bullshit. I just want to feel like I have friends, not like I'm just there because they pity me, or because they just don't know howto shake me off.I wish they could straight up just tell me they hated me, instead of play mind games like this. It's not fun at all, and I just wish they would respect me for once...

I'm sorry I really just needed to get this off my chest. At this rate, Reddit is becoming my personal venting space. But if this is the only place I can be allowed to express my feelings and thoughts, then so be it. No one else will listen, so why not just let it out here? I just want people to listen to me for once, insteado of talking over me, and interrupting me, and invalidating the things I like. I just wanna feel appreciated, like a person should feel...

TL: DR: My friends continue to make plans purposely excluding me, and it's starting to fuck with me. The fact that they also constantly make me feel invalidated is also fucking with me too, and I don't know how much longer I can put up with it...",lonely,I'm so tired of being left out by them...,2019-12-15 17:21:53

1564,NuclearSteeze,1576389566,1,"I tried. I really tried. I don't think I can do this.

So, I have talked about my loneliness on reddit before. You may have even read about me. I'm that 23 year old who hasn't had a single meaningful friendship since elementary school. I am still a virgin who has never been on a date or kissed a girl. I have never even asked a girl out because I have never flirted and am socially inept. I have even have an imaginary girlfriend as a coping mechanism for how bad I feel about myself when lonely in my studio every weekend night. I have had thoughts if ending it all before (before I found purpose in this new job I recently started that I deeply enjoy). 

Well...I tried ""just putting myself out there"". Since I recently started this nes job I was living in a completely new city, so I was hoping that maybe I could have a fresh start. Well...it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. 

So one of my co-workers (who has been working there for some time and has lived in Pittsburgh for a while so he has a good social life) said that he and his wife are having a party at his place and anyone from my company was invited to go. So, I decided to just give it a try and just ""come out of my shell"". I was even feeling some confidence in me. I dressed better than I usually do, and went. 

I was the only person from my company that went. Everyone else were either old friends of the co worker or friends of his wife from medical school. I tried making small talk but to absolutely no avail, and every failure made feel more shitty about myself. Nothing I said sounded interesting. None of my jokes are funny. Just like in my college days, my high school days, my middle school days, and even for the most part my elementary school days...I was a nobody when it came to socializing. I was that awkward kid in the corner. There were many ladies there, but i wasn't even trying to hit on any of them. I just wanted to try and make a friend maybe (guy or girl) but maybe I was asking too much for myself.

Also I had a hard time relating to all the stories. They were talking about how they had friends that did this or a girlfriend that does that or a date that went like this or a honeymoon that went like that. I mean I don't blame them. It's not like they I know I am basically a zygote when it comes to a social or romantic life. And if they knew, they would want to get away from me. 

Also physically I felt insignificant. '8 and pretty much everyone was taller than me (some of them were in great shape). Even the women were taller than me. So yeah, I'm a total manlet too (when will I ever learn hahaha). 

So yeah, in some ways a social setting made feel like even more of a loser than I do when alone (at least when I am alone I can distract myself from those thoughts with stuff I like). I tend to look forward to working, because my job is the one thing that gives my life meaning because it's in an industry I love (space robotics....not NASA but they give us funding) and it had for the most part ended my thoughts of ending it all...but unfortunately not entirely, because outside of work I have nothing to do that keeps me feeling purposeful. Noone outside my kin really cares about me, and in order to grow as a person I have to grow outside of my kin obviously. 

So yeah. Here I am. I don't know what to do about it. And I am deeply ashamed to say it, but it does tear me up the more I realize this about myself. I feel like my ship has sailed. I feel like I am destined for this.

Sorry for getting melodramatic.

1571,sleep_dirt_,1576385154,1,"  Hello, I'm an 18 year old guy and I just wanted to write my thoughts somewhere because I don't anybody to share them with. This year is coming to a close and I've reflected a lot on what has happened the past couple years for me. I've never been able to be very social because I've always lived in the same rural area and I don't get the chance to talk to people ever really. When I do I always just feel like an outsider because I never feel I have anything in common with people.

  My family has never treated me well, friends just come and go, and my ex girlfriend started treating me badly until I got her out of my life. I can't feel a connection to anybody and it hurts. Everybody feels so cold to one another and it's sad that there's lonely people when we're surrounded by people all the time, it doesn't make sense.

  I tried my hardest to make things work with people because I truly cared about them but you can't force things to happen. I always tried to understand and people would appreciate it but end up taking advantage and being so hurtfully manipulative. I realized these people really didn't deserve me in their lives so I just stopped talking to them and about all of them regretted it but they already had their chance.

  I finally realized I shouldn't put my self worth on how other people treat me because most people really don't matter in the end. I notice a lot of people really aren't that good and are incredibly selfish. It's been extremely hard to let go of past pain and even still I don't feel that great. 

  I've gotten tired of being so self defeating and letting other people get to me. I'm trying to do what I can to improve my own life without anyone's influence. I thought that I needed a relationship to be fulfilled but I don't really feel ready for that when the people my age are immature and I believe I need to just work on becoming the best version of myself I can be before that. As long as I focus on accomplishing my life goals and try to improve myself I'm sure someone that appreciates me will come around naturally instead of me ""searching"" for someone and that being my goal.

  I've had two dreams for years now. The first was to learn Spanish because I've always wanted to learn another language and it's the most common second language in the US. I think it's a really cool thing to be able to have a window to another culture and having that bridge of understanding. It would give so many opportunities to do things most people I know couldn't.

  My second dream has been to be a musician. I play guitar and I study music on my own. I've always been so inspired by music that I don't think I would be here without it, it's comforted me through the worst of times. I think there's so much beauty in listening to and playing music. I would love to make music that can do for other people what my inspirations of have done for me hopefully. 

  Sorry this was long, I just had a lot I was thinking about. I hope this didn't sound too stupid lol. Thanks to anyone that actually reads this, I know it was a long ramble.",lonely,Trying to Find Peace in the Loneliness,2019-12-15 15:45:54

1573,ts_trixietang,1576383691,1,"I've been pushed away my whole life, I've always felt completely alone.ll throughout my school life kids and staff were cruel, I missed out on every milestone a kid could have and grew up afraid- I waited an hour after school everyday for a ride because I was too scared to walk the four minute walk home thinking from the start of the day to the end that is was the day they were gonna follow through with what they said and kill me because boys don't act like that in Texas. My family pushed me away because I was shameful. 
I started transitioning when I was 18, dropped out of college to work and pay for hormones, started dating, I was going to live like I wanted to. I got my first boyfriend shortly after, I was so desperate to be wanted and not pushed away, I ignored alot of red flags and it eventually got worse, and became constant abuse. It took my nine months but I finally walked away, it would be a few more months before I felt enough self worth to stay away. I remember feeling like that same scared kid I was in Highschool. I started sleeping with my TV and hall light on (I still do) it would be years before I stopped waking up every hour to scan my room and check the locks, and another two years before I'd even think about dating again. 
At 19 my hair started falling out, chunks and chunks of hair would come out during showers. I was freaking out! I'm only nineteen and I'm chalked full of hormones, trans women start GAINING hair after starting HRT. I spent all the money I had seeing doctors, getting blood work and eventually saved up enough for a scalp biopsy (OUCH) results were inconclusive and I was getting the same answers from diffrent doctors . ""This SHOULDN'T be happening"" and ""it will eventually resolve itself as long as you continue hormones"" (it just continued to progressively get worse)
At 20 - 22 (I recently turned 22 last month) was when I realised it never ""gets better"" I found out last year I wasn't the only person my ex was abusing, he was also abusing a younger family member of his. I was 18 when my 28 year old ex pursued me, he took every opportunity to assert his dominance, age and strength over me. He made sure to constantly tell me that I would never be good enough for a life long partner. I didn't know his family beyond a few pictures, videos ane brief conversations. There was nothing I could have done to bring it to light, I had absolutely no clue but even the thought that this may have been going on while he called me his girlfriend makes my heart ache for her. I knew he was a sick individual for what he did to me, and to have done what he did to that young girl, his own family only solidifies how depraved he is and my inability to see that depravity makes me hate myself. 
Last April approximately two years after my first relationship I ventured into dating again. He was persistent, sweet and what I thought was the closest thing to a gentleman I'd ever get. He talked to me morning and night, called me during my lunch break, held my hand, opened every door for me and always walked me to my porch. I thanked him profusely for every little thing, I know to most it's just common decency but I had never been shown that kinda kindness before. It was a complete 180¬∞ the first time he got me alone.  He forced himself on me, grabbed me so hard I was bruised for days, I told him no, that I didn't want to, I wasn't ready but he refused to let up I said ok after what felt like hours, it hurt so much. I held myself after it happened and as he laid next to me, panting he said ""your first time's supposed to be special, huh"". How low he must have seen me to think him forcing himself on me made me feel special. He drove me home and I cried myself to sleep that night. I continued to see him, I felt the need to ""make the best"" out of every situation because history told me things don't get better. I asked him not to leave bruises on my breasts and waist but to him my request to respect my body was a throw away suggestion, he stopped using condoms after the first time. I spoke up once and told him to use a condom, he said no, just no, like I asked him if he wanted coffee or something and just continued. I've never told anyone that before. It made me feel disgusting, just something to use. He dumped me a few days later. Obviously it was for the best but I'd be lying if I said it didn't sting. 
I felt rotted inside, what was wrong with me that these men sought me out.
Shortly after I was outed at my faith based job, coworkers stopped talking to me, managment became unbearable, I had no choice but to leave. I was left unemployed and completely ran through my 401k and my savings, I put a great strain on what little support I had.
Then came August (my last paragraph I swear) my hair loss was at an all time high, I went from progressive thinning to losing about two solid inches off my hair line on both temples. I made an appointment with my pcp and begged for a prescription. She wrote me one and after a brief battle with my insurance I picked it up. After three weeks I began breaking out, boil like bumps under my skin, closed comedones and run of the mill pimples on my cheek and temple. I thought I could wait it out but it became so painful. I returned a month later and was given a topical cream, after three months with no progress I made another appointment with a dermatologist I was prescribed an antibiotic lotion, a chemical exfoliant and a medicated wash. After three weeks of this new combination and still no progress I emailed my dermatologist and was given a prescription for a powerful oral antibiotic for a month. It been two weeks and I'm at an all time low, my acne blankets my face and my hair loss is steadily getting worse. I feel like this is just another reason that I'm pushed away. I tried talking about it with family, how this is severely affecting my self esteem, how I feel disgusting and depressed and they tell me to get over it. That I'm being ridiculous. Even at my most vulnerable I'm being pushed away. I've felt alone my whole life but to be constantly pushed away even in adulthood hurts tremendously. My whole life people have looked at me one of two ways, like they feel sorry for me, looking away when I meet they're glance or staring back at me, wanting me to know they're disgusted with me and they'd think I'd be better off dead. I can't help but see myself that same way now. I feel disgusted with myself. I have one more doctor I can try and see, maybe two more medications I can try- both of which are not covered on my insurance but I'm terrified. What if she won't see me ? What if the medication is like all the others? 
I just can't take it anymore, after every obstacle I remind myself what I've been through and how I overcame it but I don't think I can do that anymore. I can't be pushed away again, I can't be told to get over it. I'm scared and alone like I was in school , like I've been my whole life and I feel like I'm going to be alone my whole life and that scares me more than anything.",lonely,I'm scared to be alone any longer.,2019-12-15 15:21:31

Parents are unfair? Move out! 

Friend is being weird or rude? Block him on all social media! 

Partner is acting differently? Dump his arse!

Even people who are friends with those clearly struggling with mental health, or attachment issues, are told to just abandon them because ""it is not OP's fault"". Of course it's not your fault, but you have a responsibility as a human being to help others. It's called being a kind person. I think this whole movement is a bad and selfish path for society. Its like if a relationship is not beneficial to you in some form, there is not need to keep it, to hell with other people. Every relationship will run into problems, bu there is no need to scrap it completely. 

Look this is not a hill I'm willing to die on, but I have dealt with abandonment myself and have been ghosted by people I thought were my friends; so it hurts to see this behavior been encouraged, and it reminds me of being on the other side. If you have a counter argument, I'd love to hear it, so long as you don't insult me beforehand (another thing Redditors are too quick to do, all your doing is putting me on the defensive).

I can't control how to feel anymore and honestly I lost all my hopes for a better future. I had many suicidal crises but lately I've been thinking this much more serious than before. I've became so lonely guys. I have a distant relation with my family. To be honest I don't even think my father sees me as a living, breathing individual. I feel like I'm all about my marks and school success for him. I used to talk with my friends about my problems but because of my family's ""school concerns"" I can't meet with them anymore and everything is stacking up inside of me. I feel so low. I lost my energy for everything. I can't paint, write and only books are keeping me away from feeling lost all the time. My girlfriend dumped me. All these shit started coming up suddenly one by one and I don't know how to deal with them. If I can reach a spot high enough to kill me right now I'd probably jump without thinking. Nobody cares about me. I'm looking at people and how they have this close relations with each other then I'm looking at myself and I just don't have anyone. All I wanted was some love you know. I'm not concerned with money, fame or anything material. My parents didn't care about me even when I was a little kid. I kinda raised myself. Started painting/drawing a little. Got attracted to books and started writing. I used to be filled with passion for art and literature. Then I thought to myself ""How many people are having my situation right now and how can I help them."". Decided to be a psychologist so I can reach up to people with problems like me. To show them they are cared by someone in this world. But all these dreams and passions are dying inside of me.

I recently moved to North Carolina with my parents because my mom got a new job, my dad wants to start a business, and I am here for college. I have found it very hard to adjust because unlike high school there is no one who lives near me and now that it is winter break I have no one. I contact some people from home, but it feels like nobody really contacts me unless I call them up or text them. It‚Äôs just I feel so lonely here I‚Äôm in this house and there‚Äôs no nostalgia to it and I told people I would try to visit my hometown and i don‚Äôt even know if I can. The thing is I just feel alone and no one is going to visit me so why do I have to do all the work to see others. I know life isn‚Äôt fair, but I can‚Äôt help, but feel like I‚Äôm in my own head cause I have no one to do anything with. I am also taking a semester off so now I will be stuck here with no friends nearby to pick me up and take me places or do anything. Even the friends I have made aren‚Äôt the greatest people my parents don‚Äôt like them and find them sketchy and I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore man. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I just live in my head and play video games while worrying about everything in the back of my mind. I‚Äôm 18 and I‚Äôm stressed out over what my parents tell me is nothing. I guess they‚Äôre right seeing as I‚Äôm living in their house with no priorities right now, but I just feel like there is more I could be doing. All of this has left me alone and sad and I hope maybe someone is sharing that experience or can just tell me it‚Äôs okay cause it really feels like all odds are stacked against me and i don‚Äôt know what to do.

I'm single because I feel like I'm not good enough. I'm sure that I could be successful in life and still feel like I'm not good enough to be in a relationship or the fear that some day they'll get bored of me and just toss me aside for the next.

You see relationships failing because one lost love for the other or on cheated or one can and that's something I'm not willing to go through.

I asked her when was the earliest she was free, she just said ‚ÄúLol Idk‚Äù. This got too me, started spiralling out control with my emotions.

Just had my friends explain to me how to find an SO. You know, they actually read my whiny bullshit and gave a piece of advice.

The guy said that I should act more confident. Trick myself into thinking that I'm cooler than I actually am and trick others of thinking so. Fake it till I make it. But, guess what, I'm already doing this! I couldn't do my job if I wasn't. Those who are close to me tend to think I'm strong and assertive. 
The problem is that he's got a gf, and he had one even BEFORE he started ""boosting his confidence"". The girls just naturally were interested in him. He lives with his gf now, too.

The girl agreed with what he said. But... she does nothing of what the guy told! She has little self-confidence, is overall ""weak"" in a cutesy way, not very sociable. And yes, she lives with her bf now.

I'm some kind of a mix between them. I'm snarky, kinda dominant and humorous in a dark way, like the guy, BUT shy and a bit emotional, like the girl. Aaand I've tried to accentuate those traits, too. Nope. No one is ever interested.

I have two other friends, who are single. One was asked out numerous times and just rejected. The other was in two lesbian relationships - now they're over, but still. I'm the only one who never EVER had someone interested in me, let alone asked out. 

The guy said I'm not ugly, btw, when I told him I thought I was, just that I look shy. But why then? Why does everyone out there seem to at least find someone, and I'm just constantly lonely?

1717,rightarmbc,1576263202,1,"I am a North Indian, and recently I was rejected by someone I met on Reddit. She was and Asian too, and was open to my friendship but not a relationship. We reached to a position where we were both comfortable in sharing numbers (She was the one who offered the number but I was hesitant). I was okay with that but the issue was, the more I learned about her, and talked to here everyday, more I got infatuated with her.

After a month of talking for several hours everyday and being told by her that I am the *'most perfect guy that there can ever be'* on multiple occasions, I was baffled why she is reluctant for a relationship if I was really so darn good ? So a week ago I told her she needs to give me a reason for rejecting me if she don't find any fault in me. And after a lot of reluctance from her side and me standing my ground. She finally admitted.

""It's because I am Indian.""

I couldn't believe the girl I thought was an open minded and progressive person, will be so blatantly racist. My heart was broken and I felt like I was back stabbed.

This is when I started to look for somebody for myself on r/foreveralonedating. And 2 posts later I am noticing a very recognizable pattern. Almost all of the DMs I got in reply of my posts and all the posters I reached out to, ended in same way. The moment I mentioned my nationality, there was dead silence from the other side.

So please tell me honestly fellow Redditors. Am I really screwed because of one element of my life on which that I had absolutely no control? Am I destined be always alone just because people will judge me about something which I cannot change?

PS: I Know some of you might ask me to find someone of my own country, and trust me I would be glad if someone accepts me for who I am (shy, homebody, introvert more creative than money-minded) and I haven't found anyone and not for the lack of trying.

I finished Year 12 over a month ago and not once have my friends messaged me or attempted to make contact, we tried to get us all to have a leavers party but they forgot and went and did their own stuff. This is the time when I started to feel so lonely because I knew they were doing things together due to social media, but for 3+ weeks ive been trying to get together and they don't respond or sat they're busy, which really makes me feel alone.

They're good friends, really, but it's stuff like tonight when they talk in front of me about how they're going to McDonald's tonight and ignore me, like I'm invisible.

So I act out, I do dumb stuff like pull a hat over my face and stare at people to be funny, but they either laugh then turn away or just ignore me. It sounds weird, it I love these guys but the more I see them, the more I realize I do t see them as much as everyone else does.

I've tried almost everything - dating apps, social events, being open to making friends first and not directly look for a LTR. The one thing I just can't seem to bring myself to do is to hook-up with someone. 

I have trained myself to not fall for anyone too deep because I have been burnt before. I have tried all that I can do to ""put myself out there"". But none of it works. I often convince myself (depending on my mood) that maybe the time just isn't right or that maybe I'm not destined for a relationship. I've tried to convince myself that it's not the end of the world and that there are tons of people out there who have never experienced romantic love/relationships and who have been single all their life and are seemingly happy and content with their lives. I tell myself that it's not unusual and maybe it's for the best even. But sometimes, I just can't take it. I have never known what it is like to be hugged or kissed or even looked at by someone, and yet I crave it so bad; like a drug that I've never even had. 

So I wanna ask y'all: does it ever stop? Do you  eventually ""grow up"" and stop seeking or craving love? Can you actually be content knowing that you're probably going to be single all your life? Like, do you ever get over it?

When i was young i grew up in a small town, both my parents were always busy so i guess i wasnt attended a lot to. I grew up homeschooled with some christian tutoring sessions around other christian kids but i developed like 0 social skills. My parents began fighting a lot mostly about money, 5th grade i was switched to public school at a small clique school didnt go great i got bullied a lot and became even more antisocial.My parents then got seperated and soon after me my mom and my sister moved out to the city.
For middle school i thought i was making some friends even though i still got teased a lot i had some people around me to sit with at lunch etc... then my sister started going to the highschool of my city which is a different system than my middle school. By this time my parents had officially divorced however things didnt turn out that simple. I decided to also go to thay highschool however things dont always work out great.
My older sister and i had been close when we were young but barely talked at this point, she also has social issues and apparently from her own mouth she trash talked me to her upperclassman buddies to look cool and funny.
Still with 0 social skills once i left my middle school all the kids id been around except for 2 had ghosted me. At this point i didnt really get things so life decided to get worse. My parents divorce kept going on my dad turns out to be an alcoholic and lied about a lot of money stuff even though he makes a good amount of it. My dad decided to hate my mother for whatever reason and kept sueing her and still is sueing her to this day.
The stress and anxiety from all this continues to worsen. Im now a junior in highschool, still no friends one kid from my old school whod id been hanging out with a lot ghosted me, the other we just kinda stopped talking. My sister is really fucked up and started fighting with my mom a ton. A month ago my mom took away my sisters phone and my sister freaked out and assualted my mom, i didnt know what to do so i called the cops... they came and seperated however for some dumb reason they sided with my sister and arrested my mom. My mom got off charges recently but still my dads gonna make a huge deal about this in court. He keeps sueing us about money stuff like why he shouldnt pay child support or basic health insurance or anything for college even though he makes good money. AND IT GETS WORSE, my dad started dating this rich twofaced scumbag who owns a fucking lawfirm, now there engaged and he has even more money and now a lawyer giving him help for free which is totally fuking illegal but no ones stopping him. Anyways still no friends having trouble affording basic stuff even though income wise technically i should be a rich prep boi, mom has ptsd and anxiety but shes already paying for help with that so getting me a therapist or meds isnt realistic

1751,hamartiated,1576206662,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-12-13 14:11:02
1752,fuccgod12,1576205554,1,"Hey. I am sick of the constant, piercing dissonance between my internal monologue and the physical world. I do not know what is to blame for this feeling. What you may see looking at me is a pale, long haired, goofy short guy. I do not take most things seriously. I developed this as a strategy to appear happy to the outside world. I crack a lot of stupid surreal jokes that usually only result in odd looks from people. I dress in a way that sort of makes me look like I try only a little. I do well in school without putting in strong effort. I am an extra. Hallway filler to make the school look less empty. I do not have many friends; I wonder if I actually have friends at all most of the time. During fifty percent of my lunches I just sit in a remote, empty hallway and listen to sad /mu core music. I do not think I am a quiet kid-I talk a good bit. But not really to anyone, just at any sentient thing that will listen. Most people think I am on drugs. While I occasionally drink and dabble in smoking some grass, I rarely am inebriated at school. I just act really goofy. Sometimes my eyes are red, but that is because I was crying. I usually play that off like I am high, because I feel ashamed for any one to see me at my lows. I am often crying for a variety of reasons. School causes me to have to a stress breakdown. I have no true friends. I feel void of any human contact. The only thing I have is the constant berating and insulting from the inside of my head. I just want a close friend. Someone to hold and cuddle. I tried sex with someone: It did not go well to say the least. The person I am inside is much different than the outside. I could not expose myself to anyone as on top of my stupidity, I am self-conscious. I do not think I am capable of being intimate. People may see an extrovert, however I am deeply lonely.

When I don‚Äôt hang out with them I‚Äôm usually hanging out with my family. I started my first job since college so right now I don‚Äôt have any real tight work relationships but in the past for the most part I‚Äôve been able to establish that. A year ago in college I was in a fraternity and a lot of clubs. I had a gf who broke up with me six months ago. I actively looked to form relationships is what I‚Äôm trying to say I guess.

However through all this I just have this gaping hole it feels like in me a feeling loneliness. Even if I‚Äôm not stereotypically depressed and feel rather happy or good some days this feeling persists. While I remember being depressed most of my life and in conjunction this loneliness it was never this gnawing. When I left the Marines to go to college It really started to feel stronger. 

And the feeling isn‚Äôt like depression it‚Äôs not stay in my bed all day. This loneliness is strong but dull it‚Äôs just a steady persistent nag that I can‚Äôt completely push outta of my mind. Even when I‚Äôm around people it‚Äôs there. It amplifies episodes of depression and just I don‚Äôt know makes life just a little bit less I guess. The worst thing is I can never really seem to tell my therapist why I feel this way. I know I shouldn‚Äôt I have a good family I have friends. I may not be the most extroverted but I‚Äôm social. I‚Äôve had relationships in the past and I‚Äôm currently opening back up to dating again. I shouldn‚Äôt feel empty and lonely but I do. I‚Äôve been in combat sure but I don‚Äôt have ptsd so there shouldn‚Äôt be anything wrong but it‚Äôs there.

So I‚Äôm left here unsure of why and where this came from. The only thing I know is that it feels like someone is slowly pushing a knife in my heart.

1763,LederhosenLeprechaun,1576190342,1,"I had a dream last night of my former crush back in High School. It was the happiest I had felt in years.

I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm gonna sound like a huge creep saying all of this, but I have to share it with someone. 

So here goes: I‚Äôve been real nostalgic over my hometown back in California recently, and as a result I ended up thinking of her as well. As a result, my memory of her worked her way into my subconscious and I fell asleep. 

It was a surprisingly peaceful dream, especially compared to the crappy ones I‚Äôve been having recently. I don‚Äôt remember the events leading up to seeing her very much, but I do remember what happened when I ran into her... somewhat. 

She was as beautiful as I remembered her. She seemed happy to see me, and we hugged each other. She ended up offering me her shoulder to rest my head on. Just being that close to her, and the warm physical contact involved just felt so real and cozy. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt that peaceful and content in a long time. 

It was such an amazing dream. The kind I rarely have. I haven‚Äôt really been doing well since I moved to tell you the truth, and a day hardly ever goes by that I don‚Äôt miss that place. 

As a result, my mind has been in a messed up place. So having dreams like that about happier times in my hometown and the people in it, are surprising, but very much welcome.

In that dream, I felt like things were normal again. Better than normal. I even tried going back to sleep as soon as I woke up, but sadly the previous dream didn‚Äôt continue. Just another one of my regular dreams.

I miss it all. I really do. I miss her, I miss my home, the friends I have over there, everything. I just want things to go back to normal, to tell you the whole truth.

Do I sound like an obsessive creep? A bit of a loser? Kind of pathetic? Somewhere in that ballpark, or no? I feel like I do and I really don‚Äôt like that.

I know it‚Äôs not healthy to rely on one person for internal happiness or whatever the term is, it‚Äôs just that this person in particular was one of the few people I met in school that was genuinely nice to me, almost to the point that it threw me off because I wasn‚Äôt really used to that. She was also very pretty and charming. I feel like what I‚Äôm saying doesn‚Äôt really do her justice, though. But thinking about her just brings back a lot of happy (and admittedly some not so happy) memories, and right now, I can‚Äôt help but cling on to the past, especially when the present feels like being in a pitch black room with no exit, or running down a dark hallway that never seems to end.

Honestly I really do feel like a creep for saying all of this, and I hate that I do. What do you think? Should I forget about her, or just find something or someone else for my mind to be preoccupied with? (Not in an obsessive way of course, at least I hope not) Or what should I do about this? Because I honestly don‚Äôt know how to get past this. A big part of me wants to see her again, but there‚Äôs another part that thinks maybe that isn‚Äôt a good idea right now, or even soon.

1766,tomorrowisbetter19,1576189204,1,"Dear reddit,

I'm trying to hard to escape the loneliness.

Something that I've always loved doing is travelling, exploring, and seeing/trying new things. Seriously, very few things in this world bring me similar happiness to finding a new secret place and exploring every little nook and cranny of it.

I used to have friends to explore these places with, but they never want to hang out with me anymore. I used to have an ex girlfriend to do photography and travel with, but she doesn't want me any more, and now she has a new man that serves as a constant reminder of what a failure I am.

Now I have nobody. Nobody wants to go explore with me. Nobody wants to go hike with me. Nobody wants to find these secret little beautiful places except myself.

I've been trying to make it work. Every time I want to do something, regardless of whether I'm alone or not (100% of the time, I am) I'll do it. Sometimes I get really anxious that I am alone, because I have anxiety that gets worse when I'm not around anyone else. Sometimes, I really do have a nice time doing whatever I'm doing and spend some time alone exploring. Or talking to my camera, the only person I truly feel will never let me down (the irony being that my camera's glitched many times since I bought it, letting me down and ruining a great cineshoot.)

From an outsider's perspective, you'd think I'm handling the loneliness extremely well. That I'm moving on from my ex greatly by always being out doing things and not staying in all day. 

It just hurts to get to the destination and realize that you're alone. You don't have anyone to share the memories with. You don't have anyone who wants to see it with you, who truly cares about you. That if you died while exploring, nobody would find out. Nobody would care. I may have my camera, but I don't have people who will watch my content. I don't have any ""fans"" or anyone who genuinely enjoys the videos I put out. I might as well be talking to a brick wall.

Just about every night, I go to bed and dream. I dream of travelling the world with the perfect girl. Someone who loves me and someone I love. Someone who'd rather go to Ikea than a fancy restaurant. Someone who would rather sleep in a van than an expensive house. Someone who'd rather go on a morning hike than sleep in. Someone who would rather just drive for hours than watch Netflix. 

I know she's out there, I just doubt she would ever want to be with someone like me. Someone so fucking annoying, stupid, depressed, and awkward like me. I just doubt anyone would want to explore with me. I don't care if it's a girlfriend or just a friend at this point, I just want someone to explore and see the world with.

I hope this makes sense. It feels a bit better. Last time I tried to do this, I fucked up the wording and it made me feel worse, but it really helps to write it all down, even if nobody will read it.

Love, anon.",lonely,"I'm trying to hard to escape the loneliness, yet it feels like I'm surrounded.",2019-12-13 09:20:04

It was the most wonderful dream ever, ive never felt that emotions in my life, its actually making me tear up as i 'speak' right now... It was a fun little dream, of course, all good things must come to an end. Il tell you later what i dreamed about, for now its about who she is: A girl i met from my friends group, new addition to the group, we instantly kicked off and talked and had fun joked laughed and she was always next to me hugged me (that was giving me life energy i need it desperately im almost completely out) and we messaged eachother a lot when we were away and well it all started kinda dying out just as i was trying to ask her out, her intentions were clear and i was about to make it happen i dont remember the last time i was this confident I KNEW it was meant to be... Boy oh boy do i wanna travel back in time and just shout to myself not to hurt myself, because im undesirable and it wont work Needless to say it didnt work i asked her out on a date she rejected saying she was seeing someone .... if i was a friend she wouldve told me ""Heyy there look at this cute guy ive met"" instead ... she just confirmed my grim calculations I was on the verge of greatness i was¬†this¬†close ... She stopped talking to me because she found someone better, obviously, because im worst its easy to find someone else ... I fell so hard i flopped i felt like everyone is against me and the world just doesnt want me to succeed. In the dream i was dreaming of usual hanging out with her, i hug her for a whole minute and we talk calmly about our days at the bus stop while i wait for the bus yes she went out of her way to keep me company at a bus station at freezing temperatures, she is wonderful And in the dream she said i should follow her and be quick so i dont miss the bus, ""alrightyyyy"" i Said and followed knowing it will be something interesting. It was, she ran behind a building, hid behind a gate a hopped out to scare me with a heart shaped chocolates box ""HAPPY VALENTINES"" she said ""wait what its Valentine's day????"" (in the dream apperently not irl) ""what? how did you not know?"" ""i guess because its just like any other day for me, but seeing people happy and loved"" ""Today that changes !!! will you be my valentine??"" I gasped in shock, my heart beat increased i started feeling emotions in the dream !!! "" YEEES"" I shouted while surprised she also added ""I liked you for quite some time, will you be my boyfriend?"" I just hugged her and she kissed me and we went on to hug for a few more seconds. Why? because my heart started to beat faster and my body and brain were experiencing emotions ive never felt in my life, i could feel my real body i started phasing out of the dream in that moment i realized the depressing sad truth- love is for me, just imagination Ive felt the love stricken feeling for 3 seconds after waking up and immediately after that an explosive detonated in my gut, sharp pain, sadness, loneliness, monsters... I wanted to stop crying but it just made it worse, i wanted to go back to her warm hug but it just made me feel worse and worse and worse

i was borderline dead the whole day and still am, i want to fo to sleep

and never wake up

please put me in a dream with her, one so wonderful my brain doesnt wake up from

TL;DR
a friendly girl who was interested in me rejected me because she found someone else and now i feel like shit because i couldve got her love

1798,langnerd17,1576170834,1,"So I had someone I used to call 'best friend'. We've known each other since kindergarten. That's a lot of years (we're 20yrs old atm). Some people tought we were sisters (I don't understand why, we don't look alike, I have brown eyes, she has blue eyes, her hair is light brown, mine is darker brown, but whatever) and some confused us (teachers used to do that a lot lol). That's how close we were.

You'd say we're still really close, right?

Not at all. We were friends indeed, but also rivals. We were the best in our class and always competing with each other. We've always been ambitious. I myself wanted to see this competition  as a friendly one, but she wanted to be at the top so bad that she felt satisfied while bringing me down. Ironically I ended up first on our high school graduation exam, and not her. From what I remeber she never congratulated me properly. I would've been happy for her because I didn't expect myself to surpass her... I actually felt bad for doing that.

We go at different universities now and we don't see each other that often. She is totally fine: she made new friends, she has a perfect boyfriend... I am rather alone and struggling to make genuine friends...

I ask myself if she really saw me as a friend or just as a rival. Because she seems like she doesn't care about me anymore. I did care for her. She insulted me or treated me badly so many times, but I didn't mind it, because she was my closest friend. I could've found someone else, but I just knew no one could have been like her. That's how much I cherished her.

I'm not saying I didn't do anything wrong, I'm sure there were times when I didn't act like a true friend, but it was out of anger most of the times... because of how she treated me...

I don't mean to badmouth her with this post, I just felt sad because she is no more my best friend, yet somehow she still has that place and it feels like she will have it forever...

He accepted my fb friend request and I asked if hed like to join me for lunch. He said he has a full day but thanked me for the invite. That was a big step for me, as i think i probably have mild social anxiety. 

Anyways it upsets me how I made a new friend and hes going home soon. When i got turned down i started overthinking, wondering if he was really busy or of if he wasnt interested. Was I the only one who enjoyed the conversation? 

Now I just feel so lonely and pathetic. Any advice on how to get out of this funk?

Thanks

1815,thrwmetotheedge,1576144606,1,"this is to all those lonely people out there who stick with a toxic friend group who makes you feel shitty, because you think they're the only ones who can tolerate you. for the last 5 years I've been with a pretty toxic group of friends, because I thought noone else could tolerate me. I've had one or two close friendships outside of them that have helped me grow as a person, but I never seemed to be able to apply my growth around these people. so, I realized I needed to leave to better myself. I've only spent a few days away, and let me list some cons and some pros I've found.

Con:
the loneliness does get worse - seems obvious enough, I went from 2-7 people to talk to and play with every day to 0-2
more bored - same as above pretty much
Pros:
Im less toxic - my friends hated who I really was, so I acted toxic around them because they were toxic and it's how I got them to like me. unfortunately this started rubbing off on my other conversations, and was part of the reason I couldn't get friends outside of them. no longer is this a thing
I feel like I can be myself and breathe again - I used to walk on egg shells, try my best to perfectly plan everything I say to weave a web of lies and intrigue just so they wouldn't lose interest in me,but now that I've chosen to leave them, I can be true to me, and not feel ashamed
after just a few days break, I feel like I can talk to some of the less toxic of the group about who I really am - some of my friends are pretty understanding, and I feel like now that I've gone a few days without any toxic input, I don't have any toxic output to give. this means I can talk to my friends how I want to, being nice, stuff like that, and not care.

overall, is it worth it? yeah. even if it's only been a few nights, these nights were my loneliest of all, and I seriously nearly cried once or twice, which doesn't sound like a big deal, but I haven't cried outside panic attacks since I was younger than 10, I don't remember the exact age. but I feel like I stand a decent chance now, of meeting people like me and not scaring them away with the toxicity my friend group imbued in me. I feel like I can go out there and meet nice folk and not feel like a worthless, hateful piece of garbage. 

Take it from me, if you stay where you are now, it probably won't ever change. if you decide to take this plunge like I did, but you need someone to talk to while you're going through your friendship withdrawals, chat me. I'll try my best to be there for you.

1848,hamartiated,1576119687,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm very ugly because I‚Äôve posted my face on another account in r/rateme, most said I don‚Äôt look too bad and looked cute I suppose, just need to shed some weight and grow my hair out. (I‚Äôm a Female.)

But I‚Äôve noticed that I tend to get along with people online than in real life. I‚Äôve been making friends online since as a kid, and had fun chatting with them about games and arts mostly. Nowadays, I‚Äôve gotten some friends from Discord too and they all seemed nice to talk to, even when you don‚Äôt have common interests at all. I guess the only problem are timezones.

However in real life, it‚Äôs really difficult to make friends. A lot of people here really like the most generic things that I really couldn‚Äôt relate or try to talk about. People here that I‚Äôve observed tend to have an unhealthy obsession over Kpop or League of Legends. I mean, yeah I can still make friends with people with no common interests but in here, some are also quite cold and tend to be.. cliquey. I kinda felt like an outcast because I have really.. niche interests. (I like 80‚Äôs aesthetic, vampires except Twilight, Sims and GTA Vice City/San Andreas.)

And I even attempted to make friends on my first day of Tertiary school. I tried to ask about their day to the two girls in the elevator, they gave me strange looks and nodded awkwardly. My texts were ignored when I asked my classmate about their day and wished them well. No thank you or anything. And another girl I‚Äôve attempted to make friends with walked out on me the day after we had lunch together without saying why. These lead me to missing school for a month due to my self-esteem and former depression. 

At my last resort, I‚Äôve even tried making friends in a Weeb club (Was a weeb before.) but instead, people are still cliquey and this one dude even tried talking to me so I don‚Äôt feel left out. Left the club because I got out of my weeb phase and wasn‚Äôt interested in anime that much anymore.

I enjoy martial arts, entrepreneurship, coding, building electronics, listening to classic rock, reading, chess, drones, space, and other things. However there are somethings that make me not fit in. I am a conservative in a pretty liberal school, enjoy things like meditation and other eastern practices that people have made fun of me for liking, I don't really party or like spending a ton of money hanging out, I also read a lot in school and for some people guys make fun of me for this too (no clue why.

1854,GeneralWalters421,1576112815,1,"I guess this is kinda an odd post. I guess it's kinda a rant with a bunch of problems I'm facing. My first semester of university has ended. I made no friends, and as a result have no friends. 

There was a girl I talked a lot with, we used to walk to the bus together, we sat next to each other. We shared a lot of interests, and she was pretty shy which I guess I was sympathetic towards. Anyway, I asked her out for coffee and she accepted, we spend 2 hours there talking and I think it went alright. I guess at the time I kinda thought of it as a date while she did not. I then ask her if I could ""take her out"" to see a movie and she says she is too busy, essentially rejecting me. Afterwards she seemed to be kinda avoiding me, so I essentially told her about my intentions, and that I really did not mean much by asking her. I also told her I had Asperger meaning I struggle with these things. We then agree to be friends and things kinda go back to how they were. 

It's now the end of the semester and I texted her a bit about exams but it kinda evolved into a conversation. She seemed to reply quickly and with long responses. I then friend her on snap-chat, and thank her, but she does not reply to my text. She also kinda ended our other conversation quite early, and maybe I'm overthinking this but I feel like shes kinda avoiding me. My current theory is that she really only saw the friendship out of convention due to being in class together and did not want much more than that. I'm really not sure though, I don't really understand people. I am used to being ghosted and having friendships not last long but it still hurts none the less because I now have no friends over Christmas break. Maybe I'm overthinking this though and should just text her being honest and asking her what her intentions are. She told me shes socially awkward herself so maybe it's just that, I dunno.

Anyway, that was a long tangent but right now I don't have any friends, and even if she did want to be, she's leaving for the break I couldn't really do much with her anyway. 

I am seeking therapy, due to my problems with loneliness and having Asperger for the first time over the break so maybe I can sort things out there. But In the mean time I'm not really sure what to do. I feel unproductive and useless sitting around on my computer all day playing video games and watching YouTube. I could get a job but it would be inconvenient and I imagine I'd hate working in retail. I used to have hobbies, mainly involving game design, 3d animation etc, but I kinda ran out of time for them thanks to school. I also never really enjoyed them that much as I always found them frustrating. Besides, I'd still be sitting on my computer all day. Its not so much that I'm bored, but I feel lazy and unproductive, I'm not really doing anything with my time.

It was hard to deal with other people, but at least at school and at college you HAD to interact with the others. After that, when you're basically on your own, it gets harder and harder. There are days when I don't say a single word. Sometimes I talk to myself, but I haven't anything interesting to say. Even to me I'm boring, I guess.

Since I'm not good with dealing with other people, chose to work from home thinking that would help but it didn't either. Tried a lot of things: Going to social meetings, to several churches, to bars, to parties. Find like-minded individuals. Nothing. I'm not a good functional human being. I'm not someone other people wants around. I only have a cellphone to listen to music. I had an MP4 before but they stop selling those. I have whatsapp installed but I haven't received a new message in eight months. Every time I try to start a conversation only goes for a few lines. Try to ask for their lives, only got single word answers, or an emoji.

Nothing motivates me these days. Not food, nor music, videogames, or even sex (Which was kinda scary at first but now I don't care). I have tons of stuff I'd dreamed of having in my teenage years, but now I don't care about anything of that. I don't know what keeps me getting up every morning.

I soon gave up and become the same old person I was in secondary school. I made new friends and interact with classmates. However nothing seems to click as we have different wavelengths. 
My new friend has lots of friends which I can't connect with due to cultural differences and language barriers. They use their own language to speak with each other. When I am around, I would find myself struck in a some sort of an alien conversation. 
I felt lonely and outcast everywhere. I can make small talks and jokes. However, the other doesn't seem to join in. My new friend is friendly but I can tell she felt bad depending on me for answers. I taught her how to do tutorials but she doesn't seem to learn. She told me she has no interest and just have a hard time studying. I don't believe that as I can see a potential in her if she studies. 
I can get annoyed by her. She tend to ask me questions and want to see my answers. I have a feeling our relationship won't last long. 
I tried to be close as she is the only friend I have in the class. However I don't think I can get on her level. It may be some negative feeling but I can see and feel it.
School is becoming unbearable for me. I want to quit and join another course. It felt like I was stepping on eggshells. I would see my old clique there and feel obliged to run away. I tried to tell myself, ""if they don't care about me, why should I care about them?""
I am able to get through the two months before exams. However, by the time the holidays are coming I realise how alone and isolated I am. Everyone is happily engaging with other people. I tried to go with the flow. Sometimes it was successful and I feel accomplished. 
However, the lingering void in her heart can't be filled. Ever since my clique pushed me out, I feel more alone. There are days where I would cry and just buried everything inside me. 
I can't take it anymore. I feel like I should just disappear and nobody will notice. 
My exam grades are not going well and I am losing my hope. People kept telling me to keep moving on and someday I would find real friends. Having a positive mindset is what helps.

 It's quite long since it spans about eight years, but I'll try to be brief.   
 

I  have this friend that I met in college. My school experience was downright abominable, so I started latching on this new social circle  and the first years went well, all things considered. Still, I've had my  fair share of faults and my depressions acted up in those years. I have attempted suicide twice and this friend that was sort of ""the leader""   of the group, was the first person outside of my family that I spoke about this. It was and still is a very touchy subject for me, but, back then, I valued this kindness. The other one stuck with me and I thought  the world of him, as well.  
 Until,  years, later, he mocked me for it. He used the most traumatic  event of my life to make me feel like shit and then ditched me the  moment I tried  to call him and at least talk about this stuff.  Literally sent me a  text where he said ""we didn't work out"" and  basically ghosted me. I've tried to talk to my other friend, the first one, and others of my social circle in the hopes to have at least  someone stick with me, and see my side of things, but alas, it didn't  work out. Slowly but surely, I was ostracized. The one thing that made  me swear off everyone else was the time I saw on Facebook the photo of a  graduation party I wasn't invited to. My two former friends were there.  I talked with the graduate that  basically told me she didn't want to  make a fuss, so she called the other guy instead. That was the moment I  decided to cut ties with every  one of that social circle.  
 I  wanted to give one last chance to my other friend because I thought he was better.  He once said to me that he was on my side and we'd still  be hanging out. It was a lie: If there was a thing I cared about in the  world was watching the new Star Wars movie (It was The Force Awakens,  to give you an idea of the time frame) with my friend. They all went to  see it on the first day without inviting me...But inviting *him*.  
 I  talked with the offending friend when he finally tried to make amends a  year later, and I accepted his apology, even though, in my heart,   things had changed. He left town for another college and I haven't heard from him since. Nor do I want to.  
 The  other one is on thin ice. I didn't forgive him for his cowardice and the fact that he lied to my face, only receiving a half-assed apology.  It was like he had no idea why he did me wrong no matter how much I've explained it to him. We are civil to each other, but I don't particularly care for him. I haven't in all the time that happened no  matter how many souls searching I did, nor did I forget his indifference.  He once said ""That's how things work in social circles"": I  still think  it was bullshit.  
 My first friend,  the one that I met, and I are aspiring writers.  I've written a few pieces for the theatre, while he works in commercial, and wants to expand to television. Despite involving me in several failed  projects  (I'm no Hemingway, but every idea he had and insisted on never  stuck to the landing, mostly because he's repetitive and trashy. So am  I, but in a  different way.) he never once tried involving me with the  ""right crowd"", the people that ""matter"" if you catch my drift. We don't  talk much and I try to keep my distances since he feels like a dead end.    Until recently: We've started working on a web serial with another  writer, and so far it's been miserable. He has no idea how to direct a   project, the story is even trashier than before, I feel my creativity constantly stifled, not to mention he's never satisfied with anyone's writing, including his own. I've hated this project ever since it started and I'm trying to finish it as fast as I can. Still, I don't know what I will do after this. If it has success, we may be stuck,   working together once again. If it doesn't, I'll be left on my own,   while he tries, again and again, leaving me behind.

I tried going to groups I haven‚Äôt met but it was clear they didn‚Äôt want to talk to me. Those who did I feel we‚Äôre just waiting for a natural time to leave the convo and be with their friends. One girl even told me she just came and said hi because she felt bad I was by myself.

I know that I‚Äôm not bad looking and I‚Äôm in decent shape so it‚Äôs not because of anything like that. It must just be because of who I am as a person? But I‚Äôm just a regular dude that goes to school, has some hobbies, goes to the gym, hangs out with friends, and goes out drinking every once and a while. I‚Äôm not really a club kind of person though.

Most of my buddies are in long term relationships and all of them have a shit ton more experience than me. They try to help me out too but no luck so far. I try using dating apps but I‚Äôve never actually met anyone in person from it. Seems like a lot of people just use it for validation rather than actually using it as a way to meet people. There were a few that I thought could lead to something and I got excited to meet them. But when we started deciding on a day for a date I would get ghosted. 

Throughout high school I had a few crushes but again nothing really worked out or they just wouldn‚Äôt feel the same way that I do. Then when I got to college it kind of was just the same as the rest of my schooling where I would have a crush but it just wouldn‚Äôt work out. So I decided that maybe I should focus on myself and class so that I can set myself up for a better future. And I‚Äôm doing that but man is it fucking depressing. I feel so lonely. I obviously know that I have friends and family there for me and I‚Äôm very grateful for that but it‚Äôs not the same as a romantic relationship. I just want someone to love me you know? Like can yah boy just get a date üòÇ.

1929,anonybuus,1576033111,1,"Just joined the group and it would be nice to get this off my chest. 

I'm a 24F and I've struggled with mental health issues all my life. I've been in therapy for years and take medication to help treat it. I work really hard and have worked my way into a fantastic job. I have a good relationship with my mom and sister, and a close friend. I have some acquaintences I go out with every once in a while. I always do what I can to laugh and make others laugh, and just treat people well as much as I can. I don't think most people realize how lonely and hollow my life can be. 

I've always looked for love in all the wrong places. My first relationship lasted from when I was 16-18 and it was really toxic, we were both terrible to each other. I slept around a lot after it ended to try to find some sort of freedom, but it made me feel terrible about myself so I kept to myself for the most part until I met my next boyfriend when I was 20. 

Once again, it was toxic and we were terrible to each other, but he was physically abusive and manipulative. I left him and started taking better care of myself. My life really transformed for the better. 

I met my next boyfriend at 22. I did everything I could to treat him well and love him, because after all, I had grown a lot from my past relationships and knew how to express love in a healthier way. But history repeated itself. He was a skilled manipulator and was a genius at gaslighting. We broke up and stayed friends until I found out he had been cheating on me the whole time we were together. 

It was a huge wake-up call. I'd been trying my whole life to find someone who would make me love myself, and was trying to find love from the exact same types of emotionally unavailable men. I kept to myself and did a lot of growing up and self-reflecting. But over time, I got really lonely. I realized I needed experience actually dating people and figuring out what I liked. It was gruelling and not even worth it most times. 

Then I met my most recent boyfriend in March of this year. He was so kind and had a great heart. I think I knew from the beginning I didn't love him and wouldn't ever, but he was the first truly kind person I ever dated. We had a lot of good times together and he taught me a lot about healthy relationships, but as time went on, I realized I would never feel happy and fulfilled with him. We ended things on good terms in October. I never miss him, but I always wish him well and know he'll make someone really happy one day.

For a while, I had been excited to work on loving myself so I wouldn't feel so lonely and so I could maybe, one day, attract someone I could fall in love with. 

Then, not too long ago, the loneliness set in. And here I am. I just feel trapped. I know I need to keep learning to love myself and things will work out, but in the meantime I'm still really really lonely. I'm a human and I crave physical affection from another person. About a month ago, I met up with a stranger for a hookup, something I told myself I'd never do. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into, it was safe and a good time, and I knew I'd never see him again. I didn't regret it. I was sad afterwards, not because I felt dirty or like I did something wrong, but because it was over. This past weekend, I was out at a club with a friend, got drunk, and went home with another stranger. We connected, it was a good night. The next day he asked for my number and told me he wanted to meet up again this weekend, but I know I won't hear from him. I didn't even want to date him, I knew that would probably never work. I just wanted someone to think I'm pretty and give me cuddles every once in a while. 

I guess when it comes down to it, I feel trapped with my loneliness. I have a lot of hard work ahead, but don't know how to soothe myself in the meantime. I struggle to make friends. I know a relationship isn't a good idea for me right now and won't be for a while. I don't want to keep hooking up with random people, there's plenty of safety concerns. Dating apps are just the worst and only make me feel shitty. I've been thinking a friends with benefits situation would be nice, but even if I knew how to find someone who would be up for that, those situations seem to just end in one person catching feelings and getting hurt, and that person would probably be me. I guess I just need to come to terms with the fact I'm going to be alone for a long time and make my own peace with it. 

Can anyone relate? 

TLDR: been looking for love in all the wrong places most my life and don't know how to come to grips with the reality I'll probably have to be alone for a long time until I can learn to fully love myself.",lonely,Struggling to figure out how to love myself instead of trying to find someone to do it for me.,2019-12-11 13:58:31
1930,hamartiated,1576033013,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I would love to make everlasting friendships firs. And maybe even a relationship if it comes to that. I don't care how far away you are. A true connection survives all borders.

Something about myself:

Because of certain circumstances I had to grow up at a young age. Because of that I feel kind of out of place with most of my peers. And because of those certain circumstances I deal with anxiety which I find hard to deal with.

My passion is cooking. And besides that I love to read, having conversations, grabbing coffee on a rainy Sunday, watching sports and play some games on my ps4.

I don't feel like talking today, 
Feels like you're drifting away,
No matter how much I pray,
I fear you're not here to stay. 

I just miss you today,
You're slowly losing your way,
You fall in deeper each day,
You say you're finding your place,
I wish it was in my embrace.

Oh how I long it to be,
Just you and just me,
Oh baby I wish you could see,
The damage you're doing to me.

Each day I watch as you drift,
I feel your gaze start to shift,
Away from my face,
Your minds in a new place,
Somewhere I cannot give chase.

I see you smile at your phone,
In the dark all alone,
Where does your mind go and roam,
When you're in bed all alone.

Are you still thinking of me,
Or are you now thinking of he,
Where does your heart want to be,
Nothing left,

But to wait,

1960,dwelleroftheforest,1575998207,1,"Sorry in advance for this dump/rant, but I have to get it out.

To give some background:

I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy who dropped out of college to pursue my passion for permaculture, aka regenerative agriculture. I have one very close friend (like a brother) who shares my interest is and currently working with me to start our farm in the spring. 

Basically I think the lack of meaningful social connection is a result of returning to nature, the countryside, and leaving city and university life (and inadvertently all young people) behind. Farming is a full time job and you are married to the land. As someone who came from an upper-middle class family in the suburbs, this radical life change has quite literally left me in the darkest place of my life.

While I‚Äôm working towards my goal of providing people with quality local food, and rebuilding our over-tilled, chemical-laden dying soil, I‚Äôm lacking the basic human social connections to feel happy in day-to-day life. The average age of the farmer keeps getting older and the younger generations are not interested in hard farm work. This trend is crushing my morale. 

The culture is so polarized... and I‚Äôm someone who falls inbetween. I‚Äôm not hardcore religious, so I can‚Äôt fit into those exclusive groups (I worship nature and my ancestors, which is perceived as satanism) and I really don‚Äôt enjoy mindless drinking on the weekends with superficial people. Not judging, just my experience.

No one seems to give a fuck about the people that put food on their plates. And as a young person, this lifestyle couldn‚Äôt be more rewarding and isolating at the same time. I‚Äôve noticed this problem has begun to take a severe toll on my mental and physical health... I greatly fear the challenge of finding a significant other who shares interest in the lifestyle.

I‚Äôve made the closest connections in my travels abroad, but they are finite as I must return to the farm. It makes no sense to return to university because I‚Äôve been presented with an outstanding opportunity to manage land with the skills that I already have from independent work/study. 

I think I may be better off accepting this, than fearing and suffering the never ending loneliness.",lonely,Unique life circumstance creating soul-crushing loneliness due to lack of meaningful social connection.,2019-12-11 04:16:47

1968,sc1201aurora,1575984939,1,"I‚Äôve got three ‚Äúfriends‚Äù currently. One is on her way out the door by her choice, and I don‚Äôt think even she knows why. One is a bit of a mess, drinks and parties, I don‚Äôt know who I am to him, I think just an oddity really, a bit of entertainment when he is bored. Finally the last one is mainly alright, but a bit arrogant sometimes, I‚Äôd let this slide normally.

None of these friends ask how I‚Äôm going, or ask me to hangout. One lives about a ten minute walk from where I work every day. I know he doesn‚Äôt have much on. One said once to me that I‚Äôm one of few people he‚Äôd actually want to see again. Most days he comes to the university I work at...he has never even said hi. He knows where at the university I work, that I have a really flexible schedule, that I‚Äôm there any day, and that I would move mountains to say hi and chat for a few minutes. And one sent me a text asking me for help with enrollment for our common uni course. She hadn‚Äôt contacted me in weeks and didn‚Äôt ask how I‚Äôm going. Just asked what she had to do and didn‚Äôt talk at all afterwards or during that tiny conversation about anything else.

I‚Äôm giving these until New Years. That‚Äôs it. After that they are strangers in my book. I‚Äôm pushing everyone away and starting over again.

A few days ago I met a guy with a PhD in applied mathematics and he had done his post doc in Mexico before moving back home. It was awesome to meet someone who I could talk to about things I love, and know that they are interested and actually understanding it. To also hear him talk was great, as he knew volumes more than I do, and I learned a lot when we spoke. He asked me if I wanted to come along to a club Christmas party, and said if I want we could hang out and chat about math. This is the first time in a long time I have been invited to something by someone other than my closest support/therapist like friend. If all goes well at the Christmas party, this dude, and my support friend will be the only ones to survive the cull.

But neither of them go to my university or are in my course. I have no one to see everyday. No one to talk to during the week. I get along well with my lecturers and (somehow) share mutual friends with them from outside uni, so I get to catch up with my friends on the occasion they come in to see my lecturer that they know. They happily let me know and invite me.

I‚Äôm going back to plan A, the plan I have had most of my life. Push people away and spend as much time reading and doing work as possible such that I never get a chance to think about fucking lonely I am. I tried so fucking hard this year to make friends. So fucking hard. My last message was a week and a half ago or something, and it was the text about enrollment. I came into the city during the school year when people asked me for help with math or said they were around and bored, all just for human interaction. I pretended to already be there but on a walk to make up for the hour train ride. I made it clear I that I was free to hangout. I forced myself out of my shell and did what I saw people with friends doing, hoping that I would make true friends. It didn‚Äôt fucking work.

It won‚Äôt be hard. I‚Äôll slip back into my old ways just fine. After this I‚Äôll be more skeptical of people, I‚Äôll have less trust, I‚Äôll probably be more selfish and try to do things for myself as opposed to doing everything for others. People who need my help can fuck off. I‚Äôll sit by myself instead of asking if I can sit with someone or saying ‚Äúwherever is fine with you‚Äù if I‚Äôm ever asked where I‚Äôm going to sit. I‚Äôll stop talking in such a social manor that has always made me feel fake and uncomfortable, even though people prefer it over ‚Äúold me‚Äù. I‚Äôll be short and to the point. I‚Äôll call people out on the obvious shit they are trying to pull on each other and me. My feigned patience for the non genuine people will disappear. I won‚Äôt give in and let my desire to appease people in the hopes of seeming friendly override my desires, You want to do the calculations part of the project? Fuck off. You‚Äôll fuck it up like you did last time. You want to design part of the model plane? Fucking cute. I‚Äôve designed and flown these things for nearly a decade. I LOVE aerospace. You said you picked it because it was the most elite engineering and sounded cool. There is no such thing as the most elite form of engineering. That‚Äôs arrogant, and to pick it because you think that makes you a rock bottom piece of shit, You know fuck all about planes. You have shown you will learn fuck all about planes. You can pick the tail number. You will not fuck up my grades because you want to do something in a group project that you are not capable of. And Chloe, you want to come to the hidden little part of the university every morning and rest by my feet, and then let me do they same, and then suddenly stop talking to me? Fuck you. You tell me that you trust me most out of everyone at uni, tell me you are trans, and then decide never to talk to me again (for some reason) when I tell you that my feelings for you remain unchanged and that I still think you‚Äôre amazing and you‚Äôre still my best friend, only to then message me a month after you ghost me, for enrollment help and then ghost me again? FUCK YOU. Either tell me what is on your mind and be honest or fuck off.

And finally, I‚Äôm am not fucking dr. google. You came to see me every morning before math tests and tutorials not because I‚Äôm you‚Äôre friend but because you have no drive to learn and thus have no fucking clue what you are doing, so you come to me, and ask me how to do what we are do everything we will be doing in the tutorial. And I know this is the case, because the one fucking time you knew what you were doing (though I would call a 60% ‚Äúknowing what you are doing‚Äù) you didn‚Äôt even come say hi. You just stood outside the class room instead of coming to where we usually sat together and hanging out with me. You cannot come to me, use me for what I know, and then disappear and expect me to play along, at least not anymore, fuuuuuuccccckkkkkkk yoooooouuuuu, Furthermore, say goodbye to reading my answers during these tutorials so that you can pass.

I‚Äôm doing things for me for once. And it involves kicking you up the ass and out the fucking door.

It feels lonely this couple of years. I wonder if I will end up being alone. Coupled with me being surrounded with people that don't even care about me, its going to be a tough road even looking for a friend.

Its just so hard when the people who surround me are getting married, growing their families or going on trips with their SO's. I feel lonely not going on dates, spending time with that special someone, and most importantly, the *lack of time spent being* ***little spoon.*** Since a very young age, I have been a hopeless romantic, and it hurts me to feel like I am not good enough for anybody. It hella hurts my ego. Being single makes me feel like I am not handsome enough, like my personality is trash, idk.. like my hard work in school/work/other life ventures goes unnoticed. I guess I just crave having that PERSON romantically who is a best friend. it is just so cute to me. I always dream about cuddles/traveling/inside jokes/ just being in a relationship with a person that I can GROW with. 

What I don't understand is why I feel like Im not given a fair shot in the dating pool. I go to a four yearUniversity of California, I am ambitious, not only with school, I work and have a job. I am pursuing a music career and a I have 200 thousand streams worldwide with my music. I eventually want to go to grad school and get my masters. I lead a bible study, and I am very intentional with my relationships, often trying to put myself in positions of mentorship to others. I would like to think of myself as caring. I just don't know what I can do different. I am ready to give off my love and receive it also. Im tired of hearing  ""You have to be happy with yourself before you can be in a relationship"" or ""you just have to wait"" or "" it comes when you least expect it"" lol.

So I don't know. It hurts and I get lonely. I often think of what the hell is wrong with me. Is there something wrong with my personality? Am I just not good looking? Am I not enough (even sometimes) These are things that often cross my mind when I think about singleness.

1977,Catstretto,1575976068,1,"So I'm 18, a black girl about to go back to community college. (I previously dropped out of my old junior college bc I had a mental breakdown and I was depressed from loneliness yikes)
I'm starting to think maybe I should stop thinking about boys. I took this comment my mother said to me personally.
She said I should work improving myself and my life. Like unrolling in college, getting a job, improving my looks with skin and body care, and honestly...that doesn't sound too bad..
I already have alot of problems when it comes to boys. 
‚Ä¢ I think about sex alot and love isn't just sex, it's more that.
‚Ä¢ I like personality but I feel like a I put looks on a high scale too. Like I wanted a guy that's good looking and has a good personality. Which I very rare.. not like I'm worthy enough for a good looking anyways
‚Ä¢ My type of boys ( lanky toned white, latino, and asian boys) would generally not like me. Knowing me a black girl, men usually dont like black women bc of that dumb stereotype.. ik not everyone is like that but that's rare ngl...
Plus there's the fear of losing my partner in any way. What if they cheat? What if they get bored of me and fall out of love? What if it's not real?
Like idk if I could handle that at this age.
I also struggle with texting I will forget a about a comvo or I'll fall asleep then I'll feel really bad.. 
I cant flirt or talk to ppl on General and I have low self confidence/self esteem so yikes..
So I think I will put thinking and trying to talk to guys on a box on the shelf tbh.

I(24M) am doing a two-year degree in japan and this semester it has been quite lonely. Im holed up in the lab, I dont live in the dorm anymore, and I have no classes with the other international students. Most of them are short termers (6months to a year). I have made no friends since October, when they arrived.

Two weeks ago I was sitting in a bench in a packed cafe, when a nice (23M) European dude, doing a medicine-internship thingy for four months. I enjoyed the conversation and when I shook his hand before  we parted, I said ‚Äúwas nice talking to you.‚Äù Which he replied with ‚Äúwas it?‚Äù it a surprised (not rude) voice.

He accepted my fb friend request and I asked if hed like to join me for lunch. He said he has a full day but thanked me for the invite. That was a big step for me, as i think i probably have mild social anxiety. 

Anyways it upsets me how I made a new friend and hes going home soon. When i got turned down i started overthinking, wondering if he was really busy or of if he wasnt interested. Was I the only one who enjoyed the conversation? 

Now I just feel so lonely and pathetic. Any advice on how to get out of this funk?

2008,hamartiated,1575946000,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2019-12-10 13:46:40

2015,adventurer309,1575940637,1,"i'm sick of trying with people and having nothing happen. i don't expect anything from random people i just met, but when people make it seem like they wanna be around me and that they actually like me, it hurts realizing that they actually don't. i tried to contact a therapist a couple months ago after being told to set up therapy with someone in their office. after leaving three voicemails and not getting a single response i just gave up. i'm sick of putting in effort to make my life better and trying to improve myself. i feel like maybe i have trauma but i don't know from what, exactly. i can't stand even the thought of being touched by people, especially men. i've never been abused physically by men (as far as i remember) but i have always been mistreated by people, men and women. when i was in middle school i was bullied everyday, online and at school. i tried to get help. i reached out to multiple people, adults who i thought would care. i reached out to people who are supposed to be my family, teachers, i reached out to even the bully's mother and i thought she would do something. i was wrong because she told me there was nothing she could do. i was called a freak a lot but that's the least of it. i was told that when i died they would have a party on my grave. i was given weird looks. i remember hearing people talk about me behind my back. anyway i don't know why i hate being touched so much but i'm repulsed by it with certain people and all men especially. i HATE when men touch me and they always seem to get in my personal space, including men who are probably in their 50s, 60s, or older. i'm so sickened by it. i can barely think about this stuff without feeling extremely angry. an older man who i work with recently pressed his arm against mine and asked me if he was too close or however he worded it. he said it jokingly with a laugh and i kinda laughed uncomfortably and said he was too close. talking about this stuff physically hurts and i feel as if i have a fear of being touched. it might not seem like such a big deal to people but it's a huge deal to me. i've been hurt by so many people even when they didn't seem like they would hurt me. i can't trust anyone. i have lots of boundaries too (not just physical ones, emotional ones too) and maybe people sense that or something and just don't wanna get close to me. i don't know honestly. i'm just sick of trying. i know this post is all over the place and i don't expect anyone to read this or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

i'm just sick of this. i don't see the point in anything. but i'm also sick of being nice. being nice gets you walked all over and i know it from experience. i usually am nice to most people but if they rub me the wrong way or do something i don't like that's it. i've always been mistreated by people so whenever someone does something i don't like i stop being as nice or associating with them in any way. i have so much anger and i know it's an issue i have. anyway that's it i guess

Hey guys,

I suffer from depression, anxiety, ADHD, and Seasonal affective disorder. This time of year, something that helps me is trying to give back and to show others how we can fight this.

I would love to share about my depression and my goals and how I am working to get on track with them.

I'm  and over a year ago I joined a my new school and had the most mortifying moment of my life that crushed my confidence. 

I was already close with some of the people there so I was easily introduced to everyone. I had actually dated someone who was widely considered one of the most attractive girls in the school (no flex). 

As I sat down to have lunch with a large group of about 10 people some dude just immediately said ""this is the guy that dated \[her name\], must've had zero options"" and his neighbour responded with ""pretty sure she only dated him because she felt bad for him"" and an.

No one said anything for a while as I turned into a tomato then returned to normal conversation . I left the group embarrassed and hiding tears. That moment led me down a dark path. I just wish I could look past it.

'Friends' that would just use me for food or money and then expect me to just be a silent follower to them. Like a lackey. Due to them, I've basically learned to just sit quiet and not bother interacting because who would listen to me? I'm just the girl that nods and grins, always listening to their problems and pretend mine doesn't exist because it's all about their drama.

Now I'm an adult and working and people occasionally speak to me, trying to get to know me, and I'm too awkward to continue or reciprocate, basically isolating myself from my peers because I'm so used to people not caring what I have to say or if I was even around.

I've made some good online friendships but it's not the same. There are so many days where reading their words on the screen isn't enough. Where their smiley emojis and eagerness to voice chat isn't enough.

I just want an unconditional friendship where I can finally open back up again. Someone I can call and talk to whenever I'm in a depressed mood. Someone willing to go to the movies with me or even just chill on the couch with while we play video games or something. 

I just want something real and not be desperately clinging to my virtual friends, waiting all day and night for their 'Online' light to come on. I can't be selfish like that with them. They have school and work and family. I can't rely on them to temporarily fill my lonely void until they have to go offline again.

I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl who has had a couple relationships and gets an okay level of interest, but fuck do I feel unloveable. 

I have PTSD from childhood abuse, which makes me anxious and freaked out sometimes. It‚Äôs getting a lot better, but it‚Äôll always be there. My father instilled in me that I‚Äôm worthless and that love only comes with verbal and physical abuse and that I was a mistake.

I also have body dysmorphia, so basically I feel super irrationally disgusting in my skin. This was a result of a period of extremely rapid weight gain that had to do with a health issue I have. I pretty much watched my clothes not fit and my face sink in and my body bloat up. I feel very uncomfortable in my skin, sometimes to the point where I feel like never leaving my house, or where I want to pull my hair out and panic. It feels like shit. Before the weight gain I felt attractive, and I‚Äôd do anything just to get that confidence back. But instead, I‚Äôm stuck in a body I don‚Äôt feel correct in.

I find myself getting humiliated a lot. It started in high school after the weight gain, but I get a lot of negative attention just for being both 6‚Äô2‚Äù and overweight.

The thing is though, I love myself. I am an incredible person, and even though I‚Äôm sensitive and a mess low key, I have the biggest heart, and even though it breaks easily, I am at the core, a beautiful person. 

So, I take dating seriously. I am a romantic and I want nothing more than to love. I just feel like I‚Äôm never going to find someone anymore. I think that I‚Äôm just too much to handle. My last bf made me feel like a huge emotional burden, and I loved him fiercely. I gave him everything and he just loved to knock me down and made me feel like all my insecurities should be insecurities. Dating since him has been rough. I find guys telling me I‚Äôm great, but they don‚Äôt want a relationship, or some other excuse.

in front of others, i tend to be the stoic, apparently uninterested and very quiet type. quiet to the point it looks like i dislike anyone who tries approaching me. the only way one can get me to say more than two words is striking up a conversation about anything i'm passionate about, and so far only one person has been able to do that. 

he's one of the coolest people i know, and i wished i could be friends with him for a long time. the thing is, he's exactly the same type of introvert as me, so i had to gather up all my courage and made sure he didn't hate me before making the first move. i'm really glad i did, because he turned out to be way less intimidating than he looks. we even hung out a few times, although we're still barely friends due to my crippling social anxiety and feeling like i have to walk on eggshells because of my fear of messing something up. sometimes i really can't tell if he thinks i'm okay or an absolute idiot because sometimes we just don't talk for weeks. 

this time, he didn't say a single word to me since two weeks ago and i don't know why. i was sick during that time, so i had to skip quite a big amount of school days and that contributed to the lack of interaction. at first i thought he was mad at me for whatever stupid things i said (not sure what) but he doesn't seem that mad at me and i'm pretty sure about that. though i still can't figure out how to fix this, considering i have 0 topics to talk about and i only ever speak up if i have important things to say. i was thinking that maybe he thinks i'm avoiding him but then i realized he wouldn't actually care about that. what the hell do i do?",lonely,"i never show my interest towards anyone due to my fear of it not being mutual, and it's taking a toll on all my attempts at a social life",2019-12-10 00:27:12

The funny part about it is, there‚Äôs one focal point I was trying to make. We all have lives, literally everyone gets busy. But if you delay a response to someone with consideration and an actual reason, it helps. A handful of people agreed with me when I said that if we just got a little briefing beforehand, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt at all. The ignoring doesn‚Äôt hurt us, what essentially eats at us is the incessant wondering as to *why* we were ignored in the first place. My point being that communication is key. I honestly don‚Äôt care what people think, if we are friends, you OWE me consideration and respect. And the fact that people think wanting a little assurance is entitlement highlights the very problem we are trying to address. Everything is a repeated cycle and the people in the comments who think their own *friends* aren‚Äôt entitled to a response are part of the problem. I don‚Äôt care about the downvotes ‚Äî that post has helped me identify a lot of shitty people. There are people who joined this subreddit just to hate on others, people who aren‚Äôt even ‚Äòlonely‚Äô and just literally want to hate on the people here ‚Äî and I was able to locate them. Win-Win situation. If over 500 people can come together and grieve a probability and even pacify each other in a completely serene environment bereft of judgement and prejudice, my purpose is fulfilled. 

This sub is a safe space. Or, it should be. A few people in the comments of that post were telling those who agreed with me to get lives and hobbies. We‚Äôre *lonely* people, that is why we are here. If we had these things you speak of, we wouldn‚Äôt be posting on this sub, would we? 

My point is, don‚Äôt judge other people here. Especially if you don‚Äôt relate to their struggles. There are some comments that were made that made me wonder why the user is even *on* this sub. To beat up lonely people? I don‚Äôt get it. 

All I have to say is, communicate. That‚Äôs literally all it takes. Be a better person. 

And lastly, if you think that as someone‚Äôs friend, you don‚Äôt owe them the slightest bit of respect and consideration with your actions. Then I have nothing to say to you. A lot of you seem to think this way, makes me wonder if you would keep the same energy when *you* start getting treated like that. 

I will continue posting my struggles as a loner here and whilst criticism is welcome, I will no longer engage it. This is a safe space, not a courtroom, so don‚Äôt judge anyone. We‚Äôre all here because we need somebody. And as long as I‚Äôm able to reach other people like me and we end up feeling better about ourselves, the incentive will remain. 

To each their own.

But it basically is like living alone but with the added ""benefit"" of being pestered on a daily basis by people who ""care"" about you. The silence is deadly and overwhelming me with a hatred for the place I cannot quell anymore! I hate my family (what little I have left of them, anyway), I can't stand the one friend I have who is kind of a sperg, lol. Sometimes I have stupid arguements over and over in my head with the same relative (let's say stepmom) of mine until I go insane with anger. I used to fantasize about doing horrible things to her a lot, which I would never really, do. The worst thing I would ever do to someone would be never to talk to or see them again, honestly. I've just lived with anger my whole life pretty much and I'm burned out. Tired of wondering who I care about is going to die next. 

Tired of feeling like the only people left of my family aren't worth a damn to me anymore and should do the world a favor and join my dead kin. I didn't even go to my uncle's funeral a few months ago because I just don't care about anything anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself by now is simply out of compassion for those who I know will grieve my passing as well, but I'm running the risk of getting to the point of not even giving a fuck about that anymore. Even worse, I sometimes think about how killing myself would be the ultimate slap in the face to them!

I hardly ever go anywhere because I don't know anyone and am too depressed to feel like it's worth it to go anywhere, except for once and a while I'll just hop on my bike and just go somewhere until I get bored and eventually come home. Every time I keep saying to myself ""This'll be the last time I come home."" ""This time I'll just wander off somewhere and go wandering like a tramp."" Sometimes I just go to bars or something similar to have drink so I'll feel relaxed enough to try engaging someone in conversation; anything really. I'll chat with anyone just to feel some human interaction. It's always temporary, though and inevitably like some spell or curse of solitude has been put on me I always end right back where I started. Right back here alone in this room where there is nothing and no one to comfort me. Nothing but the sound of my own thoughts. I wonder if I'll die here one day alone, and will there be anyone left to check if I'm alright?

I'm not suicidal anymore which is a big win, but I'm still not happy. I've always been a very introverted person, and the depression really made it worse. I used to think that my depression was making me lonely, but it's obvious now that I need someone. I've never really had a friendship. Sure I was nice to people but I'd never reached out outside of school or work and nobody has reached out to me.  I've never so much as held hands with a guy before.

2099,tomorrowisbetter19,1575872537,1,"Dear reddit,

I hate seeing couples.

I hate seeing people smiling and holding hands and hugging and being intimate with each other and just living together.

I know how selfish it is, I just can't help but feel envy that these people found someone to love, someone to hold, someone to share kisses and memories and stories and hopes and dreams with

I can't help but feel envy that others have someone to fall asleep next to, and someone to wake up with, and someone to talk to throughout the day, and someone to look forward to seeing when you get home.

Someone to share laughs, memories, struggles, gifts with

Someone you can let your guard down around, with no fear of judgement, and be your true self without holding back a thing.

Someone who sees what you want and wants to help you work towards that. Wants to work towards that with you. No matter what they think about it, sees that you have a goal and turns that into their goal as well.

People keep telling me to get out more, and just do things alone, and spend time reflecting on myself and improving myself, and being the best version of me that I can be.

It's great to do stuff and be out of the house, but it hurts going to all these places I've wanted to visit and explore without being able to share the experience with that special someone that will never be by my side.

It hits differently when your smile turns into tears rolling down your face as the beautiful mountains and forests in the distance turn into another reminder of how you'll never find love, how I'll never find love.

Maybe I'm crazy, but if I'm crazy, then I'm a crazy lonely idiot.

2106,ClumsyPikachu,1575866490,1,"I haven't really talked about this to anyone and it just feels heavy tonight so I want to talk about it. Sorry for the wall of text.

I don't have a lot of people close to me in my life. I have acquaintances and I think people like me well enough and I like them well enough, but there havent really been any people that I just click with and feel like I can talk about anything with. At the beginning of this year I made an R4R post just saying that I was looking for some sort of connection, friends or whatever, and got a decent amount of responses, but one led to a really close bond that I frankly wasn't even expecting to actually happen when I made the post. We just instantly were able to so easily talk to each other and our personalities meshed so well together and it just felt seamless. Over the 7 months that we got to know each other we really bonded and we quickly fell into a routine where we had long text conversations throughout each day, spoke on the phone every night, and spent most weekends playing games together for somewhere between 5-8 hours most sessions. We became incredibly close and I really felt like I had found someone that I was supposed to find. We never actually met in person because he lived in Europe and I lived in the US, so I was already aware that the likelihood of things working out was probably small and the first few months I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and him to ghost me, just because that's a common experience I have had with any guy I even slightly connected with where they seem to really like you up front and then, for seemingly no reason, decide to never speak to you again one day. This never happened with him and I began to let myself relax and get attached to him because I knew clicking with someone like this was rare for me and I wanted to pursue it and at least try. 

He was a smart guy, 31 years old, stable job, and I just thought he was mature while also being more emotionally intelligent than I had experienced with other people. I was constantly impressed at how open he was and how eager he was to seriously talk out any issues we had and I just thought he was a really good person who I had truly integrated into my life. Not one day went by where we didn't talk.I leaned on him for emotional support at times and he leaned on me and I was so thankful to have him in my life. He often told me how important I was to him and had told me before that he wasn't going anywhere. 

Towards the end of August, he just... stopped speaking to me really. I had graduated college in May and been job searching, and had recently been interviewing for a position that I felt I had a good shot at and he was so supportive of the process and asking me for updates on it and wanting to know all about it/tell him when I knew whether I had gotten the job or not. I thought I was going to get to go through this whole process with him on my side and then one weekend there were a few unanswered texts from me, which hadnt happened before and when I reached out he just told me that he was sorry he dropped off the radar and was dealing with some stuff, which I believed and told him to deal with and not worry about it, focus on himself if he needs a few days or whatever,  He told me he would get something on a specific date out of the way and give me an update. The update never came. I send a couple of short texts just expressing concern over this time and Two weeks later I get:

""Sorry, honestly not been great. I know I'm off the grid but that's the case for everyone- friends and family too. I don't mean that as an excuse but I do want to emphasize that I'm not singling you out and ghosting you. I hope you're doing really well. I apologize for all of this.""

That was the last text he ever intended to send me. I replied to it with concern and asked what was going on, but he never replied back to that, though I could see that he was online many times after that. Finally, end of September I just send him a text saying that I'm really hurt by all of this and that he never even told me properly that he didnt want to speak to me anymore, that I felt tossed to the side with no explanation and he sent me a short formal text just saying he was as forthcoming as he could be and it's not just me, it's everyone. That's the last time I heard from him and I still don't know what happened. 

I just wished that I hadn't have let myself get attached to him like I did. I really clicked with him and cared for him and then all of the sudden it was like he didn't want me in his life anymore. It's been over two months and I'm a little better with it now but I'm still so sad that I just lost that person I bonded so well with and told everything to and I don't even know why I lost them, nor did I get a proper goodbye. I find myself wondering what he's up to, if he went on that trip he had planned, etc. and I felt really sad initially that he had kind of become my pillar and I didn't have him around when I went through this life change recently. I got that job and moved to another state where I don't know anyone and I found out right about the same time that he disappeared so I never got to tell him and him disappearing kind of compounded the loneliness that I feel since I don't have anyone here.

That is until a few days later he stopped texting me consistently and never talked to me again. I tried getting in contact with him but every time he'd just answer pretty much saying

""Oh sorry I've been really busy :\""

Even though I follow him on social media and see his new posts with all him and all his friends. Also keep in mind he'd only send a text once a day so it'd take a week to finish a conversation... I finally just put my foot down and asked him if he's still seeing the movie with me, in which he replied the same thing he always does

""Oh sorry i might be busy"" even though before he seemed so excited to see it so it didn't seem likely that he'd just flake.

My ex, when she broke up with me, she told me that she felt her youth was wasted on me, that she wanted to experiment and live. I understand the feeling to a degree but I can't help myself, I feel hurt.
I gave my everything; countless sleepless nights, many poems, a good amount of kisses and hugs, all the love in my heart and my every last breath of life in myself to make her happy, to help her not commit suicide and at the end I just wasn't enough for her, I wasn't the girl she feel madly in love with, I was just a boy that she used to fill her void, maybe she loved me for a while (an almost three-year long meanwhile). At least she's happier and alive with a good girl, that's something.
But I can't deny that I was hopelessly in love, head over heels kind of love. I thought that my path was developing my passions through my love and now I feel that I've lost my path and myself with it.
My mind can't stop beating me with that damned phrase as her voice sounds on my head saying it. I can't forget her, her smile, her passions which where similar to mine, and her smile, the true one. I've tried to let her go with my memories of her but they are tied deeply within my soul., maybe because she was my first true friend.
If I want to stay alive maybe I just need to suffer with these thoughs until the time comes, I just hope that I can stay sweet, I don't want to grow bitter. I want to love someone as much as I loved her but I don't want to hurt someone for not being her, for the moment my heart is still hers and I can't do anything about it, neither she can, so I'll just wait.
I just have to live and maybe if I hang long enough on my silver thread somone else, maybe a friend will come, I'll just hold myself as my fingers bleed. I'll try. I wan't to try, I want to stay  here but my body is starting to feel numb, I hope I can stay.
I hope that the moon shines bright tonight, maybe the gaze of it can alliviate a bit of my pain and give my fingers a bit more strenght.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Everything about her is intoxicating; her smile, her brown eyes (the freckle just to the left of her iris on her right one), her dark brown hair, her beautiful hands, her goofiness, her laugh, her artwork, her kindness to every soul she comes in contact with, her ability to dive deep into conversation and discuss feelings and insecurities without any fear of feeling judged or scrutinized, her ambitions and goals, her openness to life and trying new things, her empathy, her hugs, her perfume, her lips, her style... I could go on.. But her heart belongs to another. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a great guy or she wouldn‚Äôt be with him. I‚Äôve met him. Shook the hand that gets to hold hers. He seems genuine and kind. 

Our art spaces were right next to each other in the studio all semester. We spent countless late nights working on art, introducing each other to new music, sharing techniques and inspiring artists. We connected on so many levels. We‚Äôre both divorced. Both have no hard feelings towards our exes, it just simply didn‚Äôt work with them. She‚Äôs 25. I just turned 33. Both of us had great paying jobs that could‚Äôve easily turned into careers, but our passions for art and the desire to teach it one day led us back to college to finish degrees. 

She invited me to come be another roommate at her house which she owns. (I moved in my parents‚Äô basement to save on rent, but it cost me my social life) She‚Äôs talked about how great it‚Äôd be to set up creative space in her home so we could create together more often. She‚Äôs talked about how her dogs and my dog could live together and we could take them on adventures. I want so badly to take the offer...

But I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of him coming over, then we all say, ‚Äúgoodnight,‚Äù as they close her door for the evening as I close mine across the hall, my heart in my stomach.. imagining the intimacy they get to share. I just can‚Äôt do it.. I couldn‚Äôt handle that. 

I wish I were enough. I long for the beautiful relationship we could share. She‚Äôd never feel the way jerks have made her feel in the past. I‚Äôd support her through it all, creating together for the rest of our lives. Maybe I‚Äôll have a chance one day. Maybe I won‚Äôt. My heart is hers and she doesn‚Äôt know it.

We hit it off immediately and talked every day about literally everything, from our lives and our depression to stupid memes and jokes. Once we talked for 17 hours straight. We said we'd never get sick of each other. We said we'd meet up one day. Now we're barely talking and can't even get through a conversation without pissing each other off. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I started talking to a girl from my school. We got super close, super fast. We spent hours talking about our days and sending funny jokes and cute animal photos back and forth. Then I fucked up, did something stupid for a stupid reason and now we're barely talking either.

A couple weeks ago, I met someone on r/MakeNewFriendsHere. We clicked so well on our very first conversation. I loved it so much. I wanted to know him better, to be good friends, but now he's gone and I don't know what happened. Maybe I did something wrong. Somehow I always do something wrong. If you're somehow reading this, I'm sorry for not messaging you back. I had work to do but I shouldn't have ignored you. I should've been better.

2157,skepho,1575837123,1,"Here‚Äôs a perspective that sheds light on how isolated I feel. I thank anyone who takes the time to read it. It‚Äôll mean so much to me. 

Here is my daily routine:

My alarm goes off 2 hours before my work shift. I then lay around for 30 minutes and then get up to take a 30-45 minute shower in which I sit down in said shower and look at all my notifications and check the weather (I live in Alaska and I need to know how cold it is to dictate what I wear and if I need to warm up my car). I then spend the rest of the time getting dressed and grab something easy to eat which is usually just lunch meat and a yogurt. I then fill my back pack with a soda, v8 juice, and fruit juice and take a yogurt to go. At work I sit at a desk and check my email for company updates and customers requesting supplies and I play on my phone until I have a customer. My play-on-my-phone time is usually watching YouTube for music and video games and sometimes an inspirational video. I do this for 8 hours and I spread my backpack food over the course of that day. After work I head home, take off my shoes (which are laced shoes that I turned into slip ons) and take off my layers and my pants. I hate wearing socks and prefer to walk around the apartment barefoot with a t shirt and my underwear. If I feel gross I will take another shower otherwise I pour myself a drink like whiskey with coke or a coffee with cream and sugar and then microwave a TV dinner. After that I turn on my tv and check to see if my online friends are on so we can play Destiny 2 together. If not I go to YouTube to see if I haven‚Äôt missed anything or to put on a gameplay video of the games I love. If nothing is there then I turn on Netflix to see what I can find. If not there then I rotate to checking if my online friends are on then to YouTube and then to Netflix. I repeat this behavior until it gets late or until I find something I like or if my friends hop on. I then fall asleep and repeat this Monday through Friday as since those are the days I work. On Saturday, I wake up and immediately take a shower for 30-45 minutes and then turn on my PS4 to repeat my game, YouTube, and Netflix trifecta until it‚Äôs late or something sticks. On Sunday, I wake up, take my 30-45 minute shower, and get dressed in comfy clothes. I go to the laundry room in my apartment complex and start the wash load. I then set a timer for 45 mins and then I leave the apartment and go grocery shopping and collect my mail for the week and then when I get home I put all my groceries away and then rotate my laundry. I then set a timer for 50 minutes and then turn on my PS4 and repeat my game, youtube, Netflix trifecta until my timer sounds off and then I get my laundry, put it all away or dump it on my bed (depending on my depression and loneliness) and then return to my trifecta until it‚Äôs late or I find something I like. And then the week restarts and I repeat the process. 

Some random things that sometimes changes my routine:

On Saturday, if there is a movie I‚Äôd like to see in theater I use the Regal app to preorder my ticket and I always buy a matinee. I‚Äôd do my normal morning routine as if getting ready to work (wake up two hours before, 30-45 min shower, etc) and then go watch the movie and then return home to proceed with my PS4 trifecta. 

Sometimes if I have a craving I‚Äôll go out to eat once a week (usually on Saturday) and I always go somewhere I never been to. 

This is the blueprint of everyday. Yes in all the in between moments I talk to my coworkers and I talk to waitresses/ waiters and the people who work at the movies. I talk to my online friends when we get a chance. But still I feel completely lonely, isolated, and depressed. I have broken many routines and I done many spontaneous things in my life to reach out and meet people and try to find that one meaningful connection but nothing sticks. I‚Äôm 29 now and I‚Äôm no different than the old man who has outlived all his friends and family. I feel lonely and no one really cares to get to know me. I just want a real connection and I honestly feel it‚Äôs too late for me. I‚Äôm not exactly bad looking but I think my problem is that I‚Äôm awkward and weird. My face looks unapproachable even if I‚Äôm in a great mood. Just a constant resting bitch face for a dude. So my ‚Äúaura‚Äù or ‚Äúvibe‚Äù or the impression I give is that I‚Äôm someone who can‚Äôt be interrupted even though that is further from the truth. I want to be interrupted. I want my life to change for the better if that means a connection is involved. I just wish I could be seen despite my isolation.",lonely,The monotony of my life.,2019-12-09 07:32:03

Throughout this year I have made a few mistakes that made me lost some people in my life, one of them my ex which I‚Äôm very much still in love with.

I look back at circumstances in my life, the current situation, and how I feel. I felt I understood things too late. Be it love, life purposes, what matters.

I‚Äôm in my room, alone and not a single person wished me. Quite rightly so, I deserved it. I don‚Äôt think I was ever a wonderful person.

The loneliness is unbelievable and sometimes it makes me think if there is any purpose left. I feel extremely detached and as though I have outgrown every single false hopes that my family or internet gives. Like you do feel death isn‚Äôt such a bad thing after all if it came early. Since it‚Äôs inevitable.

2165,SnovvDrop,1575831498,1,"Some context: here in my Eastern Europe country, women literally see Tinder as a ""get married"" app.  98%+ of the female accounts you will see over here are along the lines of:

* looking for a relationship
* looking to get married
* I'm NOT going to have sex with you (whatever the hell that means)

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right?  But it's so crazy difficult, it almost feels like a lottery.  Fitness trainers, doctors, video chatters, lawyers, financial _experts_, etc.  People who I can rarely establish a deeper connection with, as I'm a bit more of a nerdy type, enjoying spending long hours programming or playing video games.  Being 5' 7 doesn't help at all either: here you will get judged a lot harder for it, almost immediately being subconsciously rejected only because of your height (I wonder if they would think the same way if they could notice my dick at the same time they noticed my height!).

So with the last date:  I only started with knowing that she's pretty (looking back, she is better off without writing anything in her profile, actually).  We hit it off in the first days, somehow enjoying talking to each other.  One week passed, we'd messaged each other frantically each day (finding out about each other, jokes, couple memes, etc.).  Then December 1st was closing in, and I proposed I'd drive to her town so we can spend it together.  She was clearly not having it and excused herself for not feeling well and put me off with ""let's meet next Saturday"".  I accepted: maybe she was genuine.  Next Saturday was yesterday and she started ignoring all my texts as I remembered her about it, throughout the whole day.  Made me feel like a complete idiot, I've no words to even describe it.  I stopped messaging her and moved further.  I don't care if she writes back - this is unacceptable.

So yeah, back to square 1 now, but I'm still optimistic.  It's only a matter of time before we find each other and hit it off in the cheesiest way possible.  Every breath that I take will be just for you, as well as every inch of me.  Surprised and disgusted?  Well, don't be.  If you haven't heard of a romantic and horny hard-worker before, you have now.

The fictional characters she's interested in though are all guys. There have been a few conversations that gave me some hope that she might be at least somewhat attracted to her gender but it might be wishful thinking. Plus her family is catholic so I'm not sure if they would accept it.

We've been hanging out a lot recently and that fills me with so much happiness that I cry a little bit when I get home. I'm not even sure why exactly it's just a little overwhelming maybe and it feels like to just release some of the emotions I've had to hold on to throughout the day. Of course we just hang out as friends, often in a group but  I grew up without a single friend due to a number of reasons  so honestly having people to spend time with feels really nice. 

I still feel a little lonely even among them sometimes because the friendship doesn't really go beyond memes and what not but I am making an active effort to get closer to my new friends. I sometimes wish I could tell them about some of the stuff I'm going through but I don't know if they would care or if I should burden them with that. They might think I'm too much of a downer and decide to cut me out of the friend group. I don't want to lose them though because I have always wanted friends.

I develop crushes easy. Maybe I just mix up my feelings of appreciating someone's company with romantic feelings? And my sexual feelings are just all over the place in general so naturally it would bleed over to this as well? It's fine because I have a very big bottle that I shove all these feelings into, and only let it spill a little when I'm completely alone. I think writing this even feels more like I'm writing in a journal, since I am just alone under some blankets listening to the rain, it doesn't really feel like I'm sharing something with someone but it also doesn't feel like I'm wasting my breath just talking at nothing. Posting stuff like this is a little therapeutic. I used to post things to vent but I like the way reddit is formatted a little better. 

I will probably never tell my crush how I feel about her, and eventually my feelings will fade and I'll probably focus my romantic attention on someone else and develop a new crush. I'm not really in the right mental state for a relationship right now anyways, I need to work on myself a lot. I think I have found an aesthetic that works for me, and can style my hair and dress in a way that flatters my skinny body but I have no idea what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like. All I have to go off is a series of awful/abusive relationships I have been in and what I have seen with my parents where my mom emotionally and physically abuses my dad, me and my brothers. I made the mistake to center all of my will to live, goals for the future and self worth around one person because I thought that was love, but it was just unhealthy and set me up to be even more devastated when the people I held so highly and basically worshiped turned out to be not very good people. I want to work on making friends, doing well in school, improving in art and music, and moving towards my goal for the future, with or without someone by my side. 

I need to not let myself become so obsessive over one thing or one person because it makes me neglect working on my goals. Even though I'm probably no good for a relationship right now I still want to meet people that could potentially one day be something. I think that's fine? I think that will also help me not get too hung up on somebody that I know will never see me in a romantic light. I want to appreciate them for the good friend they are, but my mind is a little clouded with loneliness and sexual frustration. 

One day I really would like to find somebody to genuinely care for me who I can spend the rest of my days with. That person is probably not going to be my crush.

It's painful. I'm not even at fault. Just because I still live with my parents, since I'm still pretty young and have no own income yet. Basically I'm not allowed to talk with my friends on discord, like I used to a few years ago. Now I'm just always getting mad at myself whenever I see that my old friends can enjoy all these fun things without me. The worst part is, that I can't form new friendships, because school is a pain and I lack the ability to find time to do things with friends. I'm also scared about getting scolded, whenever I do something like this.

I‚Äôve never actually ranted about this entire conundrum to anyone but this sub feels like somewhere I can air it out to people who won‚Äôt judge and maybe people who can relate. 

I‚Äôm out of high school and I have no friends. Online or IRL. Judging from the title, I‚Äôm unhappy. 

In 2018 I graduated from high school and right after that my girlfriend moved to New Jersey and it totally broke me. Considering I had been dating her for two years at that point ‚Äî and everything we went through as a couple ‚Äî it shattered my being. I couldn‚Äôt even live. Moving on, I met a girl. She seemed perfect, loved comic books, discussing stuff, video games and everything. She turned out to be a narcissist. Now the thing about narcs is that 90% of the time, they are very influential people. I met this girl on Instagram ‚Äî and I realized she knew almost all my friends from high school. Including my ex-girlfriend. Long story short, our breakup was nasty. We had so many fights, where she would insult me and completely disrespect my way of reasoning and then POST the disagreements which her goons would then agree with her, making me look even more stupid than I already feel ‚Äî it was terrible.

After that, I was completely... broken. People who have had run-ins with narcs know how this is. I didn‚Äôt even know who I was anymore ‚Äî she made me hate myself. Then I realized she started getting closer to all my friends and was spreading BS about me to them ‚Äî all the while I was on my own trying to regroup, I didn‚Äôt even speak about our split at all. 

Then after that I realize all my friends start to switch up on me. It‚Äôs like, they valued the opinions of the popular girl over someone they went to school with for six years, some, a decade and more. 

We text, they leave me on read and just...disappear. I haven‚Äôt spoken to anyone of them in almost half a year and it‚Äôs crazy that none of them even remember me or try to check up on me. Then there‚Äôs the one that told me my dysphoria was irritating and blocked me. 

Basically, all my friends left me because of the narc and as a result of that, I don‚Äôt know how to interact with people anymore ‚Äî most people I text fade away after a week or two. It‚Äôs so absurd that at this age, I have absolutely no friendships active, and I‚Äôm not even exaggerating. 

I‚Äôm really unhappy, ugh.",lonely,Where do they sell interaction?,2019-12-08 16:12:03
2209,profetiffany,1575781375,1,"A little but of background:
I'm in a friend group of 11 people, but this story only deals with 8. And in our group there are two relationships. The first is between two people we'll call E and A. I'm very close friends with both of them and they are two of my favorite people. The second are J and M. I'm kinda close with J, but she seems to get annoyed by me for being ""judgy""(no one else says this to me), and no one is very close to M(except for J) and that's because he doesn't seem to care a whole lot about the rest of the people in the group.

Now the story:
Tonight, one of my friends, W, asked if anyone wanted to do something tonight. F, S, and I all said we would. J said she would be willing, A said she would be busy until 7, E said he was busy, and M read everything, but said nothing. So F, S, W, J, and I all got together and F, S, W, and I all thought it'd be fun if we went downtown and played music on the street. J didn't want to and said we could go do that and she'll find something else (A said this too, but over text). So The three guys and I all drove downtown and found a spot we thought was good. We were just playing whatever and some people even donated, which was a surprise. I didn't play too much cuz I'm not the best at trombone and I just got my wisdom teeth out last week. We were really getting in the groove until J, M, A, and E all showed up on a double date. J was joking like ""hey play something for us!"" and we had just finished a song, so we were trying to get another. She continued to criticize our set up and how we weren't doing everything (so much for me being the *judgy"" one). E at least came up to me and complained about how he was planning on doing homework but he got roped into the double date, which cleared up why he said that he was busy. 

The whole encounter just irked me the wrong way and I didn't know how to feel. I felt angry that none of them tried to figure out something else for everyone to do together because if felt like they didn't need the four of us that went to play music. I also felt lonely because I get lonely a lot due to the fact that I've never had a serious relationship but nearly half of my friends have. I hate these nights where I go home and I know that the people who I'm friends with are living the life that I want to have, but it feels like I'm doing something wrong or I'm not good enough to deserve that kind of relationship.

I'm also worried that J and M are distancing themselves from the group and that M was only part of the group so he could date J.

I get lonely very easily, even when I'm surrounded by people who love me. It feels worse that when I had no friends at all because now I feel guilty for still feeling this way.",lonely,I feel lonely when I'm surrounded by people who care about me.,2019-12-08 16:02:55

In TV shows, books, movies, billboards. Its kinda surreal. I've been feeling a bit better lately in the fact that I still don't really have friends but material things have given me more joy than usual. I used to think I was depressed but now I think I'm adjusting to being alone. High School is, as always, torture, but now I think I've been building skin if that makes sense. I'm becoming more confident and of my own person though I still am indeed alone. Which is what I want to really talk about.

&amp;#x200B;

Loneliness- its a strange thing. Our brain suffers from lack of contact with others even if that contact may hurt us in the long run. I think its a bit of a sick joke really. You were born this way or that, and now because of looks or personality you are shunted. I'm not going to lie and say that assholes shouldn't or aren't going to be alone but I am going to speak my mind. Im not a big statistics guy, but from my view people in general are lonely. Even those with siblings or in popular friend/social media groups seem unhappy. Think about it, 30-40 years ago, to quote Austin Powers: ""Love was free in the 60's, baby, yeah!"". And god was he right! Just 40 years ago the fucking military flew out to Woodstock not to drive the hippies out, but to give medicine! And food! To support the cause of friendship and happiness, at the government's expense no less! But now with subreddits like this growing every day I think we are in an epidemic. A disease of loneliness  and it spreads everyday. I think we do it to ourselves, but in that I think we can find happiness. Not just with ourselves, but with others like us who have been forged through pain and hardship. r/lonely now has 92,300 members with more joining everyday in some hope of contact with people who know the pain they have gone through. And I hope to whatever God is up there that we unite. The internet has separated us, turned us into sheep who eat into consumerist bullshit on the daily as we scream for more, more, more. Gluttony and greed is killing us, but there has been improvements. Subreddits like this are growing, medical technology is advancing, and war/political stress is generally at an all time low though it may not seem it. And so I say to all you lonely hearts out thee, Stand Strong! Life is short guys. And I realize I may just be one man screaming into the void but if not, let us stand together. As humans, as people, not the social media-obsessed, gluttonous and insensitive sheep that the world makes us out to be.

Anyways I managed to get her number (asked her irl) and sent her a text about class which again she would ignore. 

After a while I felt a bit disrespected and would completely blank her in real life when we see each other. You can tell she would look my way to say hi but I wouldn‚Äôt even give her eye contact. This continued for a few days, and one other time I felt like I overdid it because we were talking in a group and I was flirting with everyone in the room (mostly girls) without acknowledging her, and you can tell she was visibly upset. I felt bad, so the next day I greeted her and sent her a message saying that this is our last year in college and I don‚Äôt want you to have a bad impression of me, I wanted us to be talking and become friends etc. This time she called me on the phone and was really nice to me, saying that the reason she wouldn‚Äôt respond to me or any other guy she knows in college over text was that she has a boyfriend. I made sure I was understanding and told her no problem and that I would delete her number. All was over on a good note, right? 

Well to my surprise she texted me out of nowhere a few days ago telling me that i‚Äôm a great person and that if I need anything for classes etc she would have no problem replying.

Don‚Äôt worry i‚Äôm not deluded, she most likely hasn‚Äôt broken up with her bf and I haven‚Äôt even re-saved her number, but I asked a female friend and she told me that maybe she told her boyfriend and he was okay with us texting about class, which I find confusing. Why would he be suddenly be okay with her having my number and asking about class if he literally isn‚Äôt okay with anyone talking to her over text?

I'm a 28 year old male, graduated medic, even kinda good-looking, but lonely AF practically all of my life.

Since I can remember (6 - 8 year old) I've never had any significant friends, when I was at elementary I basically always was alone, I can remember that when I was at home and the phone ringed I've always run to answer hoping being some school partner to invite me to his home or whatever, never happened.

At mid school same thing, just add some bullying to my person. When there were ""team works"" I'll end up most of the time alone cause no one wanted me in their team, if there was a ""party"" or something similar I never was invited at all.

At high school I actually got some good friends that took me into consideration and always invited to hang out and so, to this moment, the high school has been the happiest moment of my life, but as soon as it ended and we all went to university and I being the only one who went to med school, we all took different paths and I and quickly went back to the same isolation.

I could never make a single true friend in all of my years of career, everyone had so much fun, hangin out, getting laid, had some boyfriend/girlfriend, I didn't.

Since a few years my days consist of the same routine: wake up, go to work, go back home, stare at my computer screen, sleep, repeat. No one ever invites me anywhere, I do invite some people from time to time, but I know it's gonna be a negative answer or I end up being ignored, but hey, at least I try.

I want to kill myself since about 10 years, but the only reason stopping me is my mother, the only person that truly cares for me and the only person that I truly care for, if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't even mind having a phone since basically she is the only person to text me or call me, she often asks me why I don‚Äôt go out or have a girlfriend, I always say to her that I just like to be alone (I don‚Äôt want her to know that I have no friends at all and not a single women wants nothing to do with me).

The only things that used to give me some joy were my hobbies: playing videogames, reading books and my growing collection of manga, but not anymore, I just keep doing them to kill time, not because I actually enjoy it.

I‚Äôm in a point of my life that I just can‚Äôt feel anything anymore, not even sadness, frustration or despair, I‚Äôm kind of a robot, doing everything in automatic, waiting for the moment that I just stop working.

I have thought of going to a psychologist but I don‚Äôt think it will help anything, I‚Äôm a sociable person and people tell me that I‚Äôm ""cool"" and so, but even so no one want to interact with me, so I don‚Äôt see how it'll help me get friends which is my base problem, what am I supposed to do?",lonely,A little everything about my life,2019-12-08 08:41:46

2248,Evan_Speigel,1575752819,1,"I found this sub not even 5 minutes ago, but I assume there are people here who are like-minded, so I'm asking for opinions. I will start with some background on myself and my life;

I grew up being bullied constantly, and as a consequence of that I became spiteful towards humanity as a whole. I refused to speak to almost anyone, and whenever somebody said something to me my first thought would be ""Oh, these morons again..."". The truth was I was hiding my inferiority complex behind this anger and hatred, trying to avoid facing my greatest fear; social interaction.

Fast forward to high school, and I was the happiest I have ever been. I liked everyone here and I was a little bit popular in my age group, and I got along with almost everyone. I finally felt like I had poeple to speak to on more personal matters, and I was contempt with my life, for the first and last time.

Now, all my friendships seem to be very temporary. Almost always, I, trying to be myself, or somebody else, trying to start s***, will break off these relationships. I know that this is because I didnt make friends at a younger age, and so I have nobody who has been through the thick of it with me, but it still hurts to see someone tell lies about me, or stir up discontent beetween me and those who I consider to be my friends. Recently, my friendship with a person ended very abruptly after I commented on one of their posts that they were beautiful, and that person said that I am wierd, and that I should ""fuck off"". I was shocked to read this, I dont see anything wrong with what I did, but then again I'm not caught up with social standards, perhaps it was wierd.

In any case, I have chosen to stop trying to make friends, knowing I will lose them. It is from this decision that my question stems; how do I become enough for myself? How can I go throgh life alone? There must be somebody out here that has achieved blissful loneliness, someone who has accepted their conditions and moved on to achieve things in life.

I've always been surrounded by people, I was pretty popular in school and university, but I've never been anyone's first priority. I just lost my 2 good friends. The person who I'm really closest with is my boyfriend. A few months ago I made a friend and we confided to each other over a couple drinks that we've both been very lonely and we feel like we bonded with each other very quickly, we even consider each other our best friend now.

Even with my boyfriend and my one (new) best friend, I feel very lost and empty. I try to not get too clingy to people in my life while at the same time fearing abandonment because of my distance I keep between myself and others.

I have never kept a good friend for longer than maybe 3 years. I really want to keep this new friend in my life so I don't just have my boyfriend, but I feel like I'm walking on eggshells because of how anxious I am after my 2 other friends just abandoned me.

I don't have anywhere I'm really going with this. But I do have this festering dread building up about the holidays approaching. It's always 2 weeks of being completely alone. Everyone goes home to their families, and I have no one.

2254,rom1bki,1575750086,1,"I‚Äôm not gonna pretend we have it harder than women but I feel the particular difficulties we face as men are rarely brought up. 

We have to be confident, showing our emotions is a sign of weakness. We have to stay strong in the face of rejection. We‚Äôre taught to suppress our emotional pain even though we feel it just as much as women do. 
Women may be biologically built to be more social so that helps them as they grow strong links with their friends as teenagers, based on oral communication, but still, conditioning is huge in that regard. 
If we‚Äôre depressed we just need to suck it up and we don‚Äôt have as much support as women do. 

As a man, nobody cares about you. You have to earn people‚Äôs interest and respect through your actions, whereas women have an intrinsic social value. We are made to believe we‚Äôre disposable and worth only what we do. 
Most of the time nobody gives us compliments or show any desire towards us. 
Oh and we‚Äôre supposed to know how to fight or run the risk to lose the respect of both sexes if the situation arises. 

It‚Äôs ok for women to treat us like shit in the dating scene. Women will laugh at men, ignore them etc just for asking them out. Probably considering that it must be easy for us to do so. And we‚Äôre in general treated with much less kindness than women. It takes a huge amount of courage for an average man to date. And dating apps are the most depressing thing for us.  

We pretty much go through life unnoticed. 
We have to live up to high expectations. 
Women often make us out to be sleazy and gratuitous (in my experience women talk about sex just as much if not more than we do). We fear being creep-shamed, or worse, need to be extra careful around children. We also often worry about appearing threatening or making women feel uncomfortable. 

Please don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love women and I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt have their own shit to deal with : financial inequality, name calling, slut-shaming, being patronized, molested, over sexualisation, body image issues (which is something that we, too have to face) and general misogyny. But what I‚Äôm saying is that women, even the most pro-equality, don‚Äôt grasp how little society in general cares about the average man. You sometimes make us feel we‚Äôre so privileged and in some areas we definitely are but please open your eyes to our reality. You may be objectified for sex but we are objectified for our utility. 

I post here because more and more I feel that being a man plays a major role (maybe even seminal) in my almost life long depression and that men (in a very general sense, obviously there are exceptions) experience a unique level of loneliness. 

I‚Äôm not saying all that out of bitterness and resentment for being ugly or invisible to women,  on the contrary I‚Äôve often been told I‚Äôm handsome and they seem to appreciate my company but I do suck at approaching them as I guess deep down I‚Äôm terrified by them as I‚Äôve always put them on a pedestal and felt insecure and inadequate as a man. so yeah, I‚Äôm extremely emotionally and sexually frustrated.

Every Friday and Saturday night I sit bored as shit in my house. Hmm I wonder what my friends are doing??. I open Snapchat to see if people are doing something. And what do you know, 4 of my friends are all together somewhere. They invite me to events and parties just enough so I still stay around. It hurts because I use to be invited to everything people did, and often had to reject parties and events because I was too busy. Now I take every opportunity I can to hang around others outside of uni.  I just wish I knew what I did wrong that pushed me away from everyone. I keep telling myself I‚Äôm fine to try and stay positive. I never realised the extent of my alienation from my friends until my mum asked me ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you go out anymore. You use to be out all the time. Now you only leave the house for uni‚Äù. 

I just finished my uni exams and I have 2 and a half months of holidays. Idk what I‚Äôm going to do.  My friends planned overseas trips. They only invited me when another person had to cancel, but by then it was too late to book plane tickets. 

It‚Äôs strange to me. They act completely normal when I‚Äôm around them; Like we are close friends. But it‚Äôs like they forget who I am once I leave. Do they hate me? Idk it could be true or it‚Äôs just some inner anxiety that‚Äôs built up in me.  

I don‚Äôt even have the support of my own family. I feel alone even around my own family.  I feel different from my own family. It just feels like there‚Äôs nobody I can really talk to. My best friend from high school is probably the closest person I have. We have deep convos late at night about life. We both have a pretty rough family situation and can relate emotionally on a lot of levels. But he never messages me just to ask how I‚Äôm going. I usually do about once a week and send him memes and jokes we both find funny.

I‚Äôm 36.  I‚Äôve been divorced for 5 years.  My ex wife has been my only real relationship. She was emotionally abusive the entire time and destroyed my already low self esteem.  

I‚Äôve been largely ignored and rejected by women my whole life.  They love being friends with me. They don‚Äôt want to date me. 

So. I‚Äôve been single for 5 years. Haven‚Äôt had more than a 2nd date in about 2 years. 

So far this year. My best friend got married, my other best friend has his first child Sith his wife. Another close friend bought a house with his wife and child.  My ex wife had her first child.  I found out two days ago, another friend is now expecting with his wife.   None of these people have any time for their sad, single friend with their new lives and families. 

I just injured myself two weeks ago, so I‚Äôm in a sling for weeks.  I was getting into better shape. But that‚Äôs now out the window because of my shoulder injury. 

My landlord is selling my apartment and gave me 30 days notice to vacate.

Everytime I've opened up in the past I have ended up hurt by it. I don't have any truly intimate relationships/friendships and most of my interactions are very surfaced level. The only instances of true intimacy that I have felt were felt during sex.

I had started talking to a girl that I have known for a few years who I knew found me attractive and we were close enough to have emotional conversations. It only made sense to try and pursue a relationship with her. She would be close to me and then not, cycling through these stages. Most recently she had been very close to me and I created a bond with her that I haven't felt in years. And then she pulled away, but hard. 

I opened myself up to her and allowed myself to be ""real"" with her. I feel so broken by it and I hate it. At this point it isn't even about her, I feel as though everytime I become attached to a girl she pulls away from me. It seems that each girl who abandons me does so with a callous disregard for my existence. Sort of as if I was never a factor in their happiness.

I feel like they hate me and when I ask them if they do, they say they don't but I'm pretty sure they're lying. 

I haven't had any friends for a while now. It made me really sad at first but I got used to it and now I can't even image myself hanging out with other people. It's better that I'm alone. I can't hurt anyone and I can't be hurt by anyone. 

I've started to leave people just because I'm afraid I'll hurt them or they're gonna leave me. People replace me easily. I'm not important to anyone and no one is afraid of losing me. It hurts to know that I need them so much but they don't need me. 

My ex friends ruined my self-esteem and that's why I haven't made any new friends. I'm too afraid to talk to anyone because I'm scared they find me annoying. I've tried to socialize but I just have to accept the fact that I was meant to be alone. 

There has to be something wrong with me because if there wasn't, I would have friends. People would want to talk to me and they would notice I exist. I don't think my ex friends lied to me. They were honest and let me see how bad person I am. I'm not someone people want to talk to. I'm not someone they want to be friends with. I'm someone they try to avoid. 

I've learned that when people say they don't hate me, they don't really mean it. They really hate me but they think it's better I don't know that. When they say I'm not bothering me they just want me to go away. They say they're there for me but I'm just a burden. 

That's why I won't talk to anyone. I'm not even sure how long I'm going to keep going. I have no reason to make friends when I might end my life soon.

My first best friend started to have feelings for me, didn‚Äôt feel like coming out, and abandoned all contact. Now she blasts rainbow makeup and pro gay slogans like she‚Äôs been hired by leprechauns for advertising. I miss her a lot, and I loved her to pieces, but now... I just... can‚Äôt. She‚Äôs MLM-hun type and it just rubs me the wrong way.

My second best friend assaulted me at a party once, and took a long little trip down boozy drugsville. He also held me down and taped a mask over my head and blew smoke into the mask when I didn‚Äôt want to smoke weed. I... honestly would have rather been assaulted again. I couldn‚Äôt hate him more, but I miss ‚Äú8yo him‚Äù.

My third best friend is the father of my child. There are times when I miss him so fucking much, I‚Äôll call him up when she‚Äôs having a nap for bullshit reasons. Like... college homework. And he plays the guitar for me to just keep me company. Mind you, I can barely get ahold of him to talk to our daughter, let alone just me. It really hurts. We had a crappy relationship, and a bad falling out near the birth of our child. A part of me hates him... but I love him too. It makes me cry to think about him.

My best friend now is my current partner. I love him to the absolute moon and back. He can be a dickhead too, but he‚Äôs still an amazing person. But... he‚Äôs my only friend now, and that‚Äôs unhealthy. I feel the need to distance from him BECAUSE he‚Äôs my only friend, but I feel like that would hurt more than it would help.

2286,Ponkotsu_Ramen,1575703279,1,"In case you're not familiar with natural selection, the basic principle is this: the more successful you are in your environment, the more likely you are to survive and pass on your gene by reproducing. This increases the frequency of ""positive"" traits and decreases the frequency of ""negative"" traits in the population. 

I have been thinking about how this may apply to my life. I feel lonely due to my lack of social connections with others. Or rather, I am not as connected as I would like to be. I have no friends who I can see in person and I have never dated or been in a relationship. This makes me frustrated and sad because I want to think that I deserve to have the ""normal"" social lives that many other people seem to have. You know, having friends who they can talk to about common interests and frustrations. Having some kind of dating success like a high school or college boyfriend/girlfriend. And then of course getting married and starting a family. It's not some privilege reserved for the elite. It's common and very widespread. You don't need to be super smart, good looking, or incredibly nice and selfless to do it. Otherwise it would not be very common.

But then when I think about this in the context of natural selection, maybe it is not a bad thing. I mean if I die alone, without ever raising children, then my socially unsuccessful genes won't be passed on. I won't be polluting future generations with my genetic garbage. I would just be getting what I deserve because I am simply not appealing or not good enough for other people. I guess it won't be so terrible if I let my negative traits pass away with me. My brother has a longtime girlfriend and some good friends in his life. He will probably continue my family lineage. Maybe I just had bad luck with the genetic lottery. Perhaps all of the rejection I have received in my life is a good thing because society doesn't want people like me to populate the world in the future. That's not to say that I can't enjoy my life and do good things in my lifetime, but maybe I should stop deceiving myself with the idea that someone could fall in love with me and would want to have kids with me. But these are simply my thoughts about myself. I think Social Darwinism is heartless and don't believe that others should be treated like that by society. But I think that I deserve it because I can' t demand that I be treated with compassion and understanding in spite of my shortcomings. I don't know, I have been going through kind of a rough time lately.

If you have no friends and/or no significant other, I am not suggesting that you don't deserve to have a full and happy life. You should go try to form those meaningful connections you desire and you might just succeed! You never know when you might meet the right person who will accept and appreciate you for who you are.

I just want to hear from her again, but i know it‚Äôll be so long before then.
To fill in, i confessed to my best friend of how I felt, and she left before I could finish speaking my mind. But that‚Äôs my fault, i was never good at my emotions. We used to talk everyday, had shows we watched together, gifts we shared with one another, and helped each other through our own personal lives. Her smile is honestly something spectacular. She has the dumbest jokes, and every time she sang it always makes me smile. Then she‚Äôd look up every time and say ‚Äúhaha sorry‚Äù as i reply ‚Äúencore‚Äù or ‚Äúno I love it.‚Äù

This week there was a lot of firsts for me with my emotions:
It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve actually cried aloud, and for three days straight i couldn‚Äôt stop crying. Going to classes was harder on me than anything with the weight of the week.
I found myself at an empty chapel, talking about everything. I grew up catholic but didn‚Äôt continue with my faith. I still don‚Äôt honestly, but it was quiet. No one was around and I spoke aloud. I talked about my stress of finals, my anxiety of her leaving me to cry, and how I missed her so much. I kept looking around like I was looking for her, but she wasn‚Äôt there. I ended up sitting there for at least an hour. Half speaking my mind, and the rest in silence.
She still important to me in my life. I always try to keep hope that she‚Äôll want to talk, but I want to cry at the thought that she may never want to hear from me again.

I might just use this community to vent how I feel at night for a bit as I always feel the lowest at night. Until my loneliness goes away.

2295,okthoughts,1575693265,1,"I‚Äôm 19, a sophomore in a liberal arts college studying a major that I know I will soon transfer out of. I tend to be referred to as the isolated artist by friends and family, yet I have many friends and my whole family loves me very much. 

I am not a sad person and laugh a lot. 
I spark interesting conversations when the chance allows it and I am, maybe, too ambitious.
I have passions for things like nature, creativity, and learning, and my biggest worry is myself.

I am often praised for my accomplishments but I feel as though everyone loves me more than I love them. 

I sometimes wish I was born uglier so people didn‚Äôt expect me to be the person they expect me to be.

Friends don‚Äôt expect me to join them when they go out clubbing, yet they still ask. When we do go out I have fun, but often feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time with momentary pleasures, wondering constantly about the legitimacy of the fun I am having: The drugs and alcohol simply making uninteresting conversations and nights seem as though they aren‚Äôt.

I think too objectively and I have something wrong to say about literally every single person in my life, including my parents, grandparents, cousins, and even my dog for fucks sake. 
This is not to say I don‚Äôt love them, because I do, but the only people I can‚Äôt say something wrong about are strangers.

The good weighs the same as the bad because I have no faith.

These people love me so much, yet so often I think to myself that if it weren‚Äôt for the context of our relationship, we would probably not talk.

I often wonder how I met my friends, and deem it accidental, but who the hell do you not meet by accident? 
My objectivity doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, yet it entirely does, but plagues my thoughts.

Sometimes someone interests me in a certain way and I‚Äôll find myself constantly searching for what is wrong with them. Those who I haven‚Äôt found something wrong with, I probably haven‚Äôt spent enough time with.

My best friends are all people I once hated for entirely rational reasons. My two last best friends, one of which was my girlfriend for almost 2 years, I now see as relationships that were started in hatred or fear of something, or love for an artifical pleasure, like smoking.

I often tell myself that the reason I draw is because I am entirely dissatisfied with reality, yet I very much love my life. I know I am very selfish and privileged, and even saying that, I am weighing my goods and bads the same. 

I love dreams, and I have made myself believe that this is because real life feels more fake than the world inside my head. 

How can I know if I should fully trust this feeling, or constantly fight it? Do I become who my body is telling me to be (a lonely artist, who searches endlessly for self fulfillment) or do I mold myself to care more about others and pleasure myself with things that feel meaningless?

I don‚Äôt know and need something, or someone to guide me towards a better version of myself. I think of spirituality, but even there I can‚Äôt help but see an incurable selfishness. I know I am depressed, but have gone through the rollercoaster and seen it in others that I can hardly call this a depression.

I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years now.

I used to have a lot of friends, go out with them, hang out. 

But I became a bad friend, start replying to messages, stop hanging out because I was spending all of my free time with my boyfriend. We broke up several time, and each time  I had less friends to go to.

We're still together now, but I have absolutely no friends. I'm social, I talk with people, have a few work acquaintances but I lost my best friend, she moved on.

2308,NuclearSteeze,1575681048,1,"Maybe the best way to start this is a backstory about me (sorry for the long read):

I am a 23 year old guy. I moved to the USA from India when I was 2 years old (so I am a u.s citizen and westernized in every way other than the fact that I can speak Hindi and eat Indian food more often than the average American).

I have always been a loner. I tried to be cool and make friends in elementary school but I would always get teased and bullied. It was worse in middle school. So, in high school, I became quieter. I was still teased, but not nearly as much, because I would just keep to myself, assuming nobody would want to be my friend and that I would just have to deal with it. Well, as a result, this led to me being totally socially awkward and underconfident into college as well. I should also add that this whole time I have been having a porn addiction. I went to a good Engineering college, but I had no social life (like 0 friends) the whole time and an awful GPA (literally just enough to graduate but I failed so many of my major courses. I literally barely made it). Of course, you gotta have a good GPA to get internships and to get a full time position, companies look at your experience (I had no internships other than this research thing I kinda did at the university).

So, when I graduated last May 2019 with a bachelor's, at 23, I had the following:

1) no friends
2) never been on a date or any form of intimacy with anyone 
3) I was broke and lived with my parents because I was unemployed



Obviously, I was thinking about ending it all (my professor said I should speak with the college therapists because he thought I might have depression. Maybe he was right but I never have been one to care about my mental health. I just tell myself to stop being so pitiful and deal with it). I had 0 confidence in myself for a whole 6 months as I made futile attempts searching for a job. I ate so much that I became medically obese.

Anyways, something really good happened for me recently. I got a job. A job that is damn near my dream job. Like it works in the exact industry that I have dreamed of working in since a young boy (but gave up on thinking it was just a fantasy) and it pays well (not 6 figures or anything but still pretty solid). I have been working for about a week now. It's a ton of work (more than 40 hours a week for sure) but I really enjoy it even when i get mentally exhausted. 

But here is the thing, despite having this great job, I still have this void in me. I think it is because I still don't come out of my shell. I still hate myself on some level. My team's director invited me to go out with some of the employees for happy hour and walking around downtown. I told him maybe, but I dont think I am going. I think I am just going to lay in my room being a loner as always. I just assume the worst. I have tried going out with people, but I always just end up being kind of left out because I am afraid of involving myself in anything because I never feel like I am truly welcome. 

And of course, I do want intimacy. I just think I will be one of those few people that will have to die without it (some people just go on without some things) but it makes me sad thinking about it. I do want a girlfriend, but I have never asked a girl out because I am too damn self-conscience (my body, my lack of a exciting personality). But I am a 23 year old virgin who has never kissed or dated so I feel like my ship has sailed since obviously women my age would want a a guy with experience (sure, there is that 0.001% that would be cool with it, but how on earth would I find them and, since there are so few, chances are high we might not even be compatible). This will probably sound dramatic, but I feel like genetic waste with a worthless manhood some times....not all the times...but some times.

One thing I am working on is getting some hobbies. I will have to work some more to get the funds to do them, but that shouldn't be long. But here is the thing. No man is an island. I really was hoping that this lovely job would completely fill my void, but it hasn't. Because it's the weekend now, and I am back to my self-pity shit. Also the place I live in and work is a crowded downtown area, so I am just a loner in a crowd. I don't know how to build relationships, platonic or romantic, with anyone. I'm just ""cool"" to be around occasionally I guess.

Anyways, I feel like I am rambling now. So basically I want to know how to get out of my shell and stop feeling pathetic.",lonely,I don't know how to fill this void in me,2019-12-07 12:10:48

2317,hiineedlove,1575673299,1,"I see posts about not wanting to talk to people because you have to text first alot. I'd never really experienced this until recently, and i immediately realized what I was doing wrong.

Successful texting is an ongoing conversation about whatever you two want to talk about. Not one person asking question after question. Not a hello wyd how are you good bye. Successful texting is when one of you falls asleep then continues the conversation in the morning like it didn't happen. If you have short bursts of small talk texts with people that end in a goodbye and have to constantly start up again, you're doing it wrong. 

That's probably why you constantly feel like you're ""texting first"" because you're probably also the person who let the convo die in the first place. Think up a topic and discuss it. That topic will naturally lead into other topics and you'll think of things you'd like to talk about while you talk to each other. If it doesn't, *that person doesn't want to talk to you or about the topics you like*. There's no such thing as having a friend who you always have to text first. 

I've never understood that part either. How could you fw somebody who doesn't want to talk to you? Like most of my good conversations leave me hungry to talk to those people even more, and likewise for the other person. If I have a bad conversation with somebody, I sure as hell won't be ""texting first"" because we both know the conversation sucked and we don't vibe. 

And it's weird to me to see r/single or r/lonely making posts asking for people to text to ask them stuff to get to know each other. You get to know a person not by asking people directly about them, but by discussing a topic and reading their reactions to certain things. The way a person is flows out of them when they speak passionately on a topic they care about. 

Find a person who cares about a topic you care about and talk about it with them. Then if they feel the same about the topic and respond to the way you feel about the topic positively, you've just made a friend who you can talk to about that topic. Find at least 1 person who shares feelings about all the topics you care about and boom ur not lonely anymore. Then you are free to find people who feel the same way about multiple topics, then you find that one special person who feels the same about all the topics. That's your best friend, your wife, your husband. 

Sociology isn't rocket science people. The real problem is when there are no topics you care about at all. Don't simply identify with this. Prove it. Get into every topic known to man before you claim you care about nothing. Most people who say this have tried 5-7 popular things and don't like those things. Maybe ur a person who likes things that are different. There's a ton of people like that, don't trip just be who you really are and find those people.",lonely,"""Texting first"", and how to talk to people",2019-12-07 10:01:39

2330,Pausole,1575662121,1,"I'll try to make it short but I'll probably fail again. TDLR at the end.

Anyhow, I turned 30 a few months ago. I've only had one real relationship in my entire life. It was abusive and it ended up with her committing suicide. Honestly my child and teen years were awful. Slowly but surely it turned me into a broken constantly depressed person.

I somehow found a job a year ago. One day a new coworker came to start working there. I grew a crush on her. A big one. We grew closer over time and she's become a friend. Honestly she's my best and only friend nowadays.

But I'm obsessed with her. Literally. And I have been for months. She turned me into an even bigger wreck. 

Whenever I have days off it hurts because I know I won't see her. We see each other after work sometimes but nothing happens because supposedly she's not into dating coworkers. Might be a lie obviously, and this creates another shitty situation because I'm done working there in 3 months. This means I won't see her on a daily basis anymore. This means maybe she will make a move on me but most likely she won't. So I'll just be stuck with not seeing her anymore. 

We're completely opposite on many things. I'm a rather conservative and quiet guy and she's exactly the opposite. She's even bisexual which is something I never found attractive. Politics wise we also disagree on many things, but I never talk politics with her because I'm afraid of losing her if I start being honest.

Unlike her I'm lonely as fuck and I have been for so long now. She has a really wide circle of friends and people she has casual sex with. It hurts. It makes me think like a bad person. I wish she was as lonely as I am. I know it's an evil thing to wish to someone you love, but I cannot help it.

She's the only woman who has been giving me attention for so long. I know she likes me a lot, but it's in a friendly way. And the way she is and the way she behaves with me hurts so much.

When she talks to me about what she's doing in her free time it induces a cognitive dissonance inside my brain because as I said I'm fairly conservative and frankly stuck up but she's not at all.  She's also had many life experiences, much more than me even though she's younger, and I wish I could have lived a life like her but I couldn't because I have always been lonely and abused. I wish I could share my experiences with her but I don't have any.

There's also the problem of sex. I didn't have much sex in my life. I'm really inexperienced about it. She's not at all. I've even lost confidence because I spent so many years without having sex at all. I don't even know if I actually have a sex drive anymore.

At work and with me she sometimes has this weird mix of friendliness and flirtiness. She gives me cute nickname, says I'm cute, wants me to tell her that I like her, she playfully acts like we're actually dating each other and she says she finds it ""funny"" that other people believe it. Other coworkers and customers (we work in a shop) have told me we were cute together and that we would go well together. Some ask us if we're in a relationship when we got out together sometimes.

And it hurts as fuck because I know she'll never be more than my friend. I also know I wouldn't be as much into her as I am right now if I wasn't so fucking lonely. I don't even know why she spends time with me because my life of isolation and depression has made me a very boring person. I don't understand, and sometimes I'm afraid that she's actually being friendly with me out of pity.

Deep inside there's this little voice that tells me that this girl isn't for me and that she would and is already bringing me a lot of pain and unhappiness. 

Hell, I've been obsessed with her for months like I said earlier. I can't stand my days off work (won't see her again until next tuesday... already feeling like shit) because I'm alone and I can't see her.  I don't know what to do. I should just stay friends with her and that's it. I shouldn't be into her. She should be a cool friend that I should keep but that's it. I should love another woman.

But I cannot because I'm so fucking lonely and I have no one else in my life. What should I do? How to get over her? How to be at peace with my state of loneliness? I just want to work on myself and become a better person but I cannot because I'm lonely and because I'm so unhealthily obsessed with her that it prevents me from doing anything constructive in my life.

TLDR: Developed a crush on a coworker. We became friends with time. I'm obsessed with her even though we're completely opposite on many things, which creates a strong cognitive dissonance in my brain. I know the two of us would never truly work or that it would be an unhealthy relationship if it did. She playfully flirts with me sometimes and says it's funny to pretend that we're actually dating and that people believe it. I know I should get over her because she brings pain and unhappiness in my life but I cannot because I'm lonely as fuck and she's the only person to actually give me attention.

But in October everything started to fall apart, and now he's not talking to me anymore. Later that month I started dating a different guy, and I lost my virginity to him before he cheated on me with one of my best friends. Now I've been avoiding any sign of a relationship because it's not worth the pain and distress right now.

I miss the first guy, my old friend. For the sake of the post I'll call him David. I miss the physical contact and shit but more than that I miss the friendship. I live close to him so I see him all the time but he's very cold toward me. I've tried reaching out too many times to no response but I can't get over it.

Now there's a new guy, Owen. I've realized, to my horror, that I like him way too much. He's from a very close circle of mutual friends so I spend a lot of time around him and we have a lot of the same interests, although I met him fairly recently. I think everything this person does is purely adorable and I love to be around him, but I'm very afraid to go for it given the circumstances.

I can't tell our other friends how I feel because I'm afraid they'll tell him, and I don't want to tell him because I can't risk pushing him away and ruining another friendship if he doesn't feel the same way. I want to believe he drops hints that he likes me. He's kinder to me than he is to our friends and he talks to me a lot about his past relationships. But idk.

I feel very alone right now, even though I'm surrounded by a lot of good people. I'm going through a lot with my family and I miss the way things were before David and I fell out. I also feel like this connection that I have with Owen is rare in my life and I'd rather protect it than crush it trying to be with him.

but because I've always been so alone and devoid of female attention and affection, I just end up ruining it somehow when it comes time to speak or meet. I always find a way to fuck it up

I struggle to be the same funny, charming, charismatic person I am over text sometimes in person, I wish I could just talk the same way I type and think sometimes

It's made me worry a lot in life. Will I ever find someone who wants me for me? give me the loviing I crave and need? Will I ever be able to be who my mind knows it can be? I want nothing more in life than to find someone for my life

I've cried myself to sleep a few times in the last days because it's getting to me. I've only just started dating really for the first time in my adult life and It's so fucking hard, I feel miles behind most of the women I want to date.

**Family**: I just know I'm the outcast so I don't even bother. Nobody comforts me when I'm angry or frustrated and the only thing I get is ""calm down"". I like to comfort them and encourage them to rant when they need to. Sometimes I try to help them look on the other side

I don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt know who to ask, so here I am crying for help to strangers on the internet once again. I am so lonely, I have been for the last 5 years. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm shy, I have acquaintances, but nobody who‚Äôs close, or I would call a friend. Everyone I try to progress, platonically or otherwise, kinda just leave me at some point. I did recently make a friend for a while, but I doubt It‚Äôll work out.

No I‚Äôm not fed up with life or something, I‚Äôm actually quite happy most of the time, and really are when things go well. Despite this I am so very lonely. I have a bunch of aquanrtnces, or people I talk to at school and even text outside of it sometimes. But no actual friends. Nobody who‚Äôs going to last once the semester is over. Nobody who‚Äôd ever invite me anywhere. People I‚Äôve tried being friendly with seem to literally avoid me and try to ghost me.

I‚Äôm very doing well in school, I‚Äôm pretty social and not very shy, I exercise a healthy amount, I have hobbies and interests, but for the last 5 years, no friends. I try to get advice but all I get is, ‚Äújoin a club!‚Äù I have been in clubs and once again have made aquanrtnces but no friends. I have also tried going to things like DnD, but It never really worked out.‚Äúwork out, join a gym, improve your self image!‚Äù I‚Äôm not so basement dwelling loser, like I said I exercise a healthy amount and I am doing well in school. I have also tried seeing a councillor but to no avail since she pretty much told me the same stuff. Maybe I‚Äôm just not a nice person, but I really don‚Äôt think I am, and even Hitler had friends.

I honestly wanna just give up and stick to trying to date, but that is no easier. I have done so before, both times I did not make it past the first date and they kinda ghosted me afterwards. This semester is over so it‚Äôs too late to try again till next semester, and I‚Äôm not very outgoing, so I‚Äôm not sure how to meet people outside of school. I‚Äôm also too young to try online dating, not that I‚Äôd want to anyway.

There was a girl, I nearly made as a friend recently, but I doubt it‚Äôll work out. Essentially I tried to date her, but she wanted to just be friends. I‚Äôm happy because that‚Äôs honestly what I was looking for. We get along with each other, and text quite a bit, but I doubt it‚Äôll last, and I honestly kinda think she only talks to me out of sympathy based on much of her behaviour. She never instigates conversations, and sometimes seems to end them awkwardly mid conversation. Despite this she replies quickly, writes quite a bit, so I don‚Äôt know. We used to sit next to each other in class, walk to the bus together, and talk when we saw each other in the halls back when school was on, but I must have been to clingy or something. Even if I am overthinking, it‚Äôll never develop into anything more than texting about school. I could ask her out to something, (platonically), but she‚Äôd only accept out of sympathy, and I don‚Äôt want that. 

I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy. I want advice and help.

I had never felt like cutting myself... til today.
I was actually kinda coasting along this morning, but I went to a therapy session in the early afternoon and in it, I realized how alone in the World I am right now. In summary, my therapist handed me some really tough pills to swallow - my ex-wife is someone toxic, from whom I should not be close, that much I knew, but my so-called friends are only around when there's something in for them. And she's so right, a therapist wouldn't take me to such conclusions if she didn't think I needed to see it, and I trust her.

Then I went to work right after it and, boy, it was hell not to cry in front of my colleagues. After 3 PM, I work alone in my room, but people come and go to bring me and ask for things. I managed to discreetly cry a little, but tried to bottle it up til I got home. I just couldn't. When I went to the locker room to get changed to go back home (I go by bike), I broke down. Spent 5 solid minutes crying inside the bathroom. I came out not giving a flying fuck if someone saw me with a face full red and drenched in tears. That moment in there, if I had something to cut myself, I think I just might've done that.

Sorry for the venting. I just need to say it somewhere, because it hurts so, so bad to have nobody to call in these situations and get someone who cares to listen. I have felt like ending my life repeated times today, but that I know how to manage on my own, since I have already tried it many years ago and failed.

i‚Äôm 25 now, i have a new crush on one of my coworkers and it seems they might like me/flirts with me, etc. but i just can‚Äôt tell, and i can‚Äôt take the ifs and maybes. i don‚Äôt even know if i want to try. i used to be content with the idea of being a single woman forever, surrounded by cats and doing my own thing. but now that i‚Äôve had a taste of really enjoying time with someone it‚Äôs really hard to settle on that kind of future.

i don‚Äôt really know what to do to get out of this kind of funk, and i don‚Äôt know how to pep talk/push myself out into the scene, in order to take risks and try to find someone who will enjoy me for as i am, and so that i can return the favor to someone who is looking for the same. if anyone has any advice about trying to move on from this kind of situation (the longing and immense dread pitted in my stomach about being alone forever) it would be greatly appreciated.

Is every social encounter with a happy couple knife twisting in your stomach? Well all those things describe me and that‚Äôs the reason I started coming here. 

However, one night I had a moment of perfect clarity. My emotions completely evaporated and I saw myself through ‚Äúeyes unclouded‚Äù to borrow from Miyazaki. I asked myself ‚Äúwhy‚Äù again and this time an answer came back: ‚ÄúBecause you are not worthy of love.‚Äù That took me back a bit because I‚Äôm a romantic and have always believed that love was unconditional and something that just happened. I was always told that I was a good person and, therefore, someone would love me. Those beliefs were lies and I discarded them without compunction. I started to draw plans...

I made a covenant with myself. If I forged myself into the best version of me that I could be and I was still not worthy of love, then my life would be forfeit. Grim, sure, but life or death stakes are the only stakes that made the commitment feel more real than some dumb New Year‚Äôs resolution.

I used to always ask how woolworths was going. And she liked being asked. I prompted them by saying ""let me check when I get to the office"". Nothing. Not a thing. I tell them how many subjects (which I already knew the answer to before getting to the office) and that's it. Haven't heard back.

2446,thefinalprophecy,1575528883,1,"I just want to go out. I'm always asking my older sister if we can go to the beach or take a weekend trip to the mountains if she's down and has money. She always says maybe one day, but it never comes. My sister rarely hangs out with me because she's out on a date or with her coworkers, or with her ex girlfriend (they're still friends). I sometimes can't even hang out with them for whatever reason. 

I have a best friend but we rarely get to hang out because I'm in community college and she has work/hangs out with her boyfriend, whom I don't like because he's a piece of shit. I could hang out with this guy who I've been talking to for the past 5 months every single day, but he's busy with work and lives about 10 miles away. He doesn't have a car and I don't really like my family in my business, especially when it comes to guys. 

I got caught hooking up with a guy about a year ago and my parents installed security cameras inside of my house facing all the exits even though I was 18 at the time, I'm 19 now. I feel trapped. 

People don't really talk to me at school unless I'm dressed in revealing clothes or in a group assignment. These two guys asked me for my number once, but I'm pretty sure they just wanted to hook up. Don't get me wrong, sex is great, but I just want friends. Or just *a* friend. 

Someone who I can go to the beach with, or a skatepark for hours with. Someone I can blaze with and they can listen to all the things I have to say when no one else does. I have a lot of things I have to say, random or important. Talk a lot too. 

Social anxiety is a big factor of my loneliness. I can't walk up to someone and compliment their shoes or outfit, I normally talk to people when I don't understand homework. Those conversations never last long. 

I once thought I could have a real friend. I met him on an app called MeetMe, he was 30 years old, 31 now. We ""dated"" but that was a big mistake, then after I realized (I was in denial) that he was probably a predator. He probably fed off my loneliness too. So I distance myself now, analyzing people so I don't get hurt again. A ""best friend"" who secretly hated me because of my anxiety. I'll admit, I'm na√Øve and do sometimes fall for people's fake attempts at a real friendship..just to get in my pants, or whatever sick mind games they want. 

It just sucks. Do I look mean and unapproachable? No one talks me and sometimes guys just wanna hit, but I need more than that. I dress cute sometimes and I draw. So why doesn't anyone wanna know who I am? I'd be a great friend. A great girlfriend if given the chance. I have so much love in me.",lonely,I just want to go out,2019-12-05 17:54:43

As a result, I have only one friend, have never been in a relationship, and feel incredibly lonely most of the time. This past year in particular, my loneliness has made me really sad and crushed my self-esteem. 

For the past few weeks, I've been trying to go out of my way to make new friends at my community college, and it's made me realize something: I don't know how to be social, even when I want to be!

The reason I lose energy when I try to be social is because I'm constantly trying to force myself to do something I fundamentally don't know how to do. What comes naturally to most does not come naturally to me. When I try to talk to a person, it's so different from how I see other people talking to each other. Other people make jokes, insightful observations, funny comments, and ask relevant questions that come to mind immediately as the other person talks. They sound genuine and engaged. When I talk to people, especially girls, nothing comes to mind. Sure, I get nervous, but I feel like it's more than that. Everything I say and think feels forced, and it feels like my brain is running in overdrive just to keep up the charade of normalcy. If words did come easily in a conversation, I really don't think I'd be an introvert. 

And I don't even have any disorders! No autism, no aspergers, I don't even have ADHD. I have no excuses, just... I don't get it. How does everyone else do it?

2462,ughWow2322,1575520230,1,"so i should be studying for a final rn but since it's my last one i don't really care. and that's the reason that brought me here today actually. bc i don't care anymore. not like on no su\*cidal shit or nothing bc i've passed that stage but on some jeez what the hell am i doing w my life type shit. when i analyze my life i'm so ... unhappy. like there are days where i'm laughing my ass off, sides hurting, tears flowing and just living la vida bonita and then BOOM! God or who ever the hell is upstairs be like ""yeet bitch you thought."" and it just gets really fucking annoying bc it conditions you to think, ""omg don't get too happy now, you don't want to get this feeling taken away from you now."" and shit. but honestly at this point i'm just over it i guess. like i'm really not having a good time here. i don't want to be that bitchy bitch cry baby that complains about minor inconveniences in their life meanwhile ppl are fighting abuse, disease, etc. etc, but DAMN can i get a fucking break from this stale unseasoned life? 

anyways i'm actually starting to care about this final so imma wrap it up so i can study lmaoossjssksjk. but no fr in all seriousness it's really crazy how life is. like some days you don't want to be here any more but then again you don't want your life taken from you bc you actually haven't DONE shit w your life yet. and i guess in a way it's ok. like don't stay in the same low ass place forever but at the same time growth isn't rapid nor is it exponentially linear. you will have fucking bad days, yes oh God i've had my share of bad times. like a couple days ago i really wanted to end my shit bc i had FINALLYYYYY gotten an interview w a software company that pays their interns really well. and for someone who has the coding skills less than that of even a 7th grader, a bitch was PRESSEDT. but yeah basically my dumb ass had slept through the countless phone calls that were attempting to reach me. i called, and emailed, and prayed, and apologized my ass off but them bastards still ain't say nun back. actually lemme shut up bc they're not bastards. they prolly very nice ppl but i was just mad in the moment. still am. but shit like this happens all the time. and shit prolly happens for reasons. so honestly i just wanna say that if you're anything like me (which you'll probably will be since we both on reddit wasting time when we should be doing something productive \*COUGHS\*) then you'll get this: it doesn't matter champ. it doesn't matter that your familiy dynamic is horrible. you don't have not even one relative to call and console you when shit go south? doesn't matter. do Christmas songs and other holiday time periods give you a feeling of emptyiness and make you choke up and wanna cry bc you don't have that bond w your relatives? doesn't matter. no boyfriend? no girlfriend? no this, that, or the other? doesn't matter. crush not even looking in your direction and acknowledging that you're an amazing person that deserves the world? THIS ONE REALLY DON'T FUCKING MATTER CAUSE FUCK THAT PUSSY ASS DICKEHEAD ANY WAY!!!! \*clears throat and adjusts tie\* or maybe you're crush does acknowledge you but pisses you tf off bc they just be playing w your head and giving signals so mixed you woulda though they was learning sign language (amazing language btw you should learn it). that shit really don't fucking matter bc imma tell you right now that i have a crush who fits the description and he doesn't do anything but belittle me and throw shady hints like a lil bitch would so why do i even give him my valuable time? i shouldn't bc guess what? he doesn't matter (peep how i said ""shouldn't well he does, but just not to me. and fake friends shouldn't either. if you're the ""popular loner"" who's friends w everyone but isn't really FRIENDS w anyone, baby i get it. i really do. but that shit really. does. not matter. i already know i'm going to be the one person who gets--yuck i can't even say it--married after all my 'friends' and even then won't really have any one to invite to the wedding bc you know, like i said no pity relatives either. i already know that i won't have the fanciest car, or nicest house, or fattest paycheck--at least, i won't have all this shit if i k\*ll mys\*lf. so in order to get somewhere near the shit that DOES matter, you gotta put aside the shit that don't, and focus on you. focus on getting better, getting healthier, getting wealthier for YOU! there are sum point sum sum billion ppl &amp; counting on this earth. some of them may matter to you, but in the end you're the one that goes in the coffin alone. so anything you do, make it matter for you!

last thing imma say is this. those hella billion ppl i talked about? yeah that big ass number? they've all been through something before. 9 times out of 10 they found the solution to it either by doing something or learning a solution that someone else used to get out they tough times. so do that. read a book. watch a video or something. chances are you'll improve your life little by little and learn that this life shit does matter.",lonely,WhatTheFuckEver (obviously a rant lmao),2019-12-05 15:30:30

I‚Äôm also too young to try online dating, not that I‚Äôd want to anyway.

There was a girl, I nearly made as a friend recently, but I doubt it‚Äôll work out. Essentially I tried to date her, but she wanted to just be friends. I‚Äôm happy because that‚Äôs honestly what I was looking for. We get along with each other, and text quite a bit, but I doubt it‚Äôll last, and I honestly kinda think she only talks to me out of sympathy based on much of her behaviour. She never instigates conversations, and sometimes seems to end them awkwardly mid conversation. Despite this she replies quickly, writes quite a bit, so I don‚Äôt know. We used to sit next to each other in class, walk to the bus together, and talk when we saw each other in the halls back when school was on, but I must have been to clingy or something. Even if I am overthinking, it‚Äôll never develop into anything more than texting about school. I could ask her out to something, (platonically), but she‚Äôd only accept out of sympathy, and I don‚Äôt want that. 

I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy. I want advice and help. 

More info in case your curious. I‚Äôm a  with Aspergers in my first semester of university living off campus, and I‚Äôm studying history, something I have always been very interested in. During middle school my parents divorced forcing me to move across the world, not exaggerating, 4 times over. This kinda meant I lost all friends I had, and learned to not get too attached to people, which really did not help during high school, where I was depressed and alone.",lonely,"I have had no friends, for the last 5 years, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do.",2019-12-05 15:11:48

While all of this is happening, I feel this aching feeling in my heart. The weird thing is that this all started a few weeks after I started high school. All of my friends went to another high school because the boundaries changed. We also don‚Äôt talk a lot like we use to in our groupchat that we have.

My depression is growing stronger each day and my social anxiety doesn't help either.. Literally all i wanted was to find love.. The saddest part is that i will never experience this feeling. When i was younger i thought that it will come to me eventually and i should try to make myself happy, feel better but the reality hit like a truck.. I wasted the best time of my life to find someone who would accept me because of my social anxiety.. But.. Would it really matter? Being ugly stops any attraction towards a person even if both of them had personalities and interests that match 100%.

I think it's finally the time to end it once and for all, to stop being burden to everyone around me.

I don't have strength anymore to keep fighting, to keep myself positive.. To not fool myself that everything will be okay one day..

I am getting older, not younger.. Every passing day is harder to swallow than the previous one.. Everyone around me have someone..

I‚Äôve never dated anyone, I‚Äôve never kissed anyone. I‚Äôve had sex, and for a while I was obsessed with trying to have sex again. My first time didn‚Äôt go so well, so I thought I deserve a second time. That‚Äôs not really the problem, the problem is I think I ruined any chance of a relationship, or that I‚Äôm in a place where a relationship would be detrimental to me or my partner. I always bring this up, and I‚Äôm sick of it, but I have mental health problems. There are a lot of people out there who are worse off than me, but still I‚Äôm struggling with it, so I gotta try to get better. I have this really bad problem where I can‚Äôt read myself, I can‚Äôt tell how I really feel or what I‚Äôm really thinking. People use this all the time to their advantage. if you know me for long enough you can see when I am a little bit slower, and that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm confused and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. My mom and my dad use this to tell me that I‚Äôve been wrong this whole time. I‚Äôll go to doctors, then I get confused and they make me believe I did the wrong thing. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but this is why I got obsessed with getting laid. I convinced myself that all I wanted was sex, and that I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship because I don‚Äôt feel love. I was on every dating app I could find, desperately trying to find a guy for a hookup. Nothing ever happened, and time and time again I was flaked. Pretty soon all I was getting were bots and sugar daddies, and even they were running thin. I stopped using the apps, and I realized just how over saturated with sex I had become. Every now and again I get confused like that, I forget what love is. It‚Äôs still a vague concept, like a math problem you just stare at because you don‚Äôt know where to start. When that happens I think about hugs, real hugs, big warm hugs. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve had a hug. A real hug that meant something. When I forget how to feel I think of hugs, and I cry. I‚Äôm crying now, just writing this. I don‚Äôt know how I feel, I‚Äôm just lonely. Even if I met someone, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm worth it. I can only wonder what it‚Äôs like to fall in love. I used to think I had crushes, I wish I have so bad. No, I never had. I had close friends, and I pretend I fall in love, but it‚Äôs just a joke, gone in a few minutes. Is that a crush? I don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs not a good feeling. It feels like a lie. I want to write forever, write everything I feel all the time. I‚Äôm scared, not of what I‚Äôd write, but of how little I would write. Some people stick in my head. Strangers I‚Äôve only talked to online. They are so much more popular than me. Is that the right word? Does popularity end when your out of school? They don‚Äôt need to be attractive, they‚Äôre just the type people like. I wish I was that type. I have so many friends, met so many people who are that type. I‚Äôve never dated, all my friends have but not me. They tell me ‚Äúdating is bullshit, you‚Äôll just get your heart broke‚Äù. I always get my heart broke, I take pills for it. Pills don‚Äôt do much you know. They replace chemicals that are missing in your brain. They don‚Äôt fix your thoughts, only you can. I try so much, I‚Äôve done so much. I‚Äôve met people online, people who are more sad. There was this one guy, just a kid in college, his first year in a good college. He was, or still is, terrified of white people. I talked to him, I love talking, I live falling down rabbit holes. I talked to him about his life, his emotions. He didn‚Äôt speak English well. He moved from Vietnam to China, then from China to America. He didn‚Äôt speak English, he never learned Chinese, he could only speak Vietnamese. Well, that‚Äôs the only language he was fluent in. His class mates took advantage of him, copying his homework knowing that he could t speak back. He was so afraid, yet here he was. He was talking to me. Who am I? What do I look like? I talked to him all night, I wanted to tell him everything I know about being social. I studied that, being social. I worked hard to find the things people like, and to copy that. Eventually I found that he was really receptive to analogies. He was really good at chemistry, and I knew enough to convert socialism to chemistry. I felt proud, he took my advice. I never talked to him again. I‚Äôve met lots of guys who were nice to me. They were so kind and gave me such good advice. It was strange, they were looking for sex, and ended up teaching lessons. I learned to not trust those people. You have to coax knowledge out of people, you can‚Äôt let them give it to you. At some point, I got a bunch of guys telling me that I‚Äôm too young, that I should find a boyfriend first. I never got those again. There was this one guy, he was really nice at first. He told me everything he knew about gay sex. I asked him the question of course, but he was more than happy to answer. He told me what to avoid, and what to do. It was not new stuff, but still helpful. I never met anyone outside of the app, I tried really hard but they just didn‚Äôt like me enough. This guy, he turned from helpful to obsessed. He started suggesting coffee dates. Suggestions turned to demands. Suddenly he hated me, he called me names said I was stupid and stuck up and naive. Maybe I was, I don‚Äôt know. Guys would stalk me for months. I never did anything about it. I loved to talk, to learn about people. I like to explore them, see how they worked. That was dangerous, very dangerous. I met some really twisted people. I met a guy who wanted watch me have sex with a 13 year old. I met a guy who kept asking me if I would cook and eat him. I loved rabbit holes too much. Even then, I made it past them. They stopped talking to me. Some guys still hung on, I tried to talk to them. They only wanted sex, and so did I, but then they wanted nothing. There were these younger guys, my age. Guys my age never liked me. I don‚Äôt think any of them haven‚Äôt blocked me. I would whore myself out to some guys just to talk to them a little longer. They always left. Guys my age were too popular. What was I doing? I deleted the apps, all of them. Now I sit in silence, constantly checking my phone for new messages. I never get any. When was the last time someone texted me? One texted me yesterday, he moved away. I though he forgot about me. No, I‚Äôm the person who likes to talk. I love to talk. I always message people, in desperate hope that they would talk to me. I‚Äôd talk about anything, I just wanted to talk. I‚Äôm counfused, I don‚Äôt know what I want. Is that what a relationship is like? Just talking? Wouldn‚Äôt I just bother them? I wish I went to peoples houses more. When was the last time you went to someone‚Äôs house? I always feel uncomfortable, I wish I didn‚Äôt. I see friends spend time together, I wish I did. I used to, I would always do things to get people to spend time together. To spend time with me. How much is a friend worth? I would go broke because I spent all my money on my friends. My family told me they were taking advantage of me, and that my heart was too big. Maybe that‚Äôs why I always broke it. My parents would ask for money, to buy things and they‚Äôd pay me back later. I didn‚Äôt care about money, I always got rid of it. I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôm so scared. I‚Äôm moving away. I‚Äôm living with strangers when I move away. I‚Äôll be so lonely. My friends will all be gone. It‚Äôs my new life, I don‚Äôt want to mess it up. But I‚Äôm confused. I don‚Äôt know what I want. Did I do the right thing by quitting my job? I need the money, but I‚Äôm quitting next week. I already said I would. My mom said they won‚Äôt hire me back. I‚Äôm failing school. I want to write. I‚Äôm insane. I got all the help I can get. I need more help. That‚Äôs why I make these. I‚Äôm begging for help. I have 3 pill bottles, I always run out. What did I do? I‚Äôm confused. I promised myself I‚Äôd get better? Am I better? I‚Äôm so confused. I‚Äôm screaming, nothings coming  out. I hear my voice inside. I can‚Äôt stop thinking. I hear the door close and my dogs breathe. I feel the bubbles in my stomach and my numb finger. I‚Äôm so lonely. People say they‚Äôre there for me. People want to help. How can you know me? I want you to know me. I don‚Äôt know myself? I want to write forever. Text limit. Please don‚Äôt do this to me. No I‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôm just a little worried. I stopped watching porn and just look up videos of people kissing. I watch tutorial on how to have sex. I cry. They make me feel lonely. I‚Äôve lost it. I‚Äôm failing school. I work full time. I workout, when will I like myself? I‚Äôm overweight, 10 pounds. I need to lose 30, but 10 will work. I‚Äôm not obsessed am I? My parents tell me I‚Äôm obsessed. They say if you have mental problems you can go to a clinic. Quite white rooms. I can‚Äôt go to war, they don‚Äôt accept people with mental problems. I want to write forever. When will I die? People say ‚Äúgod is dead‚Äù but was he ever alive? When I‚Äôm done I‚Äôll stop feeling lonely, I‚Äôll just go back to feeling bored. Writing most of the day, I have a newspaper story to do. I have a c- so I‚Äôll pass if I turn the story in. I‚Äôm avoiding my problems. I‚Äôm scared that if I feel in love, I‚Äôd get confused. Can I ask someone to take care of me? To help me when I lose my mind? Is that fair when I‚Äôm always crazy? Do I have a big heart or am I confused? Teachers used to say I had so much potential. They said that to me but I never heard them say it to other kids. They choked back tears when they said it. I spent most my time in the hall, making the clock tick and the walls melt. Who‚Äôs for me? Where‚Äôs for me? Where is who is for how and who am I? Please help me. Don‚Äôt read this just talk to me. I want to talk. I don‚Äôt want to be alone. I‚Äôm never like this. I‚Äôm confused. I don‚Äôt want to be alone forever. I‚Äôm not the guy to fall in love. I can‚Äôt love. I have isolation tendencies. I depend on my friends so much. I‚Äôm glad I have them. When I get mad I cry. I don‚Äôt get mad anymore. I just want to write. I‚Äôm the kind of guy who pleases everyone. I deleted all the apps. I want sex. That‚Äôs all I want is sex. I want to keep writing. When will this end? I have a bottle of NyQuil, I like to drink it. I live with my parents so I can‚Äôt host. L, young and dumb. That‚Äôs what I always called myself, young and dumb.

I‚Äôm a 20 y/o guy and on the better looking side (really sorry if I sound immodest, don‚Äôt want to be a dick). I go to a good college, I have internships at top financial firms, I was a football star and popular in high school and etc. but I am still having trouble finding a girl nowadays. I understand that I am young but it is troublesome to not have someone caring for me. One of my biggest flaws is that I have severe social anxiety around women in certain situations. I can be flirty and talk well but when I am put in a situation where sex may be invoked I get anxiety (I cannot talk and leads me to vomiting).

I had the ideal girlfriend in high school who was hot, smart, aligned with me religiously and politically, and very caring. I self-sabotaged our relationship due to this anxiety. She talked me into getting medicine for it so I did but that drew side effects of depression and suicidal thoughts. I was put into an institution for awhile and I have since been feeling better but that social anxiety still occurs. I feel like I am too focused on work/school to have the luxury of having someone there for me at the end of the day.

(and i always just joke about my problems but i'll try to be serious lmao) i used to be the funny kid. i was literally known to be the loud one and was always laughing. and when i was kid i had a lot of friends. it's crazy how mental illnesses can change u. it all started when i was like 13 years old. the usual- had bad thoughts, got tired easily, lost my interest in things, started self harming and had a lot of panic attacks. didn't go to school that much anymore and i lost many friends. i mean we were just kids, i can't blame them. who wants to be friends with someone who just ignores and is so down all the time¬ø i mean i still had ""friends"" in school. but after school days, after all that pretending to be happy i just went home to cry every day. so i never really hung out with people outside school. of course because of that i wasn't really invited to anything. i just became the person people little bit talked to at school but they wouldn't ACTUALLY be my friend. that's why i feel little bit bad about whining how LoNeLy i am, cus i've still always had some people around me. but i still feel so lonely. 
i feel like i don't even exist. i drown my thoughts on watching some netflix or youtube or just scrolling through internet. every day for hours. i can go weeks without seeing anyone and sometimes during that time i literally forget how to interact with people lol. i still have two friends but they both live kinda far.  and i have some internet friends since i literally live on internet. i know many people don't have ANYONE and i know i should be very grateful for those 2 irl friends. and i'm trying.
i've been in this depression for few years now. i always think that some day it's gonna be better, but every year it just gets worse. now i'm at the point where i see nothing when thinking about future. i don't care about anything. i have no interest in anything. i feel like i'm just forced to be here and i don't see the reasons why. i'm so done that most days i can't even cry. i often have the urge to grab pills or knife. i'm trying SO HARD not to do it but every day i feel more hopeless. i'm almost starting to accept death. it doesn't even scare me anymore and i feel so ready. but at the same time i think WHAT IF i could turn my life to something else. what if one day i could enjoy my life again or love someone again. i'm slowly losing all those hopeful thoughts. and yeah i would've never thought i'd write my problems somewhere like this but i don't have anyone that i could seriously talk to.

2) I text my SO but it feels like a one sided convo, not that he isn't trying to put in effort to talk, but it's not something natural for him to share about his day unless I keep probing. Everyone tells me to breakup with my SO but when I tried, he said that I am 'going back to old habits by giving up the relationship instantly'. 

3) Me and SO have this ongoing 'quarrel', basically I met someone new who has a gf, but my SO keeps saying that it's weird to be having 'useless banter' over text with this new male friend (i didn't initiate, it's the other guy who does, it's stuff about the weather or just random ongoings with life). SO says this guy might have ulterior motives because of the 'useless banter', and doesn't understand why I continue the convos despite this. I explained point 1 to SO but he still doesn't understand. 

It's currently day 3 of no contact with the 'new friend', I'm not dying, and instead focus more effort into my existing relationship. But i think about it a lot, and I have thoughts of caving in because I get along well with the 'new friend', cos of similar hobbies. It's like things I know my SO won't be happy for me because he can't relate. Idk if  i should reach out again, but I already told my SO that I wouldn't do it :( My SO said that he gave up on telling me not to text but I just shared with him that the new friend wanted to go over to my place to just chill and order food but i said no, and now he's convinced that this friend just want sex with me despite having a gf.

Recently I had to distance myself from my old group of friends because of their substance abuse and broke up with my now ex-GF due to other stuff, so I've suddenly ended up having very little human contact.

I've tried to be active with my hobbies, attending irl stuff related to them as often as I can but my evening shifts and other things often get in the way. I like the people I meet through my hobbies but basically never talk to them outside these meetings. 

So, despite having theoretically a rather active life I don't really seem to talk to anyone in my day to day life. When I get home I don't usually have anyone to talk to, even online. I can't deny that sometimes it's very unmotivating to do anything when I can't share it with anyone. And being home just feels very bleak.

The worst thing, however, is that I often feel that things won't get better anymore. These hobby related acquaintances will eventually leave too once they find something better to do. I have no idea where to even meet people otherwise. I have a three day weekend coming up and I'm terrified of it because I have absolutely nothing to do and I know the loneliness will creep up on me then.

I was hired several months ago and in that time we have celebrated 3 birthdays, and we are talking custom birthday cakes and decor, and lunch ordered from a favorite restaurant of the birthday boy or girl. A signed card. Even if the person being celebrated took their day off, we celebrated the day before. The most recent bday was last month. They have always been semi-surprise celebrations.

Everyone knew it was my birthday today, because I am taking the day off and it came up in our staff meeting last Friday. My boss asked me into their office on Monday, and asked what type of food I like. 

Needless to say, I didn‚Äôt pack food yesterday and looked forward to the little lunch. I live far from family, so that was going to be really my one celebration this year. Especially now that I‚Äôm 27 and birthdays are supposed to be less of a big deal. 

Well I sat at my desk. My boss left the office around 11. I figured it was my semi-surprise, maybe to pick up the lunch mentioned earlier in the week? But by 2, they still weren‚Äôt back, I was really hungry, and just decided to go get food. I came rushing back in case something was happening. 

My boss got back around 3, so I held out for maybe something at the end of the day. No comment from my boss, business as usual. 5pm comes, 2 coworkers verbally wished me a happy bday by this point, and I packed up and drove home.

But if you combine that with loneliness, like on a soul-crushing level, this shit is starting to make me go bonkers. Here's the thing, I'm married, happily. I have a good life, minus being isolated due to a disability. And I mean isolated. I'm catered to and cared for, but there's no one up at night, and that's when I'm at my best in every way. My spouse isn't backward, the way I am.   


So, check this out: Throw a friend in the mix right? With the same 2 diagnoses. They're there with you until sunrise, laughing at nothing, playing music, talking about life and how our anxiety is a piece of shit, and it's fucking platonic, man. And you're in love, but actually platonically, and that's a really special thing; to you, anyway. Fast forward and then you get best friend rings, like the magical duo the two of you are, and the word ""friend"" has a depth to it, like never before. And you just get a break from living in your head, for the first time in twenty-six years,  


You're together 8-9 hours a night for around four months if not longer - because insomnia/ADD makes lying down feel like you're in restraints, especially if you're in a wheelchair, and currently, need help transferring. We just vibed, man. We did. And it was magical. Then this person says they're moving soon, after Christmas in fact, which actually means they'll miss your birthday.  


And so now you're clinging and pleading with anyone who'll listen, ""Please, keep my friend around. This one's pretty fuckin' dope, God."" And you just never know, and you still don't. Then you're shaking your fist at the sky because you weren't supposed to care or feel any fucking thing at all. You've had trauma in your head for so long you don't really mind the fog, and loving anything means eventually mourning its death or departure, and you knew this. Lived by it.   


  
BUT WAIT! There's more!

&amp;#x200B;

The shit was so good, it made the fear of loss fucking die. That has not happened; not once. And then you're breathing, and seeing, and accepting, not living in a state of resistance.  


And then, you're ghosted. Dropped. After all that time, and you don't why. This is the 2nd person you've ever put faith in in your entire life, other than your spouse. And they're just fucking gone and you're fucking neighbors. Not really, but it only takes like 3 minutes to get to their place, but they're too nonchalant to want you over.   
 

And now it's been close to two months, no call, text, nothing. One or two, but everything starts to fade. And they've changed. They're cooped up and coping, and they get angry that you blow up their phone because you're worried, and you give a fuck whether or not they're staring at the ceiling thinking too hard.  Then the abandonment trauma goes in full swing and they don't fucking get it. They've chosen to be numb, only this time, they're numb to your feelings, too.  


Forever is a second, guys. Forever is gone. Please help me close this fucking door, y'all. It's so fucking heavy. A friend has never meant that much to me, ever. And they were probably lying, but you KNOW for a time, they weren't. Now you're just stuck figuring out which ones were real or which ones were fake, because you can't fucking help it, and your spouse is affected too because they also cared for this person. They, too, wake in the night not knowing how to help you heal.

AND MY MARRIAGE WILL ALWAYS COME FUCKING FIRST.

Published December 3rd, 2019 

To Who It May Concern and To Whom Will Help.

My name is Paul Anthony Bergen-Wayman. I am a gay boy who needs a mate. For the past 8 years I have cried reclusively, and have become more than broken, I have become fractured as my 20's burn away crying &amp; surviving. Without sharing my life with him, I am living a life or romantic deprivation. This chapter of my life needs to end.

Using a combination of dating sites, forums, events, and both online and offline communication, I haven't fallen in love no matter how friendly and affectionate I was.

I have been deprived of so much due to not having a SO. I have dropped out of college, I have disassociated from organizations, I have been terminated from jobs. I have been deprived of countless simple pleasures being just one boy of two. I have been deprived of normal human activities and a career path. Due to a series of circumstances and bad directions my true self is now buried under a overburden of despair and despondency.

I am done with platonic relationships, and have given up on the insanity that love will just happen when I least expect it, or that one of my plattonic gay friend will blossom into a boyfriend. Crying for romance has become a daily affirmation. My friends know full well that I cry for love and I need love.

There is nothing to live for if I'm not monogamously coupled. You will not change my mind on this. I am dead set on being a SO to another male. Denying this is existential fraud, and a violation of my true essence.

I have cried enough. Each Christmas, I yearn to make out with him under the mistletoe, and each Christmas I have been deprived of this and countless other simple pleasures.

Last Call. If I don't consider myself monogamously coupled by December 24th, 2019, I am going to truncate my life. I will disappear into the night to end this deprived, miserable experience. Eight years of searching for a boyfriend and false starts, flings &amp; dates will culminate in a dead body, an idea, and the worst Xmas present imaginable - if I am not monogamously coupled by Christmas Day 2019.

Where is the minority who know what they have before it's gone? Where are the gay males also crying for love?

Most importantly, are you going to help my cause?

Update November 18th, 2019:

Having no mate to look forward to after a hard day at work / school, and being deprived of the love other people are sharing all around me doesn‚Äôt affect?

I have lost friends because I hit on them, I have lost the will to improve myself without a mate (ive frozen personal growth because years of outward improvement has not closed the deal).

You are only seeing the snapshot of me today after these 8 years of deprived loneliness. I can assure you that you would feel very similar after 8 years of deprivation.

You can see my other posts on reddit see that internet preservation is #2, that is the only other thing worth doing. Love is #1.

I was courted by a Sex and Love Addicts Anoumous Group, how can I be addicted to something I‚Äôve never had?

I know what incel behavior is, I have done my best to run away from that up until now. I am not looking for benefits, a sugar daddy, I want his body and mind. I will live with him under the bridge or in a homeless encampment. I need his embrace. I need this bitcrushing to end.

Also, I tell myself everyday ‚ÄúI deserve him‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am a beautiful, extremely intelligent guy that deserves another beautiful, extremely intelligent guy‚Äù.

Like an extremely desperate employer who hire anyone who meets the bare minimums (trucking industry), I‚Äôve become the same way, I‚Äôll take anyone to start and then upon finding a more compatible &amp; loving guy, Fire the lesser.

I look at people making a difference in the world, and think ‚Äúthey have love‚Äù.

What else do I have to lose for not having his love? 10 MORE YOUNG YEARS? My Digital Life &amp; Legacy? My legs? Do I have to be gangraped, beaten and crippled before love?

Need a litmus test? If the UN signed a pact that prohibited me to have a love, I would still fall in love with him. The desire for his love is so strong that I will go against global superpowers. Liberty or Death? How about Love or Death!!

I keep my word. December 24th will be my last day alive without him, so I don‚Äôt have to endure another Christmas of deprivation. I have 3 PAINLESS ways to terminate myself, as I have had enough pain. If you are going to help me close the deal you have until December 24th to do it.

Let‚Äôs get my story on the News. MSM is always looking for LGBT stories. If you are a journalist, I am worth it. My story is worth putting your career or standing on the line.",lonely,LAST CALL FOR LOVE M4M,2019-12-04 17:41:53

My parents divorced when I was 3, so I never really had a parental connection or felt what it was like to have a mother as at best I only saw her maybe 2 to 3 times a year and we aren‚Äôt really close. My dad worked really hard to provide for me and my sister and my stepmom at the time. After being through many divorces and having multiple stepmoms, my sister left me and my dad when I was around 8 to go live with my mom due to issues she had with my dad (my dad wasn‚Äôt her genetic father but raised her.) 

Soon after my dad would meet someone and she would end up being my stepmom for 6ish years that we‚Äôre usually filled with many breakups. It was a really toxic relationship and tbh I hope my dad would just move on. I had 2 stepbrothers that were a little older then me and I eventually got close with them. But as time would have it, my stepmom would eventually divorce my dad and at that point I just felt like making connections with anyone meant nothing anymore.  I moved away from my lifetime school and had to start over. I‚Äôve never had any romantic relationships and even now the friends that I do have don‚Äôt see me as their #1 or even #3 friend.

I‚Äôm from a third world country. I‚Äôm studying in the USA.

My brother was a naturally gifted painter. I loved reading and geography. My brother was encouraged to hone his talent - my parents bought him painting supplies. They never bought me a book. 

In my teens, I started playing the guitar. I wrote a couple of songs and recorded them too. They were never acknowledged by my mother. My dad had passed away by then. I was never encouraged to play - I was just told I was wasting my time.

My brother painted something - my dad would bring his coworkers home to show off that painting.

I worked hard - I was reading books that were two grades above me. I knew obscure places in Europe before you could look them up on the internet. I was told I was wasting my time ‚Äúreading‚Äù and not studying.

I was winning College guitar competitions - not even once was I congratulated or asked about them.

I went to study engineering under pressure from my parents even though my heart was in the arts. My brother did the same. He finished. I dropped out.

My brother became a cop at 25. Everyone‚Äôs proud of him. My mother especially. 

My sister is divorced. I saw it coming. I defended her while my mother and brother blamed her. My brother fat shamed her all the time even though she is beautiful and slim. My parents never asked him to stop. I defended her - I was told that I do not understand what‚Äôs going on. I stood up to her. I was told I was too naive and young. How old do you have to be to know the difference between basic right and wrong? I fought with my family. Every single day. That what they were doing to my sister was wrong and that I wouldn‚Äôt keep quiet about it. 

At 26, I quit my lowly job to plan to move to the USA. I was told that I was worthless and stupid. I was told that I was only worth being a tuk tuk driver.

I got accepted into a Top 25 college with a small scholarship. My mom didn‚Äôt congratulate me.

No one in my family talks to me anymore. I haven‚Äôt spoken to my brother in 15 years. My sister still lives with my mother and thinks there is nothing wrong with the way she was treated. She is upset with me for becoming an ‚Äúenemy‚Äù to my mother. There isn‚Äôt a single person in this world who is proud of me. 

In college I see everyone and how smart they are. It comes naturally to them. I want to work hard but my brain tells me I shouldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôll be a waste of time. I waste all my time with mindless entertainment. If I don‚Äôt get a job before I graduate I can‚Äôt live in the US anymore. If I go back, I‚Äôll be worse off than before.

2560,joeviben,1575436067,1,"This is a long story but I‚Äôm leaving it here in case anyone wants to read it. This entire ordeal has absolutely consumed my life as of late. 

I transferred schools last year and met this really charming girl. I never really noticed or talked to her during first semester but come second semester we really started to hit it off. We would sit and work together the majority of each day, especially Fridays when neither of us had anything going on. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time but I liked spending time with her, she was funny and didn‚Äôt seem to get upset or bored by me.

At the beginning of this year there was this new guy who came to the school, and he was super cool as well. Both the girl and I became good friends with him and we would all hang out together from time to time. One time when it was just me and him hanging out he asked if I was interested in anyone and I finally realized I had a crush on her, he joked about it a little once I told him but he seemed understanding for the most part and let me know if she ever said anything about me to him.

Flash forward a few weeks and this guy starts talking about things with this girl I never heard about before- her past relationships, her home life, really personal shit I would‚Äôve liked to hear as well. Eventually I find out that her past relationship was emotionally manipulative and learned that she doesn‚Äôt open up as a result, but I‚Äôve noticed from experienced that if trusted and pressed hard enough she‚Äôll let you in on some private stuff. 

I finally take my friend‚Äôs advice and start facetiming her nightly, something she seemed happy doing, and it went on like this for at least a month or two until we got close enough where I decided I‚Äôd tell her how I felt. We were sending eachother wholesome memes on instagram while communicating verbally on facetime, this is when I finally messaged her ‚Äúi love you‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt reject me, so that was promising, she sent me heart emojis and giggled uncontrollably, eventually we said our goodbyes and went to sleep. 

The next day after school I shoot her a message apologizing for being so forward since I know she hates that stuff and is uncomfortable with it, but she sends me a huge message explaining how she loves me back but doesn‚Äôt know how to show it, I told her that I get it and it‚Äôs not something that worries me. We talked about it later that night on facetime and she agreed to work with me to try and start feeling comfortable in a relationship again, but it‚Äôs been almost 2 months since then and we‚Äôve gotten nowhere, in fact, she‚Äôs been talking to me less.

She‚Äôs still talking with the new guy about shit and laughing about it in group calls, and doing so in a manner she‚Äôs never done with me or our inside jokes; I‚Äôve been asking if she wants to facetime and she‚Äôll say ‚Äúin a minute‚Äù but that minute never comes; she hasn‚Äôt talked to me for 3 days straight even when I‚Äôve been sitting 5 feet away from her, she only seems interested in talking to this ONE guy and his friends, and they all hang out after school once I leave. 

I feel like shit. I‚Äôve had been cutting myself because her words are meaningless to me but all I want to do is hear them, it‚Äôs all completely pointless, I still feel this way but the blade got dull so I threw it out. It‚Äôs a shitty habit I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. I‚Äôm so fucking jealous of what they have and only want things to go back to normal. I‚Äôm so obsessed and invested in someone who, despite their words, will probably never show me love back. She was the only thing I had going in my life that made me want to keep on living but now I don‚Äôt even feel like it‚Äôs worth keeping this shit going anymore.",lonely,I‚Äôm told so much but still feel so alone,2019-12-04 16:07:47

From surgeries to crippling depression my life has been messy and I just didn't want to get anyone caught up in all that. Even though I crave romance and companionship as much as anyone, it's always been easier to keep things casual. I don't usually have a hard time detaching sex from emotion, but my most recent fuck buddy is making it very hard.

He is sweet, adorable, affectionate, and we have a ton in common. My stupid heart races when he texts me. I get this goofy grin when I see him. I literally cannot stop thinking of him and I absolutely hate it. The worst part is that he's only interested in a casual relationship as well, so there's no way anything will come of it. Plus I'm afraid that the only reason I think I like him is because he's nice to me and to not fuck up the good thing we have going.

2566,hamartiated,1575432564,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

2581,17R__,1575420327,1,"First off, I‚Äôm a 21 year old male college student. I want to start by saying that the last few months have been an improvement for me in my mindset. I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist who I like a lot, and I‚Äôve learned that one of the unhealthiest things I was doing was comparing myself to others. I‚Äôve been staying off of most social media as much as I can, and I now realize the negative effects that it was having on me. I‚Äôve also tried to stop wasting my time on my phone. Rather than worrying about what everyone else my age seems to be doing, I‚Äôm now thinking about what I really want. So, these may all seem like good things, and they are, but also, with the removal of a lot of time I‚Äôve wasted on social media, my mind now has a lot of time (too much time) to think. I ruminate constantly about future relationships, future jobs, what I want to do with my life, etc. But most of all, I think I‚Äôm just lonely.

I haven‚Äôt had a romantic relationship in almost 6 years, and I don‚Äôt really know how to meet a girl. I feel pretty comfortable when actually in conversations, but I‚Äôm just never one to engage a conversation with a stranger. I don‚Äôt really want to just talk to/ flirt with/ randomly try to pick up girls, that‚Äôs not really how I am at all. I strive for a much deeper connection in a relationship, almost unexplainable by words. It‚Äôs difficult, because it feels like a lot of other people my age just prefer random hookups and sex in relationships, and that‚Äôs not at all what I want. If I couldn‚Äôt envision a long-term relationship, I would never consider dating someone.

I‚Äôm very much an ‚Äúold soul‚Äù; I‚Äôve been called that by people and it‚Äôs actually something I take as a compliment and am proud of. While other people might prefer partying or going to the bar or club, I‚Äôd much prefer a nature walk. I love old music, old style houses, I even think I feel more comfortable talking to people my grandparents‚Äô age than my age because my personality is closer to them. Most of the time, I feel fine alone, but recently, I feel overwhelmed and I really want to make some friends that feel like I do and meet a girl that feels like I do. These feelings are a lot worse now that I only have one semester left of school, I guess because I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to find love and find close friends after school. I know I‚Äôm still young and have a lot of time, but my recent existential crisis on top of all of this makes me feel like I‚Äôm in a rush to create relationships and find my true meaning in life. I feel like I can‚Äôt waste any more time.

I know I‚Äôm a really deep thinker and a really deep feeler, especially for a boy. But I know there are people out there that feel the same, I just really don‚Äôt know how to find them. It seems that everyone else my age just wants to party all the time and have fake relationships to post all over social media. I just think and feel really differently, and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm in a different universe. I just want something real more than anything, and I‚Äôve never really found that. I do believe in true love and I do believe I‚Äôll find someone someday who perfectly understands me. I‚Äôm ready to start trying to find that somebody; I just don‚Äôt really know where to start.

I'm currently 19 and at young age up to 11 12 I had many friends and was super social, almost all day I was out playing with friends and at some point everyone turned against me and casted me away, almost my entire class and they did super terrible things to me that left scars that are behind me. At that time I stopped going out with friends and I didnt go to school 50% of the time(studied at home), told myself that I dont need them and I can be happy staying home and playing video games and enjoying stuff by myself. That continued kind of up until to this day.

I finished school 1.5 years ago and right now in virtual university, I watch luctures at home and study from books. I tried physical class once but its same for virtual for me, I only listen to the professor and dont mind the stuff around, so I told myself why bother with physical. I also make my money online with companies I've founded over the years so money isnt a problem for me, I have only online emploies.

Couple of months ago I got into a group of friends and we went out almost every week but it felt ""normal"" and I wasnt really happy and connected to them on deep level, I always asked myself ""Is that it? Is that how I should feel with friends around?"". I also had girlfriend that was 10 years older than me for 3 months we had fun and played games together and talked about life with her and other stuff but I broke up with her because after a while I felt it was too boring and we didnt have strong of connection anymore.

I wish I had friends/gf that I can enjoy life with like in the animes but I dont know anymore if its just a fantasy or it can happen for real. maybe its too late for me.

Just to make this clear, I can go outside and talk to people with no problem but I want to find out good friends or girlfriend that I can connect with in a deep level and enjoy life together but I dont know how and where, most of the people that I talk with are in the computer or myself.

Last year I finished high school and one of my worries was being able to make friends, and not because I can‚Äôt but because I didn‚Äôt want to. So this year I started it and made a group not because I actually cared or was interested in them, the opportunity was just there ok (I dropped out later so didn‚Äôt get to much into it)
Anyways I thought I was gonna miss my friends from school but turns out.. I didn‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt care about them at all, they moved on and so did I. And I think I should be concerned but I‚Äôm just curious/very confused because it‚Äôs really new for me. I even tried to make friends online but I get bored and stop talking to them. So now I don‚Äôt have friends and I don‚Äôt talk to people online because I don‚Äôt want to ghost anyone.
I knew I was kind of asocial but it has never been on this level, I feel like I‚Äôm losing my empathy towards everything and it‚Äôs lowkey kinda scary, I talked about this with my therapist but didn‚Äôt got much further, like my sister was born this year and I don‚Äôt feel anything towards her, and I realized the same with my other siblings like I just don‚Äôt care about them at all, we are like strangers living on the same roof.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Good aspects of my life:

&amp;#x200B;

My parents saved me from starving to death as a baby because i was a very very picky eatter.

&amp;#x200B;

I get fed, clothing, a bed to sleep in, a roof over my head and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My parent want to help me whenever i need help.

&amp;#x200B;

I got A's and B's in school with no sick days at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I created a working storyline 2D Platformer game in under 6 months with actual code not drag and drop.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished 2 almost 3 college classes so far in computer Science.

&amp;#x200B;

Im in the top 40 or the top 400 most hardworking students in my class (I dont remember which group im exactly).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bad Aspects of my life

&amp;#x200B;

I have High Functioning Autism i deal with all the time. :""(

&amp;#x200B;

I was bullied and shunned my whole life from my neighborhood to school and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I have very protective parents who love me and care for me but wont leave me alone. They still treat me like im 12 when im a 20 year old young adult. Also they take my shit i bought with my own money because i didnt do something they asked of me to do. Im basically my parents house slave which im suppose to do chores if im not working on my collrge class. Also when im having a happy day for once in my life somehow something pisses me off its either my parents, work or mad at people for not accepting me.

&amp;#x200B;

If i acted as if i was a different person i would get more friends but when i act like myself i get shunned and laughed at for what i like to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to make friends in highschool and trying in college and still everyone shuns me to the way i act. I also was the guy who did all the work in group projects eventhough my group members lied about everything saying they did work as a team with me but they didnt. their phone was more important than our project.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to make friends at work and no one understands me so they told my boss that they thought i was a stalker and i got written up for it. Which now that makes me the less important guy at my work.

&amp;#x200B;

I work basically 36 hours a week with one day off for my college class and no freetime to hang out with friends or to do what i like to do.

&amp;#x200B;

idk if i am having a good life or not but please i want your suggestions cause i feel like my life is hell for me right now and because of this im a pist off, depressed child all the time with no one to go to for help to be my comfort companion.",lonely,A hard working person that never got the respect he deserved.,2019-12-04 10:18:59

He gazed upon freedom, 
He prayed to be free from his spite,

2607,msFluffyPants61,1575398672,1,"2019 hasn't been a good year for me up til now. 

On the first day of the year, the boy I fell in love with refused me. Kinda. He just ignored my happy new year messages and told my best friend that he had already had a crush on someone. He's also my classmate, so after the holiday, he just tries to keep away from me. Just a few days before the day he refused me, he still accepted to go with me on a date and he even held my hands in the cinema. That just hurts. That time, I recalled of my ex, once told me that I wasn't pretty enough to go along with him. I know I am not a pretty girl, but it really killed my self-esteem.  Sometimes I even think whether I am worth being loved. 

My academic performance is getting worse despite the fact that I had pretty high scores the last 2 semesters. I can't sleep at night and I don't want to go to class in the morning. Besides doing exercises, I dont know what else to do to enhance my knowledge. My friends around me has been looking for internships, while I am still struggling with the thought about what should I do in the future. I can't get help from anyone. My friends tend to have diffent directions from mine, and they just couldn't help. Taking the first step is a challenge for me right now. 

I have just had a foreign language proficiency test. Though I had going hard with it, it doesn't pay off. That moment I realized how bad I am at languages. It was wrong of everyone to expect of me. I feel useless. I don't have any clues of my future at all. 

I don't want to disturb my friends. They have their own problems and i just don't want them to be down by my negative thoughts. Besides, they won't understand. They have always thought of me as a strong one, and that they will say somewhat like ""Cool don't joke around I know you can't have THAT bad performance"", ""Dont be so negative"" or ""That's pretty normal to be sad, just take your time"". Even though that's true, I dont want them to see me as a crybaby. I dont want them to cheer me up. I just want to share my feelings. I just want to say it out loud, that I am exhausted. I am just... afraid. I dont want to mind my parents either. I live away from home. I dont want them to be worried about me. I dont want them to know that their daughter is really suffering with this university life. 

I know that these things above may just trivial normal things happen in everyone's life, but for now, I dont have anyone to talk to, I feel really lonely. I'm scared.

I hate that i'm so lonely I would kill to have a simple conversation or be able to develop a meaningful relationship with anyone and I can't.
There is not a single way I can come in contact with another person.

If I don't do anything no one will ever notice me or try to talk to me first. No one has ever shown any interest in me or made any effort to talk to me in any way.

If I try to talk to someone in person, that will also not work because its socially unacceptable to try to talk to random strangers in public unless its to ask a simple question.

If I try to message someone online I will probably just get screenshotted and laughed at or ridiculed for ""trying to slide into someones DMs"".

I'm 20 years old and I have nothing and no one.
I don't see how this could ever change. I will never be able to get close with anyone or open up about anything.

I think the reason is just who I am as a person. I don't really show how I really am to anyone but either way both are infuriating to be around. It's like there's surface level me (that tries to just stay out of the way and be 'normal') and there's the real me (which I can't bring myself to like). I feel like I'm too obnoxious, not smart, no talents or skills, the only thing I think I'm good at is staying out of people's way.

So I left a relationship around 2 years ago and it utterly broke me. He cheated, it knocked me for 6 and I've spent the past 2 years trying to form relationships and just not getting anywhere. 2 years ago, I worked a soup kitchen and last year, I thought I was spending it with my family but they were all busy with partners and I was left with my Gran which was shit but hey, it was one christmas. I feel terribly lonely that year. So much so I woke up on Christmas day with my stomache in pain at the thought of everyone I knew waking up with someone who cared while I was really just caring for my Gran because she can't be left alone.  I just remember how silent everything was. No conversation. Nothing.

This year, I feel a bit stronger (I've really worked on myself) but I am still single, still on my own. I live alone, I just moved for a new job in a city where I know no one and I've been away from my hometown in Scotland all year. I was really looking forward to getting home and seeing my family when boom. They did it again. My mum, my siblings (who only ever contact me when they need money), uncles and aunts all want to be with their partners and even Gran is elsewhere. I'm so angry. They know how dark my mental health has been.  My career is always doing great but mentally, I'm always breaking down and a part of that is being on my own so much. They know this. I spent hundreds of pounds on train tickets I can't get refunded. If I go to visit ANY friends, itl be a hotel and there's no excuse. My whole family live in the same city. There are people without families but I have one and they are just lazy. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this rant. I'm just really struggling with loneliness and complaining about it just gets met with my mum going ""Well, I can't force people. Maybe you have a nice friend you can visit?"".

Maybe I need to find someone who I consider to be as perfect as myself? My sexual/romantic life is so stale I have almost forgotten the affection of another living soul. I‚Äôm in my peak age bracket and should be comforted by others and feel welcomed. But instead I lay in my room feeling like I don‚Äôt even know anyone. I‚Äôve tried desperately to meet new people but I have such a hideous personality I rarely get as far as making plans. I use University and work as an excuse for having no social life when I‚Äôm practically feeding my own melancholy and loneliness.

My mom pressures me sometimes by saying that people in my age are starting having families, have a job and be these perfect human beings. For efs sake, I'm 21 and my mom is 53 so I understand that her views are a bit old but still, it's giving me pressure. Also, like how you explain to new ppl that you aren't fully normal (I have medical condition)?? (tips are needed!)

I've heard many times from my mom that my look and attitude aren't giving me any friends or boyfriends or anything. Idk is she serious (probably not) but still...social media is giving me pressure of the way I look etc. My own standarts are a but specific and I just feel scared a bit. Like....there's supposed to be a someone to everyone right?

I am having a really hard time this past few months with being lonely. I am a freshman in college and there are only a few weeks to my first semester. I fell really burnt out at this point not because of the hard work, but because I didn't accomplish any of my goals for this semester. I give 110% of my ability to school every day and I continue to do so despite how unhappy I am. I have good grades and my teachers like me, but this is not what makes me truly happy. All I have wanted for as long as I can remember is to find a girl who loves me. I see couple after couple at school every day and it really hurts because I have never experienced what they have. I'm 20 years old now and I haven't even been on a date before. I know that I deserve love just like anyone else does, but when I actually work up the courage to ask a girl out it seems like crazy things happen to prevent it. I have picked a girl that I want to ask and she works in the library every tuesday night. One week I had a doctors appointment, the next the library closed early, this Tuesday school got cancelled due to snow. In reality the chances of her saying yes are probably pretty low anyway, but I'm so tired of sitting and waiting for something to happen to me.

Think it was that damn easy, we wouldn't be having this conversation now would we? Everywhere I look people are holding hands, kissing and laughing.. they look so happy, so loved.   
All you wanted was to be looked at the same way, to be held and hold others the same way.

*Don't think about it.*  
You think I haven't tried? I damn well wish I can be as blissful as other single folk, not wanting a relationship. Must be easy to say such a thing. *Least you had a relationship...you don't know the pain of a lifetime of loneliness.* How can they understand?   
***You think I have a choice in the matter?***  
I'm alone not because I want to, I'm alone because I have to...it's because of who I am, the entire package, that makes me unlovable.  
I am an eccentric among my own people, among the stars of cyberspace...how do you think I look to normal people, down here in reality?

I'm not mainstream, and I refuse to be...it ain't who I am...it just ain't...but that means I'm foreign to everyone. Nobody understands when I ramble on about my favorite anime or video game, or when I share with them my history memes...or talk about politics and the world the same...They do not share my enthusiasm...they do not even understand...they only pretend they do...

I put on a mask of sorts, yes....but it is part of me, but it ain't all of me. You want what's on the outside? Heh, scratch that, you don't even want what's on the outside...If I can't provide that, how can you accepted such complexity on the inside? No one wants to put up with all of this...

Everyone loves to be around me, but no one cares enough to love me. They say don't worry, me of all people will be fine...but they don't know...they don't know my pain...they act like they do...but they don't know all of me...  
***Damned if I do, damned if I don't.***

Romance for me is like bashing my head against a wall. When I was younger, I thought maybe persistence would help me break through, but as I age, I only become tired. They say believe in yourself, as if I hadn't tried. There is only so many times I can hit my wall against that wall, so many times I can get rejected. At some point the subconscious takes over, it doesn't want me to hurt myself no longer for the sake of self-preservation.   
***I've given up, given up on myself, accepted my lot in this life, destined to be alone...but my feelings refuse to leave me alone.***

I don't want to think about this, I want to forget all about this stupid chase, live the other parts of life and be free of these chains of emotions. But no matter what happens, it haunts me, creeps up on me...hurts every fiber of my being.

 I want, I crave, I ***need...***somthing I've only have had a mere sip of...somthing I've never had...somthing to help ease the raging storm inside of me...someone to be my ***anchor***.

Ideally? I want someone who understands me...Someone whom would listen to me ramble on about my favorite things...someone who understands me...someone, I can be there for...where we both can be excited about the same things...mutual love and adoration...  
***But that's nothing more then a mere fantasy...I know...I know...I know it too well...***

No...at this point, I'll settle for anybody willing to try to love me...I just need someone I can physically hold...I don't need them to fix me...I don't need anyone to try to fix me...they can't...only I can...I am the only one who can fix myself...

I just want someone to be here for me...just hold my hand as I try to ward of the chaos in my life...a back that I can lean on and not worry...and a back for me to support...*you watch my back...I'll watch yours...*

I'm young, I know...but I've always wanted children...perhaps I have more faith in raising children, then I'll ever have finding love.  
These thoughts come and go, one minute their there...next minute there gone...when will I ever be rid of this sadness...when can I be free?   
Is there hope for me? How can I believe when my history has proven me otherwise? I am a man of rationality, yet filled with emotion. A man who wants the best of others...yet to be understood fully.

2634,selectambientworks,1575359074,1,"I feel like shit. The only place I socialize is the school. That's not much and I always feel annoying there. Outside of school nobody talks to me, unless I text/call first, and usually if I do any discussion is done in 5 minutes. That just accentuates the idea of me being annoying and I grow more resilient to reach out to somebody.
I know that I exaggerate the situation in my mind, but it's just a feeling that catches me and puts me in the ground.

Anytime I hang out with anybody I just feel extra and if it starts showing that I'm not enjoying myself and people start noticing I just get a terrible feel of guilt and I try to get out of there as fast as possible. 

I'm not close to anyone in my family, my parents are divorced and since then I've been drifting further and further away from everybody. It has been like 4 years and I barely talk to my mother with who I live.

I haven't had a friend to who I could write anytime or to who I could confess any of my problems in such a long time. I don't have any friends to who I can open up. I tried and nothing came out of it: either they just didn't say anything or I just grew a feeling of asking for attention or pity from them, which is just slowly killing me.

I had a 2 year relationship which ended because of my psychical state resulted both from the relationship and my other life problems, it just left me empty. Now I see my ex and her bf everyday. I guess this contributes somehow, as, ignoring any bad aspects of the relationship, she had been the closest person to me ever. 

I tried going to a few psychologists, but so far it didn't have any results and I don't have enough money to throw them away endlessly and purposelessly. 

I try doing many things outside of school, I have a job, I have hobbies, but it just ends feeling too much when added up with my misery and I end up messing everything up.

I used to play computer games and I had friends there, with which I used to talk daily, but we fell out because of life stuff.

I just haven't felt as lonely or purposeless never as much as now. I don't seem to have any motivation or goal, and doing it just for myself doesn't work too much for me. I have no purpose for making this post, I guess I'm just unwinding because I have nobody to tell this stuff. It's just mess that keeps me from enjoying absolutely anything.

None of my friends care to ever speak to me, and I don't fit in with anyone else. My own fucking girlfriend leaves me on read for days at a time and never speaks to me when we can be together. I can't even go to my own family without being ridiculed about something. I came out as bisexual last week and they still talk shit about me in my face about it and I have, who would've guessed, no one to go to. I'm a compulsive liar and have lied about almost anything and everything to my friends and it sends me into a nervous wreck when they approach me and say ""[name]?"", I always think they're gonna find out that I really never had that expensive bass that I said I bought, that that image was actually stolen from a 100 day old thread on here, that I didn't go out with anyone that one weekend, etc. I'm really thinking that I'm losing a shitload of friends because of that but I just can't stop abiding by my constant thoughts that tell me to make myself look falsely good, to the disdain of myself and probably others that found me out but won't tell me.

Recently, I've started seeing a new therapist and she put sort of a different spin on things for me. She told me that what it sounded as if I was describing was loneliness, rather than depression and I can't stop thinking of that.  


I identify as a highly sensitive person and if I've never found life as easy as others seem to, finding it hard to stop thinking things over and worrying about things. The kind of person that I try to be is someone who is kind, compassionate and thoughtful. Sadly, the divorce, work stress and frustration with the dating scene has made mean just exhausted and cynical and I hate being like that.  


I'm realizing more and more how important genuine, empathetic and kind people are in my life and I have far too few of them around. As I look around I just see a lot of people wrapped up in their phones, doing the rat race and buying crap like crazy, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of really authentic, vulnerable connection in the world, at least not where I'm looking.   


I feel like I have a lot of love to give and I'd like to be in a loving relationship someday. I think I have to do a bit of healing first as I don't want to be this cynical, frustrated person in a relationship. I'm starting to feel like dealing with the loneliness might really help with that, but I'm not sure quite how to find the kind of people that would resonate with me.  


Anyways, just felt the need to throw this out into the universe. The holidays always seem to bring out the feels in me.

So I'm currently a 22 year old (m) in college in my senior year and I just realized a few months ago earlier in the semester that I'm actually really ugly... :(  I went to a party like I usually do but this time I was with one of my friends who is considered decently attractive. After a few drinks and a few different conversations and a few times of me getting rejected like I usually do I stopped to think and my mind was actually blown at how different of an experience attractive or even average-looking people have at life in general. I looked around and noticed pretty much everyone, even guys I would consider average were talking to girls and having a good time and laughing and the girls were super receptive and laughing and blushing and all of that and I couldn't even get any kind of response back. The next few days when I was sober I realized people actually treat ugly people a lot differently and worse than regular people... our jokes just aren't as funny, we're ""creepy"" when we try to talk to people instead of just maybe weird or eccentric, we're ""strange"" if we're generally quiet instead of just ""mysterious"" when someone is attractive. (for context I'm very physically fit, workout regularly, i have a good hairstyle and i dress nicely. In other words im doing everything i can to maximize myself but it just feels useless because i was born with an ugly face). My mom calls me attractive a lot because she probably knows how ugly i am and is trying to raise my spirits but unfortunately i can see right through that. So I've gotten extremely depressed over the past few months because of this... there's no other way to describe it besides it's just so unfair... everyone is born the way that they are and because of something that I can't change my life is just way worse than someone elses, for no reason whatsoever. I just got unlucky. I just want to be a happy and cheerful person and get to know people and make people laugh but it's like everywhere I go now I see it in the way people interact with me. It's people quickly looking away when I glance at them. It's people deliberately not moving out of the way if I'm trying to get past them because they don't feel like i'm worth it. Not only that, but you could probably tell that i'm extremely lonely... everyone around me is in relationships and i just feel like ive missed out on so much of my life. In a few years im going to get a job and start making money and then ill maybe find a girl but at that point i think she would only want me because of maternal instinct. in a few years people start looking for partners to have a family with and i think a woman would only consider me if im someone who is financially stable to raise kids or something like that. I just feel like ive missed out on any kind of relationship based on mutual desire with no end goal in mind... and that just sucks so much to think about. Thanks if you made it this far I just needed to rant a little bit because i dont understand how i can genuinely learn to enjoy life after such a massive realization that it's always going to be harder for me just because of something I could never control",lonely,Has anyone else ever realized they were ugly late in their life?,2019-12-03 14:08:40

Now I'm a realist man so when I turned 23 a couple of years ago with no prospects on the horizon, I realized that getting married in the couple years was becoming far more unlikely. What I didn't count on or see coming was that I would make it to 25 without ever having a girlfriend. I'm not socially inept or anything, I've had sexual relationships with women but nothing that lasted to be officially considered my girlfriend. It seems that women close to my age aren't interested in an actual relationship, they either just want to fuck around and get drunk. Or they are so focused on their building their career that they don't make time for anyone.  

What really bothered me was when my Mom called to wish me a happy birthday. Her boyfriend felt the need to chime in: ""You know when I was 25 I was already married with 3 kids!"" Uh, Okay?

Do you guys ever feel like you might be mental ill because of how hard it is for you to engage in social interactions, for me it‚Äôs been a pain to get out from my shell and I know nowadays I‚Äôve been overcoming my shyness little by little but I cannot stop overthinking all the time about how people really see me, I also have this ruminations about trying to figure out what people like without even asking them first and I mean you might think is common sense to ask people about anything if you‚Äôre interested but crazy as it sounds I always get stuck on my emotions and my awkwardness, I feel also that everyone knows how shy I am and that makes me more insecure.

2670,electrahedra,1575337690,1,"I have been at uni for 2 months now. I have been able to talk to one person more than once so far. I remember we met at a session being held in the chaplaincy. During freshers while everyone else was drinking, occupied and the time I realised university is just an extension of sixth form. We talked and I asked if he knew how to play chess, he didn't so I asked if he wanted to go to the chess society with me. He said he would, that was a lie as far as I can tell. We both decided to meet the next week, but the session wasnt on that week. The subsequent weeks he did not come, I asked but he said he could not find the room. I stopped after that. I invited him to my room at one point and taught him the basics, he seemed preoccupied. I tried to be lighthearted but I do not think he cared at all. He did mention he was going to taekwondo some time before that, so I said I would go with him. We went together a few times. I missed 2 weeks in a row because I felt completely unable to be around people those nights. I have been every week without fail since. I have lost interest in programming, chess, walking and nearly lost interest in guitar. Taekwondo distracts me though. I have done stretches on and off and I am able to touch my toes now. He has not been for three weeks now, he says he had an injury and could not go, but still managed to go to a social event that night, he told me. A social event I can not go to because I can not talk to people in groups. He is my only real contact here. I can not say friend or even acquaintance, we have drifted apart from whatever tenuous relationship we had before getting to that stage. It hurts more than any other problem I have. I would give nearly anything, I would endure nearly any pain for a friend. But I can't, there is no end in sight. I messaged him to ask if he was coming this week. He has read the message and not responded. 

I will have to go to the doctors this Wednesday. I have 4 pieces of work piled up. I am unable to focus. I spend most of my time browsing reddit because it distracts better than anything else. The doctor maybe the only solution remaining. But how can a doctor cure the fact I am alone

I cant remember life being good anywhere after around the age of 12. 

The only things I derive pleasure from are eating and masturbation. Reddit and taekwondo are the things which distract. My work I do because I will be a failure if I do not. The only module I look forward to on my course is the mathematics module, which I am better than most at, but the work takes me ages because I just keep switching. Scalp rubbing, toilet, scalp rubbing, toilet, reddit, toilet, guitar, reddit, toilet, scalp rubbing. Over and over. 

I feel frustration beyond comprehension, it wouldnt take much time to be my friend. If someone talks to me I talk back. I message first. I dont think I overload them. I try to be as friendly as I can. They either ignore me or hate me and push me away. I read some posts on here about people with friends. I am in disbelief. I have not had a friend in 6 years and you whine that your friend isnt kowtowing. I have noone who has ever been there for me. I am hated and ignored only. Those are the only two things people can feel towards me, hate and apathy. Generally males are hateful and females are apathetic. I am never anyones first or second choice. I am nothing. More and more I think there is one way out. The deluded masses think exit is an abnormaility. No, the abnormality is sitting next to you on the bus. He is loathed and feared. The abnormality is in pain and needs someone more than you have ever needed anyone in your life. It is built into human nature. These people are their disease as far as everyone else around them is concerned.

I do not know what to tell the doctor. I have a list of everything going wrong that he might be able to help with. I do not know if I can say about my occasional thoughts of suicide. On the one hand I think it might be safe to do so, because I have not thought of methods, other than thinking several times jumping is the worst idea. Thats how you end up paralysed, sent to a physical hell in addition to whatever you have before. On the other hand he might think I am fixated enough to be at risk. I do not want to be watched. Even before I experienced paranoia I did not like to be watched

Life alternates between pain and neutrality. There is no pleasure any more beyond my base urges. I have become degenerate in that way

I hide what I feel. No one else knows. The people who have known I am alone have only taunted me or ignored me. You might think that is delusion, but it is the truth, throughout secondary and sixth form, abuse only. Never help. Thinking back on that, it makes me wonder if a friend is worth anything at all. All humans properly formed to design are degenerate in groups.

My mother I can not tell. She is friends with the mother of someone who went to my sixth form who was obnoxious to me, despite the fact I tried being nice back, or just ignored him. My mother seems to think it is ansport to tell everyone she can anything new she has learnt about me. She has some sort of mental illness and I have seen she is on the SSRI sertraline. Wheb I tell her not to tell anyone else anhthing aboht me she has screamed at me. She says it is normal to tell other people what is happening. She has said disgustibg things to me. She has now multiple times told me I will never have a girlfriend (although I am probably not straight so she might not be wrong there) I will never marry, I will have no friends. As far as she is concerned she is perfect. The house looks like a rubhish tip. I alternate between hating her, forgiving her briefly and apathy. Currently apathy, the hate was renewed when she screamed at me for half an hour these things while driving me to the train station. The cycle will never end. My dad has enough problems working a physical job for little money. I have grandparents on my dads side, but I do not want to worry them and I not think they believe there can be anything medically wrong with the brain and by extension the mind.

2678,Adamzima,1575331143,1,"Hi, I think I have finally accepted I have depression because of how lonely I feel sometimes. My body has gotten so used to it that the feeling doesn't stay for long but sometimes it just lasts for days.
Basically that shit never gets old. It's just dormant inside.

I cannot go to malls, clubs or gatherings without getting triggered seeing couples or girls whom I wish to talk to. I have tried talking to strangers before but they deflect instantly. At one pt I gave up meeting someone new unless someone introduces you to someone but that's never happened because our high school gang still hangs out together so the circle never gets big.

I just went to a club today and this girl was so hostile because she was alone and bored and I asked her if she's enjoying this or if she's getting bored.

2682,Vespid90,1575328793,1,"It was my birthday. I was ready to spend it all alone, dreaming of someone to love and drinking until I pass out. Then, in the evening, I received a message from my friend saying ""Happy birthday, when are we going to celebrate?"" I was so excited, that someone besides my parents and brother remembered what day it was. I replied, that I'm not going to throw huge party, but I would be honored, if he and his wife came to my place for a drink. Obviously they accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after they arrived. We spent some nice time watching Friends and drinking. It was middle of a week, so his wife had to go in order to get up early. I took few days off and he had work at 12, so we decided to stay at me and keep drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, he mentioned situation from a while ago, when he and our other friends decided to visit me and I turned them down and ordered to get the fuck out of here. Then I broke. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I told him how lonely I feel. How painful it is. How keep going became so difficult for me. I told him about moments, when I was with him or with our friends, which strengthen my loneliness and pushed me further from them. He let me speak out my mind, first time in years apparently. After I stopped speaking, he suggested me a therapy and that he could pay for it (he is quite wealthy). I told him the truth. I am in no need of a therapy. I need basic human interactions. Messaging one another, going to parties, watching movies together etc. He replied, that he will help me with that. I was so happy back then and couldn't wait to end my loneliness. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do you want to know what happened next?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Absolutely fucking nothing.

 

 

It's been weeks. No single message, no single invite, nothing.

 

 

We met once by occasion during our common friend's birthday party. He did not even mentioned what I told him back then. What is more, I've seen a facebook's post of him, his wife and our common friends attending a party, without me of course.

 

 

Did I broke? Was my heart disintegrated and my soul crushed? No

 

 

It made me stronger. It made me stronger, because it proved that I was right from the very beginning. They are one of reasons behind my loneliness. They never wanted to hear me out, they never caring for my feelings and my whereabouts. They treated me like a background character and reached me out only when it suited them. That one time when I told them to get the fuck out here, they came drunk to my place in the middle of night at my working Wednesday in a need of finding next drinking spot. Truth is, they are egoistic, narcissistic, shallow bastards with that one guy in particular. 

 

 

He was ready to give me money, while he couldn't text me ""what's up"". He and this entire world is a fucking joke. If you are lonely, people wants you to go away. They are even ready to pay you for that. You can't be lonely. You have to be happy. You have to socialize in a way they tell you. You have to post as much as possible on social media. YOU CAN NOT BE DIFERENT.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hear me out my dear lonely souls. You are the only one, who can make you happy. Don't avoid loneliness, avoid people who makes you feel lonely. Don't let them tell what to do. Find your own way. Loneliness is a high price you pay every day for being yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am so done with my so called friends. I shall keep looking for that one soul I could spend rest of my life with. I have found strength in a darkness and accepted it.

&amp;#x200B;

2686,Schattenmeer,1575325264,1,"Basicly the title.

I sometimes really wish I would have a crush on someone just to be finally interested to get to know someone.
Most people around me are.. Well. They don't interest me. Yea it's nice to talk to them sometimes but that's it. 

I'm currently in a research group and honestly I'm not even interested in getting to know any of them. Some of them seem nice, others not so much. Maybe it's because I'm not interested in research and their jobs. Idk. It feels really lonely there because I'm doing something completely different than everyone else. Because of that my motivation was really low during the whole internship. 

Sometimes I see people and think 'man I really would like to be friends with them' but that's basicly because their looks and there would be no way to get to know some people that you see in public transportation once. (and honestly, nobody would want to be my friend because of _my_ look, it's so weird) 

I feel kind of shallow for this kind of thinking. Because when I start to get to know someone they're becoming more interesting (I mean normal-friendship interesting). I met people online and became friends with them and they are really cool. Just - - making a start is so hard. 
And sometimes keeping these friends is even harder.
I had that group of 3 male friends and we would play online games every day but life kind of hit everyone of us and also I lost interest in that game and we just stopped talking? Every few month we write a little in our group chat and that's it. It's kinda sad.

Currently I spend my evenings with people in a voice chat where everyone just plays their own game. We're kind of a collection of loners, I guess. It's nice but it feels kind of shallow and most of the time I'm just there for the background noises and do my own stuff. Even if I would want to take part in the conversations - I just have no idea what to say.

2691,Insanity290,1575322247,1," I recently just lost me best friend for 2 and a half years to an his ex that he started talking again to recently.  She hated me and he said that he never took sides but he lowkey kinda did. She hated me and threw shit in my face like ‚Äúhe‚Äôll love me no matter what‚Äù and ‚Äúme and him are pretty close now‚Äù which bothers me because I was ALWAYS there for him when he had a break down and even when the tried getting together and only lasted a day because she chose her EX instead of him. He hated her and they started talking again last month. He‚Äôs been distant and i said ‚Äúit feels like you talk to her more than to me, john and justin‚Äù (friend group)  He said he‚Äôs been busy which he has been but its not right to prioritize his ex instead of his friends. 

 So after i fought with the ex on instagram after her making a post about me i said ‚Äúlook i dont think i can hang out when you get back or talk to you.  You know i cant stand her and if she is as close as she says she is to you then you don‚Äôt really need me anymore to help you when your have stuff going on‚Äù  as soon as I said that he ended the call and then I broke down. 

 I‚Äôve always been lonely so when he became my friend I prioritized him over a lot of people and I became friends with his friend group and he helped me a lot so I decided to always be there for him and care for him. I started to like him and I even told him but I wasn‚Äôt his type. But we became friends with benefits.  It hurt me because I liked him with my entire heart and he only like me as a friend but fucked me like a lover. It killed me because it made us closer and i was afraid of losing the friendship so I continued it. But after all of this I dont think its gunna happen again. I also called me two friends john and justin who were supportive and helped me.  John knew the ex because he is best friends with my friend (Nate) and he hated her. I sent him the screen shots and he said that He would talk to him but i was afraid because i didn‚Äôt want justin and john ganging up on nate so I told justin to not say anything. John later texted me saying that nate didn‚Äôt love her but it wasn‚Äôt the point that i wanted to hear. At this time i still dont know what I wanted to hear.  I know all of this is a mix of my jealousy and hatered but i dont understand how 2 1/2 years of friendships can be tossed away that easily.  

 Now I‚Äôm not crying because i cant anymore.  In my head I just want to get better. Like lose weight (I‚Äôm obese and I‚Äôve always had low self esteem) and possibly dye my hair again because i loved the color. But its like i dont have enough motivation to do anything. Even if i think ‚Äúthis is for my and my better health‚Äù its nothing and I even tried being stupid and thought ‚Äúi can change and when nate comes back to naugy, he‚Äôll see what he‚Äôs missing‚Äù and it still wasn‚Äôt enough.

2692,skepho,1575319318,1,"The 1st question: Why do I see through these eyes?

I‚Äôm on a road. A lonely road to solve the mystery that is my existence. To answer questions that seem to have impossible answers. I have traveled to the Last Frontier in search of these answers. How much further must I go? 

This road is a lonely one. Everyone I‚Äôve ever met, talked to, or just seen have only stayed for as long as it took to walk by them. I miss some, I hate others, and I‚Äôm anxious about meeting more. My road has taught me that everyone leaves in the end. I wish I could just stop from this road and be with someone but I can‚Äôt. I must answer these questions. I must find the answers to my existence even if that means I must die alone as much as I‚Äôve lived alone. In the end, will these questions even get answered? Will I find peace? These must get answered.  From the ashes I must trudge on. With bitter tears I must keep going. 

The biggest question of my life, is one that I once asked my mom when I was 5. I asked her ,‚Äùwhy do I see through these eyes?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt know how to respond. I knew what I was asking. I wanted to know why I‚Äôm living this life and not another. I wanted to know what was so important for me to experience this existence. From this singular perspective. Why? So came forth the 2nd question: 

What am I supposed to see? 

I‚Äôve put myself in situations just so I could feel accepted, included even. That way I can feel ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Loved. And most important: understood. But none came to pass. No one seen the road I‚Äôm taking. No one understood me. Why would someone walk a road that is meant for one person? No one can. So I must keep walking and I have to look at other things. Where people brought me pain I must look elsewhere. I must follow my intuition and my dreams. I must go where I feel a connection with. I already taken the road to the Final Frontier. Why must I go on? 

My dreams show me isolation. Outcast. Stranded. Alone. I run down a mountain basin to avoid a river flood and come across black rock and an infinite view of ice. I feel partial to Reynisfjara as if it‚Äôs important. I don‚Äôt know why. I know not why I do the things I do. I just want to know why I see through these eyes and what is it that I‚Äôm supposed to see with them. But I‚Äôm tired. Tired and lonely. I want to lay my weary head to rest as Kansas once out it. Honestly, there‚Äôs not a day that I don‚Äôt think about dying. I want to die. I‚Äôve tried so many times and yet here I am. I hope these answers are worth it and are answerable. I don‚Äôt know if I can take this road any longer. A lifetime of pain and loneliness is too much for me. When can I finally have peace? When I answer these questions? And then what? I must go to Iceland and see what Reynisfjara has to show me. What will I see? From the shadows I‚Äôll come. The skeletal phoenix needs his rest soon so he can be reborn. What will happen to me on the beach? 

‚ÄúTo be or not to be, that is the question.‚Äù I need to know how and why I‚Äôm forced to live and see through these eyes to see this thing or things I‚Äôm supposed to see. I want to die but I must know. I don‚Äôt want to be old and look back and realize I never answered these questions. It would be a life unlived. Even if I travel the whole world. Even if I somehow transcend this existence. Even if I got everything this life could offer. I would feel unfulfilled without these questions answered. I must know what is the point soon. I want to die but I need a sign or something profound to prove that I need to go on. 

Why do I see through these eyes? 
What am I supposed to see? 
Why must I go on?

I told you in the title it is whiny, what did you expect. I lost my parents when I was very young, an only spoiled child. They left me without any kind of financial security since they were both very ill years before they died, so all the money, savings etc went for the medical bills. They both died in the span of less than 30 days. After they died I got myself some scholarships and went to university where I made some really bad decisions. I didn't finish since I started working and the pay was really good, but the job was time-consuming. Through all this, I had this friend that was my rock. See, the same month my parents died, she lost her dad, and I guess we bonded over losing our parents, though we never talked about it. No, she was always the fun one, the one that made me laugh and forget everything bad about my life. God, I loved her, I still do. She was my happy place, my happy everything. For six years, I was always craveing her company, and she was like my fix for everything bad and ugly by just being near, and being herself. I got fired from my job after almost 4 years, and I went to a different place to find work, leaving her behind. She finished her studies, and got a really great job, then another, and another, and she finally left the country, got married, and has a kid now. See, we always talked how we won't marry or have kids ciz we loved life too much. Silly, pathetic, imature...I know. But I believed it. 
I got a crappy job in the new town. Met a great guy and got married. I love him, I respect him, I would give anything to make him happy, but I don't think I am in love with him. I can't have kids, even though he wants one or two. Honestly, at this point, I don't want kids. A couple months ago I got diagnosed with a nasty chronic illness. Since the sympthoms started two years ago, I had to stop working. My husband had to get another job to support us since my medical costs are growing by the minute. So now, he works two jobs, he is never home, and when he is, he is sleeping. I am all alone, all day, every day. Sometimes I realise that I've only been talking to a cat for two days. My family distanced themselves from me when my parents died for being ungreateful brat..and maybe I was, maybe I still am. My friend's world revolves around her kid and she told me I hurt her when I started distancing myself from her when she told me about her pregnancy. My other friend, my childhood friend that was pretty close in terms that I considered her as my sister, also left the country for work, got married to this super possesive a hole, and has a kid on the way. She recently texted me that I am a shitty friend and don't know how to keep in touch or ask for help. The casual friend, coffee buddy of sorts, that I hung out with for the last year, also went out of the country for work last month, and she texted me only once. I am not makeing this sh...t up I promise. I don't see a way out, I contribute nothing to my marriage, I see my husband is not happy, I am always in pain or depressed.

Everyone already has groups and friends and doesn't care to talk to the shy guy (me) at the corner.

Man dude, I miss her. We met over the summer at a church event and she was really the only person there that treated me like a human. She actually listens to my problems and doesn't interrupt me, but she lives in Georgia and I live in Alabama. We have each others numbers and snaps so we talk whenever we can, but she's busy most of the time. Everyday I feel lonely but whenever we talk it goes away. I just miss her so much, I haven't seen her in months and its been 2 weeks since we talked because of school and what not. Me and her both have been through similar stuff too, theres just one difference. I still feel miserable and depressed but I don't think she does. So I'm scared that I'm just making her life harder and being a burden to her. Because I'm just like my mom, my anxiety skyrockets, I think of the worst will happen, and I always wear a ""mask"" around other people. Only her and some people on discord know who I truly am. Nobody at school does though, or at home. Not even my parents. I'm just worried that I'm making her sad whenever I talk to her sometimes. I'm just scared that in a way I'm making her relive her past. Because I always have the urge to cut/burn myself and she knows about it. I'm just scared that I'm worrying her a lot because she knows what I'm capable of doing to myself. I need help, and I just want to be with her. She's the only person that makes me happy, relieves my stress, and I truly do love her. I tell her it almost every night. I just wish I was there with her so I can get a hug. Thats the first thing she did when we met. She didn't know about my situation at all and now she does.

Such a rise typically is attributable to ‚Äúsomething disastrous‚Äù like an epidemic or war, lead researcher Arjumand Siddiqi says. In this case, however, the ‚Äúmisperception that \[whites‚Äô\] dominant status in society is being threatened‚Äù is ‚Äúmanifesting in multiple forms of psychological and physiological stress,‚Äù [***Newsweek*** **reports**](https://www.newsweek.com/rising-death-rates-among-white-americans-caused-misperceived-threat-their-dominant-social-status-1474038?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter).

Then, instantly, I question whether we should give it a try or not, and the answer is always no. I come up with the most ridiiiiiculous reasons. Suddenly, things that had never been a problem become an obstacle to a potential relationship. I always ruin everything. And I end up alone, and I hurt these people in the process. Every time.

Result : I'm 25 and I've never been in a relationship, and more time passes, less ready I feel, even though there's nothing I want more than being in one. I want to commit but it scares me. Also, I'm more and more ashamed by it. People my age usually have a love life, introduce their boyfriend or girlfriend to their family, move in with their partner, etc. I've never introduced anyone to my family ; I live alone, no one is ever waiting for me/I don't have anyone to wait for ; and I'm pretty sure my parents have pity for me because of how lonely I am.

I think that, in a way, it's also because I'm always in control, nothing I do is spontaneous. I unconsciously try to give a certain image of me : the one of someone who doesn't have any problem, and I guess welcoming someone in my life would ""force me"" to show how vulnerable I am.

For the past two years, I‚Äôve noticed something about myself, I‚Äôm afraid to talk to people about my problems even when it is absolutely necessary. For example, in university I hadn‚Äôt done so well in my program so I was ultimately booted and applied for a fresh start, which I did get accepted into and got into another program. This program requires me to talk to an academic advisor as well as someone else to ‚Äútalk me through my issues‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt enjoy burdening other people with my problems so I seclude myself from putting myself into situations were I would need to talk about my problems. Anyways, it‚Äôs come to the point where it‚Äôs actually affecting everything I do in life. Crippling loneliness as it were and nobody to talk to about it, but it‚Äôs my own fault for putting myself in this situation anyways. My life two years ago was completely different, had friends. had a girlfriend and I was really happy. Obviously two years later, things happen, people exit your life and that isn‚Äôt my problem.

No one asks how I'm doing, parents are an exception, of course, no one asks what I'm up to, no one asks to chill with them.

I hate to make stories personal cause usually not as many people comment cause it's ""a you problem"", but I used to have so many friends in high school, was the leader of the group and I had lunch with a friend recently, he said he was bi and that he was figuring out his life and how he felt about the way I treated people, he also reminisced about the bitterness I had in high school or ""savageness"" and that's why lots of people liked me cause I was funny and stuff, but in reality I probably hurt more people than those that I made laugh, maybe that's why they all parted ways. 

I guess it all makes sense now, this is why I deserve this I guess. It also sucks when you are 18 and haven't been in a relationship and anything you get that's close to it ends in a hope crushing way, pushing you down deeper.

With that said, we‚Äôre looking for kind, accepting individuals to be friends with. We need more positive energy in our lives and people who genuinely enjoy our company. 

The good thing about being friends with a system is that you get a handful of friends for the price of one. 

Our interests include: video games, music, art, cartoons, ARGs, horror stuff (like YouTube videos, movies, shows, etc.), text based roleplaying, DnD, collecting things and miniature versions of stuff. 

We like to play games with friends, voice chat, watch things together and just chill in general. We enjoy good jokes and good memes. Some of us can be described as goofy, though some of us could be described as tsundere. But they warm up with time.

I'm 15 and have been making bad decisions recently and have always been a mix between introverted and extroverted so being grounded all the time and not hanging out w friends never bothered me but i also lived party's. I was abused real bad when i was little and that caused me to have anger problems and so I've always had a mean streak. A few months ago I had to start doing group therapy and it doesn't help very much but im forced to go there. I did lsd twice in the past couple months and my whole perspective on life has changed. I feel like there's not really a point on life and I had alway d felt comfortable being alone and was perfectly fine if I had no one to talk to. When ppl said they felt lonely I just couldn't relate but had sympathy for them. Ever since I did the lsd tho I've felt that none of my friends are real friends and that they don't care abt me but it didnt really bother me bc I had myself and weed.

So you isolate yourself to know that in your choice, you've chosen a life where you can luxuriate in a bliss of not having to put a mask upon your face to commune with those around you.

But life without society can feel so cold and empty at times. And man sees not warmth in community, but endless empty streets, benches without occupants, parks without park-goers and the list goes on.

2757,StupidAssPotato,1575252636,1,"I (20M) had a ex-BFF () and I met my ex-BFF in my middle school 6th grade year online from Xbox 360 live services. I stayed in touch with her through the years and created a strong friendship with her, completely viewing her as a best friend and nothing more but she sought something more intimate than best friends and I had some strict guidelines that made me refrain from entering that intimate relationship with her. To provide more info on her, she started developing feelings for me when I had entered my sophomore year in high school and had confessed to me for the first time mid-school year. I respectfully responded to her and told her that I couldn't establish a relationship with her because I didn't like her, along with other reasons like; she lived in Seattle while I lived in California (I couldn't handle a long-distance relationship), I was fearful of ruining our friendship by being a bad boyfriend, she's the ex of my male best friend who I still keep in touch with). She was an extremely smart girl too and pretty with a small figure and long hair. She was popular while I was kinda meh at my school, knew a lot of people but never had true friends except for my BFF. We had a strong connection like we would call each other in the morning while walking to school, after school walking home, and usually late at night until we fell asleep on the phone (rip phone bills to parents :c). Whenever I had a personal problem stressing me out, homework stuff, or a tantrum, I would rant out my feelings to her and she would honestly make me feel better and conform myself. All the while talking about her day to me soothed me and gave me comfort that she was doing well on her side. Though things didn't stay static like this as I mentioned earlier that she confessed her feelings to me that I turned down, I offered that I'd still be her best friend and she was obviously upset but took the offer and was thankful I stayed the same though 3-4 years in a row, she continued to confess her feelings to me and I did my best to minimalize the pain I'd cause to her when I declined every time. I'd even encourage her to find other guys in her area because I didn't want to elevate our level of friendship. It wasn't til I was 17 and she was 15 when she started going out to party with others and said she was changing and it was true as I watched my best friend change from a humble 4.0 GPA early university student to well just a 4.0 GPA student of the University of Washington that parties hella hard now chugging soju and .. hooking up with guys which kind of brings tears to me while I type this because I blamed myself since my later half of senior year in high school for her negative change of lifestyle. I noticed that she started to get somewhat annoyed of me at times when I would talk about someone I'm interested in (maybe I was careless of her feelings, I think so.) and she would talk explicitly about the guys that she meets that are so rich, handsome, and are amazing int'l students while I'm just a fucking couch potato lol, honestly I am quite the cozy couch potato anyway back to the story, she would I guess try to make me feel jealous and I honestly did though I mostly was kinda happy that she was enjoying herself, just kinda because she was usually with a new guy every time we talked which was about once every 2 weeks-3 weeks because of how busy we were with school. One day I assumed she was drunk and she texted me saying why I wouldn't accept her and randomly said things like how she didn't care that I thought I wasn't cute, or smart enough to go straight to a 4-year university (I'm getting into CSULB Fall 2020...so...I am kinda smart), or that I was living with my parents still (EVERYONE I KNOW THAT IS SMART LIVES WITH HER PARENTS STILL WHY IS THIS AN ISSUE), but I told her I wasn't comfortable with us getting into a relationship so she started ranting about her feelings even more and I tried to reason with her then she started insulting me and it kind of flipped a switch in me and I bursted with outrage calling her an unreliable friend that belittles me when I try my best to help her out, I called her things I shouldn't have like 'slut' for always messaging me about how she took in a 7 inch guy with her throat, and I find that sketchy because she's like 4'7"" but who knows. Though I hurt that trust that she had because tbh, giving out that kind of information is pretty hard unless you absolutely trust and are comfortable with the person you're talking to it about. Though all in all, she and I blocked each other though her birthday resides on a certain day in June and I always message her happy birthday even if we weren't friends, or are 'archnemesis'. She would reply thank you each time and despite how our relationship had ended, I still look up her instagram accounts and like to check up on her to see how she's doing, seeing posts of her cooking, her artwork, just her going to EDM concerts or festivals warms me up because though she's caused me a whole deal of pain, I'm thankful for meeting her for the good times we had. I feel that she hates me for what I said and still has me blocked but a few days ago, she liked a few of my photos from my public instagram posts and I don't know what to think of that as.

For the readers, I'm sorry if the quality of this post is shit, I honestly was jumbling through my memory to keep it accurate, I am actually leaving out a lot of stuff about her that I find readers would possibly see as toxic like her immediately disliking anyone I sought as a possible relationship partner or being overprotective and too-clingy for getting annoyed at me not responding to her messages when I'm asleep.

It sucks to think that if I were to win a trip for two, whoever I pick wouldn't be the person who picks me. I want to book a trip to an all-inclusive resort in a month, and I have no one to go with.

There aren't as many opportunities to go talk to other alone people like in hostels. 

Whenever someone says they're lonely or alone or have nobody, they get told to go out and meet people. I've done that. But I'm never someone's first. Whenever I meet someone and they mention their best friend, it makes me sad because it reminds me I don't have one, and haven't since I was 8 years old, and that I'll never be that person's best friend because that slot is already filled.

A friend who has lost contact with me and doesn't respond to my texts because she is now occupied with her own life and boyfriend. Friends who update me about their lives yet never ask me about my own. One of the only people I have ever had in my life who asked me about how I felt has his own problems to deal with and often doesn't answer his phone. Family who only want to listen to the tidbits of my problems and disregards them if I tell them too much. A mom who tells me that I will never be in a successful relationship because of the way I look and the way I act. A dad who is never around and throws money at me to make it seem like he is still an active part of my life. I join clubs and reach out to old friends. They don't pay attention.

So because of that I grew up alone, all by myself and to be honest I don‚Äôt hate it, I got used to it. But now that my parents quit that job they had, I was able to establish myself in one place and I was looking forward to form meaningful friendships and even perhaps find a SO.

I listened to everybody‚Äôs problems, provided amazing advice, and rarely ever judged. I constantly put other people before myself. I would go out of my way to be nice, because I loved when people went out of their ways to be nice to me. I loved making others feel good. 

Unfortunately, It has not been reciprocated because I have no friends. I do not have any friends that call me to hang out. I do not have any friends that reach out just to check up on me. I always thought that being good to others would guarantee that you would have people to fall back on, but that has not been the case for me. 

It bothers me so much especially since some of the most judgmental, negative, toxic, ugliest ppl I have ever known have tons of friends to spend time and hang out with. I always hear people talking about their friends, saying things like, ‚Äúmy friend is extremely annoying and such an racist asshole but I love her. We hang out all the time‚Äù. It‚Äôs very confusing.

TL;DR: I am nice to everybody and have no friends. I know ppl who are terrible to everybody,  yet are extremely popular and well-liked/loved by many. Is that confusing to anyone else?",lonely,"How do terrible, mean people have friends?",2019-12-02 11:31:24

I felt like nobody would ever want me. 

Fast forward, and now I‚Äôm a healthy weight. I‚Äôm slender and graceful. Nothing like the clumsy mass I once was. People tell me I look good. My friends tell me ‚Äòthat guy‚Äôs checking you out!‚Äô My mother genuinely looks happy to see me and parades me around when her friends come over.

But inside I feel sick and ugly. I still feel like that fat girl. My confidence is completely shot. I don‚Äôt trust guys who approach me ‚Äî I‚Äôm still convinced they‚Äôre only being nice so they can get close and make fun of me.

Basically, even though I count myself as a lot happier than I‚Äôve ever been, I still feel so damn lonely, even lonelier than I ever did before. For context, I‚Äôm 16, male and gay af.

I have people that I care about a lot, okay‚Ä¶ only one really. I count him as family even though we‚Äôre not related and only know each other for about four month. I know he wont leave me, but there‚Äôs still something that makes me scared so much about it turning out that everything is a lie and he just leaves me for no reason like people did before him. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have no intention of ever wanting to have him as my boyfriend or anything, I see him as more than that.

Apart from that, I have no one. I have some ‚Äúfriends‚Äù at work and school but honestly they don‚Äôt really care about me and neither do I about them (even though I‚Äôd never tell them that).

So.. enough backstory. My real issue, and why I feel so lonely is that I never had any sort of boyfriend and no reason to think that I‚Äôll get one any time in the foreseeable future. Yes, I know that it‚Äôs just stupid and I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about this and that I‚Äôll probably find someone at some point but, tbh, I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true really. Everyone I know at least has or had someone, I'm just lonely and never had someone.

I just want someone to cuddle and give all my love to.

Also not helping the fact is that I literally never met a gay guy irl and that just makes me feel even worse. Like‚Ä¶ I have contact with people in the LGBT-community, most of my online friends are part of it. But irl, I know two LGBT-girls and not a single gay guy and it‚Äôs depressing me more than I'm willing to admit.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I can live with that, even though I really don‚Äôt want to. But it‚Äôs just depressing me and making me sad, especially when I see couples being happy together and most of my friends finding partners them self (although that usually doesn‚Äôt always last long, but the point still stands).

Hi, my name is Lumirogen, it's not my real name, but just call me M.

I'll start where I feel like most people would get why I struggle the way I do, I grew up with a single parent who was abusive and neglectful, and because of that, I grew up selfless, and I don't really think of myself that often, and that resulted in having to cope in bad ways, I.e, substance abuse, self harm, going up unto rooftops I'm not allowed at because of not really putting helpful coping skills into practice. 

It's just there are very few places I feel like I can go to to recharge, so I feel as I get older, I feel like one day, I'll just stop giving a crap whether or not I'm going into places I'm not allowed to be at, it'll become a problem, especially involving my mental health and my living situation.

I moved out not too long ago, say a few months ago from my toxic environment, and I am struggling, I admit that, I grew up cut off from the world and my *want* to get better with that is getting stronger as much as my want to kill myself is, I do have suicidal ideation, but I do want to say that I don't feel like I am suicidal, it's just, I don't have any healthy coping skills nor do I feel like I want to put that into practice having major depressive disorder and PTSD myself, I do have hope for myself, but I just keep struggling because I feel like I'm stuck in a feedback loop of not wanting to care, but at the same time, I feel like there is something inside of me that does want to care, so in between that is what I feel like my fight or flight response is messing me up.",lonely,[L] tired of living,2019-12-01 20:54:27

A while back I went to a party my family was invited to, and a friend I don't get to see often also went. We have known each other since we were babies and she is somehow also an introvert and awkward person like me. I had always seen her as one of my only friends till that day. We were talking about some stuff and out of nowhere she asked for my number so after that day we talked every day, I eventually told her all of my problems, and how I've hurt myself before and she seemed to really care, then I started to get to know her better and I felt happier than ever before in my life since she always checked up on me and made me feel important to someone.

But my stupid self had to fuck it up. I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, she said yes which made me even happier, so I started trying to always be happy and make her feel as happy as possible but the problem begins one day like a month ago she left. She told me she didn't feel ready but that we could still talk as friends (she hasn't texted me since, and I don't since I feel like Ill bother her) yet I can't help but think it's my fault. My unstable self was probably too much for her and I feel worse than I ever did. 

I feel like talking to people and making friends isn't worth it, I'm only getting hurt in the end, I feel like I shouldn't tell people my problems, I thought I'd finally found a purpose in life, and that was to live for someone who wanted me to be there, and now I'm back to feeling worse than before, I don't have a purpose again, no one cares about me, my self-conscious mind is killing me and I don't see a future in myself.

Friends that have moved away are much the same. Yeah, invite me to a party, and then leave the party, so another friend can join my party and then leave it to join your party, all so you can play a game that I don't own while I wait a week for about an hour of actually playing a game with you guys before you go play another game I don't have.

I know all my friends are out at each other's houses, watching movies, and doing other stuff while I'm sat here at home with nothing to do and noone to talk to until I get back to school, only for the cycle to repeat. I don't so much as hear about any of this until it's already happened, either.

""Last night Friend and I did this and that."" Oh, really? That's cool. Shame, though, as I never get invited to have fun with you guys after school.

2833,Little_Pumpkin202,1575181814,1,"It's 3am here, I'm listening to music in my dark room, the same place I've been in the past 2 weeks. 

Sorry, I think I should give some context. 
I'm a 15 year old male, I have no friends, only some people I barely talk to, my parents divorced a few years ago and I've stayed alone at my father's apartment in the past few weeks, alone, in the dark. 

I've had this hole in my chest for a really long time, I can't really talk to anyone, so I've decided to talk about in the internet, with strangers. 

I have a feeling like I don't have a purpose, that nothing really matters, and that has been affecting my grades over the past few years, and this year (I live in South America, my school ends in November/December) I'm probably not going to pass. 

I've never really had any friends, I remember a few things about me when I was younger. I used to have violent tendencies when I was 5-7 years old, but I'm rather calm now, avoiding violence at any cost. When I grew out, my class had a few groups of friends, two groups of boys, one of girls, and me. I was alone, with exception of one year, when a new student with mental difficulties showed up for a while. He was fun, we had a sincere friendship, but he left as soon as the year was over, and I was alone again. After that, I tried getting in a group, but one didn't even wanted to talk to me, and the other only let me in to make fun of me. And I was okay with that. I let them make fun of me, thinking that's what friends do, but, of course, it isn't. Now, most of them pretty much regret it, except for one guy, he was a dick and still is. 

Then I moved to Florida for a year, and that was fun, I guess. I still hadn't many friends, just one or two, but they were cool, I guess. Never spoke to them again, I wonder how they are.

And that's when my grades started decaying, moving to another country then back messed up everything in my school live, from what they were teaching to the school time. 

Math was, and is, my biggest problem, I had no idea how to do the complicated stuff they were teaching back here when I was in Florida, so the first two years back I barely passed, but the last it was my teacher's kindness who let me pass, and I still was in complete ignorance of half the things they were teaching.

Now I'm in high school, first year, in, once again, another school, and I'm not going to pass, there's absolutely no way I'm going to manage to score high enough tomorrow, but... I don't know, I feel like that doesn't really matter, I just feel like staying in my dark room playing videogames, listening to sad/romantic music, eating crappy food and watching YouTube late a night, waking up at 2pm, and doing it all again.

But some nights, like this one, I can't sleep, the hole in my chest becomes too hard to ignore and I just stay there, wanting to restart my life, see if I can get lucky and this time make things the right way, then maybe I could be worth what my parents think I am, then maybe I can have the will to do the stuff they think I can do.

I have a good life, that's not really the problem, I am. If I wasn't a self centered dick then maybe I could make some friends, some real friends.

I am sorry, I don't really know if this is the best place to post this, but I really don't know what else to do with all this inside my chest. If you've read until here, thank you, you don't need to comment, give an upvote or dm me, just know I'm thankful someone actually used their time to read my long (and maybe unnecessary) post.

All I want is for someone to be there for me as much as I‚Äôll be there for them. I need someone who won‚Äôt ghost me for being clingy because I was worried about them. I want someone who I feel actually loves me. Instead, I‚Äôm shy, antisocial, introverted, and overall idiotic. My mannerisms(?) are so awful I‚Äôm possibly autistic (coming from a psychiatrist).

They all asked why and how. I always try to keep laughing about it and pretend that it's no big deal but everytime someone says ""why? You are pretty and smart!"" Something in me breaks a bit more apart.
Yes i would love to have someone too love and care, share a lifetime. But I have the most awkward body shape, unclear skin and every Guy just wants to have the benefits of ""friends with benefits"". they don't care for me. And i think they would be ashamed introducing me to someone else as a girlfriend or just a friend.
It hurts and i hate this question soo much. I don't know the feeling but i would say it's similar to the ""are you pregnant"" or ""when will you have kids"" question for someone trying hard to have kids.

I've been the sexdate for a guy for almost 7 years. We met through facebook and in the beginning i really thought he's interested in me, not only in having sex. 
I told him i have feelings for him but he rejected me. I still let him come over. This half an hour ever 2-3months make me feel like someone cares, even if he just comes over to satisfy his own needs. He's not even texting back if I ask him to come over. 
I tried several times to stop but i can't. It's like those 30minutes keep me alive. And i always think about if he maybe could change his mind, i know it's impossible but the imagination is nice. 

I have never had someone saying that he loves me or being happy seeing me and with every week of my life, the feeling of being unnecessary gets worse. 

Ending up alone, with nobody who cares. I always try to stay strong, saying to myself ""you don't need someone else to be happy"" but it gets harder. Every day.

I just want to share one story with you, we can all feast on it's rotten flesh, it stinks of shallowness. We go back when I was 17.

When I was 16 I was into a girl. I didn't wear tight clothes and had some extra pounds but nothing special.

So one day we were at night club and all my friends were like ""Just go for it"".

I went, she dismissed me and of course this stuck with me and guided me later on to make mistakes and suffer more.

Anyways, few weeks later I just woke up and ... I started to work out, cut bad food, got myself some tight pussy shirts or whatever.

My birthday came up, I threw a party on the beach. Already, some of people including girls were in AWE and started to treat me like I'm some Nobel prize winner all of the sudden, lol.

Girl that I was digging showed up at party. I didn't pay attention to her and I was drinking my wine like it ain't nothing.

Then when I got drunk I just remember that I was wandering talking to people and all off the sudden I bump into her and her girl-friend.

We just started to talk, had laughs, I lied down and all of the sudden I felt someone is touching my stomach.

I look up and I see my crush screaming like ""oh he has so much muscles!!"" and literally making some primal noises.

After a few moments I went outta there and next thing I know someone rushed me from behind, next moment she's kissing me on the beach.

So, as you can see from this rotten shallow story that success comes from:

Its a character I play. Its not that I hurt people. I just dont talk to them and they dont talk to me. That was the case until last year. I decided that if I'm so undesirable, I might as well just stop all my interactions. And so I did. I used to stare at my screen for 24 hours for someone to text and nobody ever did. And so I stopped bothering people. I've only been nice to people. But they dont respond. They are not nice to me. I tried suicide and was hospitalized. My parents screamed at me. They didn't act like they cared. They were just annoyed that i didnt finish it off. What could I do?  My body is full of scars and I havent shown them to anyone. I'm ashamed of my scars. I'm ashamed of who I am. I talk in the stereotypical ""gay"" way. I'm not gay. I'm just socially anxious and thats how i talk. I was bullied throughout my school year. They called me a ""Fag"". I couldnt prove them wrong coz who the fuck would date an asshole like me. I'm sure that even if I was gay, no one will date me.  

My world is full of books and music and art and movies. I occupy myself with creative pursuits. I dont write yet but I listen and read and watch a lot. Those are my only friends. I talk to people inside my head. Sometimes I see them too. Yes, hallucination. I'm totally fucking insane. 

So, now that you know something about me.  I havent celebrated any festival since I was, like, 15. I'm 18 now. And I'm just too tired. Too exhausted. Sometimes I feel like I should just give up. My corpse will rot and nobody will even come to my grave. No lover would give eulogies. No friends will talk about how good a person I was. And forget about parents. I dont think I'll survive for long. I dont think anyone will pick me up and I dont think anyone will love me. I dont ask for much, do I? These are just normal stuffs. Someone to care. To provide me with some warmth and protection. Everybody has ppl who cares. Why not me? Did you know that the serial killer Ted Bundy had a bunch of fans who never met him but who gave interviews about how he was cute and how they cared for him? They never even fucking talked with him. Jeffrey Dahmer's parents stayed with him through it all. There are even a bunch of fans of the Columbine shooters online. Theres a whole fucking community.  Look at me. I have never harmed anyone and people hate me. Why does it matter? Why be nice? 

Yeah. If you wanna talk, message me on reddit chat.",lonely,Its my birthday in 2 hours and nobody fucking cares,2019-12-01 04:25:21
2897,Innovatium,1575134211,3,"I made this mistake. At college I ment one person and I thought that guy would be a great friend, so I tried to be ""best buddies"" with him. And it worked for awhile until he started to reject me, and then I was more lonely + one damaged relationship. So why did this happen?

We're ment to have many friends, not just one friend you think you can depend on. If that one friend abuses the fact that you are his only friend. You have no one else to go to. And in my case this friend already had a network of friends. So he didn't need me the same way I needed him. And that was my fault, for not building my network.

There's nothing wrong with having one best friend, but you should also have other friends on the side. Incase one of you goes ""out of the line"". It's how we humans are ment to live, and I've realised alot of my loneliness has come from the fact that I've always searched for one best friend. But whenever I do get one, we end up on bad terms, because we become dependable on eachother, which isn't very healthy when issues arrise.",lonely,"Create a network of friends, not just one best friend.",2019-12-01 04:16:51
2898,MilkSteak_Party,1575131738,1,"I‚Äôm a 25 year old very tall kinda chubby white guy living in a house with roommates who don‚Äôt like me in Michigan right now. I have absolutely no friends in the world. I‚Äôm terrible with people in general. My life consists of getting up without sleep, going to work, coming home, and being alone in my room till I get up for work again. I hate my job building electrical harnesses to death. It‚Äôs the most soul sucking job I can imagine having and I do it 6 days a week. My coworkers are my age but want nothing to do with me. I think that they think I‚Äôm too bizarre, which I am. I have strange interests and passions, mostly in the occult, science, and art, so I‚Äôm terrible at small talk and normal conversation. I also question reality a lot, as my insomnia gives me peculiar hallucinations in the day time. I‚Äôm so terribly lonely, and it feels like my chance to break into a group I can fit into, or even to find one decent friend, is long gone. I can either go on for the rest of my life being this lonely and miserable, or I can end things sooner than that, and it is a tough choice to make.

I know sending this out to the world won‚Äôt help me one bit. People like me are generally cast aside, and rightfully so. We‚Äôre no good to society. I‚Äôve just been in the same suicidal rut for years now and with nobody to go to. Maybe putting this out there will end this fucked up simulation immediately. That‚Äôd be pretty cool",lonely,Feel like an idiot wasting my time typing this but I‚Äôm lost,2019-12-01 03:35:38
2899,antisblij,1575130980,1,"I have so much homework each day. 4 tests a week, 4 hours of homework a day. Everyday I look out of my window and see people play outside. I don't want to play ouside or something i want to be free. School is going to kill me, one day.",lonely,I want to have more free time,2019-12-01 03:23:00
2900,inceleater,1575130916,1,"""Find a hobby"" sounds like generic advice, but it really helps. Focusing on things I wanted to do/could do by myself helped me find value in myself. I realized that while even being alone I was capable without having an emotional attachment. I wouldn't have been able to put in enough work for my plants if I had stayed in those relationships. Now I have 3 giant aloe vera plants, one fern, two pineapple plants and three different types of succulent. Trying to grow a bonsai tree now!

It's okay to be alone, you'll see the value of your own company. You'll see all the wonderful things you're capable of. And maybe, through your hobbies, you'll find people who will stick around and also see your worth. If they undermine your worth, if they treat you like you don't have any value, then you're better off alone.",lonely,"When I was heartbroken and alone, I took up gardening.",2019-12-01 03:21:56
2901,matt_cov24,1575122792,1,Nothing makes me happy anymore but still have enough to get up and get about my day. Feel incredibly lonely but always surrounded by people. I don‚Äôt want to die but I‚Äôm not really sure I want to live either.,lonely,In a weird mental state,2019-12-01 01:06:32
2902,Qwertypool11,1575122787,1,"Today it hurt me the most. It hurts when the only person who ever talks to you and the only one who you've considered a true friend doesn't show up to simply meet after months of not seeing each other. I know he is ignoring me and not picking up my call on purpose. Didnt even bother to call me to cancel. I was waiting for him. I was looking forward to it. It was suppose to be the best thing thats happened to me in a long while. I've struggled with loneliness for as long as I can remember. It hurts.

I hope that those of you reading this truly find someone you can call a friend. Someone who can pull you out of your darkness. All it takes is one friend, to make this life worth living. Thats what I believe.",lonely,Friend,2019-12-01 01:06:27

2904,loonatic_odd_eye_12,1575120217,1,"I feel alone a lot. I am the only person in my class and friend group that isn't free to go outside whenever they want. They let them out as much as they want. But I have a strict ass curfew and I have to tell them with who am i going, where will I go? I want to free. At least a bit. Today two of my friends wanted to take me out with them to a few shops. If I could I would have lied and sneaked but I was scared my parents will find me there and when j come home it will become a shitstorm. I ae back home and both of my parents were home. I told my mom and she always tells me the same ""It's to far away to go by foot"" ""You have 5 bucks you cant buy anything"" ""Don‚Äòt worry I'll take you with me when j go there next time"" ""If it was that good I would have  even forced you to go""",lonely,I feel alone because of my strict parents.,2019-12-01 00:23:37
