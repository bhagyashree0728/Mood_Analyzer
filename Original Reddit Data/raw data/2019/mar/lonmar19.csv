I have a partner, he’s great and he brings a lot of joy to my life. Having a boyfriend is a recent thing and it still boggles my mind how the relationship has become so possible for me. However, I don’t have any friends or even acquaintances. And I literally mean zero. Stuff happened in my earlier years that ultimately made me a recluse and fear social interaction. I’ve not had a friend in twelve years. It’s been that amount of years being on my own, just really had my parents to talk to. I tried making friends online and sometimes great conversations were made, but long-term friendships never seemed to happen. I’ve overcome a lot in the past few years and believe I am a lot better at being social and I’m a fantastic listener. Just no one ever seems interested in forming a connection with me. I felt like I discovered who I am/my personality recently but I guess it’s not one people are drawn to. I have this desperate need to have a friend, but also there’s a part of me that has accepted that it’s likely not going to happen. Some days being lonely is very easy to ignore, other days it hits me like a truck. What can I do about this feeling? Mostly everything in my life now is better than I ever could have imagined, but there’s a sense of belonging and a genuine friendship experience that I am missing and always have.",lonely,"I hate having to acknowledge it, but it’s there: I’m lonely.",2019-03-31 19:05:47

I want to meet new people and go to social gatherings but I don't know where to start. Even just sending a text to someone I don't know too well sends my heart pounding. I am too anxious over people judging me. 

There just seems to be no way of making new friends. I feel as if I can't be myself around anyone out of the fear of being judged. People might think I'm weird... People might shut me down... How do I interact with anyone?!

So not only do i feel left out but I basically lost my best friend too.

4,GarbageYasuoFangirl,1554014530,4,"Some part of me seems to think that by posting this here all of my problems will magically go away, while the other part of my mind thinks that by doing this I am only further indulging my thoughts and intentionally making myself feel worse, but I've already started typing so no point in stopping now! 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what all I should share about my past for context, Or really how much of it actually matters but I suppose I will give the readers digest. When I was younger I was physically and emotionally abused alongside my younger brother. This happened periodically from the time I was about eight to when I was about thirteen when I finally decided that enough was enough and told someone. These abusive periods were mixed in between times that I would be told I was supposedly being ""good"", However would very quickly shift back into the abuse with next to no context. Looking back now on the events it makes a lot of the stupid thought processes I have even to this day make a lot more sense. It's hard to imagine my younger self trying to figure out what I had done wrong that deserved being hit, along with many other awful things, and what all I would have to do to go back to being what they considered ""good"", however that did eventually come to an end.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was sixteen my father committed suicide. I don't really know what to say from that. I was never really as close with my father as I was and currently am with my mother. It hurts me even to this day to think about what he did and how much I miss him, Don't get me wrong... But sometimes I feel guilty that I don't miss him as much as if it was my mother who did it instead... I love him very dearly and I feel ashamed to openly admit this now, but beating myself up with my thoughts does me no good either.

&amp;#x200B;

After my father passed I did a year of homeschooling. During this time we lived in the country so my options to go out were very limited, On top of my lack of friends. Every single day was nothing but me thinking terrible terrible thoughts, an entire year of near isolation. Looking back on it now I am very surprised I didn't self harm, Let alone take my own life. 

&amp;#x200B;

That brings me to now. Like I said these are a very ""readers digest"" of events because I don't want to sit here and write a novel, but at the same time my brain feels that if I write vague statements of events then maybe I will feel magically better because... idk that's how my thoughts work. For the first time in a very long time I do not think that I am depressed. I have come to accept my past as something that has happened and nothing can ever change it and I like to think that I am a stronger person for surviving this far. Sometimes it helps me to imagine people who face worse things and that makes me thankful that it was only these things that happened to me. Now I'm just very lonely and lacking social skills. I don't think I am ugly or unlikable or anything like that. I suppose I am just an average young adult. I just want some people to play games with or just have some companionship in general. People always talk about how this is supposed to be the best time of someones life but all I can think about is how boring and lonely it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yaaaaaayyy feelings dump. If I am honest I don't really know what the goal of this was. Maybe a cry for help in the form of friendship, Or maybe it was just an attempt to dump my feelings that I don't want to think about any longer on some small corner of the internet. I promise I'm not super weird. This is just my unfortunate portions of my life that helped shape who I am. I think everyone faces times like this.

5,SnowberryMarz,1554007646,5,"It seems like everybody has something they're into and somebody they can go to. I feel like I've had tastes of both of those things, but nothing seems like the right fit, and I think having no idea who I am or what I'm good at might be a huge reason as to why I'm just so awkward to be around. 
People have always told me to get out of my comfort zone and try new things. And for the most part, I think I live up to those standards.  I've tried everything, music, sports, art, writing, academics, etc. But I'm bad at everything, or at best average. I'm clumsy and tone deaf, maybe have 3 brain cells and they can barely navigate a Walmart.  I have no hobbies or real passionate hobbies. Why?
I feel bland and boring despite trying desperately to seem intriguing and mysterious, yet I am a quiet, anxious, scared little puppy surrounded by lions. I've got nothing to talk about, no true passions to speak on. Anything I am really into, it feels like I'm not intelligent enough to articulate my thoughts about. I feel like a hollow shell desperately searching for a core. I've got nothing. I'm like a chameleon in the sense that I blend in with my surroundings, trying to fit in but only becoming more invisible than before. 
I've always been this way
Lately I've been left with an ungodly amount of alone time. It's been miserable thinking about myself so much. But I've really started asking that question I assume we all ask ourselves at some point. Who am I? Who the hell am I in this big, beautiful, chaotic, universe? 
It's not the first time I've asked myself this question. In fact I ask this question before I decide to go through a new phase, which happens a lot. 
But I usually give up looking. Trying to let the answers find me I guess. But isnt doing nothing somehow worse? I'm just running out of ideas and things to do to fill the void. Everything just eventually fades into the same black and white mishmash of everyday life, even if it once popped with color. I'm just having such a hard time finding me. I dont feel as if I've gotten any closer to finding her as I was 10 yrs ago. I've made progress on being a kinder and more understanding human, I've made progress with my morals and my manners, but that soul? The passion? Where is it? 
I see that pilot light in peoples eyes you know? It's like a quiet constant burn and when you fuel it it becomes a beautiful fire. Everyone has that thing that when you talk about it or even start to bring up something related, they light up like a firework, they could talk endlessly about that one thing that fuels their fire. 
I feel like I dont have the pilot light to begin with, so I just spark and go out. I dont know how to find my pilot light. I dont understand why I dont have one. I dont understand what's wrong with me. Maybe its depression and nothing makes me happy because it's a literal chemical imbalance in my brain. But honestly I havent been depressed 24/7 my whole life. There has to have been something at some point in time that I fell in love with, right? 
I cant think of a thing.
And it makes me so sad, i feel like I'm missing out. Like the world is happening in brilliant radiating color and warmth, but I'm trapped in a cold dark cave.

What the fuck is wrong with me.  Why do I get so attatched.  I see someone that I like and suddenly they are what my mind thinks about when it isn’t preoccupied with anyone else.  I think of how much better things would be if I could be with her, if I could just get the actual confidence to talk to her instead of let it pass me by which become more and more a real possibility as the semester comes to a close.  What really sucks is that she lives near me and I know that if there is no relationship now there won’t ever be one later.  Not if I don’t establish it now.  She is just awesome, that’s all I have to say on that.  A simple explanation for a simple yet stunning girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean she breaks most aspects of what I'm comfortable with in a partner and I just don't care at all which makes it even more enticing to me.  I just know I won't ever have that confidence and that she's just going to dissapear come the end of April and that I'll probably never see her again and that just really really sucks.

The way I spend my time is at home (usually alone) listening to music, watching Netflix or gaming. One great social hobby I have is football but that won't fill the gap. I failed my study so I have an extended year where I have to finish my re-assignments. I also am still looking for a job. I also still live in a social isolation which I have been in since my 13th (I'm 21 now) which causes making friends to be a real challenge due to the lack of my social skills. It caused some trouble with me opening up to others.

I'm clueless on what to do with my free time. It will be really cool if I'd met some fellow people to spend activities with. How do you guys spend your free time. What do you do to meet other people around your age? Do you have any outdoors activities?

Only have 1 real close friend now who has other friends and a girlfriend. (He doesn’t have much time for me)

Apparently I have a shit personality so now I know. I don’t know what to do because I feel hated and just want some damn love.

On top of this all, I can’t find a girl. I haven’t been on a date in 3 years. Rarely get matched on dating apps. I can’t find someone that isn’t taken that I want, maybe my standards are too high?

45,SandSalesman,1553920114,2,"She left because she has a lot of mental health issues, blamed the breakup on me, and said a lot of cruel things. Regardless of me trying to help her in any way I could. I don't know whether or not I should fully blame her for what she said to me or blame her past traumas, but regardless, the things she said hurt worse than anything I've ever felt.

I took a couple months to sulk/sob. After that I got tired of just being lonely. I looked in the mirror and hated seeing the same guy she broke the heart of. I started lifting harder, and got a drastic haircut. But that wasn't enough. She was the last girl I kissed and shared a bed with, and that wasn't the same for her a mere days after we split. So I got on Tinder, and had a couple hookups, one of which I'm currently fwb with. We don't have anything in common other than that we're sexually attracted to each other. Honestly I don't know if I want to continue things with her, because the whole reason I liked sex was because it was with the girl I thought I was going to marry. And having empty sex makes me feel better, but not much better than just being alone.

But the things she said to me torched any pairbonding part of me I had. I want to meet someone again but there's no one in my small college town that's my type. Physically, let alone personality wise. I feel incredibly alone, and as if I might as well give up on love until I move to a bigger place in 2-3 more years.

My roommate and I are moving to a new place and it just makes it harder because I wanted my next move to be with her. It brings the breakup back as fresh as the day it happened and I think of everything she said to me. That the sweet nothings were just that, nothing. 

There was a very pretty girl I matched with on Tinder. Not like the other matches. She seemed genuinely interesting and my type personality wise. But honestly I doubt it's going anywhere. She doesn't really show interest in myself, but talks when spoken to. And god damn, that doesn't help with feeling undesirable. I know Tinder isn't where one should find love, but it's virtually a no-consequence app, so I figured it's still worth a shot.

I dunno, that's my blogpost. I just feel empty and don't really know what to do anymore. I feel like my love life is stuck until I get out of this town.

46,3_Progenitor_Inertia,1553918282,2,"So right now I'm probably going through the worse part of my life right now. I'm a 16 high school student who is a tad on the clingy side (as I will stick to someone who really matters to me) but am an overall very loyal friend. I have this one friend (I'll use the letter T to represent him) who I had since day one. We were really close and practically talked to each other on a daily basis. I would probably go to the extent of saying that we're best friends (T doesn't do best friends but the gist is we were really close). We would always hang together in our group and everything was great. 

But recently, T has made new friends who he really enjoys being near with. He would always be  surrounded and followed (T is a very popular guy cause people always follow him) by the new group. Being his friend for this long, I don't think much about it because he still talks to me and we are still pretty close.

Time passes, and one day, T just completely stops interacting with me. I would go to him and try to talk with him but he would respond to me in a monotone voice and have expression when near me. At first I thought he was having a bad day but right after talking with me, he straight up talks so someone else with a thousand times more energy than he did with me. At this point I kinda felt hurt and I thought that it would pass.

Several days later, things were still the same. T was still treating me as if he barely knows me. I then decided right and there to confront him about and he answered me in the most hurtful way possible. 
(To preface: T means a lot to me because I've been friends with him for so long so he kinda knows that I need him and that I really care about him. I would probably fall apart without him)

T started by telling me that he (actually said it to me) that he was no long interested in talking with me and that he no longer needs me. At that point, I started to fall apart. I asked him if he was pushing me away (he said yeah but he's not cutting me off completely). I also asked him if he knew what he was doing was hurting me and he responded with an emotionless yes (he knows that it hurts alot for me but he just doesn't care enough about me). He then goes on saying that he's happy in his new friend group and that he's happy without me being there. He also mentions to me that I didn't do anything wrong to push him away anything and that I'm still his friend but I won't be as close anymore. I then repeatedly asked him why he did it and each time I asked, he responded with ""idk"". Before leaving, he tells me that he has no intention to making things back to the way it used to be and he has no reason why he wants it like that.

Now that entire conversation with him has been so confusing and so hurtful that even now I don't understand why he did that. I didn't do anything bad to him yet he practically cuts me off and talks to me as if I'm a boring bio teacher. I am no longer of any value towards him and I just feel so much pain and suffering. What's even worse is that this only applies to me. To everyone else, he's still the happy and caring T that I used to know so it hurts like hell when he has fun with others yet he hates being near me. 

In a normal situation, I would cut him off completely and find a new friend but the thing is, he has been there with me for so long and we were so close. I've grown to need him and to be wanted by him. I desperately want him back as my close good friend. I tried talking to him starting convos with him but everytime someone he knows passes, one hundred percent of his attention goes to that person instead (which ends up hurting me even more). 

I need help because I don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to let him go and I really just want things to be how they used to be. Everyday that passes knowing that he is pushing me away is killing a part of me. I'm literally having trouble sleeping because of this situation.

Please, can someone tell me what I can do? I'm completely lost at what I can do.

55,tjruy577,1553912820,3,"I’m really tired with a lot of things and just straight lonely.

I graduated from high school and joined the navy as a nuclear engineer mechanic. All of my friends back home, however, stayed back and went to community college instead and kept playing games and keeping to the same old. I never seem relevant to them and none relain care about how things are or how I’m doing. Most would ignore me in the discord. Others went to college and some even joined the military as well. 
The one person that I truly loved joined the air force  and before i knew it, she already left to go to basic training and I couldn’t tell her my feelings. I honestly loved her. Same interests at the time, same personality, often finishing each others sentences, always with each other, talked about anything, ran away together for 2 days.she always brightened up my day and she felt more like home than my actually family.
I soon went to boot and finished that and then transferred down to training right after. Made some friends along the way while completing part of my 2 year training there. They’ve moved on as well going to a different command.
The one I loved got married to someone she knew in highschool. She’s not allowed to talk to me cause her husband thinks she will cheat on him with me. Something along those lines I think since I’ve been blocked on every point of contact. Even her parents don’t talk to me. 
 I transferred up to NY later to finish my training and within a week, I was sent to hold because I’ve become ______ and have picked up ptsd from an event as well. (Don’t really want to talk about it)

Fast forward 4 months from there all my friends that transferred up here are graduating soon. Hardly hang out with any of them anyway because Im pretty much left from any social relevance in the command. Everyone works 12 hours shifts and have weird hours.

I’ve also racked up a debt on my credit card as well trying to find new things to do. Still can’t find happiness. I can’t find it in myself to go out and try to make new friends because I feel so behind  in what’s relevant with collage students. Under the age of 21 so drinking is a no go as well. Can’t pick up on new hobbies even though I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to find one. Literally $4783 on my credit card. Max is 5000. I know it’s my fault on that and I totally agree. I’m not good with money.

I don’t have good relationships with my family. Dad has some mental conditions and he keeps to himself. I remind my mom too much of my dad so she doesn’t like talking to me. Siblings have their own life and jobs. Tried talking to them all.

I’ve tried dating apps but I honestly don’t have any good photos and don’t have the wit or personality to leave a good impression on majority of girls that just seem like they want to party, get drunk and high. On top of that, I’m a nuke and we are especially socially awkward. Borderline “nice guy”

So here’s where I’m at. I’ve lost my career essentially since I’m still in and in the process for discharge with mental conditions and illness.
The one person who could bring a smile to my face can’t talk to me anymore because she doesn’t want her marriage to end. I feel like I have no family . Most of my friends are moving on with their life while I’m stuck in a standstill waiting on my medical records to be pushed through. Loss of motivation and depression won’t allow me to do anything. Even the medication isn’t working for the lack of motivation. I live alone and wake up constantly every night in cold sweats and heart pounding situations and then continue to cry myself back to sleep. Constant sad thoughts.I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about what I’m feeling because what good will it do. I’m still alone in the end. Far from anyone.  

Thank you to whoever reads this for listening to me.  And I apologize once again for how messy it is. If any of you can offer any tips for embracing the suck, I’m open ears. Once again, thank you.

I cannot afford child care and have no community support nearby for such things. On top of this, without a job, when my car broke down, it was just something I had to accept. There was no money to fix it, no friends or family to help or to watch my child so I could get a job and pay for the fix.

We get by, I have an amazing partner who supports our growing family, but a large expense like a vehicle, even a 1k beater, isn’t possible.

It’s possible that I can use my partner’s vehicle on nights or weekends to go out and make friends, but I don’t know where to go. I’m not interested in the bar scene and due to some medical issues, I’m unable to dine out 99% of the time.

Things like a yoga class where I might meet stay-at-home moms like me, cost money that I don’t have. Oh yea, and I’m allergic to the sun so outdoor venues/activities are off the table as well. Wait, what did I just type...yoga!? I’ve never done yoga in my life, but that’s what moms do right? 

I have friends online,some that I talk to daily...but the only human adult I see is my partner and I would love a friend, just someone to talk to about anything...cook with on occasion, watch a movie, anything!

My loneliness is starting to effect my emotions daily and I’m starting to resent the wife/mother role that I’ve loved for years...What can I do to get out in the world and make a connection with someone who lives in my area?

Oh yea, and I live in a place 700 miles away from where I grew up, so old connects aren’t an option for human contact either.

64,ElenyAstrid,1553903250,2,"I’ve struggled with myself to finally make this post,I’ll try to make this short.I’ve been single for 27 years,my early twenties were sufferable but after my brothers wedding at 25,I went through a full blown nervous breakdown because it really hit me i was going to die alone. I did all the desperate things a touch starved person does,slept hugging a pillow,created little fantasies about myself with cute strangers where were together and I’m loved just to cope,all that Jazz,at 27 I’m approached by someone online who is everything I dreamt of as a little girl,we didn’t meet in person till I was 29 because of my anxiety but the whole time,even from afar was heavenly and I was the happiest I’ve ever been,so shortly after we met in person(those few days were magical to me at least) he became more distant and aloof,he said he had become depressed and I didn’t want to be an insensitive bitch about it,but I always found it puzzling how it seemed to happen overnight,it’s been one and a half year since we met and although it’s hard to show much tenderness online,our relationship has reached a point I’m too afraid to address it as such.It feels like he doesn’t even want to be talking to me and when we talk(I usually initiate) there’s nothing that would convince one it’s a romantic relationship.And I’m somewhat alright with this,I understand,maybe he didn’t like me in person(both physically and personality wise)and mistook me for being someone I’m not,but I really wish he would admit to it.Everyday feels I’m being heartbroken over and over again.Loneliness and self loathing is bad enough but I don’t like feeling like I’m holding someone hostage.And I can’t stand it anymore seeing someone I love lose interest in me more and more with each passing day. Also tmi,we did some things when he was here,I’ve had sexual trauma and for most of my life thought I was asexual or sex repulsed,I felt like I trusted him so much,it no longer seemed “dirty” but after what followed,I wonder if I did something wrong and I feel ashamed of myself once again.I often wonder if I disgusted him and scared him off.

67,Tomtom1599,1553898771,2,"I (m/19 soon 20) am a lonely fuck. I got my circle of friends but everytime I am around them I just wanna go back to my room and enjoy solitude. Plus, I am quite easily infected with those loneliness attacks, when I see happy couples. Not like I wanna take smth away from them, but that envious feeling tears my chest apart.

I had one female friend, that I know since class 6, and after suffering in friendzone for 4yrs I finally got over it, that resulted in me laying down my ""overly nice mask"" that I held up for way too long.
She soon started to be pissed since she thought I was mad at her (because I obviously was as cold, as I am on a regular basis).

We didn't talk anymore and she blocked me on all social media, resulting with a way happier time, until yesterday (prom night, 3am, drunk as shit), where she came up to me, wanting to clear our arguements since everyone goes to a different uni now. We soon realized that we are too drunk to have a proper conversation so she wants to meet up. I dont feel like it will be as before, and to be honest, I felt way happier without her around me. 
Does this make me a bad person?

That time without her made it feel easier to cope with loneliness, but I still end up using 4 dating apps at the same times with one (or max 2) matches every 3 months that tend to ghost me after a short amount of time because I am not ""what they were looking for"".

71,EyeSackJam,1553893869,3,"Love:

What is it On scientific level: hormones that make our brain feel happy. This is due to the fact humans want to reproduce and pass on their genes. This being said, Loneliness is the absence of love or rather lack of exposure to oxytocin. Of course, this love chemical cannot be simply expressed as oxytocin but it is the main component. (I would also like to point out that there is no alternate way of perfectly creating this exact chemical any way other than being in a relationship.

Do we need it: 

yes, as with most species, we strive to reproduce and pass on our genes. When we aren't in a relationship our primal brain sends us signals in forms of loneliness in order to get us to reproduce. 

Is there a loophole to feel ""love""/not lonely: 

I have been thinking and only came up with one idea which ultimately if void. To get rid of hormones that urge us to reproduce. This however leads to many complications, especially in some cases of chemical castration or sterilization, patients have been more inclined to development depression and suicidal thoughts. An explanation of this behaviour is perhaps that a loss of specific hormones eliminate our primal goal of surviving in order to reproduce. Therefore, this option doesn't work.

Second, my few friends are kind of not being very good friends lately and I wanted to vent somewhere since I can't talk to my actual friends. I live with one of them, she's nice and all, but she is also hard to live with. Her depression and apathy make it hard to like her sometimes. And I'm not saying depression is a deal-breaker (because I've lived with MDD for decades), but she can never pull herself out of it and has been stuck in this ""woe is me"" mind frame for years now. I try to help her, include her in things, and some of the time she will come along. But she refuses to clean her spaces, or even help clean the house. Most weekends she gets off of work on Friday at 4pm and stays in her bed until Monday morning at 7. I can maybe get her to clean the bathroom once a month, meanwhile I've cleaned the entire house at least every two weeks. It gets tiring. But ultimately, you can't be responsible for someone else's well-being, and if they don't want to get help, you can't help them. So here I am, in my own depression. I'm having trouble just trying to connect with her without being incredibly frustrated at her apathy. Meanwhile my own apathy and isolation is growing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have another friend that lives out of state. We used to talk almost every day, even if it was just a message here and there saying ""hey"" or sending a funny meme to each other. The past two months, we've maybe spoken twice outside of meeting up over a weekend for a concert. The meet up was all fine, but outside of being face to face, they seem to be too busy to even respond to me. I have anxiety as well and I can't tell if something is actually up, or if my anxiety is telling me that they're just done with me. But every time I go to talk to my out of state friend, I do the typically ""Hey, how are you?"" because I genuinely care, and want to know what's going on in their life. I'll get the kind of response ""Just really busy"" or complete silence. Meanwhile, I see them on gaming platforms we share for hours and hours. I'm not saying they should feel obligated to talk to me, but it kind of seems like they don't want to talk to me period. When we have talked for the past few months there has been no reciprocal ""how are you"", like they don't even care?? I've never really been the type to offer my troubles up in a conversation, but I'm going through some stuff, a family member is severely ill and we're worried they won't be pulling through, but I don't want to go and just dump this on my friends unsolicited. 

&amp;#x200B;

While the main reason I am posting is to vent, I'm also interested to see what others do to pull themselves out of the isolation, or to distract themselves from the black hole of anxiety feelings and depression.

I look at facebook and snapchat and see all these people in such happy relationships and stuff, and while yes I am glad that they're happy, and would never take that from them, I can't help but get so envious and wish I was in their shoes.

I don’t like my friends. They’re all really weird, nerds, socially inept, or just plain stupid. I’ve been friends with them all for a long time, but it’s time for me to drop them. In fifth grade to eigth grade I acted as a sort of sentinel for the outcast group in my school, I would take the New weird kids in and make them my friends to grow my freak army. Now it’s different. I grew up, puberty hit me, I look pretty good. But this is killing me. Every day I get more and more ready to leave this place and this is just a last ditch attempt to get something to distract me from depression. It’s been getting so much worse. I’m not getting more confident each day, and it’s not good that I still consider these people my friends.

I’m just really done with being a stupid outsider, I want to be accepted into the social norms. I’m so sick of being an afterthought to my more popular friends.

The short version of my backstory (for context): I come from a really tiny place (a whole community of about 150-200 people. But in my village we're only around 40) where there weren't many people my age when I grew up. The few that were there pushed me out from their friend circle, but used me as ""backup friend"" when there were drama in the group. I pretty much grew up without any good friends. I met a couple others from a different school the last year of elementary, and we ended up in the same class in High School, which was pretty cool. We weren't best friends or super close, but we hung out a lot around the school (not so much in our spare time as they lived too far away). We all split after high school except for me and one other who ended up in the same class in college, which again is pretty cool. Which is where we are now.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the ting is, I haven't managed to find any new friends here. Growing up with little to no friends has left me very shy and I feel a lot of presentation anxiety every time I try to talk to people. I'm not good with words either which doesn't help. My friend has gotten a lot of new friends, and no hate, I'm really happy for said friend, but I feel like I'm pushed more and more to the side. I feel pretty shitty for complaining, because of course meeting new people is exciting and I don't at all expect her to be with me and only me. But everyone seems so close with each other here and it makes me wonder what it's like to be close with anyone. A couple days ago was my 20th birthday and I really wanted to celebrate it because 20 is kind of a big deal, and I haven't celebrated since I was 14, so I thought I'd ask my friend if she wanted to go out that day (My bday was in the weekend and I asked about a week before) try to find a party somewhere, have some drinks and just have fun. Nothing too big. And she was down for that and we were talking about it for days. The day before my bday I ask her if when she wants to look for places to stay at that night and she says she no longer can because it's too expensive to head out. I feel super selfish for thinking this, but I guess this is where I feel left out as her roomie celebrated her bday a couple of days before me and she went out with her. I mean, of course it's okay to not do anything if she can't afford it, but we didn't have to go out either, would've been fun to just hang out at campus too, watch a movie maybe, play instruments, anything. I didn't say anything cuz I don't want her to feel forced to hang out with me, I just didn't wanna spend the day alone, but I ended up crying myself to sleep that night. Felt especially bad when my parents called to wish me a happy birthday and asked if I had fun and what I were doing that day, and I had to lie and tell them I wasn't going to spend it alone and that I had a great time.

96,mathboi69,1553804686,3,"For the past two years I’ve been very very lonely. I had this great friend group and we were all really close until they suddenly stopped inviting me and later even talking to me. When we did go out I found that they had new inside jokes, interests... and I could never fit in with them anymore. It got so bad that I stopped wanting to hang with them but I was forced to because I couldn’t stand being alone. But, one day I cut all of them out, and they didn’t care, we stopped being friends just like that. I tried making new friends, and every time I do, I either end up losing them, or they stop being friends with me and start being friends with my old friends. 
This happened so many times i don’t know what to think of it anymore. 
I don’t know why this happens. It got to the point where I no longer have anyone to talk to. And I’m so emotionally and mentally drained all the time that I can’t even think while talking to people.

There are around twenty people in my phone's contact list: him, my family and all my doctors.

I actually had a couple of friends when I was in high school, when you sit at pretty much the same place with pretty much the same people around you for eight years, you eventually end up befriending at least one of them. It took me around two years, but I eventually got two friends and a couple of people I could sit with during lunch break. It may not sound like a lot, but I was pretty happy during that time, I always found being around people pretty draining anyway. I also joined an online community and had a bunch of after-school activities, some of which were pretty social (drama, choir).

My whole social life fell apart once I went to university. No one I knew went to study the same program (medicine) as me - some people went to the same university, but our university has faculties all around the city so we wouldn't see each other anyway.

I didn't really befriend anyone at my first program, but I eventually ended up talking to some people there. Also, I joined a medical students' organization and got a fair bit of socialization through it.

However, medicine wasn't a great fit for me, I had two major mental breakdowns within two years, so I decided to switch it for a biology program. It also meant having to quit the medical students' organization and having to deal with a completely new set of people.

After three years, I don't know anyone here. I don't have a single friend. Literally. I've been dancing swing for three years and met my boyfriend through it, but I didn't make any friends there.

And I'm just so sick of taking the bus from campus after a lecture and seeing other students sitting together and talking and laughing. I'm sick of going dancing (which I rarely do nowadays) and just standing there awkwardly with no one to talk to or ask to dance, while my boyfriend is dancing with someone else.

Take for example cheating on a test, by doing this the grade you get is rightfully yours and a fair assessment of your knowledge. Now I did not say a fair assessment of your knowledge on that particular subject, just your knowledge over all, to bend things to your will. Cheating in grade/middle/high school is child's play though, if you are actually creative enough to cheat you way through life, college, work, ect. I believe that your paycheck/degree is rightfully deserved. Such is the concept of bending the reality around you to your will, the situation relative to the setting, of course this all sounds foreign and unrealistic. “But one would not do such a thing!” I hear you saying, here we are presented the concept of normativity, to do something like everyone else would, the so called “right” way to do something, such as going through school and college honestly, getting good grades because you “earned” them by studying or otherwise. When we get down to the absolute morality the cheater has earned his grade just as much as the honest learner has. The cheater looks at every possible solution to a problem or situation and takes the easiest and most beneficial route, no matter how much the morality of the choice negates his decision, thus is the true way to live.

At the moment what’s really been bothering me is family. So in our family of me (f 20, unemployed) my bro (m22, unemployed, has bipolar) and my dad (works an office job), we never really talk to each other. Well honestly I never really talk to them. My bro is usually the one initiating conversations but when with my dad he always seems pissed off or doesn’t want to talk when talking with my bro and always critiques his opinions (or how we cook sometimes when he says he’s trying to help but his tone feels like he’s insulting) so I keep myself shut because I don’t want to feel shit by talking to him. (90% of the time I feel bad talking to dad or he makes me feel over sensitive and bad) 

This lack of communication leads to not knowing what chores need to be done and it always seems like me and my bro are doing the chores but my dad rarely helps out and just drinks away. The only thing we do together is grocery shopping. Even then I walk so much slower than my dad and bro as they walk together and they never stop to wait for me and it’s always bothered me for some reason. (I tried talking to my dad about it but he made me feel like it was a silly thing to be upset about so I never brought it up again)

Honestly just hoping this reaches the right person(s). My name is J,  I’m looking to make new friends. I’ve felt alone since about high school started (sophomore in college now) and still now I have about 2 good friends. Problem is I’m trying to distance myself from them because it’s just a toxic relationship at this point . I got along with them because we had similar hobbies but now they just take advantage of me. I have past diagnosis of mental illness and It really plays a part in trying to “get out there” I’m way too shy to approach someone or even initiate conversation. It’s much easier for me to reach out online than in real life 

A little about myself: I’m a huge nerd I love video games and stuff about computers. Hobbies include wromping all over town in my car blasting loud music (yes I’m that asshole), fishing, gaming, and I smoke A LOT of weed (not about bragging right but more so an unhealthy crutch) (about all I have time for factoring in the 40 hours I work a week)

From doing errands to being at home, I usually enjoy talking to someone to feel relaxed because when I don't, I get tense and nervous. Though I am posting for a whole completely topic lmao
Recently, I managed to get my feelings reached out to a girl that I liked for awhile and we both knew each other for like 4 years, felt like a huge achievement to tell her, but getting those feelings accepted and hearing that she felt the same way I was surprised and happy. I was longing for a serious relationship for years because the last serious one that I had was emotionally rough and not healthy at all. We started going out about a week ago, things went peachy and things felt smooth! I had high hopes for this to work and so did she. She told me that she wanted to pursue some of her goals which involved getting more involved with her church and focusing more on University, and I fully supported her through those goals. The issue that I didn't realize beforehand is that our relationship and her goals were going to conflict each other because of certain strict rules her religion had when it came to relationships. One of those rules was that she wasn't able to do any sort of physical contact, which also including kissing, something that we both did on our first date without realizing it. It didn't bother her at first but through the times I met up with her, I noticed she was getting more tense and uncomfortable each time. It wasn't until at the end of the week where she confessed her issues with what was going on and how she was feeling like things were moving fast. She was a indecisive person and even though she knew she shouldn't be doing those kinds of things, she still wanted to do em, and same with her emotions towards me. She liked me a lot, she didn't want to let me go at all. She wanted me to stay even though there was no solution to satisfy both parties involved. We both want to be together and grow with one another, though I just wasn't sure how that would be possible. The hardest part came where I had to make the decision myself that things weren't going to work out, sounds obvious enough if relationships don't hold up. I ended our week long status because I wanted her to focus on her goals, so that she can achieve what she wants to do. It may not sound like much and given we only went out for a week, it shouldn't be anything taken seriously. Though given that we known each other for quite a while, and how our feelings kept growing after the confession, I feel like there is something missing now, my days just feel grey and not really full of life. I'm not depressed but more like simply out of it.

I would always see my friends get dates and partners but I never felt like I truly wanted one. This has unintentionally screwed me over now since I never learned how to pick girls up or talk to them in a non-platonic sense.

It's always been on my mind, but more as a hypothetical. Like a ""what if i had a GF"" but nothing more. Usually I would just continue on with life. For 22 years I never did....until recently. I don't know what triggered it, but now I want someone in my life romantically. 

I want the cute moments, I want the companionship, I want the cuddles, and laughs. But why would any girl actually want me now? I'm not saying that as pity, I seriously think this. Like: I'm a 22 year old man with autism, no dating experience, no real social skills, social anxiety, and no real confidence. Like I know I sound like an incel probably, but I honestly have a hard time believing there is anyone who would want me. Not an attack on women BTW; you have freedom to date who you want.

I don't understand why. Why now? There has been no real trigger I can think of, no bottled emotions, and nothing in my life has really changed. Can anyone else relate? Is there anyone who's in a similar boat, M or F?

Once she took me and a group of friends to lava beds. We hitchhiked and took the bus and though I got in major trouble, it was so, so worth it. I want to travel the world with her.

She wrote a poem, once, about traveling. It doesn’t sound that important but it made me realize that I’ve barely scratched the surface of her wonders. I want to take off with her and never come back. She’s too great for our small town and she knows it.

I have banned myself from thinking anything remotely sexual because afterwards i get really sad and cry a bucketload, contemplate my existence, feel ashamed and touchstarved.

But goddamn does it suck to see other people happy with their significant other. I don't have ill will toward anybody for it, but I'd he lying if I said I didn't have a damn good bit of envy for them. It may be slightly bitter envy, but I still don't have any ill will toward them, even if I act like it sometimes. Anyways, yea, it hurts. Watching people kiss, and hold hands, and laugh and smile with each other, and go on dates. Hell, my brother even has a girlfriend, and he sort of only wants one for sex and stuff. At least thats what he says. But, it's hard to read the guy. I mean, he's really hard to read. You can hardly tell if he wants to hug you or slit your throat half the time, though he'd never do anything beyond a hard punch to the arm or a kick to the groin. Anyways, that makes it even worse. He's  always got a girl to flaunt off in front of me, even if it may be unintentionally. I'm happy for the guy, really, I am. But it sucks. He has amazing social skills, everybody at school loves the guy. Then there's me. Nobody knows me, and if they do, they think I'm weird or that I'm not worth their time. And, honestly, maybe I'm not. I dunno. I mean, I wouldn't be my own friend. My depression makes me too inconsistent. And I can be super bipolar. I really can. One moment I'm in a decent mood, the next moment I'm pissed off at you for some reason. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens at least once a day. My few friends say it isn't my fault, since I technically wouldn't be able to control bipolar disorder (if I have it, I'm not officially diagnosed), but I tell them it doesn't matter. I'm still an asshole that can't control his damn emotions. I mean, I'm so inconsistent, not only are my emotions inconsistent, but my messages and plans are inconsistent too. I'll message somebody, hoping to continue a previous conversation or start a new one, or I'll make plans with a friend, just to get super depressed out of nowhere or because of something I saw or did or something, making me completely stop responding to messages, or to not show up to or cancel the plans I made. I mean, who'd love that, let alone be friends with that? I don't know if I'm at fault, or if I'm simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Or both. Who knows. Anyways, back to the whole love thing. I really wish I had a girlfriend or something. Somebody to share a bed with at night, and not for sex, get your damn mind out of the gutter. Just so we can cuddle and watch scary YouTube videos or something, or just talk about life. Someone to take long walks with late at night, as I usually do. Somebody I can make happy and can be happy, or at least content, with. Stuff like that. I mean, obviously sex would be nice, especially with somebody who reciprocates my love, but it isn't required for me. I could do with out, even if I am quite a lustful person. It probably doesn't help that I smoke and drink. If cigarettes were more readily available to me, since I'm technically not of legal age for them, I'd smoke like a chimney. And, I bet I'd be an alcoholic if I had the money and legal ID for the stuff. It's bad, very bad, I know. But, I can't help it. Cigarettes help calm my nerves, since my mom won't let me get anxiety medication, and alcohol let's me be a fun goofball. It's a nice change of pace from being depressed all the time. But, I realize how bad for me they are and stuff. Anyway, I doubt I'd find anybody who would put up with my ugliness, poor personality, AND my smoking and drinking habit. I mean, hell, my only good quality is my musical ability. And that's still not the best thing. There s a ton of people waaaaaay better than me with music. Sums me up as a person, I'd say. Anyway, this lost is long as all hell, so I should close it here. If anybody relates or has advice or whatever, feel free to comment or message me, if anybody reads this, that is. But, if you wanna be a wise-ass, just piss off. I just wanted to vent in a non-linear style for once.

yet i never had anyone even remember my birthday. (not even my family)

I’ve been that guy... who stay up hours to comfort friends or travelled miles in heartbeat just to be there for them...

yet at my lowest points, all i had was myself...

But it was the little things in the end that got to me. How people would basically ignore me in group chats. When we are out for a meal or what not but I’m practically invisible. They would have conversations around me and basically ignore me when I mention something. Sometimes i feel like they wouldn’t even notice if i left in the middle. And they get upset when i stop showing up to gatherings or replying, i mean... they make me feel like i’m not worthy, and every damn time i felt like i had enough of being treated like I’m less. They say things to me and get me to blame myself for the way things turn out.

And the final straw for when i realise how pathetic and unworthy i was...

When our final exams results was just announced,
our teacher congratulated my friend and I for scoring the highest in the entire cohort. 

And like any others we had separate groups chats for just friends and literally everyone only congratulated my friend and say that he was the pride of our class.

We literally had the same score
I’m genuinely happy for my friend as well
and right now me typing this out, it makes me feel like I’m petty and i should’t be upset.

I used to have a decent amount of friends and people I could depend on but over the past year or so I've lost almost all of them. I really don't have someone I could talk to about anything and I used to and I miss it desperately. Some due to circumstances no one could help (ex. they moved away) but most due to a falling out. I feel like I keep getting betrayed over and over again with people being my friend for awhile only for them to eventually leave me behind and make me feel like I was nothing. The first two times you think wow they are just pricks, but after repeat occurrences you really begin to think that you are just a bad person who doesn't deserve to have friends. I've had my friends of 4 years tell me they don't care about me and (now ex) significant others tell me my personality is trash after dating for months. I'm just stuck and don't know how to feel better about myself as everything both material and non-material around me seems to be failing and going horribly. Everything I try to do and no matter how hard I try I always seem to disappoint myself. I try to make new friends but at this point with how hurt I've been all social interaction terrifies me.

Backstory, I was in a relationship for 10+ years, he was good to me but I always felt like something was missing. The loneliness and lack of connection and emotion ebbed and flowed over the years. I spent a lot of time living on auto-pilot then suddenly falling off it and crashing hard. I’d sit in my car listening to music sometimes for hours, cry a little, feel too much and yet feel so empty all at once. I knew for a long time that I wouldn’t stay in that relationship. 
Then came the time to leave, I was so heart broken, and so unbelievably happy. I felt like I was escaping. 
I found a new love, or truthfully he found me. I was so madly in love, I don’t know if I ever felt so alive, so full with love. Not that I never wanted to not live before but now I wanted to live so much more simply to feel everything I was feeling. 
But Slowly over time the loneliness came creeping back.

Am I feeling sad and lonely because he puts me in that place? Or am I looking for things to blame it on.. am I just broken and putting blame on every person I have a relationship with? 
Am I empty because there’s something wrong with me or is it the lack of passion in his eyes when looking at me? 
Our relationship is good, we’re in the stage where the honeymoon stage has subsided for him, not so much for me, I live for passion, I live to feel. He’s comfortable, he’s content. I need more. 
I stupidly thought he’d never lose that twinkle in his eyes, or the long kisses that felt like he kissed me with so much emotion it was as though it could be the last. 
I feel expected to be here, supper made, clean house, showered in case he’s on the mood, expected to be here. Am I being taken for granted?

I'm an Interior Design student at uni, and am currently in the process of designing a space to help combat grief and loneliness in children and 'young adults' (young adults is up for debate on whether I extend it to adults as well).

I posted a while back about this same project, but I'm still looking to understand my demographic far more than I currently do. The responses I received from this subreddit amongst others was overwhelming. It was incredibly insightful, whilst also saddening to have even a slight glimpse into how people struggle with mental illness, post-loss or not, in different ways. In order to understand in more depth those who would be using the space, I've put together a little survey (in 2 parts sadly) for people to answer. I hope this isn't too intrusive into the sub, and if not, I'm looking forward to getting more responses so I can make my project as reflective of the demographic as possible. Thanks for reading!

227,canigetuhhhhhhhhhh,1553395765,9,"nothingness. Not alone. I've never felt less; I've never felt more lack of feelings. other than some drowsiness/tiredness lol

i say this because back when i was *definitely* lonely, for many months, i was on this sub on the regular and feel like it really helped me…and i saw a bunch of posts like ""it's my birthday and i've never felt more alone"". and i could relate at the time. Then something happened and my birthday came around that year, and for some/whatever reason i didn't feel sad or lonely at all. I treated myself to a cake (lol) a nice buttercake with blue icing and my name in the middle, like a person-sized cake, and i enjoyed it my way. It didn't feel particularly lonely at all.—Actually, that was the night i completely blocked out my parents for the first time—turned my phone off and on airplane mode for the day before and day of and day after, just so i didn't have to listen to them, just so i could be alone.

because it pained me *so much* during my lifetime the fact that every 'birthday' i had, it was just a 'family' birthday…like, my grandparents or whatever, and my family would call whoever was in town together to eat cake…but it never seemed like *for me*. idk. it never seemed like *for me*. I'd sit there…at the head of the table…with my little birthday hat on or whatever…pretending to smile; pretending to make conversation with people and pretend as if i'm interested; pretend that i'm pursuing something that they think is worthwhile, some 'career'; pretend to be an outgoing conversational young kind; pretend to be polite…etc…etc… pretend. Nothing but pretend. Felt like i need to swim through *so* many channels to be the person i had to be.

god i want to fucking drown now. what? don't know where that came from. i don't mean that.

what i mean is…okay maybe i'm a little sad. about lots of things. But mainly, i think that 'loneliness' at least in the way i used to define it, and in the way i used to define it in this sub, doesn't have to do with me anymore. You'll see a lot of posts that are like, ""I feel like I'm kinda fucked up but I'd much rather be alone, I feel more comfortable; but I also feel so lonely thinking about how alienated from 'friends' (not-friends) around me"" etc. And someone in the comments will be like, Yeah, I felt this way too for a while. Then I realized I just really like my alone time, and like my own company, in a recluse kind of way that normal people don't. Once I learned to appreciate that and cultivate that, it started fixing my problems with loneliness.

And that's *kind of* how I feel now. I feel like my first rub with r/lonely allowed me to realize that i really *do* like my company, and that's not a problem, and that's somethingn i should feel comfortable with. And allowed me to move on…

damn i just saw someone's comment on a post here that was like, Yeah I felt the same way as you feeling alienated from friends because they cared about different shit and none of them were depressed. Or something to that effect. What was with me? (What was with *me?*) That made me not able to relate in a certain way?

It wasn't necessarily depression, I don't think. But there was something else, though, that kept me…'out there.' Out there in a bubble. Every since preschool. Lol, idk about preschool actually; but I definitively remember grade school / elementary school; I definitely started to feel the different-ness by then…just so out of the loop; as in, looking in at other people / friend groups and feeling on the outside. BACK THEN IT WAS OKAY THOUGH. I think. I would pop around in my orange jacket in my own dream world, making make-believe with my one friend…

whatever happened to that one friend? why did some moment come, or some period of moments, when i started to feel less and less attached to *him?* When I started to feel like *he* was the immature one, and i had moved on? When I didn't want to play his make-believe games anymore, or, I just thought that…it was different?

We grew apart. Or, I feel, I grew past him (at the time), and…i never got another friend. Idk how we got together in the first place. Some chance of fate, I guess. But we grew apart, as I guess people do (???)(??), and now i'm here…several years later, on this bitch of a rock of an earth, etc etc…where am i going with this.

I'm a shy guy, and talking to people takes a lot of energy to me. Last year, I started to like a girl, we work in the same school, as teachers. This year I tried to date her. These three months where great, because I felt happy, and the last couple of weeks everything seemed to be working. 

She started to treat me in romantic way, and I did the same, obviously. She told her friends that she loved me. Last Monday I asked if she'd like to be my girlfriend, and she said ""Yeah, but I guess this is not the moment and the way to do it"". On Thursday, we talked through phone, and she got mad at me, because ""I don't talk a lot"". But I had already planned to ask her if she wanted to be my girlfriend on Friday. 

And finally, she said no, according to her, there are a lot of differences between us. 

Right now I really feel bad, because she gave me wings, but didn't let me fly. It hurts too much, I thought it was real, but it didn't. The shitty part is that she got me excited and then dumped me, and I have to see her everyday.  Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to vent.

Growing up, my parents did not have a lot, we lived in low income, received public assistance and rarely did anything together as a family, such as vacations etc. My father was a very abusive drunk who had no patience and was verbally as well as physically abusive toward my mom and I. I have a younger sister and an l older autistic half brother (mom) who were not subjected to the same sort of treatment that I had received from my father. I can remember dreading going home after school during my elementary and middle school years, looking for any excuse to stay as late as I could so that I did not have to be home any longer than I could help. More times than not, I was able to go to my cousins house on the weekends &amp; spent almost all of my entire summer breaks with them as well.

242,LettersfromthePatch,1553346131,22,"Today I was watching yet another random romantic comedy series on netflix. Nothing too odd there- nothing overly common either. It is not like I go out of my way to watch other people fall in love or anything. It just... Today when I was watching something it made me realise a particular change which has happened over the last couple of years. The emotions I have while watching romantic comedies and other romance stories seems to be slanting away from just a simple zone of someone who loves to watch romance. It has started to slant towards a sort of melancholic longing during and existential dread once complete. Now, I have never exactly been a Casanova to begin with- most of the relationships I have had with someone on a romantic level have been online. My last major relationship ended over five fucking years ago now- but I can't seem to drop it. Now as I continue to march on closer to the massive impending wall which is 30- I find myself losing what little confidence I had in favor of a raising sense of worry. 

Some may say that's normal, other's may point out that 30 isn't the end of the world- some still will just wonder why the hell it even matters to me. I don't know, that's exactly it. I have reached a point where not only can I not imagine finding someone to have a romantic relationship with- but that even if I had one I would have no clue how to proceed. When I got my most recent job I assumed this could be my moment. My time to make the world make sense again. Suddenly I would be able to find my way once more as things started to get level. No longer would I be a broke university student- but a guy with a full time job and the ability to support himself properly. I would be forced to interact properly with the world and maybe- just maybe it would finally work out for me. For the most part it has, but the part which continues to elude my very existence is that of having a partner. I have reached a point of learned helplessness where I am unable to have the confidence to even attempt say- online dating, tinder or anything which a normal person may do to meet someone. It doesn't help that I am incredibly nerdy, mildly autistic and don't have even the slightest desire to drink. People always love to point out at these junctures that people can always improve themselves if they want to- but- for me I do honestly like myself. It has just reached the point where I don't think anyone else will. It doesn't help that the town I am in while not tiny is not exactly a place where I am likely to meet someone. Doing your best to be the helpful and happy sort is fine for making people not hate you- but it doesn't magically make people who you are compatible with appear.  

It has reached a point where I look at my life and even beyond the prospect of searching for that one- I wonder how I would even manage to hold a relationship. Recently I have been doing my best helping out with political activities for example- and being exposed to all these non nerdy types is making me just- stop- wonder- how could someone even fit into my life. How would it even work, how could I not somehow screw it all up. I always assumed that nerds like me mostly find their partners through their friends. But when half of your friends are online and the rest don't seem to know anyone it seems rather hard. Even when someone did say a friend of theirs knew someone, I couldn't work out how to even consider contacting them- even when given a possible opening text message to send. I wanted to know more before I even tried- wanted to know all the intel before I even began so I didn't do something entirely wrong. In the end it just sort of disappeared because I was so fucking afraid of the unknown I didn't even try. Generally learned helplessness seems to be linked to learning or performing a certain skill. While I suppose technically socialising could be considered a skill, it seems slightly out of place to consider it on par with the regular usage even when all signs point to it being the case. 

I assume everyone is happily in a relationship til I find out otherwise- then sometimes even when I do find that out I am so self defeating that I can't even work out a way to ask. Last post I wrote here was about how I was afraid of becoming bitter. I still don't think I have became bitter- not just yet... but- the impact seems to be similar. I just. I don't know what to do- even when I do think I know what to do somehow I still can't bring myself to pull that trigger. Things seem so much simpler in romantic comedies- and in those worlds they are designed to be overly dramatic and with terrible timing by default. Look, I know this isn't likely the best use of the /r/loney subreddit but... this is all causing a massive level of loneliness. Sure I still have friends and family but- over five years feels like a heck of a long time to just... slowly be chipped away at. I couldn't post to /r/foreveralone because I clearly wasn't FOREVER alone- but recently- I have really started to feel it. It comes in waves- it is uncontrollable and annoys me to no end. It has reached a point where I am so desperate to wonder if anyone even thinks of me that way that I have been scouring /r/unsentletters just for the minute chance that someone posted one for me. I go to the theatre, I watch netflix- I play games. So many different stories- romances- people to just push myself into and imagine what it could be like. But in the end all that it does is leads me with an ever increasing level of sadness. 

I wish I knew what more I could do,  but I know that even if I did I likely would fuck it all up anyway. I miss feeling that level of comfort and safety that can come from a decent loving relationship. I do indeed feel lonely. *sigh* I suppose all I can do now is go to sleep, try to enjoy what little remains of my weekend and try to hope this particular wave passes soon. bleh",lonely,Unsure if i'd even be capable of being in a relationship again- and that scares me.,2019-03-24 00:02:11

They all got new friends while Im struggling here in my section. Right now, I only have 2 people I still consider close and one of them went on a trip to China ( soo I’m extra lonely right now). When I try to make friendships, I feel like I’m always the one who goes to a person. People never approach me first, it gets tiring sometimes. I don’t know why I’m being left out( especially in groupings and it hurts) I don’t know if it’s my attitude or something. I asked one close friend and she said my attitude is fine. 
There are times that I’m happy and I don’t care at all about my nonexistent social life and there are days when I feel so alone and lonely. Today is one of those days. I was stopping myself from crying during the last subject and on the car ride home. I remember before I went on a trip to Singapore (feb this yr) I was feeling soo lonely and when I got back it was even worse. My only closeish friend got close with the person I don’t like. So we kinda drifted apart. She was my only closeish friend in the section. To make things worse, THE TRIP WAS MY BIRTHDAY GIFT... and after the trip that happens with my only closeish friend......
Whenever I’m feeling left out, I always think about my blessings. I am thankful that I get nice things and I get to go abroad a lot. I also always think that after high school, I’m leaving everyone behind and I’m going to move to au. Another way for me to cope with feeling left out is trying to be better than everyone. I go to the gym so that I look better than almost everyone and I wear nice things. Can anyone give me advice when I am having one of those days when i feel left out and lonely? How to feel less lonely and left out and how can I make friends? How can I make people like me and be the first to approach?",lonely,Lonely in school,2019-03-23 21:27:52

It's the same online aswell...

I'd ask on my social media if anyone could pop up to talk or something and I've never gotten a response.

A long time ago I had a best friend, but we grew apart and I just feel sad when I think about them. It feels like everybody is keeping me at an arms length, or I’m doing that to everybody subconsciously. I don’t know. It’s a really sad thought to feel like you don’t have anyone who you can share yourself with.

I was an odd kid, and As a young boy I read instead of making friends; books were enough. But they aren’t anymore, I need human people, I need somebody near me.

I feel like a wind-chime. I’m not able to shine on my own, I need somebody to push me. 

It feels like people think that I’m a joke, like I’m not really serious about existing. I know that eventually I’ll find somebody who really gets me, but this just sucks. I believe that I’m gonna be okay.

Now tonight is a strange night for me. I'm a 24 y/o student who regularly travels on the bus 3 hours to and from college every weekday. When I get home, I normally have tons of responsibilities: a cluttered house, 3 cats, a dog,  several siblings, a highly dependent grandma, parents, and usually my niece and nephew. I normally never have space for myself or much time for myself either.

However, tonight is the first night for a weekend that I am house-sitting for a friend. This sounded like heaven in comparison to my normal, and it kind of is. I am feeding his cat and his bearded dragon while he is gone. I cooked for myself, handling raw meat for the first time even if it was just hamburger helper. I played on the computer a bit with some online friends and then watched a little anime and I'm now in bed.

I guess what is strange to me is this feeling of nothing. I am here and there's no one else. No one to talk to. No one to share how my day was or how things've been. No responsibilities or people to keep me awake. Idk. I don't even understand whats bothering me. Am I just lonely? In truth, it's still a step up from slaving in my home for nothing in return, but it's still... Weird. Almost like something feels wrong. I'd feel lonely in my crowded house all the time among many more frustrating feelings, but this? This is just a strange place to me. Well, it's just night #1 so I guess I'll see how it goes. I didn't really feel this way until bedtime, so maybe i just need some sleep. Goodnight friends. I'll be here reading any comments until I fall asleep, in which I'll reply in the morning",lonely,"Hi friends, tonight is strange",2019-03-23 14:39:38

No matter how reasonable, rational, polite, patient, understanding, or considerate you are it will always go unappreciated and be undercut by someone getting ever so offended at the notion that you simply noticed them acting weird. 

Don’t tell me you like me sooo much and then proceed to have every text you send be 3 words. Don’t reply to me putting effort into the conversation with a dead end response.

i know every optimist that reads things like this is so triggered and can’t wait to say “change ur mindset!!” like yes because if i start expecting people to stay around and match their actions to their words then they magically will, wow never thought of that.

I'm not sure this is allowed but here it goes:

I've been following this user for quite a long time. He used to post on this subrredit as well as in other subrredits such as the OCD and Suicide Watch ones. He was struggling and regularly made posts about sadness and suicide. Lately, I could tell he was even more suicidal than the usual. He was commenting on pet-related subrredits saying things to pet-owners to trigger them, so they would say bad thing to him in return and he could ""get the last bit of motivation he needed to kill himself"", because, he said, he was so close.

I'm worried because his account was deleted some days ago and he hasn't showed up since then I think. And he was VERY active on Reddit. Me and u/thescopeoflife talked about this and he also doesn't know what happened to this Moose guy.

296,jg021,1553196285,2,"I've only heard good things about therapy and I feel like I'm getting close to the edge.  
I used to have a friend I rarely talked to but about a year ago we started getting really close and I learned we actually shared a shit ton of interests and it was refreshing how open he was about his life and feelings. I think he is one of maybe two people I have ever really trusted. We would chat all night long, just about anything. We could talk for hours about our secrets, our feelings and our most secret interests. Which was quite nice since most of my other friends were kind of hard to hold a long and meaningful conversation with because they are the kind of guys that have a hard time expressing their emotions.  
About 6 months ago my friend met a girl online, they started talking and found out they had a lot of common as well, the same interests, about the same age, they both lived in the same country. So one day he introduces me and my other friends to her and besides me she didn't really seem to like any of them. So she, my friend and I would sit up for hours at night just chatting about whatever and that's when I really allowed myself to feel real emotions for the first time and even though my self reflection got me really sad at first I quickly started getting better since I had them to talk to.  
One night she sends me a message telling me she has to talk to me immediately. I was trying to sleep but I didn't really mind talking to her so I responded. She confessed to me she was in love with my friend and didn't know what to do. This had been pretty obvious and I was just kind of waiting for one of them to say and I were of course very happy for her. She dealt with a lot of depression and anxiety but I helped her build up the courage to tell him and soon after that they pretty much ""officially"" dating. They invited me along for a trip were we would all meet for the first time and obviously I felt like a bit of a third wheel but it was fine since I trusted them.  
When we all met however they kind of started being assholes towards me and being really inconciderate about me feeling down at the time. I knew they were both the type of people to get pretty stressed by this kind of situation so I just left them alone when they wanted to be left alone and hung out with them to the best of my ability.  
They started talking to eachother by themselves for a while after that and I didn't mind since I were busy with school and they were just newly dating and everything. We still talked every now and then and were still friends. Eventually they just kind of stopped talking to me and I've only talked to my friend a few times since then.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you shouldn't rely on your friends too much and I've defintely felt that. They were the only people I could talk to about this stuff and now that I've ""lost"" them it feels really shitty. I didn't notice it that much at first but it has really affected me. I think they have both kind of moved on from me in a sense and going back to them now would only seem like I am finally talking to them again because I need something.  
So to finally get to the point, is therapy worth my time? I am feeling really garbage and I NEED someone to talk to but to me therapy just seems really weird, like I'm talking to someone that doesn't really care about me and the only reason they listen to me is because their job is to pretend like they care.  I've done a lot of self reflecting and at this point I think I might need a professional to find out why I feel the way I do. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated!",lonely,Would you recommend Therapy? (Also venting),2019-03-22 06:24:45

I created a quick survey with the goals of collecting everyone's different experiences with loneliness. It's a subjective feeling, different for each person, and I would like the project to elevate different experiences and voices. Thank you so much in advance everybody.

This year I joined a new class in University after a year off and while I had great luck making new friends who fit me perfectly in terms of humor (with SSRIs for the social anxiety and bupropion for my apathy) they all have girlfriends and since we're in a heavy program they never want to hang out after school. Since I've made friends for the first time it has made it even worse for me. For the first time ever I laugh almost daily during weekdays at school but then I come home to loneliness and I can see the contrast. And then the weekends, they are deafening. Breaks are when my worst thoughts come alive. 

I just got a job for the summer and I told them I want to work every single day and I can jump in any weekend that they may need. They were genuinely confused as to why a human being would want that (other than money). I just don't want to go home to loneliness.

It makes me afraid to like people cause I know deep down if I like someone, I'll depend on them for that companionship that feels so ever rare. Everyone around me just seems to have these busy full filling lives but what of mine? I go work and then go back home and quietly watch a show, read a book, play a game, try to write my story. All the while I'll sigh inwardly cause I crave some interaction. Go to a bar you say? Or some other such place? I can't really deal with crowds and I'd just end up sitting or standing silently in a corner counting down until it seems to be an acceptable time to leave. I find it hard to just randomly walk up and talk to people and thus most my friends are online. Most follow that same friend trend these days where if you don't reach out....well you might as well not exist for each other. I have these fantasies in my head from reading books are watching shows where I see friends hanging out with each other...doing stuff....just enjoying each other's company and I'll think to myself....why can't I have that? Is it wrong of me to want that? Yes? But when that one person shows me attention I'll get expectant. 

""Ah, I've finally achieved that fantasy""

But often that's one sided, one or two times is enough for them and then it's back to lonely times. If I reach out more to that one person that showed interest....I'll push them away. If I don't....I'll just be forever be sitting alone with my thoughts slowly driving me insane.

Some people befriend you as a fashion statement and for personal convenience. And you know what's fucking funny?  They think they can justify their actions through their self centred needs. They think it's all about them and always about them. The whole world, the entire universe, everything has to turn up just right for them to enjoy their fucking afternoon tea. I'm done. I cannot trust people anymore. I cannot trust anybody anymore. I look at everybody with suspicion and I have realised that I'm a terrible judge of character.

331,jg021,1553119747,2,"I am usually pretty confident but when it comes to talking to girls I like I'm a total fucking wreck. I would like to share some stories about that and hopefully gain some of your insight.

&amp;#x200B;

There was this girl that new to my grade, we were both kind of lonely since she was completely new to the school and my friends weren't in the same class as me. We both came early to school basically every day so we started hanging out before class, just chatting about whatever. At first it was super awkward but we quickly grew closer and became good friends. We used to chat at night using Kik and we had some stuff in common, mainly the type of movies we liked. One day I realised I really liked her and that was probably the first time I was really in love. I was pretty self aware and I knew that I wouldn't try to push it too hard if she didn't respond to my signals.  
So I started trying to get it across to her and pretty soon she started to catch on and respond. For some reason I couldn't just say it out loud, no matter how hard I tried. When I was finally starting to get to a point where I was comfortable telling her how I felt she started avoiding me out of nowhere and hanging out with some of the more popular girls in her class. Pretty soon after that I found out she had started dating my best friend, with whom I had also started to glide apart.  
We didn't speak for about 3 or 4 years and I met her again for the first time a few months ago and she didn't seem to remember me at all, I hadn't been thinking much about her since then but when I saw her I immediately remembered everything and tried to talk to her but she seemed genuinely confused.

&amp;#x200B;

There was another girl I had been friends with when we were very young but when we reached higher grades we stopped talking and I didn't think much of it. When we got older we ended up in the same class and started talking again, mostly because my best friend was dating her best friend and we were kind of forced to hang out because of that. We became friends again and started hanging out and talking inbetween classes. By our last semester I was sure I liked her and I didn't want to fuck it up this time. I started giving pretty clear signals, not in an aggressive way or anything. She obviously didn't mind and carefully started confirming my signals. However I was very unsure about what was going on and how to tell her how I felt, especially since we were basically never alone. My friends were probably onto me and every time someone mentioned it we would just laugh it off, but I would feel really shit and it kind of looked like the girl felt the same way but I was never sure and I didn't know how or when to adress it.  
Now we share a german class and even though we ocassionally talk she seems to have shrugged it off and moved on, I didn't want to do the same thing but it seems like I have anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously problems talking to people you like is extremely common but I would just want to know if someone has some good tips for not being a pussy other than ""just do it"" or ""just tell her what you feel"".

First, I have always had a hard time making friends, I am extremely introverted. The one friend I had became frustrated with me that I wasn't contacting him enough and when I told him that I had in real life stuff going on and it was hard to talk to people about these things, he sent me a barrage of texts saying a lot of hurtful things one of which included ""You're emotionally fucked up kid, fix yourself"". We haven't spoken for a month and a half now and its become difficult to talk to him after this, he is also pretty high maintenance.  Along with this, I have social anxiety (and anxiety in general) so it's very difficult for me to initiate conversation with people. I get along pretty well with my coworkers and enjoy being around them, but many of them always hang out with each other when not working and I feel sad that I am never invited along. I always tell myself that sometime I'll ask them if I can come along, but have not been able to get to it. Secondly, I have a crush on a beautiful and amazing girl at work. However, she has a boyfriend who also works there and their relationship is very stable and happy. I am happy for her, and I would never try and sabotage the relationship, but I have feeling for her that I have little to no control over and these thoughts are very difficult to control during the day whether or not I see her.

But still, I keep my distance. I don’t think I have anyone who I can 100% trust or feel like I can fully depend on. I feel like I would be a burden if I try to depend on them every time I’m have my lows. I fantasize about finding a lover who I can trust and depend on completely. But I haven’t found anyone. Sometimes I get attached too fast to people who (1) are very nice to me, (2) seem like they are interested in me, or (3) have a lot in common as me, and I kind of get too excited and pour my affection hoping that things will escalate into a relationship cuz I’m sick and tired of waiting. But even when I’m “pouring” my affection I don’t actually tell them that I like them cuz I’m scared that my feelings will scare them away. I just send them a lot of texts, be very very nice to them, want to hang out all the time etc without actually talking about my feelings. Usually I get friend zoned or slowly fall apart. (Idk I thought it would’ve worked cuz I’m a girl, but maybe it’s because I’m ugly) Once I realize that they might not reciprocate the feelings (like if they like someone else or their reaction is not enthusiastic) I just shut my feelings.

It use to really bother me and make me want to cry but now I’ve just gotten semi use to it I just drown them out with my own music and shows in my room from their laughters.

Here’s where I talk too much about my own life struggles.

It’s easy enough to say get a job and then you can move out and live your own life outside of the house (I’m 20 so I could easily do things. I’ve tried to get government aid money but my dad earns too much money for that so I’m literally kinda stuck unless I magically get a job or I turn 22 and be claimed as independent) but also I’ve been trying to find a first job for years and that’s really gotten me down That I haven’t been able to get anything. (Especially since this year I decided not to study and go to uni after graduating from my art diploma) 

I never really leave my house. I’m always at home, I’m not close with any of my family and there’s always little to no communication between us so I just stay in my room and don’t bother and just waste my own life. 

I do have some friends irl but they live hours away from me and I don’t always get to visit them and I’ve already vented to them about my life struggles and I don’t want to make our group chats the place for venting so I’ve just stopped talking about life bothering me there.

I started feeling lonely almost immediately after I moved out of my parents house, but I thought the feelings would eventually subside. I have my ups and downs like anyone, but my life has taken on a deeply permeating sadness.

During the work week, I usually get home, eat dinner/watch a tv show, and either go to the gym or study for the LSAT (I’m trying to apply to law school within the next few months). 

I talk to my coworkers a decent amount at work, but they’re all a great deal older than me for the most part and I can’t help but feel old and boring talking to them. I feel a bit envious of my friends and acquaintances who work in younger offices.

I hope to get out of this place soon—within the next few months—when I hopefully move into law school, or a better job near the city, but right now my life is incredibly boring.

I have been alone pretty much since grade school, I was alone through my whole education, no one talked to me. It wasn't until I started working that people started to talk to me, it wasn't because they outright liked me though, it was either talk to me, or the walls. This is just the way it seems to go. I am never really *wanted* and the most I can hope for is to be tolerated.

I recently enrolled in a class, of about 30 people, it has fallen down to about 15 people. I know these people relatively well, but only by proxy, I happened to be near by when they said something about themselves to another classmate. Every single one of them. But I'm not supposed to know any of it. They didn't say it for me to hear. I have spoken to some of them, a few words here and there, I relish these exchanges, it makes me way happier than I let show, usually, some times I do get too enthusiastic about some one wanting to talk to me. 

An example of this, in this class, we were learning a certain ""thing"", I had displayed aptitude in this specific ""thing"" and one of my classmates was congratulating me on it and asking me for advice, I was way more hyped about telling this guy my technique for the ""thing"" that I practically stumbled away from with little regard to my success. Admittedly I hadn't realised I had performed the ""thing"" successfully but even after performing it successfully after that, I was way more excited about the opportunity to talk to someone it brought on than accomplishing the ""thing"" itself. 

I am on my final week of this class, I have watched friendships form, and I was left behind, I'm not upset about it, I'm not even disappointed, I knew this is how it would happen, because this is just the way it always goes, I am just lonely. I will always be the lonely one. If anyone has any other option to talk to anyone else they will take them over me. That is just a fact. 

I'm not upset, at least that's not what I would call it, upset would insinuate a certain amount of outrage or surprise. I think the word that describes what I'm feeling is probably just defeated, or exhausted. 

I want to have friends, I want to not be the last choice, but that is always how it is, no matter what else changes, this doesn't.

      For most of my 23years iv  always had somebody to call my own not necessarily the same person but there was always somebody there. When I didn't have somebody I had friends and people I could lean on but over the last year I've lost everybody. Either due to my actions or their own. I already have enough abandonment issues and trust problems  due to my biological paretns every guy knows my life story and still treats me the same.I havnt had insurance for a couple yrs so I havnt been able to/want to see a therapist. The idea of having someone be paid to listen to me kinda makes me sader. Basically self diagnosed with depression and anxiety tho. So years and days are better than others but for about 3 years it has just been too much. Everyone around me  is so fake and just want to use people for a ride, or to smoke, or borrow $.  I have been in bout 10+ relationships but I've had a handful of them  come into my life and promise me forever, no matter what, all the same b.s. they all say and possibly mean at the time but they dont mean it forever, one even purposed.  apparently forever means no more than 3 years. After spending the last 6 months trying to make it work with someone who promised forever(more convincing than anyone before) loves me so much but they can't be with me anymore because of the pain they caused me... if I didn't have my mom I would have already spiraled down a deep hole and hopefully never come out. I don't start work for another two weeks so I sit here everyday alone, no one texts me, no one messages me, no one cares. I'm not perfect and I don't expect the world but I care and love deeply and I make sure I show it regularly but I guess I have my own problems are too much for them. I dont need a man to be happy but I just want to feel important to someone in this world. I'm a nice,  genuine, thoughtful, intelligent, social butterfly  who just wants to make other people happy, and help them anyway I can.  I cant remember the last time someone really cared about what I was going through (other than my mom) Sometimes she's not as much help as she thinks, but that's how moms are. I have ""friends"" and by friends I mean guys that will talk to me cuz they think they can get in my pants. Not bout that at all.. I have been told many time I have have fairytale version of what i think love is and it doesnt exist, I don't expect perfect, just a 2 people who r equally invested in each other through the good and the bad. 
      A lot to say with no one to genuinely listen. The struggle is getting to much for me to deal with I had to let it out.

366,Captaincrunchpunch,1553038408,12,"Posted this somewhere else but posting here too. Maybe some of you can relate?

So I am entering the last year of my 20s on Saturday.

It's been a doozy of a decade.

I am finally starting to understand why building a relationship with yourself is so important and how only then can you protect yourself emotionally.

I am currently on a solo trip. I am staying at a really awesome hostel with great people. I conversate with them and get my fill of human interaction but I still feel like an alien. I feel like an alien everywhere I go. Though I love traveling and it is my life source, I always inevitably feel a sense of loneliness.

I am simultaneously in a state of bliss because I am exploring a new place but at the same time a state of sadness because I am reminded how much I am utterly lacking in human connection.

I just feel like I was made to be alone.

I am an INFJ. I don't know if that means anything to anyone but basically I am really intuitive. I am dreamy, complex, hard to understand. I am in my head. Been told I am ""too intense"" ""too sensitive"". I constantly contemplate the nature of reality, consciousness, the cosmos, what life is, what I am, what people are, what we are doing here and where we are going after here. I fail at small talk and superficial interaction. I either go deep or go home. Which usually means I get bored with the interaction.

And for this reason, I don't connect. I don't feel like anyone truly understands me and I think people find me too intense to want to spend any amount of time around me. Sometimes I don't even have to do anything. I can just be trying to be as simple and normal as possible and ask them about their life. Be interested. Keep it basic. And by just looking at me they get freaked out or it's my energy or something.

But I also have a normal lowkey human side. I love going to art museums, observing architecture, trying new food places and loving the tastes, getting lost in the tastes. I love music, literature, traveling, learning about everything I can. I love simple things like a coffee and a sweet snack. I love just walking around, looking at the sky, taking everything in. Hiking in mountains..challenging my body.

I look around and I see people (especially when traveling) who just seem to be enjoying each other's company effortlessly. I can't find that. I want that so bad.

I guess I am just wondering if anyone has ever been so lonely but got lucky and found someone who got them? Someone they never got sick of? Someone they felt safe with?

I know I shouldn't need someone this badly but human connection is the essence of existence. I truly believe everyone craves it and I think loneliness is more common than we believe but people just ignore it or deny it or aren't aware that they are feeling it. I am so aware of it. too aware.

I guess I am just feeling lonely, and like any feeling it will pass and I will continue to enjoy my trip, have conversations, get lost in the experience that captivate all my senses and appreciate my short time here.

I am focusing on myself. I am really trying to develop a solid relationship with myself because I know no one can be responsible for me and my happiness. The last thing I want is to be in a codependent relationship..it was my relational model growing up and I am trying so hard to break that pattern. So I have spent me entire 20s either alone or in really shitty situations that I luckily got out of. I guess I spent my 20s learning.

I spent all day with myself and had a great time and saw many great things. I like my company...I just wish I could find someone who does too.",lonely,Any lonely INFJs out there?,2019-03-20 10:33:28

You think to yourself – “I didn’t leave the light on..”*

*I look up from the toilet with a half assed grin, a magazine in my hands, and rip another huge fart. Simultaneously you catch the scent that has enveloped the bathroom, and proceed to gag before turning around and walking back to the bed.

&amp;#x200B;

A lovely feeling, is it not?   


Let’s face it – day in and day out you sift through posts on here that were written by guys who promise you the world. Flowers, candies, dinner dates, shopping, and whatever else. Some guys just want to get you in bed and get in your pants only for you to be the next notch in the bedpost. Some guys just want nude pictures. Some guys are secretly cheating on their spouse/girlfriend.   


Then.. There are the guys like me. I’ll promise you nothing. Flowers die. Dinner digests and turns to poo, clothes and material things wear out, and I saw my mom naked one time – so I already know what females look like underneath their clothing.   


The ONLY thing that I have to promise you is.. My honesty and respect. It’s not much – it’s not tangible or something you can hold in your hand, but it’s what I hang my hat on. In a world filled with guys who are addicts, deadbeats, can’t hold a job, cheaters, or whatever the case may be – I strive to set myself apart – because they’re all seemingly the same, and I’m hardly the same. I’m different. Vastly different, and I know you’ve read that and seen that, and been told that before. However, let me show you. Let me put my money where my mouth is and prove to you that I am a very, very different kind of guy that you’ll likely never meet again in your entire life. My convictions are different. The way I live my life is different. I don’t adhere to the “norm of society”. I’m not normal. I’m far from normal. I’m unique in many aspects and my personality has many facets that you may or may not fancy indulging in. I’ll tell you this much though, if you want unique – you’ve found it right here. If you want “normal”, I’d suggest you move on and message someone else. However, as you’re reading this, it would be a fairly accurate assumption to say that everything you’ve done in the past isn’t working for you – otherwise, you wouldn’t still be reading this, correct?  


The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results each time.   


I don’t consider myself a man of integrity. I consider myself a man who is here to live and enjoy life. I’m a man who’s primary mission is life is to be happy and to perhaps bring happiness to others along the way. I feel this is the meaning of life. Happiness is the key to living a fulfilling life in my opinion. Happiness is also subjective. You won’t make me happy. I won’t make you happy. There’s only ONE person on the face of this Earth who can bring happiness to a person, and it’s themselves. Only YOU are responsible for your happiness. Sure, I can give you reasons to be happy. I can do things that make you smile or giggle, but at the end of the day, I’ll never be able to bring you true genuine happiness. I DO consider myself a man of responsibility and somewhat success though. I own my home and vehicles. I own a boat (an old boat, but it’s still a boat..), and have a dog (a 3 ½ lb Yorkshire with a mouth that will WAKE THE DEAD).   


I am NOT many things. I’m not an addict. I don’t smoke or use tobacco products. I’m not an alcoholic. I’ve actually never been drunk in my life. I don’t understand why people like to drink hundreds of dollars worth of alcohol, only to throw it all up again and remember nearly nothing about the night before. I’m not a perfect 10. I have flaws, many flaws, and while I’ll be the first to admit that I’m completely and utterly far from perfect – compared to some of the guys I’ve seen on dating sites/apps, I might as damn well be. I absolutely 100% do not tolerate hard drug use. A little 420 never hurt anyone (though I've never done it personally, I feel it's a rather harmless substance) and well tobacco, that's just.. Not me either. Not a deal breaker though!   


My hobbies are vast and diverse. I’m very much an electronics nerd. I’m into ham radio, and anything radio communication. I was an engineer for a radio station in Southern Kentucky a few years ago actually before relocating. I’m also into diesel performance – mostly drag racing highly modified diesel pickup trucks. I spend most Friday nights at the local drag strip during the summer/fall. I also enjoy doing DIY things around the house. Little woodworking projects, etc. I also love to work on/piddle with cars/trucks. I do my own oil changes, and (most) all of my repairs/maintenance in my driveway. My Craftsman tools are one of my most prized possessions. I’ve been known to spend 45 minutes walking around searching the ground for ONE lost socket or wrench (found it). 

&amp;#x200B;

On a darker note, I’m also rather into BDSM and kink. I've been involved in the BDSM lifestyle for the betterment of nine years now, in several aspects. This isn't something I tend to really share openly, but in time, perhaps it can be discussed as adults.   


What I’m looking for is above all someone who’s personality is every bit as beautiful as the rest of their body. The old adage “beauty is only skin deep” is utter BS. Genuine beauty sinks deep into one’s mind, one’s soul, and one’s personality. The human flesh and body is only that. If you don’t have a beautiful personality, you’re automatically a total mutt.

&amp;#x200B;

While all of this may sound great and grand, there is one caveat. I'm married. I'm happily married of almost twelve years. For this reason, I am polyexclusive/polyfidelitous. For what it's worth, she is bisexual and also polyexclusive. I understand this is most likely a deal breaker for many (all?) but in the name of transparency and honesty, it is the truth, and you, the reader of my musings is deserving of the utter truth. Everything I said earlier is also all true. I'm seeking a long term romantic and emotional connection with someone - someone who wants to join my family long term and share life, share compassion, and hopefully - share love.

I’m at the point in my life where I don’t even expect a single person to read this fully, and I can’t even be mad about it.

So i have a girlfriend, that I like a lot, for now 6 months, friends I’ve known for years, and all those relationship are basically based on “Wow, you’re a good listener !”. And I fucking hate it. 

On one side, I can’t blame them. Whenever people around me start talking, I can’t help it but feel deeply involved in what they’re talking about, I just feel like it pleases them.

But I’m pretty sure, and I’m not even joking, it’s been MONTHS since I last had the opportunity to talk about myself.

I’m a huge video game fans, I watch series/movies, I read, I draw, I play the piano, long story short lots of interests I’d love to share, but hey ? Who cares right ? 

I don’t know how to make my point with people. I just want, once, even a tiny and sincere “Hey, how are you ?” would be fine, but no, I’m surrounded and I feel so alone, I’m just done. I can’t do it anymore. I feel empty. I feel like everything I’m doing with my life is pointless, it is a fact, I like people’s attention, heck, I LOVE it. And if it’s not for that, what am I supposed to do ?

Make sure to pleasure myself first ? I can’t. I first have to care about how my gf’s internship is doing bad, or how my friend Eric has trouble with girls.

i´m still busy with the transition because not everything is done yet, for example my voice hasnt been changed yet which absolutely sucks!

i´m so lost, I lost all my irl friends when I changed because they think i´m mentally ill or something, I just want friends that can accept me being a girl that has a more guy-ish voice.

I never talk too much unless I'm with friends that I really enjoy spending time with.

Some of them know about my severe mental health issues and I know some of their secrets too but now that connection has died for months now. We've had normal conversations about school and other topics other than mental health so not everything was about sharing my sobbing stories. 

I'm in college still, actually graduating in April so I can go back home to my family and away from a city where I used to have connections with people. Funny thing is, I wanted to leave my hometown because I didn't wanted to see my ex-friends. Moving to a new city was exciting because I hoped I could start over but instead I ran into so many problems with people who let me down.

I learned that people are exhausting to communicate with and causes so much anxiety. I spent 2 years trying to make friends here as well as focusing on school work. I focused more on friendships than school because I just wanted to make a close connection with people who I had interest in (platonically). Now being in my third year here, I've just stopped chasing friends and focused on my school work but it's been getting difficult again because when I have free time, I do the same crap and sometimes I wish I had a friend over at my dorm to loaf around with me or to go out for drinks, shopping or just events that are happening around the campus and city. 

I talk to myself everyday when I'm alone because it helps my anxiety but that's not always enough. But even having friends, they exhaust me still because I get so much anxiety about if I'm their friend? Do they care? Am I annoying them? and so on.

I feel like an attention whore if I am posting my sob to my instagram stories because I know that's the kind of things nobody wants to probably see from me. I don't always do it but I'm at my lowest again where my thoughts are negative, i just needed a release.

403,lucyclementine,1552942667,2," 

I am a bright, attractive, thoughtful, and empathetic 30-year-old woman living in New York City with my boyfriend. We're very much in love and happy together. These are the good things in my life. Less good things: My job is fine and pays a decent amount. I work from home, and because I'm an introvert with social anxiety, this is both a comfort and an issue when it comes to making new friends.

I had some trouble making friends growing up because of my introversion/anxiety/generally preferring books over people, but I didn't get bullied that much. I've always had at least 1 or 2 girls I could invite over for sleepovers and vice versa. I was the most social from ages 18-27, starting in my last year of high school and continuing through the years after college. I've had two serious boyfriends, about 15 sexual partners, and usually at least 3 close friends I could rely on at any given time.

This all changed around the time I turned 28. I moved back to my hometown, started dating my current boyfriend, and my two best friends from high school I'd kept in touch with, been on vacations with, and visited for years up until that point, suddenly wanted nothing to do with me when I moved back. They ghosted me when I asked to hang out, and I never found out why. This was extremely painful. I cried for days. It felt like a breakup. Over the next two years I also gradually lost touch with almost all of my friends from the city where I went to college and spent most of my 20s. I still keep in touch with one girl--we write letters to each other, text, and message on IG--but we're no longer super-close.

My boyfriend and I moved to New York because we love it here and hate my hometown, where he'd lived for a long time as well. We both have jobs and know some people in the city, but they're more acquaintances than friends at this point. We've been here about 5 months now, so it might take some time to make real friends...but I don't know how to start or if we ever will.

I thought that I'd have 1 friend here, because she and I were friends for years in the city where I went to college. We used to hang out at each other's apartments and go to parties together on a regular basis. Anyway, we had one lunch here, at my request, and then she ghosted me. Again, no explanation. Again, I was crushed. I asked my therapist why this could have happened, because she and I got on so well and even had marathon phone conversations while I was living in my hometown, and she said that the old friend must be intimidated by me. She asked if the girl was pretty, because maybe she's intimidated by how pretty I am? I thought that was an odd thing to say and unlikely. She's very pretty. And because of what happened with my hometown friends, I think that either she (and they) outgrew me or they all just dislike me now because I've changed or there's something wrong with me.

So, I just turned 30 and I am completely girlfriendless for the first time in my life. My boyfriend is my best friend--he's amazing and so supportive. But I need more than that. And I'm afraid that other women might want to be friends with me but then change their minds when they find out I don't have any at the moment. Because that's weird and abnormal, which means I must be weird and abnormal.

On top of all that, my boyfriend wants to get married and I don't...because I have no one to invite except my family members. I'd be too embarrassed. This makes me sad, because I love my boyfriend and want to marry him. Instead, I suggested we elope.

Anyway, I'm pretty surprised to be in this position because I'm a nice person, normal looking, and normal acting (I think? Maybe I come across as awkward or obnoxious and have no idea?) My major fault is that I developed an eating disorder in college and have been in recovery since. I am thin but not anorexically skinny anymore, and even when I was still having a hard time with my ED I had more friends than I do now. I also have a hard time trusting people and being vulnerable so it's possible that I put a guard up, while still being polite and interested in others. I find other people fascinating but also tiring if I feel overexposed.

Anyway, thanks for reading my novel. Would appreciate your advice.",lonely,I Don't Want a Wedding Because I Don't Think Anyone Would Come,2019-03-19 07:57:47
404,Anon-bruh,1552942591,3,"Had one real relationship when I was 18 which lasted 11 months and was an awful first experience.  She had some serious emotional baggage from past relationship and drama with old friends which, looking back, she probably took out on me.  Only had sex with her 6 times during the whole relationship and she took advantage of my inexperience and manipulated me big time.  Started smoking weed a lot with her too, as she was a stoner.  I had plenty of chances with girls in college but I squandered them, as I had with other girls in the past.  Bad experience after bad experience caused me to stop trying and I probably got inside my own head at one point or another.  Been using marijuana on the daily to substitute the lack of intimacy in my life since end of first semester in college.  Haven’t even kissed a woman, let alone sex, since that semester, after which I stopped drinking and going to parties.  Fell out with my college friends sophomore year (bunch of frat boys) since I decided I didn’t like the whole frat scene (or them really), but looking back I often wonder if I made the right choice.  It was so much easier to meet girls with them, even if they weren’t really the kind of girls I would be compatible with.  For a while It didn’t really bother me, the lack of girls in my life, except for when I felt social pressure from friends and family to get out there and get laid.   But now I’m just a year away from 25 years old, 1 year left of grad school and I feel like I’ve wasted so much time.  Of my friends from high school and the new group of friends I’ve made in grad school, all of them are in serious relationships.  This just serves as a constant reminder of what I think I want/am missing and makes me less likely to do single person things.  But honestly I’m so out of the game I don’t know how I could ever get back in, much as I might want to.  I’m just completely clueless with women and what little instincts i may have ever had are long gone.

At this point in my life I'm in therapy for trauma's, going trough a break up, and am changing study/schools. I don't really have any friends in real life and I try to accept that and am mostly okay with it. Sometimes though I do desire a good chat and someone appreciating me for who I am.

412,RemoteHistory,1552906739,12,"Just venting. 

21 year old girl in college... I feel like I fucked my life up so bad I don't care about the degree anymore, college should just be about meeting people. Which I don't. 

Failed out last year because I turned myself into a nasty alcoholic (to cope with my extreme social anxiety) and worked my ass off to make them let me back. Its not working out so well. Im still sick all the time and too afraid to ask for help. Everything always comes in waves. Half the time I have to leave class and take swigs in the bathroom just to breathe. 

 I sleep around from dating apps as often as I can because its the closest I get to someone giving a fuck about me. They never hit me back afterwards which makes me feel even worse. (what do I expect?) Im still there, sadly, just to meet people...but deep down I just want someone who will like me somehow. I feel dumb because Im a young, attractive girl that can get laid but it makes me even lonelier. 

I have like three friends who I honestly don't even like, but they're all I have. They're those three friends you meet your freshman year out of convenience in the dorms, really. Every minute around them is torture because I find them so annoying but its better than sitting in my room which is what I do 90% of the time. 

...Which is because I'm a camgirl, and while I make good money doing that, it isolates me. I started doing it because I couldn't handle social interactions in the first place, and the drinking stopped me from keeping a job. I'm also a sugar baby, which is usually more of an escort kind of thing. It makes it hard to connect with humans when you're a sex worker. Half the battle is valuing yourself in other ways. I know I have so much else going for me, but I just don't know how to tap into it yet. 

To top it off, this week I found out I got myself pregnant (like the idiot I am) and I reached out to my ""friends""-- but nobody really cares or wants to talk to me about it. They act like I'm disgusting or stupid for letting it happen in the first place. Going in for my abortion in a few days. I sleep with so many dudes I have no idea who the father is (not that it really matters I guess) so that kind of cuts out the option of talking about it with whoever they may be. 

I don't know what to do. I can't sleep most nights just out of loneliness, even worse these days because I spend hours crying alone in my room because of the stupid pregnancy hormones. I try to talk to my ""friends"" but they're always out with their boyfriends so they don't respond.  I haven't had a significant other since high school.

Isn't it weird how ignorant people become when they're in love? You hate them for it, you envy them, but you can acknowledge they look like a moron with their head so far up someone else's ass. Yet, yeah, you want it for yourself so badly it hurts. 

So pathetic I even tried omegle and 7cups. No one actually talks to you there. (again, not sure what I expected.) Can't be open with my regulars or people in my cam room because yeah, no one wants to spend money on a sad girl. Sad girls aren't sexy. I'm not allowed to be sad in front of anyone, even virtually. Now I'm here.

Aside from online, there's no one I care about at all and no one that cares about me. It's been that way for years, so I should be used to it, and all my failed attempts at socializing/trying to meet people. But I'm kind of over it and in a way I wish I could stop knowing everyone from my past (aside from family), move to a diff state, and start over. 

Every time bad things happen (guy randomly flaking on and telling me he's no longer attracted to me mid-week), my heart grows more black and I feel like isolating myself. So much of me just wants love from friends/good people and to return itt, but I feel like maybe I'm just meant to be alone? Idk.

I've been feeling quite lonely for the last year, and every time I have the chance to not feel lonely for a second, this is what people do to me when I talk with them. It's really off-putting and I'm starting to get discouraged to even try to talk.  I isolate myself from the world more and more.

So I went to a barbeque/party yesterday and it was ok. I only talked to a few people that I knew before I left the rowing team and only talked a little bit to everyone else. I didn't really know what to do. And yes there was drinking that night. I was talking to this one girl and she asked me if I wanted to see her piercings and I said no and continued to talk to her about lab stuff trying to get to know her and whatever but she grew uninterested in our conversation. I started talking to her after I saw a majority of the people there with their partners, of which I do not have one. Anyway, she became uninterested and, even if I wanted to talk to her more I couldn't because I had to help someone who was out cold and make sure they were ok (they were, I checked in this morning). Anyway, she started talking to the host and then it looked like they were going to hookup which they probably did. I being a gentleman decided it wasn't a good idea to do anything or try anything because people had been drinking. The point is that even though I was at a party with multiple people, I still felt an immense amount of loneliness and worthlessness. I drove home drunk and cried on the way home because of how I felt/acted. Also, back to me helping the person, o noticed that everyone was cheering on the other guy who helped him with me and not me. I'm not trying to be self-centered and take all the credit but it's still upsetting to feel like no one cared for what I did or that I was even there.

 ""Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection""  

&amp;#x200B;

If you are wondering if this book is a worthy read, I have inserted an excerpt below, taken from Chapter 10: Conflicted by nature. I just read up this part and I felt that I needed to share this with you guys. Warning: LONG read.

&amp;#x200B;

When we feel lonely, we are painfully aware that our social needs are not being met; at the same time, we have a greater tendency to see ourselves as having little control over our ability to fulfill those needs. The prejudiced opinions of others always play a role in this negative feedback loop. If people expect a new acquaintance to be fun and nice, they will behave in a fashion that draws out the pleasant and enjoyable side of that new acquaintance. If parents or teachers think a child is intelligent, they will do and say things that will encourage that child to exercise her intelligence. In one study, participants were introduced to opposite-gender partners after being told that the person they were about to meet was either lonely or not lonely. They subsequently rated the partners they had been primed to consider lonely as less sociable than the others. They also behaved in a less sociable manner toward the partners they expected to be lonely.

When our negative social expectations elicit behaviors from others that validate our fears, the experience makes us even more likely to behave in self-protective ways that spin the feedback loop further and faster toward even more isolation.

So while any of us may become lonely because of a genetic disposition coupled with an unfortunate situation, we remain lonely partly because of the manner in which we and others think. As the trap of loneliness becomes more a function of social expectations and aspirations, the literal reality recedes in importance.

One might expect that a lonely person, hungry to fulfill unmet social needs, would be very accepting of a new acquaintance, just as a famished person might take pleasure in food that was not perfectly prepared or her favorite item on the menu. However, when people feel lonely they are actually far less accepting of potential new friends than when they feel socially contented. Studies show that lonely undergraduates hold more negative perceptions of their roommates than do their nonlonely peers. This divide between the lonely and the nonlonely in their perceptions was even larger when the others being perceived were their suite mates, was larger still for floor mates, and was even more pronounced for students on other floors of their dormitories.

Time also plays a role in constructing these negative “realities.” Researchers asked participants to interact with a friend, and immediately thereafter to rate the quality of the relationship and the quality of the communication. Participants then watched a videotape of the same social exchange and rated it again. A few weeks later the researchers reminded participants of their earlier exchange with their friend and asked them once again to rate the quality of interaction and communication. The participants watched the videotape once more and, once more, rated the interaction. At all four measurement points, lonely individuals rated relationship quality more negatively than did nonlonely individuals. But the further in time they were removed from the social exchange, the more negatively they rated it. They were especially negative after each viewing of the videotape. When they rated the interaction soon after it happened, it appears that their negative social cognition was reined in by their understanding of the reasons for their friend’s behavior. As time went on and memory for the underlying subtext faded, however, the constraints faded as well. The more time that passed, the more objective reality succumbed to the “reality” constructed by the lonely individual’s negative social cognition.

We’ve been together 5yrs and pretty sure that’s cause I love him and he doesn’t want the drama of breaking up with me. I know I annoy him I annoy everyone and I’m always so awkward.

450,Nashnx,1552821695,3,"I got so sick that I had to leave my job 5.5 months ago. I’ve been stuck at home since, besides the times I’ve had to go to the doctors, and the couple times a month my SO and I hang out with our few friends. 

At first, I was so sick that I didn’t care I was alone all the time. The company of debilitating pain kept me from wanting to be social. I just was focused on feeling better. Now I have some energy to socialize, still not able to work just yet (getting there), but every friend I have works or is too busy to talk/puts me on read and I’m starting to lose track of days. If it weren’t for taking my boyfriend to work and back during the week, I wouldn’t know what day it was. We don’t live with anyone else, and I’ve got social anxiety around large groups of people so I don’t bother going to anything remotely crowded by myself. I’ve been sober for a year due to health reasons, which used to help my social anxiety in large crowds (anime conventions/bars). I’ve tried making friends lately but nothing seems right. I feel like I walk on eggshells around new people I want to be friends with because I enjoy having new conversations. I feel like I bother people by asking questions or being upfront. I just miss talking with people who genuinely want me around, and have new experiences of my own. I miss bringing stories to the table at dinner. 

I worked in pest control for nearly two years, and had 3 very good roommates I consider friends still before I moved in with my SO. 

Pest control is actually a really social job to do. Talking with new people everyday, helping them with problems, and besides crawling under houses and spraying for bugs, I touched many lives just by talking to people without judgement, held hands of crying customers because they were ashamed of their situation, and gave them my personal number in case something else arose after my job there was done. I didn’t do pest control for the dirty work, I did it because helping people was so rewarding for me, no matter if some became a problem later or not. It was never something that couldn’t be handled with a simple gentle let down. (Usually customers taking kindness as flirting.) I never let those things bother me unless they couldn’t take no for an answer, which I haven’t dealt with just yet. 

I still talk to my old roommates almost on a daily basis, but with being home alone for so long during the day, not able to leave the house much, and seeing everybody doing something, I really feel like crap when this feeling bubbles over. We all talk mostly over IM, but now it’s just not the same. It hasn’t been bad enough for me to cry about it until today. It’s not like they’re far from me, but not trusting my car’s brakes and not having the money to fix up my broken vehicle or get a new one makes me feel isolated from the world unless I go somewhere with my SO.(I don’t like driving other peoples vehicles for long unless I’m on the insurance.) I barely have the physical energy to walk a mile outside without getting absolute fatigued for the next 24 hours. Living in a town where you need to drive everywhere, and especially near major roadways that I swear never sees a minute without someone whizzing by, doesn’t help the feeling of isolation.

I have the best man in the world, who cares for, loves me, and treats me like his queen and equal. He’s able to work one job and take care of us and our cat without too many hiccups, and I do my best to tidy up our small one bedroom apartment so he doesn’t have to worry about it when he gets home. He even takes care of my monthly bills because I’m not bringing any money in. meet. I felt so bad crying for an hour about feeling lonely while I had a great man and my best friend, all in one, holding my hand and struggling to stay awake so he could comfort me. He’s all the comfort I have right now when others have shown their true colors. (Some I’ve cut ties with because they saw me as their next ‘snack’. Others just left me on read for weeks even when I see them online. I learned to just let go of those who continually don’t respond.) I now understand why house spouses have outside clubs and communities to include themselves into.

It's been less than 3 weeks since I started working after I graduated and I still do put time into other things like chamber choir I just joined 2 months ago, which has been taking around 9-10 hours per week. I've talked to a few of them since it's a large group but they've been close knit for at least 2-3 years so it's a little difficult to get to know them when there's little time to talk during/outside of practice when they are also busy with school/work and they all have inside jokes I don't understand. 

I've also been getting to know my coworkers but aside from the other new person who also just graduated, everyone else is either 5 years older than us and have been there for the 5 years since they graduated or they are significantly older with children or grandchildren. 

In both cases, I'm still in that stage of being friendly with them since it is a professional environment and I haven't known them for very long.

I've already told my friends nearby that I can make time for them outside of work and just hang out for emotional support if they don't have that much time for food or a heart-to-heart conversation, and that I'm frustrated that I live either a walk down from the street from them or a 5 minute drive and yet no one invites me (for example, a friend's surprise birthday party that I'm very close to) or remembers me unless it's some yearly university event as a group, but I want to have personal quality time and feel like I'm appreciated, the way I go out of my way to do things for them unless I'm too tired to drive after work any more than I have to since at that point it's unsafe. 

Since then, only a couple of people have contacted me, I'm the one who attempts to initiate things with other people most of the time, and I'm so bitter and jealous of the connections that have seemed to have evaporated since I graduated, yet they've maintained. 

What do I do now? I miss drinking, eating, playing video games, catching up during parties/kick backs with people I care about, but that doesn't seem possible. I'm thinking of going to salsa nights, trivia bars, and parks/hiking by myself (even though I'm a little scared to without people because of safety), and organizing/decorating my space at my shared apartment to feel more like home. I'm going to start working out again (I stopped for some time after I graduated) and call my dad's health insurance since my doctor said I can self refer to a therapist and I have things to work through mentally.

But at the age of 15 I got into a relationship that lasted 5 years, all of my friends quickly became “our friends”.. well after a messy break up, I lost everyone I thought had my back. I sunk into a deep depression, and really lost everyone. Fast forward a year and I had zero friends, no boyfriend. And basically sat in my room all day all night wanting to kill myself. Eventually I met someone via tinder and we’ve been together 9 months now, but he’s still my only friend. I have no social interaction besides him. I work from home as a nanny, and I have a terrible fear of trying to make friends because I literally don’t know how anymore. I fear that my mental health is a burden, that I’m not interesting enough, that I can’t carry on a conversation.

It takes 7 hours for me to go home and again 7 hours to come back. Because of that I only come home a few times during the semester, big holidays and when I feel like I need to and am willing to spend 14 hours on train.

Right now I am feeling really down, happens every time i go back to Uni. It's not like i hate it, I am doing ok in school and I have some good friends here, I go out, I laugh, I make jokes, I feel like people around me appreciate me for the most part, but every once in a while I feel really lonely, minutes take hours to pass and it just feels hard, you know? Crying myself to sleep has became normal whenever I am alone in the dorm room. Weed is helping a bit and it takes some of the pain of being far away. 

When i come home it is my time to relax and spend some time with my friends (a group of 5 people I would catch a grenade for, and they'd the same), visit my grandparents, walk my dog, have a coffee with my sister and drive the family car and put all schoolwork aside (stress is a big part that I learnt it comes along engineering).

I sent my friends a selfie from the train on our WhatsApp group and one of them replied with a group photo of all of them basically saying goodbye and I'm struggling to fight back the tears. Next time I'll be back will be on Easter break which is not too far away fortunately, and it's a one week break so I'lll have a decent amount of time to catch up with everything. But untill then I'll just have to deal with the distance.

As a side note, my sister is pregnant and is gonna have a little boy, so I'll become his uncle. This got to me more than i thought it would and I get really emotional thinking about it, I am really happy for her, my brother-in-law and the new family member.

I was lonely before, but I coped with it really well (ignoring it) but now is the third time in two weeks I've broken down late at night. My two best friends, with who I really felt like the three musketeers, have gotten a new friend group and I'm slowly being forgotten. We agreed to voice chat once their friend left their apartment and I was off work and.. I waited until 12 am, I finally texted them and they said they had decided to take a nap. Last time we voiced and they both suddenly said they had to go and bye mid-convo, while in the past we'd...actually say a proper goodbye. We don't do it as often anymore. 

I can't talk about this with anyone. These are my only two friends. Everything is reminding me of how freaking lonely my life is.

My love life? None. I never seem to connect with people easily. I'm convinced I'm repulsive, either physically or my behaviour?

Everyone around me seeming to have either no issues or someone that'll comfort them. I want nothing more than to cry out in a friend's arms. To finally have someone as loyal to me as I am to them, I've always been prepared to go to the ends of the world for someone.

I'm just sitting alone in the dark day after day, coming home to no one to talk to, no one genuinely interested in my day. I'm always  hoping that my plans to move abroad will miraculously give me friends/make me liked and I am so scared for when I find out that isn't going to happen.

I have a need for a deep romantic relationship... I just really want to love someone who loves me back for once...

True love is, in the end, all I really want out of life. As long as I have that special person who will love me forever, I’ll be happy.

There’s a bunch of problems with this however...

1. I probably won’t find anyone like this in the near future.

2. I’m still very young (15) so I don’t have much expirience and even if I did find someone we would probably grow apart as our personalities develop...

3. True love is hard to spot. I asume that you can THINK that you’re in love but then realise years later that you in fact aren’t...

4. I just don’t think it’s probable I’ll find someone who shares the same feelings. 


My first love turned out to be a lesbian.
The worst part is that she is literally perfect for me and so I still have feelings for her...
(We’re still very good friends though, so at least I can be happy about that.)

Recently I found out that a girl who I thought loved me (or at least had romantic feelings for me) in fact didn’t. She is just a really flirty person and didn’t realize that it looked like she loved me.



I know that I’ll probably find someone eventually... I just... I don’t know... I just wanted to complain about this, I guess...

I’m sorry if this wasn’t the right sub to post to... (I mean- I feel lonely because I lack a deeper connection that I desperately need. So I guess this is the right sub?)

I’ve been in love with the same girl since I was 15, we had a very intense complex relationship spanning 8-9 years not always together, not always in love together. But always found each other again. Sometimes we’d just be tearing each other apart for different reasons, maybe just to get each other to react. Sometimes. Sometimes we were so fucking in love, sometimes I felt the most joy I’ve ever felt in my life to date. But we were so young. 

Until a few years ago, that’s how it was, even when we weren’t “dating” she was mine and I was hers. On paper it’s all very dysfunctional, but when we were alone, it’s so different. It’s like this version that’s easier to explain to your friends and parents because of mistakes on both parts. But the truth being veiled and intense. Her constantly trying to keep me out of her skin, me trying to get her to admit it at times. It almost because a sick game that I grew to love. Forcing her to admit it. Making her show me she loves me or lose me. 

I suppose it escaped me that initially I just wanted her to love me openly. Unconditionally. The thing that was always lurking under the surface though is I was never truly good enough. But, we’ll get to that. The really sick part is, when I first met her, she was my first true love, I was not hers. It was the boy from the home town that she had unfinished business with. How much that killed me, I don’t think she ever knew. 

But really, it’s not all her fault I ended up lonely. Sure, I’m not good enough. I get it now, but that’s only one genre of sin we committed. I knew from the minute I saw her, walking down the hill from high school registration I needed to talk to that girl, god she was beautiful. The grey sweater, the peace sign necklace (she swears she never liked peace signs yet wears in her year book photo silly girl) those tight blue pants and vans. Gorgeous blonde hair, green eyes, silky white skin, I haven’t been attracted to blondes until that moment. I digress. 

I’m not sappy but, I’ll be damned if it wasn’t fate, love at first sight. The real kicker, my best friend was good friends with her best friend at the time. I couldn’t believe my luck, there she was. Standing next to my future frenemy, the very two people who’d hurt me the most. So I walk over and play it cool and greet my friend and ask him about the girl I don’t really care about. Her name is Alisha, then I ask the most beautiful human being I’d ever seen what her name is, Breezy. Sipping her Starbucks nonchalantly. The Angel in my nightmares.  

We get to walking home and talking, I’ll be honest it’s been so long, I don’t recall what we spoke about, I don’t have a good memory, but I do remember being so overjoyed to be breathing the same air as this goddess in front of me. Getting her to laugh and smile. She was so pretty. We end up getting to Alisha’s grandmas house at the time, (I think) then we say our goodbyes I hug her and I don’t remember if I had the nerve to get her phone number or MSN account for instant messenger. (Yeah, back in the day. 😅)

Within a week of school starting we started hanging out and walking around and talking a lot. Little did I know the very beginning would lead to so much heart ache and struggle. I asked her in a very corny way to be mine, she accepted and I was over the moon. I had a lot more confidence back then because a lot of girls were virgins and inexperienced whereas I had lost my virginity at 14. But, in actuality that detail came back to bite me in the ass. 

A week and a half. That’s all it took, I didn’t know how much she meant to me. But I loved that girl and it turned out she loved me. Partially the reason I was so numb to the feelings was I dated a psychotic girl I thought I loved for a year and 8 months before her. Jasmine. The bane of my existence. She was verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. But at that age, you don’t know better, I was “in love” and getting laid. It made me feel superior to my peers. But it cost me so much grief.  

My first sin: I had been separated from Jasmine for a little while and I thought I could be friends just like all my other ex’s I didn’t see the problem what’s done is done. Or so I thought, it hadn’t occurred to me how manipulative and sly her feminine powers could be but week and a half in I find myself alone with her under a guise of a talk. At the time I apparently was blinded by hormones or blatant stupidity, or that I still loved her. Despite all the shitty things she did to me. She used her silver tongue and got it wrapped around my penis before I could think things through. Trying to justify it in my mind, I just let it happen. The irony is the clarity in release, the overwhelming dread, remorse and guilt of the first and only time I betrayed love.  

The next day, I ate myself alive and knew what I had to do. I remained distant and hid the words in my throat until we could be alone and didn’t have any obligations. Walked to a corner outside the school building with walls on three sides and stood in the shadow of the sun partially shining in. I explained what I had done, how sorry I was didn’t bother trying to make excuses. 

The brief silence. How she began to cry, the image burned into my mind. Her slumping down the wall and covering her face to her knees yelling at me to go away. How she never wanted to speak to me again. As I walked away, I didn’t know how much I ruined my own life. How I broke her heart. 

6-8 months of groveling, her lying to me, apologizing, agonizing, obsessing. Just to get to speaking terms. I can’t even believe that’s not the worst part. At least not for me.  The thing is all the instant messaging, trying to do things to be around her, texting, begging, explaining, hurting, sacrificing my pride. The pain, the anguish, the hurt, the heart break, the struggle the everything I haven’t event explained yet. 
I’d do it all again. Just for one more life time with her. 

It’s been over 2 years. My friends know the whole story, no one seems to care anymore. But I still miss her every single day. She’s moved on and is happy with someone else. But I can’t bring myself to love anyone else. Not like I loved her. She was everything good about me, she was everything to me. My life feels so empty without her. I’ve learned to live with that reality.

I have severe social anxiety and just couldn’t relax around him even though he was very friendly as always and it made me want to kms. I was being very quiet and sad and tense and the only thing I would say comfortably was suicide jokes because I was so nervous to be around my friend...who’s been my best friend for 4 years. We call every day, text, know everything about each other, have so many inside jokes. Anyway, I became seriously suicidal after i went to visit him on Tuesday, because I knew something was really wrong with us, and I acted really weird. I think I hurt him by acting weird around him. He’s been pretty much ignoring me ever since, and when I told him I was suicidal, all he responded was: Im drunk. He has never ignored me when I told him I was suicidal because he knows I’m capable of it and have a history of suicidal behavior. I hung myself on Thursday night and got down because I considered that maybe i could wait a few days or weeks and everything would be back to normal with him. He’s been distant like this before, but never when I told him I needed him and that I was suicidal...I really am shocked that it seems he doesn’t care if I live or die at this point.

482,hateful_raven,1552747862,15,"Hey all, how’s everyone doing? A little backstory about me: I’m a 24 year old man, 6’1”, 230 pounds and muscular, an introverted/weirdo artist, an avid reader, explorer, and adventurer. Guitar and lifting weights are my primary hobbies. I’m an electrician involved in a union apprenticeship, so I make great money and have been self-sufficient/on my own for over 2 years now. I have suffered from crippling loneliness and chronic suicidal depression since I was 11. I was extremely scrawny when I was younger (130 pounds in high school) and over the last several years have made strong, active efforts to improve my life, get bigger, and become more confident. I’ve only ever had one real girlfriend who was much older than me (31) and she ended up gaslighting me for 2 years and presumingly cheating on me. Horrible waste of time, money, effort, and devastating to my mental health.
My problem is this. I seem to be doing all the right things for years...lifting, have a solid career, independent, talented, creative, nuanced...but I still struggle big time with loneliness. I have a hard time meet quality women and friends because most people my age are so entrapped in the party lifestyle and that’s not something that has ever fulfilled me. I just long for deeper bonds and relationships built on things that aren’t so purely meaningless and superficial.
A few weekends ago I went to 3 public libraries and just started confidently approaching women I thought were attractive and started making conversation and being flirty. Some were reciprocative, some were shy. I’m actively trying to meet worthwhile women but it’s extremely difficult because I’m naturally not a confident person and am chronically depressed. I think about committing suicide literally every single day because I feel that all of my efforts to improve myself are useless if I have nobody to share them with, nobody to invest in, nobody to create a meaningful relationship with. I feel pretty hopeless so any advice would be appreciated. I know many of you feel the same way.",lonely,Where do you meet quality people? Feeling hopeless.,2019-03-17 01:51:02

487,moody_jazz,1552728551,13,"A few days ago, I just became a member of this group on facebook where people share dark memes, sort of like r/2meirl4meirl. I honestly thought that there would be other people who are going through a similar situation as myself, and that I'd be able to relate personally to some of the memes. However, the memes are only making me more aware of my loneliness and isolation, and as a result I feel even worse than before.

For example there was a post with the caption ""going home after being the funny friend all day"", then a picture below of a tired, dejected Spongebob entering his house. Many people seemed to relate to this, it got hundreds of comments and reactions. This seemed to imply that those people actually have close friends that they hang out with, and this made me feel even more miserable by comparison. It's not even that I don't relate to this particular meme; it reminded me of what a loser I am for not ""going out"" or being invited out on weekends. 

I know this is a silly thing to get worked up about, but I even get jealous of how people tag their close friends in the comments section. I don't have anyone to tag. I'm not really close to anyone enough to share depression memes with, and even if I did I doubt they would even care. This made me feel even more like a loser, because at least other depressed people have close friends and social support.

However, I’m now more confident in my personality and in being able to make a conversation move forwards. I’ve never been called straight up ugly and I get shocked looks every time i thought I was. Nonetheless, I haven’t been called hot, just cute. 

Anyways, within the last few months I started trying to befriend people. I invite them to eat, suggest things to do, listen to everything they say, make them laugh, and I juggle ideas/conversation with them. The problem is that mostly everyone seems to not reciprocate. They don’t initiate things but they are friendly towards me, but sometimes I feel like I’m being made fun of.

I’m a 19 year old female, decided to run away from my problems at 17 to London to start a new life and start studying at university to make new friends and improve myself. I know that sounds young but because of the trauma I’ve been through I feel like I’m a bit more mature for my age however I still have a lot of things to figure out in my life. 
I ended up hating it, didn’t make a single good friend no matter how much I tried bonding and asking to go out with people or approaching people. 
Ended up falling into deep depression and developed anxiety because I smoked so much weed to help cope. Somehow I managed to pass the year but then dropped out and moved back with my family. 
Stopped smoking weed and felt a tiny bit better but there was still nothing that really sparked joy in my life, I couldn’t say I was happy. Just normal. 
Did some internships, spent time with family, basically just went on auto pilot through all of it. Finally now I’m 19 and started at a new location and university in turkey to see if I could try again and maybe it would be better. 
But here I am in my second semester , on my couch, smoking my 4th joint of the day with absolutely no real friends, the only person I managed to meet here I had met him 3 months ago, we fell in love and I had never been happier. I think those 3 months were the only time in my life where I experienced what being happy actually feels. I was on top of the world. I didn’t even care that I had no friends because I had him. 
But now he ghosted me. Blocked everywhere. Worst part is it’s my fault because of my depression I really took it over the line in our arguments , idk how to control my emotions sometimes and lose it. 
So now I’m back to stage one. 
I have tried making new connections here, but seriously idk why this happens to me. I feel like no body likes me, every time I enter a group people get awkward or if I try join the convo it’s like they don’t want me there. Every single group of people I’ve tried getting close to. What is wrong with me? Why can’t I ever make a connection? Usually people end up hating me for no reason instead... idk what I do. Seriously.

I'm slowly realizing that the only real thing motivating me is the drive to become a hero, no not like a policeman or firefighter but actual superpowered hero which is extremely dumb but I've been living vicariously through my hero academia and spiderman and it's been the only real thing motivating me to be better than what i am now so ik wondering what can i do knowing life will never live up to this crazy and foolish dream i choose to believe in ?

I live far away from my family because of my studies and I just miss them tonight.

I don’t really have any friend to confide in about this kind of thoughts. Maybe I do but I never tell anyone about this kind of feelings. As if it’s shameful to feel lonely sometimes. But then, no one has ever reached out to me about their feelings, so why should I bother them with mine ? 

I’d call my parents but I know I’m just gonna burst into tears and that’ll only get them to worry.

We used to hang out all the time when we were in community college because we were all right there and had the time, but when I got into university I worked a lot more to pay for tuition.. all winter breaks and then all summer breaks. 
This friend group would mostly hang out when I'm working or need to study. I'd have anxiety attacks over this and my relationship with them and it was exhausting.
Fast forward to today, I'm working my dream job but I'm 70 miles away from everyone in that friend group. I'm happily engaged (Important later, I promise.) and my fiance has been making friends with some of my friend group. The only way I can keep in touch is through Discord and two of them hold all the power in the server. I tried to add my fiance after asking if it was okay and I did get responses that it was fine but not everyone answered and this was a while ago. I found a way to add him and I did but this morning he was kicked out. Then, I get this long paragraph that says
""You haven't gotten an explanation but I guess now's the time for it as we all have things to focus on..."" and the rest goes on about some times that I fully agree with but was left in the dark about until now and then that he could hang out with them in person or in the other ""game-dedicated"" servers. Then, a couple other members react or belt out an amen like I wasnt listening to them when they hadn't responded to me or talked to me at all before.
We both work normal hours and a distance away. I feel rejected, dejected, ashamed, disheartened.. just lost and sad. They were honestly my closest friends and I don't know where to go from here because they barely talk to me any way.

They make my anxiety flare up, I start getting paranoid thinking every voice I hear is talking about me, and then eventually I end up quitting during the 2nd or 3rd month.  The only time I was ever close to being signed to a FT contract was in 2016.  I was promised by my supervisor and it turned out to be a lie.  I was terminated at the end of my temp trial.

It sucks, you know?  Being unable to hold a job is disheartening.  It prevents me from achieving my goals and it will likely lead me to homelessness.  I do have ADHD and just started taking meds that I want to believe will work magic for me, but what if my stupidity is due to something deeper than just ADHD?  You know what? I could be a HFA. However, to get an evaluation for adult autism , I'd have to shell out 1000+ dollars to some specialized psychiatrist who is located 20+ miles away from me.   I don't have the money or the transportation for that.   My parents don't think I have autism nor does my therapist.  I don't get what I'm supposed to do now.

615,CarryMeToDiamondOW,1552366745,25,"I really thought i could convince myself that I’m not lonely. 

Hey everyone, just another lonely college student here, 23M. And I thought if I kept myself busy, I could occupy my emotions. Everyday I put on this act that I’m happy being single and hitting goals in my life that are “for me”. But a while back I realized, that was all a lie. 

Im going to school full time trying to become a CPA, have a pretty decent job that pays me good, and an all around wholesome person. I love helping my friends with their problems and even covering shifts for my managers when they can’t find anyone, even if it means i have to sacrifice my days off. I love doing things to help others when they need it the most and it makes me feel good knowing they had someone that looked out for them.

I have a great family that I love with all my heart and would do anything for them, but this type of loneliness isn’t the kind that I want a genuine connection (friendships) with those around me....I want to find someone for me. 

I’m scared I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life. I’m tired of feeling this way, but maybe I should accept it. Everyone I come across sees me smiling and laughing....but behind closed doors I’m lonely and worried about not finding “the one” for me. I see couples around me everywhere I go and it gets me thinking “Why haven’t I found that yet?”. I’m not saying I’m not happy where I’m at in life, but I wish I could just find someone to be happy with. 

Deep down I know im going to school for my future family more than just for me, but if I can’t find anyone, is it even worth it?

I actually went on my first ever date which went pretty well, and I thought I was gonna go somewhere but it looks like it’s not going to work out. He’s been ghosting my texts and being flaky about second date and I’m let down again.

In the modern world of dating getting let down is not a big deal but I’m emotionally unstable so small things can trigger a lot of overwhelming emotions for me. I don want to get hurt so I try to keep my distance but then I attach myself too quickly. And I shut myself off again very quickly when I’m let down even if it’s a slight thing (like he didn’t reply to my text etc). 

My view is like “either fully love me or don’t give me any affection/attention at all”. I know it’s really hard to just jump into a relationship or love someone right away but idk... I just want someone to care about me. I let guys walk all over me because I’m thirsty for attention and I just feel like I should be grateful for someone to even give me some sort of affection. But I’m too tired. I let myself fantasize about finally finding someone to love me but I made a mistake again.

617,MisanthropicPotato,1552350836,3,"On March 8 last Friday, I had a kind of waterfall of negative thoughts which suddenly all happened at once. I'm 24 (M) now, and am usually fairly stoic and unemotional, but for some reason I just started crying. I guess that might be my first experience of what a mental breakdown might feel like. I stopped eating for a couple of days and was in a pretty bad mental state.

I began thinking of how lonely I am, how scared I am of no longer existing after death (r/thanatophobia), my personal/romantic future, how I haven't had fun with other people in ages, everything really. I started googling things like anti-aging, longevity, how to find love, etc. I was actually perfectly normal and fine with my stake in life before, but it was like a switch was flipped in my brain. Now these thoughts have consumed me for the past weekend. I just sat in front of my computer and blankly watched gaming videos, not really paying attention. 

Thankfully, I think I've kind of regained my sanity today, and writing this out has calmed my nerves somewhat. From reading through this subreddit, none of the advice people gave has really helped me and I think it's difficult to truly change someone's way of thinking through text alone. I'll probably be stuck in this mental rut for a while yet.

But as an ""adult"", I still have responsibilities for my family, my thesis and advisor, and can only hope things will get better. The best advice I can give for someone in a similar situation, is that things will only get better if you fight for it, only you can save yourself and by the end, we'll all die anyways so might as well give it a shot.

Even if I'm near a girl that is clearly interested in me I'll always somehow talk myself out of being social and talking to her. It's like there is always a voice in my head telling me it's not worth it being social because I'm better off being alone. The truth is I do prefer being alone most of the time and being social for extended periods kind of tires me out and makes me want to be alone again sometimes, that's why I think I'm introverted. But at the same time I find myself really craving something like a girlfriend and for that I would have to be really social and talk to people , which is my main problem . part of it like it said is also confidence, that I sometimes feel like I'm just not good at being social so people won't enjoy talking to me even if I try. So basically im almost always very quiet and don't really talk to people other than my few close friends. I really want to improve on my self confidence and socializing skills so that people will see me as a more friendly person. Things I am trying now is standing up straight and saying hi to people more and smiling . I also try to improve my confidence by thinking of the things I'm good at as reasons that people would like talking to me. What's hard is often I am satisfied just being quiet and alone and thinking to myself for a while , but them this causes people to think I am not friendly don't want to be social.

630,silently-depressed,1552334401,13,"I’ve lost all self esteem. All motivation.

I feel low, really low. 

I feel alone, even in a crowd of people, I feel like there will be no one who understands, no one who cares.

I am a 30 year old guy, with a steady job, a roof over my head and food in the cupboards. 
I have a family who, despite seeing regularly, I feel distant from. 

I don’t have many friends, the ones I do have I haven’t seen in a while I might as well not count them. And the one friend I see often is an old friend from my school days and we have only really got back in touch a few months ago.

I’m single. And despite the loneliness I feel, don’t feel like I would be any good in a relationship simply due to my current state of mind.

And I am fed up. I am tired of putting on the smile day after day, just to make the people I do see think I am ok. 

I am numb. Empty. Lonely. 

And I am wondering whether it is all worth it. 

I lost my mum when I was thirteen. Two weeks after I turned thirteen to be honest. She had had cancer from when I was six, beat it, only for it to come back again the month after she was told to stop taking her medication.

That was my first step. I lost faith in religion, and began to become numb to loss. 

I don’t remember much of her, nor do I remember much of my life as a kid... Hell, I can barely remember what I did last week. It worries me. I can’t even remember the last time I was even remotely happy, let alone content.

I have lost both my grandparents on both my mums and dads side of the family. 
I barely see my dad. He is happy enough with his new wife and her children and grand children. 
But it bothers me that I am not that bothered by it. I should be. We are his blood, his children, but he doesn’t seem to want to know us. I think last year I saw him three times. His birthday, my birthday and briefly at Christmas. Each time it was met with news of my step-sister or step-brother, and no, I don’t see them ever. 

I lost an old school friend too. 
I had gotten him a job in my office after he left his last due to stress and depression.
He was coming on leaps and bounds, planning things with colleagues. Then he had an accident on his way home from work. 
I think I still feel guilty about him. 

And then there is my relationship status. 

I have been single for almost eight years. My ex cheated on me, and then, almost eighteen months after we broke up, she gave her son my name. 
We got in contact again a few years ago, she had changed. I was glad, and was planning to take her for dinner for old times sake, but that never happened. 
I think I am glad about that too.

Since we broke up, I found myself trying to get better jobs. I put all my time and effort in to work.
Without sounding too big headed, I feel as though I have done an amazing job keeping myself busy, I didn’t notice it happening. 

I am sat here, watching Netflix. 
I say watching, it is on in the background, and I am not really paying attention to it. 
I am still numb.

Even then, I was still an awkward dude, depressed, and being an awkward talker due to my potential speech disorder. What initially caused the downward spiral was around late middle school in 8th grade, I creeped my ex-friend out and it haunted me later afterward. Mistakes happen, or you dont realize how much disdain is causing the person or you don't even know at the time, being 14 years old and all. It's been 8 years since that happened, and I still believe that to be the cause of my depression. Nowadays, I lost all the motivation of talking to people, except for a very, VERY select few, a whopping two. One online, one in person, and I dont even get to see him in person that often. 

I remember years ago I used to be watching TV all the time, even playing video games I had all the motivation in the world to actually beat them. Now, it's just been me laying down in bed, watching YouTube every single day, almost never turning on the new 4K tv I had in my room since around late summer last year and having difficulty mustering up to play video games. 

I don't have the drive to talk to people, I'm really having difficulty knowing boundaries of interacting with others, being careful of how to talk to women on Snapchat, never bother to asking and hanging out other people. Just because it's all too unfamiliar to me and my brain is ingrained to this thinking progress. 

I just want to change, all of the hesitation is all to difficult and painstaking. Having a sick father isn't doing favors either, and tho my mother allows me to go out, she's overworrying about me going out somewhere, I know its kinda of a mom thing to do, but that really contributes to my inactivity to not talk to anyone.

It's just way too much to talk about, I'm about to be 22 next Monday, and haven't gotten shit done at all. I don't drive at all, I'm way behind my peers, my social skills are absolutely terrible. I'm just too deflated and feel like garbage who feels like I don't have the brains to know that change exists.

It's not physical like a shove or a nudge. It's what's coming out of my mouth, how it's coming out; and... hushed.

Crushed and stepped on, I can feel emotion under my feet. I can hear it. Can you? My brain rattling about what to do.

How to hurt, how to destroy the feelings they share. How to make them cherish me, then vanish in thin air.

How do I get rid of this! I'll shake and I'll scream! Surely someone will hear me!

All of these people who've given me happiness! I need get out to show them I need them!

Why can't I get through, I must show them my gratitude! Stop pushing them away!

Stop it! I need them, you need them as much as I do! Please let me go!

I don't know why. I haven't had any romantic relationships of any kind in over two years. And it's not like I never socialize, or that I don't meet girls, but for some reason, girls are almost never interested romantically in me. And I wouldn't say I'm ugly either, I would consider myself decent at least, and I'm confident in myself. Maybe it is that I'm terrible at reading other people, but almost no one ever shows interest.

And I don't help myself either. Every time I like a girl, I already assume that nothing is gonna happen, because it hasn't in so long. The very few girls that do seem interested are always girls with which I know a relationship would not work for some specific reason.

I have a lot of girl friends, but I know none are ever interested, and at this point, my brain automatically assumes no one ever will be. I'm just destined to be the best third wheel in the world forever lol

I feel like just out of pure coincidences, I'll never find a partner. Maybe the type of girls I like are very specific. Maybe the type of girls who could like me are very specific.

I was, weirdly enough, in a pretty good mood walking into work yesterday. I walk through the entrance and say ""Hey,"" in a friendly tone with a smile to the hostess, who was standing by a server, and to my surprise she goes from a neutral look to a disgusted/weirded out look and awkwardly says ""Oh, hi?"" No, I did not interrupt her and the server or some shit, they were just standing there.


Maybe I'm a sensitive baby, but it ruined the rest of my shift. I'd assume that she doesn't know I work there because I've only been there two weeks, but I've worked there multiple times while she was there and where she stands is close to where I stand and do my job. I had my uniform with the logos on it too. Then she was weirdly staring at me while I was doing my job the rest of the night and would look away if I glanced over to check why the fuck she was still staring.


I don't know, seems like I'm going to be like this the rest of my life.

However, I feel like nothing matters. I have all of this responsibility, opportunity, and reward for my work over the years...but without a love in my life I feel empty, purposeless, and dead inside. What good is of all this success if I can't share it with someone special?

My relationship history has been extremely rocky. I've been cheated on, left and ""ghosted"", and treated like shit and abused. Despite never truly connecting on similar interests and other traits, with most of my relationships, I've still given it my all, and fought tooth and nail to show my love and affection for my partner. At most I've ever gotten from someone was 3 months...

People tell me ""Oh, SOMEone will come along. Just you wait!"" Well, I know it's childish, but I'm tired of waiting. I'm in my prime, right now, and I don't want to ""go it"" alone...

There was once I tried sticking up for myself so I grabbed the broom. He looked at me. I was holding it like a bat ready to swing... Though the thought ""He is your Dad you can't hit him"" went through my mind. In that instant he snatched the broom out of my hand and swung instantly at my face no hesitation... If I didn't have fast reaction, the scar I have on my hand right now would be on my face, left eye (assuming I didn't lose my eye) so yeah... Excuse me for not thinking so highly of him... Everyone who knew about my beatings as a kid would use the excuse ""He is in the military, there is a lot of things and stuff he has been through"" in other words he has PTSD (which is true) but is that an excuse?

717,_UncleRuckus_,1552174294,0," **Who Are We?**

We are The Glory Hole, a group of nerds and loners from around the world with ages ranging from 16 to 35 that get together every day to hang out and pass the time. We are a server for meeting new people and making friends, and despite our numbers, we are still a pretty small close-knit group that would love to expand our circle with more unique and interesting people. 

**What Do We Do?**

We are a mainly voice-active community, so we spend most of our time chatting together while we play games or go about our day. We run a popular weekly movie and game night, in addition to a monthly game tournament, art club, Minecraft server, and other special events. There’s plenty of text and media channels to share your interests as well as a variety of voice channels for larger or smaller conversations, watching movies, or playing video games. 

**Our Philosophy?**

While we aim to facilitate a fun and welcoming place for online strangers to meet and make friends, our core philosophy rests on the concept of free and open discussion. This means the staff takes a hands-off approach in regards to the opinions of the users and the language used. At the end of the day, The Glory Hole is all about hilarity and friendship, nevertheless, if you are easily offended, this probably isn’t the place for you as we tend to have silly hazing processes for our new members.

**Should You Join?**

The Glory Hole has provided us with genuine and long-lasting friendships, and we would love to provide this opportunity to others such as yourself. A group of people like this is an amazing way to make new friends or at the very least fill those lonely evenings up with lots of laughter and other voices. So if you're 16+ and at all interested in joining our group or poking your head in to see what’s up, I welcome you to follow this link: [https://discord.gg/H4w58Px](https://discord.gg/H4w58Px)",lonely,"The Glory Hole, a place to make genuine friendships or merely decrease the loneliness.",2019-03-10 10:31:34

I 'm in my mid 20s and 6 months ago I started over a new life. All people I know live pretty far away.  I came a long way struggling with several addictions and decided to kick them all and start over. Depression is not a new thing to me but lately I cannot make sense of anything going on in my head anymore.

I have a job I like and normally beeing alone is not that big of a deal for me as I am obsessed by making music... it's the one thing that keeps me going. unfortunately  I am terribly lonely and depressed lately. I feel trapped. the only people I have real contact to are my co workers which are unlikely to become real friends as I can't be the person I really am in their presence. I do not like most people and most people can't cope with me due to me having had this type of past. 

I tried to make connections and find friends here but the resonance I get is frustrating. And the more frustrating it gets the more I fall into destructive behavior like drinking etc. I am treating people bad that frustrate me even if they are nice to me and I don't know how to stop it. This might sound selfish but after all I think I do deserve someone that at least partly understands what I am and how I function/think. 

 I'm also having a bad time with girls due to beeing small, skinny, and scared from my past. I'm basically invisible to them. I feel like I'm running circles. Everytime I go out and try it gets worse. I try to be productive and work on my music but without any inpiration it is totally impossible to be creative. You cannot be ispired by not having a life. 

Sometimes I consider doing drugs again as it would generate at least a bit of a social life I share with people that head in the same direction although it's the wrong direction and I know it.

I do not want to be like I am right now. 
I want to be a nice and friendly easy to talk to person that isn't cynical about every aspect of the in my eyes pathetic and selfish life people live around me and that is what in fact makes me pathetic and selfish as well. I look at people that sorround me as if they are possible outcomes for my future and it makes me cringe. I can't change my past or not be the person I am.

Advice would be highly appreciated.

It feels like my life is going nowhere, fast. I have to do something about it, like finally finishing high school, or getting a job, but it's so difficult. I have nearly crippling anxiety, stemmed from the bullying and loneliness I experienced during the time I was in school, which evolved over time into a hatred and disgust of who I am and what I look and sound like to others. It's hard to find the motivation to try to do anything anymore.

This sort of destructive aimlessness has been plaguing my existence for a long while, and I want it to stop. For some reason, however, I just can't seem to take that first step - its becoming more frightening with each passing day, but as I sit here and do nothing, my anxiety for the future grows. I'm caught in between being scared to go out into the real world and being scared to stay here until there really is nothing left for me to do.

At the centre of this cavalcade is this crushing loneliness that I feel, caused by my inability to love myself. I'm not stupid - I know that for anybody to love you, you NEED to love yourself first. But I've been just sitting here in my home, hoping something extraordinary will happen eventually. It won't. I won't magically get better, or suddenly love myself unconditionally for no reason. 

I don't want attention; I'm not that kind of a person. I've never posted something like this before in a place where a lot of people could see it. I just felt like I needed to vent out a lot of the things swirling around in my head tonight that are preventing me from sleeping. In a way, this is me trying to take that crucial first step forward - even if it is just a tiny baby step - by admitting that there's a problem, and identifying the problem clearly, I can attempt to work to resolve it.

I don't mind if nobody sees or replies to this. This is more so a letter from myself to the world, saying that I'm going to try to get better from here on out, than it is a social media post. Like a checkpoint or milestone of sorts. This is physical, binding proof of my own commitment. 

It doesn't have to happen tomorrow, or the next day, or a week from now, but change is going to come whether I like it or not...so I must change myself in order to avoid being left behind by a world who doesn't care about people like me.

But it's the way he worded it that got under my skin. Am I not a friend? Am I not as important as those friends?

When I read that I suddenly realized I was sitting alone in my room, talking to a person halfway across the world. It really hit home just how alone I was. It sucked ass. 

What really hurt, though, was the fact that I came to the realization that I'm always the one starting the conversations, and always getting spurned, or cut short. Not just with this one friend, but all the friends I've made, locally and online. I'm always the one saying hello, or wishing them well, or chiming in. But I don't get any of that. I may get the odd greeting every now and then when I don't show up for long stretches of time, but otherwise nothing. I keep going back and forth, arguing with myself, saying that they have their own lives to live and I shouldn't be harassing them, or engaging in worthless self-pity, but here I am!

I have no idea anymore, I really don't. I've tried so hard recently to engage others, to socialize, to bring my walls down and risk getting hurt. I've gone up to strangers and struck up conversations, I've made myself bury my shyness and bring out every last bit of energy into talking to others and learning about them.

The main reason I never really wanted to have a party was because of the fear that Noone would come.

I organised everything, I invited (2 weeks ago) 6 of my closest friends and they all said they'd come. Two days ago 3 of them cancelled on me with some excuses, and then a couple hours later the 4th person also cancelled on me. Since it was just me and two other friends left I decided to cancel the party. (this was due to the fact that they're from different groups and it would've been awkward idk).

I was already heartbroken that my closest friends aren't really that good of friends as I thought they are.. And one of my friends (who didn't cancel on me) asked if I wanted to go out somewhere with her anyway. So I accepted.

780,Imthatguy0029,1551940102,8,"My favorite cousin died tonight to drugs. Lately, I've been hearing about some of you willing to turn to drugs in your times of need. I'm telling you all this story in hopes I can save some of you that may be in the same situation.

A few months ago I was introducing him to Eve: Online, and he was very excited to learn that I'd been playing the game too. While I was showing him the ropes, he openly told me he had been suffering from depression and was trying to keep himself in check. I don't recall how I reacted at the time. After a bit, he moved to an area with another cousin that didn't have internet, so I didn't hear from him at all.

A week or two ago, my 4-6 year old niece found him unconscious, bleeding at the nose, foaming at the mouth with needles around him in my oldest brothers basement while he was visiting one day. Too young to understand clearly what was going on, she was scared to sleep in her own house that night and slept at my house. My oldest bro and his wife did what they could, and he was taken in an ambulance unconscious and using machines to breathe.

There he stayed for a week or two with his family unsure if he would live, be braindead, or miraculously be ok. Family members posted pics of him on Facebook asking everyone to pray. Apparently some of them knew he'd previously done drugs but didn't know he continued.

The drug was called the strongest drug out there by the doctor, also called a serial killer in the streets. I don't know it's exact name. My mother also told me that she heard it was originally created to sedate elephants. Pharmacists explained that contact with your skin alone could kill a person, which was problematic when it came to trying to clean it up properly to keep the niece and even younger nephew safe. They won't be allowed down there from now on, just in case.

Clearly, my cousin didn't know what he was getting into with this drug. I know this because I know he wouldn't have wanted to cause all this trouble, especially in front of such young relatives. He had no idea how deadly that drug was, or perhaps he had no idea what it even was. Idk.

I didn't think I'd be too upset. I hung out a lot with him when I was younger and looked up to him then. Part of me feels like he's the most to blame, but I also understand that he was going through depression, and had previously been exposed to drugs probably causing him to become an addict together.

Tonight I was woken by one of my brothers and told the news. I didn't react much but with frustration, not in front of my family. I went out to walk in the cold  to grab me and my little bro mochas at a nearby gas station. I normally do that to find time alone to sing on my way there. It was the best I could do to mourn my cousin's passing. I couldn't manage to finish my songs tonight.

TL;DR: cousin was depressed, ised drugs for support and died accidentally taking something deadly unknowingly.

I know it's tough out there guys. Please don't turn to hard drugs to get away from your problems. It may not always seem like it, but there are people who care for you. Once you get past a certain point, it's hard to get out of drugs and it makes your problems so much tougher to remove. Reach out to others and let your pain push you to do something more positive. If you're already into anything harder than weed, honestly, let someone responsible know or call a hotline. Many times you don't know when you're past the point where you need someone else's help to see the problem and stop. I promise there is at least one person out there who will or does care about you, one person who you make a difference in their life, no matter who it may be. I wish you all the best.",lonely,Cousin Died to Drugs,2019-03-07 17:28:22

I have a purpose in life that i’m never uncertain about.  I have grown to become a fairly well-rounded young man despite a less-than-optimal upbringing to be gentle.  I’ve conquered addictions and come face to face with and accepted many of my demons.  But my undying desire to be married still burns inside.  Loneliness has been my constant companion.  I’ve never been in a relationship before although i have seen enough of the good and the bad to know what it takes and what to avoid.

Waiting has felt like an eternity though.  And especially more recently.  I met someone within the last year or so.  She’s a couple years younger than me but she’s such a mature and driven and resilient woman who i admire very much.  It didn’t take me long to develop feelings for her.  And recently it became apparent to me that they may be mutual although she hadn’t said it outright.  I knew that we were on a collision course.  Not being ready but also not wanting to lose her i decided to talk openly with her about things.  And it went very well.  We came to agreement that there are some goals that the two of us still want to achieve for ourselves individually, that we were willing to revisit things at a later time, and that we could definitely manage to stay friends in the meantime as long as we set some boundaries so that our feelings didn’t grow out of control.  And yet, here i sit, alone in my bed in the dark, thinking about her.  I’m determined to follow through with my goals and i know i can, but that doesn’t take away the loneliness.  When my mind wanders, it wanders to her.  I imagine what feels like infinite unrealized futures.  I know i shouldn’t as it just adds fuel to a fire that, for all i know, may be destined to never come to fruition.  But my hopeless romanticism is just part of who i am.  When i hear love songs i think of her.  When i’m around her, i feel like i’m floating in a sea of warmth.  I can look into her eyes and see the best parts of me.  And at the same time every word i say to her is not what i want.  When she asks me how i’m doing or how i’ve been i say i’ve been pretty good.  But what i want to say is “I’ve been lonely.

I have been lonely after my dad had passed away 5 years ago. Back then I didn't know I was lonely and I didn't know what I could do. I didn't speak to anyone about it because no one would understand what it's like to lose a father (at the time).

Since then, I have been seeing that lonliness spreads far beyond Social Isolation only. And, I realized that all of us just want to be listened to and not talked at all the time. So, I have made a website where I want to display stories of people who want to talk about how it feels to be lonely and how it had got them there. 

I see loneliness all around me, and instead of giving 10 tips on how to combat loneliness I want to hear what you are going through.

- just take a shower bro! get a haircut!
- just be confident bro!
- just treat women like people bro!
- uggh stop watching anime
- etc.

This advice all just echoes the same old bullshit. They assume someone who is lonely has horrible hygiene, horrible attitudes towards women, or is some basement-dwelling anime weeb.

I don't watch anime. I make 55k/year at a corporate job. It's not much but I graduated college late (at 22 yrs) so 1 year out of college this is fine for me. I dress well, I carry myself properly, I speak alright. I shower and brush my teeth.

People, for whatever reason, just can't process that it's hard for someone to connect with others. Simple as that.

I used to be quite the extrovert and in my elementary school and middle school years I had tons of friends. Or at least that's what I thought of them as. I was that guy who everybody knew but I didn't have a ton of super close friends. I had about 7 really good friends at the end of sixth grade which was fine by me. By the end of middle school I was down to two of the originals and one new close friend. And that brings us up to the present. By people moving and just growing away I now don't really have any friends. I'm that guy that everybody thinks highly of and everyone thinks of as a great dude, but is forgotten instantly. Don't try to assume it's because I'm selfish because I like to think I'm not and based off the rest of the high schoolers I know when it comes to kindness, I've won. In ninth grade I immediately lost everyone, I tried to communicate and I'd be dismissed or left on read. I locked myself in my room and either emptied my feelings into video games, Netflix, or my notes which I have amassed quite a bit of. It was the first birthday I'd spent alone and I spent it with frozen pizza and Netflix, basically a normal day besides the pizza as an award. I play two sports and would always be the person without a partner. It was no different during school. I remember once I was the first to class and I sat down at a six person table and all five other chairs were taken away and put up to other tables so people could sit with their friends. Once in gym we had a free day and nobody would let me join their game of basketball, I just got shrugged off even by my teammates. I soon gave up and spiraled down. I'd go days without talking and didn't mind it. All I needed was my mind and people were too much work anyways. I soon became more and more of a background character until people didn't even notice I was there anymore. I miss people. That's the main thing I'm writing this for and I don't even know why I'm writing it. People always seemed to let me down but I've become so socially awkward I don't even know how to talk to people anymore. I feel like I'm screaming into the void sometimes. I just want a hug really.

I empathize with them however. I’m a hypocrite, my own worst enemy. I’m done trying to make friends with people face to face, they will simply never care as I do for them. I give up.

I won’t stop trying to be a decent person though. I have no expectations for anything anymore, aside for myself. I just want to grow a garden, I miss that most.

Still, people should be allowed their own lives, unattached to chains of guilt and shame. It’s odd to think the very attachments to those we love are also in a sense a prison - what we give up to spare love.

I make a lot of jokes, I tease, and I'm grossly sarcastic. I'm sorry if that's not your taste. I don't know how to turn it off 🤷🏾‍♀️. I respond positively to memes, gifs, and pop culture references.

I'm passionate, dramatic, and love to tell stories using hyperbolic statements. I only mention this because I've noticed that people believe everything I say verbatim and it's maddening. I just love a great story.

I hate holidays because they usually make me realize that I only have friends from school, those friends are only friends with me at school and that outside school, I just stay at home lonely.

I guess I'm just not that likable. I'm quite a weirdo: I'm 16 but I'm becoming bald, I can't small talk, I don't really understand social interactions - am I supposed to just stand there?-, I've never kissed someone, I have a weird accent because of a speech problem and the last time I went to a friend's place I was at elementary. People might think I'm smart - I can talk about Goethe or the Venezuela's crisis -, but being rather honest I feel dumb and I'm probably never going to be someone. Talking about Goethe or watching old Italian movies just because being pretentious is the only thing you have left has never made someone's life better.

I think very often that I'm never going to be loved.  And in a certain way, that calms me down. The thought that if I killed myself I'd not going to be missing anything is quite resting. But I can't really kill myself. So I just keep living a lonely existence.

She did some sort of depression/grief screening, gave me a checklist and asked if I had any friends I'd trust to confide in and no, dogs and family don't count. and having to tell her I didn't.

And oddly enough, ancient words from a dead guy still ring true. I'm trying to make a habit to care less about what others think, to gossip less, and to speak no ill of others. It does not work well when everyone seems to do so, and honestly I meet some really asshole-ish 'dumb customers' due to club work, but this line is what I need to remind myself:  ""Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility."" - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations Book Three 

From what I can understand from the paragraph that line's from, Marcus realizes humans are social creatures and it is inevitable to think about others, what they think of you, how they see you, whose dating who, who cheated on who, etc- but it is best not to dwell on it, except when it is of a base utility. Do not waste time over whose dating who unless knowing that will help you navigate social situations you cannot avoid, loosely or strictly, basically; and that thinking about others too often will lead to negativity.

I'm actually quite good at making friends but I find that I never really attract the people I have anything in common with. Most of the time I just go straight for my generic/polite/shy persona when I hang out with people because I just know that my genuine self is too out there.

I have a very dark sense of humor, I make cynical comments but I am actually quiet optimistic. I am also pretty blunt and I don't like the idea of having to hide things from others to save face; it makes me feel lonely. I'm kind of fucked up honestly and in turn some of my interests and opinions might be strange.

I don't want a lot of friends...I'd rather have a select few (or even one) who I could be totally comfortable with.

The thing is, I'm a sophmore girl in high school. You all know how challenging high school can be. I'm extremely isolated: I have no friends and I've joined all of the clubs I could. It's a private school, and everyone there is cliquey and snobbish. 

My mother doesn't make it any easier. Sometimes she cares, then sometimes she tells me to get over it.  She's technically the only ""friend"" I have, and even so she's wishy washy.  

I'm often sad and I feel like crying a lot. It doesn't help when I see others having a blast with their friends or dates. I know I won't have a sweet sixteen this year or go on my first date, and it honestly makes me feel like I'm missing out on something big (although it probably isn't).

Trying to chew off whatever I can't stand  
Let the sun blacken and blot  
Let an icy Hell stretch out over land

The seas shift and stir  
These old scars burn and sting  
The blood-black bile drips from my cuts  
World'll stop before this pain ever does  
Life will end before I get what's mine

No matter how long I spend wrapped around your finger

Not an angel in sight  
Nor a candle to light  
A disease that knows no curing  
A fight that knows no end

There ain't a part of me worth saving

I'm hacking off every useless bit  
Every finger that's not intertwined with another  
Every flap of skin that's not felt intimacy  
I'm going to destroy my body before the big freeze hits  
I'm going to tear apart this fucking flesh prison I've been trapped in  
I'll throw every limb down the drain  
I'll drain out every drop of black blood

I'm only returning the favor

I wanted a friend so desperately. So whoever I met I used to tell them that I don't have friends. Thinking that somehow they might like me and be my friends. I would do anything to get a friend. Every time I was neglected. I was so embarrassed. So I tried to get away from people. 

One day that thought came to my mind changed my entire way of thinking. I came to realize that I love being lonely. Why the hell am I trying to be someone that i'm not. Life is so short for being lonely my friends. Accept Yourself for Who You Are and move on. You're not lonely. You have your goals and dreams. Achieve them.

912,Arsimael,1551618505,3,"Hi.

If someone wouldhave told me ten years ago ""Hey, in 10 years you were married, getting divorced and work in the biggest Software company of europe after living a year in Australia"" I would have laughed at them call them nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

But here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

During my 33 years I had a lot of... I don't know if I should call them ""relationships"" because I never felt safe and sound in anyone of them except my last one. My experiences so far: People just want to be with you as long as you provide a home, money and food. As soon as you want them to participate in your life together, they are gone. This happend in nearly all of my so called relationships. 

&amp;#x200B;

\----- The following text is for better understanding why I think like this. If you are annoyed by personal ""whining"" - skip it---  


&amp;#x200B;

My first ""girlfriend"" at the age of 14(? Can't really remember if I was 14 or a bit older) was... interesting. Although if I look back at this time, I was young. And I think it's natural if your first ""SO"" in life is not the last one. Well, we broke up since she fell for my best bud back then and just stopped talking to me.

My next three or four relationships were mostly the same. ""Teeny"" relationships, nothing serious. I was the ""vehicle"" to get in contact with other people around me. Then I met HER. Guys... never fall for a woman which has mental issues. It all started with me seeing her on a concert. She lost her wallet and was looking for it. I found it earlier and gave it back to her. She had a black eye and a few other ""marks"" on her which made me curious about how that happened. We talked a lot and I met her ""boyfriend"" - A retard which treated her like... well, not very good. 

We became friends and after some quite unpleasant events including the police she finally left her ""better"" half and moved on. About half a year later we were a couple. 

On this point: Guys (and Girls) NEVER form a relationship out of mercy and because you want to help someone.

Anyways it moved on for about a year or so and things were ok. She had some issues and I could understand them (I was 20 at this time). Things like not sleeping with me 'cause her ex forced her and tortured her in bed etc.

A few weeks later I found out that she was sleeping with her ex. I wanted to pick her up after workand saw her jumping into the car with her ex. I drove home, tried to call her several times and she told me that she was just getting ""some stuff"" from him which were still at his home. 

Later that day I had a long talk with her best friend, and I had no Idea. She had a mental illness and was seeing her ex the whole time we were together. I was her ""waste pile"" to get her problems off while her ex was the one she was sleeping with. - Of course I broke up with her. 

Big Mistake. It took me another year to finally get away from her. She was stalking me hurting herself and blamed it on me, and in the end she hurt me with the words ""If you ever leave me again I kill you"". 

As I already said, in the end I got away from her.

&amp;#x200B;

The next four years I stayed for myself. Until I met him. I never considered a guy as my SO in my life, I never had any thoughts on same-sex relationships, but he was... cute. We talked a lot until I flew around half of the world to meet in person and soon we became a couple. I moved. We lived together for almost a year until the government made it impossible for me to stay longer. With enough money I could have bought a visa, but that time, 4000$ or 4 million dollars, both would be the same. So we both moved back to europe and got married. I knew him for two years and I thought I found the one I could settle down and get old with.

For the next three years we were living together. I got work at a good company, earned good money and slowly we could build up a life together. Well. more I build up a life for us. He was sitting at home, playing games all day long and I felt more and more like a provider for food, home and internet. I did the cooking, the chores, everything.

Over the three years I constantly asked to help up a bit. Doing chores, learn to cook. And most importantly: learning the language. I did not expect much, just to see that our relationship and I am important in any way, but all I see was a person, totally caught up in online worlds, talking to people he would never meet. I felt like his online friends were more important than me. 

Then I told him I can't go on line that anymore. His parents always nagged us for him to come back and visit them, so we decided he fly back and take a vacation. Also for us to get some space and think about how things should go on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well... I waited for another two years. Constantly hearing ""I am coming back after my brother birthday. I come back after Christmas. I am coming back after dads 50th, I am coming back after nanas 75th birthday...."" and so on.

Last year I made a point and asked straight away if he ever wants to come back to me, because after two years I don't want to hear another ""I am coming back after..."". 

And he said no. He never wanted to come back and started dating someone else. So I filed in for a divorce. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was last year in June. 

&amp;#x200B;

I quit work about 2 weeks after this and started a new job. I moved to a new appartment and went on. Of course it hurts, but I needed to get out of that job, that home which always remembered me at the failed relationship. 

In September I started dating again. I have my 33rd birthday this year - And I give up.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

From what I experienced so far (I know I am generalizing things):

People don't want to open up to me. I am good as long as I am having a job, earn money and have a home. But really ""being together"" seems like something totally extraordinary. 

Most ""dating apps"" and websites I had a look at are mostly a ""Whom I am going to fuck today"" instead of a so called ""dating"" app.

If you go out and try to meet people, you are ""creepy"" and just want to hook up and fuck. 

One evening I was sitting in a pub with a Friend and I got called ""stingy"" because I did not paid for a drink for a woman which sat down next to me. She did not talk to me, just sit there and waited for me to buy her a drink. (After five minuted she got up and walked away, telling her friends in a loud voice to stay away from that ""stingy"" guy over there)

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I give up.

I start minding my own business. Doing my job, earn good money and live my own life.

913,yawaworht66767,1551617048,3,"So, I'm here on a throwaway because friends know my main account.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously, what chance do I even have anymore? What chance do I have not to be alone all the time?

I have a small circle of friends that's slowly dying because everyone is moving away. This circle consists of me and 3 other guys. Two of them, I mostly communicate with in memes. I haven't even met up with those guys since New Year's intentionally. Well, to be fair, one of them now lives like 400km away, but the other guy, I just randomly ran into at McDonald's last Thursday after not seeing him in almost 2 months.

And the other guy? I guess we're still pretty close. We see each other about every other day, but that's also gonna change soon, as he's gonna move an hour and a half's drive away in May. We're probably not gonna be able to meet up more than once a month then.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the only one in this circle of friends who's still single.

Why? Probably a combination of a lot of factors.

I don't think I'm ugly. But I don't think I'm conventionally attractive to girls my age either. You see, I'm short, I'm extremely skinny, I look way younger than I am. No 18 year old girl that I know of wants a guy who looks 4 years younger than her.

Well, that's at least what I'm assuming right now. Might be completely wrong about that, but that's not the main problem I have.

&amp;#x200B;

What's way worse is that I have no means to meet anyone my age right now. 

Almost all the people I know my age, I know from school and haven't kept in touch with since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Going out on weekends? None of my friends are into that, and neither am I. I'm not gonna go to a bar or club on Friday evening alone, just sitting there and not talking to anyone because my crippling social anxiety is keeping me from doing so.

I don't drink alcohol for reasons I don't feel comfortable with sharing right now. I hate loud places, I hate crowded places, I hate not being able to breathe properly.

So, going to clubs isn't really an option for me.

Going out of my comfort zone? I've tried. I went to a club with 3 others like a month ago just to try it out and it was fucking terrible. The minute I went in, I wanted to go home again.

Every time I try going out of my comfort zone, I get reminded why it's called a 'comfort zone'.

I can't go out of my comfort zone, because it defines who I am. At least not in this regard.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting better at talking to strangers, and talking on the phone, because my current job requires me to do that on the daily.

But that doesn't help my situation at all. I'm still the same lonely fucker I was before.

I still get extremely awkward around people who actually are in my age group.

&amp;#x200B;

I can never get over past crushes because I never actually get to tell them how I feel.

It doesn't even matter if I think she likes me back or not, there's just always this barrier in my mind that keeps me from actually telling people how I feel.

I don't know if it's fear of rejection, fear of humiliation, or anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

What I actually think is, that I have a general fear of people my age not actually seeing me as one of them.

As I already said, I don't go out because it makes me uncomfortable to the point where I would rather just cease to exist than be stuck in the setting I currently am in.

I don't drink alcohol.

I look 14.

It always kinda felt like people my age never actually saw me as one of them, but rather as someone's little brother who was brought by someone because their parents told them to.

&amp;#x200B;

There was this one girl I liked a year back, haven't talked to her in a while. Maybe I should text her. Probably should, what do I even have to lose.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm gonna wimp out every time I want to do it anyway, what's even the point

I'm a leap year baby. That's not really one of those things a lot of people forget because it's pretty much the only interesting/unique thing about me. My entire life I have celebrated on the 28th because the 1st was always reserved for my dad (parents are separated). I don't have a lot of friends to begin with, but that's because I am super socially awkward and antisocial. For all of my friends I always wish them happy birthday on time, I never forget a birthday. However the 28th rolled around this year and only my mom, dad, and boyfriend wished me happy birthday. I said something to my other ""friends"" and they were like ""oh I'm waiting until tomorrow"" and some other excuses, but my thing is, I have never celebrated with friends on the 1st, why would I change that this year? No one wished me happy birthday until I asked about it. Well, I posted something on my snapchat story that said ""thanks for all the bday wishes I didn't get"" (because I'm kinda petty).

I also planned to do something with 3 of my 'best friends' today and 2 out of 3 cancelled, and both of them blatantly lied to me. One of them forgot (she also forgot every single time we were supposed to hang out over other breaks) and the other lied about having to go to work, and I told them both two months ahead of time when I would be home, and then reminded them a month ago, then two weeks ago. One of those people was also supposed to hang out with me the next day as well and also cancelled that as well. I cried today because I'm already very lonely because I got to college 860 miles from home, drove the 12 hours back home to hang out with them, and they cancelled. 

I'm also that friend is never invited to anything, and always left out of conversations and pretty much everything.

920,J-HOL,1551589616,1,"I don’t know where why when or what I fucked up but I did. I’m 16y/o male, in alright shape and not bad looking, 5,11. I live in the inner city so there a plenty of people around. Never had a gf, never kissed anybody etc.

I’m a social person but only at school. I talk between 2 groups. One is a bunch of guys who never get out and essentially just talk about video games and the other is an inclusive fun kind of group. I’m trying to move away from the vg group and towards the fun group but it’s kind of hard. But when school stops that’s generally when my social life stops. 

Recently though I’ve been trying to be more social and get out with people but I’m just never invited to gatherings, no one tells me anything no group chats etc. 

at was only yesterday I tagged along with some friends (fun group) and headed to mates house where we had dinner, stayed the night and had a good time. At this gathering my best friend was there and so was my long time crush. This is where I start wanting to die.

So this girl I’ve liked for 2 years or so is IMO perfect. She’s pretty, funny, friendly etc. I’ve never really made a move to her and I don’t know why. Is it cause I’m anxious, or nervous that I would ruin what was there already or the fear I would get rejected or ridiculed idk. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was due to this. That my best friend who had known her for longer than I had started dating her out of nowhere. I felt like shit for ages. Then she moved away and they broke up. In this time I managed to ask a different girl to formal and even go on a date which ended in rejection.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway it was a good time at the gathering and I was starting to build some confidence with her. She was laughing at my jokes, and was even a bit physical. Then my best friend started to get comfy with her always managing to sit with her before I did etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it got late a lot of people at the gathering decided to stay the night. And both of them decided to sleep together. Not sexual or anything just cuddling. But the really agonising part was That I was the only person there sleeping alone. Some people slept in threes even and there I was lying in the furthest part of the room in agony, losing sleep over just how angry and depressed I was. I got the kind of thoughts which just echoed in your mind like “no one will ever love you” and “you’re pathetic”.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I’m going to be seeing everyone soon again so I’m ready to endure another round of emotional torture as long as there’s drinks and mj.

So that was my night, how was yours?,

&amp;#x200B;

\[UPDATE\]: the night started well enough. Everyone had a pretty fun time. We had some boof and a beer. And then truth or dare happened... at this point my best friend in the aforementioned post was stoned to shit and I was feeling it a little. A lot of the time was near to either me or my crush. This time it didn’t bother me cause it was starting to seem like she flirted with everyone. 

Truth or dare was fun for the first half of it and I did get chosen for a truth or dare question. They chose several people more than once. It was around halfway through that my slightly drunk slightly high brain figured out that none of them actually gave a shit about me. I was never the daree’s subject nor did anyone want to be my choice. After this we headed back to the hosts place. The whole way there I was just thinking of ending it all oncoming traffic, some big drunk guy to piss off anything to make me forget that the group of people who I cared for and had fun with were completely apathetic towards me. When we got there exactly what I predicted would happen, happened. They all of a sudden didn’t have enough room in the apartment for all of us, despite one of the other originally planned guests leaving beforehand. I just got my bag and left and only got a goodbye from 2 ppl near the door. At this point I considered heading up to the roof to see if I bounce or not. I then cried in the hallway a few levels down and left the apartment. Now I’m at home wondering why nobody likes me and crying. Is it my personality? Am I more unattractive than I thought? What led to me being so fucking average that almost all the people who I previously enjoyed being with become nearly apathetic towards me specifically? Is it the life experience gap? Because they had all had their first kiss, date, sesh etc. way beforehand? I'm just gonna go to sleep and hope I don’t wake up for now

i don’t know what i’m doing anymore, i’m just floating from day to day - trying to survive. 
i felt better for a couple of months and everything was ok but now i’m starting to just feel shitty again even though i desperately tried to look on the positive side like i once could do so easily. even now, i’m letting my negative thoughts spill out for a second and ill probably regret ruining the good thoughts i’ve been trying to stick to helplessly these last few weeks. 

i just don’t know what to do anymore - i just don’t feel good and i thought i had escaped the terrible lonely feeling for a little while but i hadn’t, i had simply ignored it and stored it away deep deep down.

934,idiedformyownsins,1551556314,160,"I'm in grad school and I've tried to combat my social anxiety and loneliness by talking to as many people as possible in class to get them to study together with me at the very least. Some people I've studied with several times and in my opinion we have a great time both learning a lot and having fun but I realize it's the same pattern as always in my life.. I'm the one who has to ask people if they want to do something or ask them what's up.

I've never been asked how I am. Or if I want to hang out. On summer breaks during high school I never talked to any friends. When high school ended since I always texted first I lost all my ""friends"". Same in college. And now here. I don't require much. I just want someone to ask me if I want to study for the next exam together or grab a cup of coffee or whatever. Just something. I recently went through my conversation histories with people in my class and I was honestly shocked that I started literally every one of them. Not a single fucking time have I been asked. 

And I don't think I'm a ""freak"" or something? Since most people say yes when I ask if they want to hang out to study. Or do they pity me? 

I'm thinking of going radio silent but I know I will lose the little basic human interaction that I get very quickly. But I probably will because I like testing the waters and confirming once again that I am a fucking failure. 

Also, why are some people so fucking slow to answer texts? Some people take like 4 days to answer easy texts. I always try to be a decent human being and answer as soon as I can and it really hurts when people who I know aren't doing anything special take so long to answer. Especially if I just want to know something that I missed like what room our exam is in which is kind of urgent. I know they have the leverage since I always text first and ask the questions so I can't really do something like that to them to show them how it feels. And if someone texted me first I'd be too excited to not answer immediately. 

Alright. Now that's off my chest.",lonely,Why does no one ask to hang out with me? I always have to text first.,2019-03-03 06:51:54
935,Momoismaeliano,1551553433,5,"So we got married almost 5years ago. To make a long story short, she travelled to visit her mom last July, she was supposed to come back by November, but at some point she thought i was cheating on her, when i actually wasn't.. then she blocked me and disappeared, and about 10days ago she finally responded to my emails and started talking to me, i tried to explain that i didn't cheat but realized she can never believe anything i say, she then told me after a couple of days that she won't come back and blocked me again, and her reason ofc is that i'm cheating..
I'm so heartbroken and exhausted, my life is turning upside down, i'm starting to think maybe i should actually cheat or try to have a relationship with any random girl, maybe i'd be able to get over her, but also i'm afraid if i do that it won't work, or that there might be a slight chance she'd come back and if i tried to move on with someone else i know she'd never accept it
Btw. When we finally talked after 6months, she didn't sound like missing me and she wasn't affectionate at all, so!!!?

***What is*** u/80KtsV1 ***Looking for?***

I am looking for a funny. Talkative person from the United States. 

I don’t mind clingy people and honestly prefer it tbh

I really appreciate someone who values loyalty. And can stay long term :)

It would be nice to find someone also in college. Or finishing up high school to talk about the perils of school life.

Piercings and tattoos are a huge plus. Cause that shits cool!

Also, I love bad jokes. For instance: Did you hear about the Italian chef who died? He pasta-way. HILARIOUS. So if you got bad jokes I love you. 

And finally, biggest of all. A good communicator, because I have had some AWFUL experiences where the convo goes: Hey! hows it going today! ""Nice"" SO lets not do that haha. I just would appreciate someone who can ask questions and be engaging and outgoing like me! 



**And one more thing!** I am an open minded and race or age (or height) is not an Issue for me! (obviously)

(also I pretty much only use iMessage or regular text! So please be from the USA or Canada because texting is expensive!)

I’m a social person but only at school. I talk between 2 groups. One is a bunch of guys who never get out and essentially just talk about video games and the other is an inclusive fun kind of group. I’m trying to move away from the vg group and towards the fun group but it’s kind of hard. But when school stops that’s generally when my social life stops. 
Recently though I’ve been trying to be more social and get out with people but I’m just never invited to gatherings, no one tells me anything no group chats etc. 
at was only yesterday I tagged along with some friends (fun group) and headed to mates house where we had dinner, stayed the night and had a good time. At this gathering my best friend was there and so was my long time crush. This is where I start wanting to die.
So this girl I’ve liked for 2 years or so is IMO perfect. She’s pretty, funny, friendly etc. I’ve never really made a move to her and I don’t know why. Is it cause I’m anxious, or nervous that I would ruin what was there already or the fear I would get rejected or ridiculed idk. 

It was due to this. That my best friend who had known her for longer than I had started dating her out of nowhere. I felt like shit for ages. Then she moved away and they broke up. In this time I managed to ask a different girl to formal and even go on a date which ended in rejection.

Anyway it was a good time at the gathering and I was starting to build some confidence with her. She was laughing at my jokes, and was even a bit physical. Then my best friend started to get comfy with her always managing to sit with her before I did etc. 

When it got late a lot of people at the gathering decided to stay the night. And both of them decided to sleep together. Not sexual or anything just cuddling. But the really agonising part was That I was the only person there sleeping alone. Some people slept in threes even and there I was lying in the furthest part of the room in agony, losing sleep over just how angry and depressed I was. I got the kind of thoughts which just echoed in your mind like “no one will ever love you” and “you’re pathetic”.

Anyway I’m going to be seeing everyone soon again so I’m ready to endure another round of emotional torture as long as there’s drinks and mj.

960,zbpa,1551493386,1,"I don't expect this to be met with a lot of sympathy, as I'm sure many of you are in much worse situations. I've been struggling with social anxiety most of my life (I remember first realizing I had a problem when I was 10 or so). Luckily I've been really lucky in several situations and managed to make a couple of friends in my dorm in college and a couple an an old job, and just switched to a job where everyone is really friendly.

I used to have trouble talking to people at all, even in non-social situations (calling to order a pizza, going to a store I wasn't familiar with, etc). I also was really upset that I couldn't engage in some of my hobbies because of not having anyone to do them with (rock climbing, backpacking).

I've gotten a little better, and have been able to go climbing with people and hang out with coworkers after work and such.

My problem is that even with all that I still feel really lonely. I like being around people but outside of very structured situations like a planned trip or something I still don't really know how to interact with people. In some ways doing these things makes me feel worse because interacting with other people makes me realize how easy it is for other people to make friends, and how they mean so much more to me than I do to them. Like hanging out with my coworkers, it's nice at the time but they always mention parties they've been to or their significant others or whatever, stuff that I'm happier just pretending don't exist.

It feels like all of my interactions with people are so superficial. It's always talking about the subject at hand (climbing if on a climbing trip, for example). Part of the problem is that I don't really know what I want. I feel disconnected from people and upset but I don't know why being around people doesn't help.

Sometimes when I'm with my coworkers I'll feel a little bit close to them (commiserating about some work thing or something) but then they'll mention something about how they just had a birthday party or something, or I'll remember that I don't have their phone number and they seem total disinterested in me, and I remember that they aren't really my friends, they're only talking to me because I'm there.

966,taking-a-walk,1551485589,0,Since age 7 I’ve always been alone and maybe only had a few friends who rly didn’t relate to me. To this day I feel like I have to act differently just for people to tolerate me and it’s tiring. I just want someone who will love me unconditionally and for me to be a priority for them (&amp; vice Versa). Nobody rly relates to me tho. I had spoken with one girl for around a year and told her how I felt and took an almighty L when she stopped talking to me because her ex told her to which showed that I was definitely not a priority to her. I feel that I’m always gonna be stuck in this position to be honest and there’s not much I can do about it. ,lonely,It’s my fault tbh,2019-03-02 11:13:09

Now I’m in my early 30s and have seen my twenties vanish to the same grave as my teens. Never a significant other, still a virgin, no lasting friendships to speak of, stuck in a job I hate that doesn’t pay worth a shit with student debt up to my ears. I hate this life and I have tried very hard and worked with counselors, medication, exercise and joined meetups, tried dating apps (awful), but everything falls back to the baseline of always being alone. I guess at this point I’m just ranting but I’d love to hear how someone else has made their life better especially if it’s a different angle from what I’ve tried. I’d really like to be able to salvage what’s left and have those normal social experiences others take for granted before too much longer or write it all off and end it myself.

I had a few friends but unfortunately, 2 of them dumped me when we were around 14, because it wasn't cool to hang out with me. First few years of high school I was still very shy, but eventually I openes up and made a small group of friends and still had that one friend in my hometown. But college comes around and people start going seperate ways, so we started seeing each other less and less. In college I made some wonderful friends, people where I feel like I can really be myself, but unfortunately they all live at least a 1 hour ride away from me.

Sometimes it feels like I've been cursed, but mostly I'm fine with it since I'm focused on work anyway. But time to time oh how it hurts to feel that you're not someone worth even dating. And my sexuality doesn't help much either, since I'd rather be closeted then be publicly queer and face being secluded even more.
So I just had this where a person confessed me that they had crush on me. No one significant in my life (e.g a not friend, just a familiar face I see time to time, I guess that's how dreams work).

977,RedditZurah,1551462344,3," ...but it's still gonna be my life, if I keep going (which I don't really plan to cause of this and much more).

To start things off, I have Asperger combined with social anxiety, so just saying ""you will grow out of this"", or things like ""it will get better"" aren't really valid - it won't. It's a permanent condition, so don't even try to make me feel better, it only makes it worse.

I have 0 interests, 0 hobbies and nothing interesting about my personality in general. Why should someone even love someone who they would be extremely bored with ?  
I am socially not capable of even looking people in the eyes, talking for more than a few minutes doesn't really work out well and whenever I get hugged I don't hug back - or I could never hug someone on my own (or more, which would be happening in a relationship). How should a relationship work with someone that doesn't even show the slightest bit of affection or love, creating a relationship without talking to each other, without seeing each other, without doing things together, without spending time together - which couldn't really be considered *relationship* anyways..  
Lastly, I have severe trust issues, so whenever someone actually do speaks to me or makes any sort of friendly move towards me, I just don't believe them thinking they're doing it just because they feel obligated to do it, or just don't really mean the gesture anyways...

The thing is, my therapist, my psychiatrist, all of them also know that I'm gonna be alone forever, they just want me to learn to accept my life, which I don't want, I could never fully accept it (partly because the other dreams I have, or rather used to have, also won't happen for many reasons)

981,rubesboo,1551445209,0,"So long story short; I'm 31 weeks pregnant, I don't know who BD is, my sister is adopting the baby, my current boyfriend knows all of this and also happens to be going through some serious medical issues. I don't feel like I'm not getting the affection and intimacy I NEED during pregnancy, but I also feel like I can't complain to my boyfriend because he has his own stuff going on and he didn't sign up for this pregnancy in any way. 

Long story long....
My boyfriend and I have an on and off history and while we were broken up in the summer of 2018, I unknowingly got pregnant. He and I had contact and still occasionally hung out during this time, but we weren't together by any means. Fast forward to January 25th of this year; I get a snapchat from him telling me he's in the hospital and his legs don't work. I immediately think he's making a bad joke or something, come to find out he's very serious. So I go and see him in the hospital. Later that same day, a conversation with my sister leads me to take a pregnancy test and it comes back positive. I tell my boyfriend, we start getting excited thinking it could be his and sort of ""officially"" get back together. I find out it's not his, and he is understandably disappointed and a little hurt, but still supportive of whatever I want to do. A few more days go by and he decides if I keep the baby, he doesn't want to be with me, all of which I can totally 100% understand and empathize with. This is about the time my sister and her husband mention to me that they could potentially adopt, as they wanted to adopt another child anyway and this seemed like fate. Mind you, I'm NOT ready to be a parent in any capacity. So at this point in time boyfriend is still in the hospital (with what they had now diagnosed as transverse myelitis), I'm very pregnant, my sister is adopting, and everything seems like it's going to work out okay. 

Fast forward to last night...
Sister is still adopting and everything with the pregnancy is going normally and well. My boyfriend is home from the hospital, still wheelchair bound and has minimal use of his legs, but is expected to make a full recovery, just based on time and how hard he works at his physical therapy. He's a pretty reserved person, not incredibly affectionate, and when he is it's mostly sexual. Annoying to me, but whatever, I'm pretty used to it. But last night he starts talking about how he feels like he doesn't have the emotional capacity to love me the way I love him and how I deserve so much better, and he's always thought he was meant to be alone. Then he said he just needed to go and think and that he loves me. Now, I don't need to hear about how I'm wasting my time and how I deserve better or that he's literally TELLING me that I deserve better. Nobody is perfect and our relationship is not going to be perfect. We both have had traumatic childhoods, mothers are narcissists/sociopaths, we barely know our bio. dads, so both of us have some learned behaviors that we are both actively trying to break away from to be healthier people for ourselves and also for each other.
My main point is that especially because I'm pregnant and hormonal, I'm feeling particularly vulnerable right now and just want/need more of an emotional and intimate connection than I'm getting. BUT, I feel sort of guilty complaining about it because he is currently going through something fairly traumatic between losing his leg function, finding out his girlfriend is pregnant by someone else, and having to be pretty much housebound unless I come and get him and take him out (because I have experience with paralysis and home health care, fortunately). And all of this while already dealing with OBVIOUS depression and probable anxiety.

I guess I mostly just wanted to vent about this, because I know what I SHOULD be doing about it, what I WANT to do about it, and what I'm GOING to do about it.

988,Hakuna_Mar,1551431094,0,"Im 25, male and am currently as lonely as I never was. About 6 Months ago things spiralled downwards and for a few weeks/months. Im on Rockbottom. Dad Got sick 4 years ago, died 3 years ago, relation to other family members went from meh to bad/nothing. Had a bunch of friends and roommates. Moved out in bad terms. Girlfriend of 2 years left me. I completely isolated myself like never before in my life.      

Breakup is different than when Dad died. Both is losing a person you love.      

When someone dies the problem is that you can try as hard as you want. You won't be able to speak with them or reach them anyhow. After a breakup the person is just gone but still existing in this world. But handling it is similar. One has to be thankful for the past while looking forward.

I had phases before where I wouldn't meet with friends for some time or where I neglected attendance to events. Skipped school to not meet anyone. But never this long, this intense. If I look back I see it like reoccurring behaviour of mine. I worked out ways and mechanisms in the past to counter it, I really try to apply them but its hard to change old and establish new habits. Some times it works better than other times.

I think too early after my Dad died I met my now ex-girlfriend. I could focus a lot on making her happy instead of focus on my own improvement. I forgot myself in the relationship and was happy about it because I didn't want to think about what the fuck I actually have to do now where Dad is gone and Im just 22/23.        

In February I went to some self-help group. That was weird. But I think it actually was better being there than another lonely evening of web browsing. One time there already gave me some ""tools"" I try to work with. I want to go again this month.      

Earlier this week I failed my driving exam. One of the few things I tried in a long time. Afterwards the examiner said that at first he thought I was joking but then was afraid of his life. lol. Why the fuck do I pay driving teacher money when he doesn't actually teach me to drive and sends me to test like that.     

I think start of my process of becoming a man again instead of being a lonely, stoned slug is to take responsibility.       

I fucked up the exam. I will go back to learning and try again soon. Focus on the future.       

But one of the big problems I have is that there is just so much time to fill and nobody to share with. Does happiness even exist when there is nobody to share it with? Next week new semester begins and a few weeks ago I started to run and swim a bit again. Both lonely activity but its improvement. Improving everyday a little. What do I want this week, in the next 10 weeks, where do I see myself in 6 months?      



I will stop here. Sorry for wall of text, anyone actually reads this far? :D

So the very first video I'd ever seen from her channel I figured I'd watch it again since it''d been a while since I last watched it and I've fallen alseep to it before. It was a roleplay type of video. She does those a lot, she tends to do more of these roleplay/skit type videos rather than straight triggers which i think is cool because most triggers dont really work for me sometimes it's relaxing to just hear her play out whatever scene she's doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I had never really experienced the end of this video before either because I fell asleep, ended it early, or maybe even wasn't paying attention. The roleplay that she was doing was like you're like a survivor of some incident and you've been turned into a creature (a vampire or something similar). She found you and saved you. She takes you with her, starts helping you adjust and takes care of you as you get to know each other. Near the end of the video she starts talking about what people live for and who they live for and says ""Maybe you should reevaluate that"" and chuckles. My eyes closed at this point trying to like be calm and fall sleep. She then follows it up by saying we could be each others reason to live, pauses and then kisses you. She doesn't often do the whole caring/loving/flirting thing so this was a bit of a surprise for me...apparently enough so that my heart started racing. Not proud of it but....in my defense, this girl is amazing lol

And one of her more recent videos was very caring and loving. It was a very calming video so I actually started watching it a lot to help me sleep when she published it.

I can't take this anymore, everyone in my life seems to mind their own business. I tried to put my energy in my job and was quite satisfied, but now I had to take the rest of my vacation days from last year. 

My job was the only thing in my life that made me socialize with people and I would consider my colleagues my friends. I'm only 3 days in my holiday and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to spend the next week all on my own. 

I feel completely isolated. Why is it so hard to find people to hang out with nowadays, I was always kind and open hearted to the people I meet. I feel like I don't make a lasting impression on people. I feel like I'm just not worth to engage with. 

Everything about this holiday has been shit, I would just like to go back to work, I also considered to just do so, but you have to take your vacation days by law and my colleagues might think I'm crazy by spending my holiday in the office.

Probably the worst thing about all of this is that I have no one whom I could tell all of this, all my fears, all that's pulling me down in a never ending cycle of feeling depressed and undesirable.

997,93462,1551407191,1,"I know a lot of people and I have friends but I just can't help feeling lonely. It's like not belonging. I've been this way since I was 13 maybe. My friends usually ask me why I don't go out with them and I have the perfect excuse, I always tell them I was sleeping, they think I have a sleep disorder.

I'm used to it but sometimes I just want to vent.

Piece of advice to everyone who's lonely: Always try to look confident. It changes how everyone sees you and I promise you you'll never be always lonely.",lonely,Different kind of loneliness,2019-03-01 13:26:31
998,ctrldwrdns,1551406622,3,"I used to have a group of friends. I never had any growing up so this was a big deal for me. I even had a best friend! But our relationship was becoming codependent so I decided to distance myself from her, although we were going to be roommates I wanted boundaries and emotional distance. She was a part of my friend group, you could say the leader of the group sort of. We would hang out quite a lot and things were okay. But basically, she got jealous and annoyed that I had actually set boundaries with her. She began to invite the others to do things without inviting me. I learned this from their social media, which we all followed each other on, because they posted pictures. She said she was tired of my ""toxic negative energy"" basically she was tired of someone else getting attention and sympathy because she's not the only one with problems (this all happened last semester, I had mono and she couldn't stand someone else getting attention, even implied I was faking). I always listened to her talk about her problems but I couldn't talk about mine. She was definitely talking shit to other people about me, too. I tried to keep hanging out with them but I just kept getting left out and ignored. I also always had to text first with this group of people but I thought, whatever, at least I have friends right? But I stopped showing up at our usual hangout spot and I stopped texting them and even deactivated social media. I got no word from them. I actually don't blame the other friends for what happened, I think they were innocent bystanders and obviously being manipulated. But it's clear that my ex best friend was always the favorite and I was just kind of.... there. So I have no one to live with next year, no friends, and I'm hopeless.

I have CPTSD, possibly BPD so it's really hard for me to make a connection with anyone. I am very socially anxious. Please don't give me the old advice to ""put myself out there"" and join college clubs because I really have tried everything. It's clear that I'm just a repulsive person that no one really wants around. I just want words of encouragement and for someone to see things from my side.

so when today someone played a completely, obvious joke on me, it just wooooshed on me. 

I dont think I'm really that gullible but when someone acts towards me as if I were their friend, it had felt so alien because I had become so used to being alone. Like I could not even fathom someone being friendly towards me. 

It felt nice when I realized someone was being friendly towards me yet as I thought about it, it was kinda sad that I had forgotten this was a thing people do. 

It was an interesting experience I suppose. ",lonely,today someone told a joke...,2019-03-01 11:32:52

Not looking for people that will chat for one day and then ghost. I know we all have commitments but if you're not interested in trying to make real friends (even online ones) then don't waste either of our time. Sorry if it sounds harsh but I've been through this too many times and always come out the other side that little bit more lonely. Don't think I can take much more of that.

I have Kik, Google Hangouts, Discord, WhatsApp. Reddit isn't that great for chatting through.
