I was going to put my typical ad here to reach out to people. But I thought of maybe having a discussion and doing something off topic from an ad as this subreddit seems to be quite civil. People might strongly disagree, but I think that some people aren't lonely for lack of other people but they are lonely for the people that they want to be with. I remember on other sites people would say, ""wow I'm super lonely"", and I would think and respond ""Hey me too! We should be frens!"" and I was always crushed how those peeps would just not have any interest in me at all. I use to be that kid that others would confide in but they wouldn't let me confide in them, being some sort of outsider (looking at the posts here, I can relate).

18,Wyattkins193,1551323554,3,"I honestly cannot understand how people enjoy being alone for extended periods of time. I have felt isolated for the past 6 or 7 hours because I've spent the entire time in my room. the last hour i just spent lying on the floor listening to frank ocean and doing nothing else despite the fact that I have work that I should be doing, but I feel like I can't do it right now. my room feels like a prison to me and I just cannot leave.

i really wasn't going to type this on my main account because  there's a chance my friends, or more importantly a specific roommate to see this but at this point I am pushed to my limit and i just need to type. 

theres this one roommate i have that just bullies the rest of us, anything from just ""wanting to deflate our ego"" incase we get too many compliments to telling my trans man roomate that he's not looking too masculine when the rest of us are telling him. anyways, this roommate has gotten way into skyrim again and brought his ps3 down to the living room and plays it. I don't know anything that drives the rest of us out of the living room and into our respective rooms faster than him playing skyrim. He has been playing for actually 7 hours now and I still hear it on the tv as I type this out. he just makes awful commentary as if he is a let's player. 

I know a lot of this is our problem, seeing as we just don't want to spend time around him, especially when he's just playing some game, but it's just unbearable to be around him. Besides one of us, we are just so uncompatible personality wise with him. Conversation just doesn't happen. I've talked to my therapist about him and what he does and she told me that it would be best for all of us to sit down and talk with him but I am just such a coward who can NOT deal with confrontation, especially not right now. It would just be too much, and we all just resigned the lease for this year, so there's a whole lot that comes with that just incase something bad enough happens where epoeple have to leave. 

Either way, we all go to our rooms and essentially just go on our computers or phones. It's fine for maybe an hour but after that it's just unbearable to me. I cannot be on my computer for too long without thinking that i""m just wasting my time. So at that point i just clean my room, but there's only so much to clean. I took an extra shower tonight just because i had nothing. 

I tallked with my one of my roommates about how lonely I feel occasionally, because my therapist told me that it would be good for me. She told me that she understands, and that whenever I feel too lonely, I can just tell her and I can hang out in her room with her. However, because my brain is absolutely stupid and just plays tricks on me, I feel so anxious asking to hang out in someone elses room. Especially because I feel like they appreciate their alone time much more than I do. I simply just cannot tolerate any alone time besides when I wake up and get ready before I have to commute to campus. any more than that and I just start feeling miserable. honestly i feel like if I have to spend any time longer than taking a shit in my room (besides sleeping) then something went wrong. 

I think I'm too dependent on my roommates besides the one, and another one who mostly stays in her room but I respect her being independant. My other roomates and I were not super close before moving in, but only like half a month in, we became extremely close. I think maybe I became too close too fast and I always want to spend time with them or some other friends that I have. It just feels kind of pathetic to not be able to tolerate being alone for even tiny amounts of time, but now that I'm here after 7 hours of isolation it's just unbearable. I'm about to go to sleep like hours before I normally would just so I can wake up tomorrow and have tonight be over. 

I don't know what I am expecting to get from posting this. I don't even know what I want. It's a stupid situation and I just feel like I can't tell my roommates that I'm lonely because I feel it would be selfish. Or I just don't want to seem like a needy, attention grabbing bitch. I know this is just my brain playing tricks on me and they don't actually feel this way. but I just can't reach out to them. I know nothing is going to magically happen to make everything better but I feel like I can't even take the first step to make anything happen myself. I just don't even know what I want at this point except I know me and my roommates are ready to hire someone to steal this ps3 because my god.

And any amount of effort on my part just pushes them away even more, and I don‚Äôt want one sided friendships or bad friends in general who don‚Äôt initiate conversations, make no effort and just flat out ignore me.

Unfortunately this has been every friendship I‚Äôve had in the past 5 years, but it hasn‚Äôt been that many. 
So I cut them off, all the ones that never even bother saying hi, all the ones that don‚Äôt respond to messages, the ones that will disappear for 6 months, come back one day and act like a best friend, then disappear for another 6 months. 

I did not remove them, I just simply faded away, I don‚Äôt have Facebook or WhatsApp or anything like that anymore, as I just don‚Äôt see the point and in all honesty they won‚Äôt even notice. 

I decided to focus on myself 100% because the only person you can truly rely on is yourself. I stepped up, took self improvement classes, did voluntary work for charities, took part in an activity course, went back to college, secured a great job, made my confidence skyrocket, and dealt with some heavy shit, and this was all done by my own doing, having no support or anyone to truly talk to. 

Sure I met people, but that‚Äôs all it came to (friendly encounters and chats.)

It's sad to realize you will NEVER be able to have a teenage love again. You will NEVER have 15 years again and being in love, lying on the grass in a hot summer night looking at the stars and having a conversation with a girl with nothing to worry about. No worries about bills, jobs, rent, etc... Your only worries was how you was going to cheat in that history exam on monday. You will never be able to take away the virginity of a girl on puberty at the peak of her beauty and innocence and see her look you in the eyes and tell you ""I Love You"". You will never meet her after class and pretend you're both doing homework when in fact you will both be making love like two little bunnies in love. You fell to the good boy meme. You didn't learned how to deal with emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you're 20+ and have to get a job. You have to be a serious man now, a grown adult. All the good girls were taken. Maybe you will find a good girl and be with her, but she already felt all those emotions before and is tired now. She already had dozens of partners before.

39,NothingButDeadInside,1551281223,14,"Online, offline it's the same issue. I don't have any friends, hardly had any my entire life but I have become okay and accepting of it. I still feel the need for social interaction and I have tried. I noticed when I did try it seemed a lot of the people I came across are mainly into themselves so it repels me and there are pretty big personality clashes as well. It's just so odd to me, maybe it's cause I live not far from the city but everyone has this personality type I can't even think of a name for. I guess it's called being social?? .-. I don't know. Offline or online it seems difficult to find someone with substance.

Maybe I'm just too different? I never smoked, don't drink and never done drugs and I don't plan to but those things seem so commonly done by others so I feel like the odd one out. I know I can be interesting and have interesting conversations but it rarely happens. Even though I am into common hobbies like playing games and anime I do have other hobbies that can pretty interesting and not commonly heard of but it doesn't seem I'll actually get to show someone I'm interesting. x.x

I really try to keep conversations going but it's just so uninteresting and I try to keep it going in the hopes that maybe it's just that way because the convo is new and things will improve in time but in the back of my head is like ""Gahhhh, I can't do this."" and conversations never go anywhere. It's just hard to find someone that gives the same amount of effort or at least try to seem sorta interested so it doesn't seem redundant to keep going.

Trying to establish a decent relationship seems so unrewarding and I feel I'm starting to completely emotionally check out when it comes to being social and with people in general. No one actually tries to know anyone but themselves these days and the few times a relationship goes well it either ends or becomes unstable/toxic.

I am in a long distance relationship but the person I'm with went through a drastic negative personality change that I don't blame him for but the romantic feelings I had are gone but I keep it going because he needs me and no one else seems to want to help him  with his problems.

I do dream of the ideal relationship but I know it's a dream for a reason even though it's realistic. I just want a wholesome relationship that consists of tenderness and understanding and the person's appearance doesn't matter. Not really a romantic relationship because when I figure out how to solve my current relationship I'm most likely finished but still.... I think what I want is reasonable but I don't think I'm ever going to get what I want.

I guess this is more of a rant or something. Damn, I'm just really frustrated is all :c My ""standards"" aren't even high and even when I did lowered them it still backfired. I wish I didn't feel the need to socialize but I know all brains are programed with this need and it's unwelcomed.

I have a chronic illness and I expect everyone to leave me. I have a nice roommate who says he likes being my friend but I keep being a toxic person to prove that he shouldn‚Äôt have a friend like me he should get rid of me because I‚Äôm useless or mean. For example I kept him up until 4 am tonight talking about how he hurts my feelings how I‚Äôm a trash person or how I feel alone and sad and that the sun is setting on our relationship for a variety of reasons. I don‚Äôt want to be a toxic person in anyone‚Äôs life but it‚Äôs almost like proving that I‚Äôm unworthy of anything. He says our relationship is not in danger and that it won‚Äôt be hard to maintain it once we aren‚Äôt roommates anymore. That almost made me want to prove that our friendship will fall apart in one fell swoop. 

At the same time, almost every time we talk I feel lonelier because I am left out or invalidated. My mom says he‚Äôs my only friend, he‚Äôs my lifeline keeping me alive until graduation but I think sometimes if I lived alone I would be happier. I see my both my roommates constantly do things that I physically cannot, and that‚Äôs really hard and painful. 

Sometimes I snap at him, and regret it. For example he never invites me to musicals but he goes all the time, I start being mean and saying how I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would go see Wicked twice or that DEH sounded hokey like tween music. I didn‚Äôt mean these things, they came from a place of hurt. Finally I admitted that to myself and him tonight and yet it didn‚Äôt feel better. I still feel like shit and I don‚Äôt think we should be friends. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy for me. I honestly think my mom was wrong, I would be happier if I lived alone. I currently have no doors so if my roommate is laughing and having a good time with our third roommate who is actively mean to me I can‚Äôt escape it. Some days I just sleep and sleep to avoid facing him. 

There are a lot of issues facing our friendship but if you had one friend who was generally nice but every time you spoke to them they made you feel sad on accident would you break up with them.

I decided to join chat rooms to make a few friends and chat with others. That's what I love doing but today that was taken away from me and I feel lonely.


I have been banned from so many chat rooms because of the awful things I've done like using profanity and  spamming  and the last chat room I got banned from wasn't for that bad.


I work at that chat and was kicked for 72 hours for ""harassing users and staff"" but I was just calling out the people in the girls room who took part in a sexual roleplay/orgy,  even the moderators and admin took part, I'm so digusted by them and I told them that they need to stop and rethink their acts because what they are doing was wrong.  Keep in mind that they are minors and I don't think that is legal.

But when you go big and go home what you got to say
I fell hard but make no mistake 
the only pain I ever felt was when she went away
And at the end of the day 
she still makes me feel some way 
and I dont know what to say
I wish I could change her mind really tell her how I feel
But she ain't happy anymore and that's just how she feels 
So I don't know what I'm supposed to do 
I tried to make her happy but I just made her blue
Yeah I realy blew it with her and now I'm all alone 
I don't know how to feel 
And I don't know where to go
But the pain is holding on and that shit won't let go
No she aint ever coming back this I already know.
Inside I'm screaming someone please help me but nothing can ever truly help.
I'm lost on the ocean suspended in doubt 
A bunch of false notions like she's coming back
it was all one big mistake
That lie takes the cake
I torture myself with all this false hope
Sinking in these waters still just trying to float
So what else is there to say 
except maybe next time I'll keep my head up and learn from my mistakes
And now all that's left is pain and heartbreak 
all the times I let her down
Got me feeling helpless 
Feeling like a clown
Yeah big top no more messing around 
I always had a job to do, to never make her frown
but it almost always went south and got her feeling down 
now I'm just a clown with tear drops falling down..
So don't you give up and lose your self
Walking straight through hell 
till you hear the ring 
Yeah saved by the bell
No more late nights and no more maybe next time's
She's the one in your heart and the one on your mind
Cause she doesn't quit on you when you fall down 
even when you're that clown she always hangs around 
so don't you ever let her down
Cause I promise there are a million guys who can and will give her that crown 
if you ever fool around
So what's left to say when your world falls apart
When she leaves you, taking with her your heart.
So don't be a fool 
Stop it before it starts
Don't do what I did and let it all fade away
Keep your lover happy that's what I've got to say.

I don't understand why everything has to be romantic. Cuddling with a girl is seen as romantic and I hate that. A lot of people want a girl to be in a romantic relationship with, but I just want a close platonic friendship. If I were to ask a girl to cuddle and snuggle with me, then chances are she'd think I'm trying to fuck her. I wouldn't blame her. Society has so much focus and expectations for romance. 

The focus on romance in our society is something we'd be far better without. Everyone has to be in a relationship. Those who aren't are expected to be trying to get into one. To cuddle with someone it either has to be in a romantic or familial way. If a guy and a girl cuddle, it's generally seen as romantic, and it'd be presumed they're in a relationship. Why can't people do things like cuddling, snuggling or even kissing without being in a relationship?

69,reyeszeno,1551203735,21,"30M. Please bear with me as i dont know where else i can pour my heart out completely. 

Been single for the better part of 4 years. The last relationship was the best i had (even though there were ups and downs). I screwed it up by being too close with a female friend whom i've known for more than a decade. We started calling each other 'dear'. But there was nothing else going on. No other feelings whatsoever. My ex found out and left me for good. I deserved it. And i'm still living with that consequence of my foolishness.

Most of the times since, i felt that maybe i have screwed up my one chance of finding my partner. Like God is telling me that ""i gave you one shot at the best and you messed up. Now there isnt anymore for you."" That's the feeling i've gotten since then. I've tried to ask girls out but to no avail. Either them blowing me off at the last minute or just didnt show any interest. It gets tiring.

Recently 3 of my best friends got attached and that just leaves me being the only one single. I'm really happy for them but personally, it sucks for me. It's like seeing everyone else finding love and yet i'm not even close to it really hurts. I dont even know if i'll ever find someone because maybe not all of us are meant for someone. I truly hope not.

This has been a life lesson nonetheless. It definitely made me know not to do anything stupid no matter how trivial. I just need some redemption and for someone to see that i still have so much love to offer.

I would say that I'm great at socialising and people around me are usually willing to be around me, yet I can't seem to get myself interested in most people in my daily life.

I know beggars shouldn't be choosers, but I tend to not be able to stand small talk and such unless I have no choice. I find meaningful discussions to be much more enticing. So if you're into deep/intelligent conversations or having some casual discourse, then feel free to hit me up.

Maybe it is, but not because of our personality, but because we choose or attract toxic people. If you are a good and caring person there will always be someone there ready to exploit it, use you and get on with their lives, leaving you to wander what you did wrong. I felt it on my own skin. Every friend i ever had used me to feel better about themselves, made me care about and help them, and giving nothing in return. So they just take all our kindness and will to help someone and leave.

79,HelenofJoy5,1551183959,2,"Hey everyone, I wanted to jump on this lonely train as i can relate to so many posts here it's scary. My story is not much different than all of yours but here goes. I always had a lot of friends growing up but never felt like i truly belonged with them. I was always the outcast and the one that would get teased because I cried. When I started only hanging out with boys(i'm a girl btw) I felt so much better, I was a tomboy myself so it made sense. Growing up we drifted apart and stopped spending any time together, now we are nothing more than strangers. I always felt best only having one best friend at a time, I never liked big crowds or hanging out with more than two or three people, as i always felt stupid and less worthy. During the years every one of my 'best' friends found some reason we should stop being friends. One was mad at me because of something stupid i said, but in reality she was jealous because i was good friends with a guy she liked. So she just stopped talking to me altogether. The second was so possessive and was insanely jealous that i spent time with my boyfriend instead of her, and the third one got mad at me for some money i borrowed from her,she said pay me back whenever you can it's fine, she knew my situation, but as time went by she grew colder, only to tell me that she doesn't care anymore about me, and it's not about the money it's my behavior. I behaved as i always did with her, she just wouldn't confess that the money was the problem. I never had any problem just cutting people of my life, because all of them turned out to be toxic and took more from me than they gave. If i had a problem it was no big deal, but their problems were the worst and if i wasn't there for them they would be mad. So i'm not sorry this happened, I just feel like i'm incompatible with people. i feel much better being on my own than having to go through all that drama again. But then again, i miss being so close to someone. I hate feeling like an outcast all the time while other girls go out with their 'besties' and do all the girly stuff.

85,JARPCG,1551164478,4,"My loneliness is honestly my own fault. I could very well go out and try to get a girlfriend, but I don't. I keep saying, ""I'm busy; there's no sense entering a relationship with someone that will barely get to see me,"" or ""They're clearly not interested in me anyway, so I should avoid the embarrassment."" That kind of stuff has been plaguing me since freshman year of highschool. As far as I can tell, I've got two main problems:
**(Don't worry, there's a TL;DR down there)**

The first is that I tend to think down on myself. Friends of mine have told others, and even told me to my face, that I'm one of the kindest people they know. I'm constantly told I'm considerate, optimistic, and a great friend. Despite these compliments though, I only seem to see my flaws. I see all the times I've let people down, all the promises I've broken, all the things I could have done and didn't, all the things I've done in secret that I shouldn't, and I wonder if I'd still be getting those compliments if they only knew me in complete privacy.

The second is that I want so badly to avoid heartbreak that I'm scared to enter any romantic relationship at all. The thought of someone breaking up with me doesn't scare me as much as the thought of having to break up with someone. On the off chance that I eventually enter a relationship with someone I don't end up liking in that way, I may never actually break it off for feat that they would be hurt. I know that the right thing to do would be to be honest with them and let them find someone who does return their feelings, but I'm honestly not sure if I could do that.

TL;DR

I doubt my self worth and have a constant fear of being heartbroken/breaking others' hearts and that causes me to isolate myself.


I'm not really looking for advice, although I'll gladly accept some; I mainly just needed to vent. I didn't want to put all this on my friends and family, but I REALLY needed to get this out of my system. Like I said earlier, this has kinda been building since freshman year of high school.

It's mostly my fault, but I'm a complete train wreck emotionally. I would cry every week if I remembered how to.

I'm a good conversationalist. Most of those I'm surrounded with get along with me. But I feel cooped, up, alone, and gross nearly all of the time?

I go to an all-girl's school with a great education that I am incredibly grateful for. However, the student population is very, very small. There are very, very few people I don't feel tense around. The environment is competitive, and I've definitely started hinging my self-worth on grades, and the place makes me feel unworthy and miserable. I've been trying to branch out for two years, with limited luck. Every connection I've made is half-formed at best, and even so, I'm not allowed out on weekends anymore- all I'm allowed to do is work, and I feel sick and lonely and miserable.  I need to just finish high school and get out, quickly as possible. 

However- recently met some people from a different school that I really clicked with, the first time in many years. I felt so warm, so welcomed, so wanted, that I nearly cried when I got home. I've just found out today that it isn't going to work. I won't go into it, but by pursuing this friendship/potential romance, some people could really get hurt. There's a timebomb on this thing, and I feel sick. I was so close, just for it to be pulled away, because I really don't want to be an asshole.

I've lived in several different places in my lifetime, and I usually don't have an issue making friends eventually. But this time, it's different. I'm in my early 30's now. I don't have many interests or hobbies besides video games and making music on my computer. I figured that once I moved here, I would make friends at work and be able to monkey branch those friendships into some kind of social life. But the problem is that they are all native marylander's. They all have friends, wives, kids etc... So when the end of the work day comes, they all go home to their own personal lives. One of the guys I worked with asked me what I had planned for the weekend once, I told him that I literally had nothing going on. He was like ""dang, can't believe you're not doing anything man. That sucks."", then he fucked off and went about his way. I've received the same kind of treatment throughout my life honestly.

TL;DR My (what felt like) best friend is drifting away from me, and my other friends don't talk to me unless we see each other in person

I met my best friend back in September, and we slowly became close buddies. We always watched videos together and played random games that always had me out of breath from laughing. She also had another close friend (definately closer than I could be) who she talked to often, but I didn't care because why would I? Hes just another friend of hers, and she seemed to enjoy his company as much as mine. I even talked to him and he seemed like a good person. Then, she told me she got together with a mutual friend of ours in December. No big deal, she just had an SO and I was happy for her. Then I started noticing that she would start giving excuses not to hang out more often, and our chats became less frequent and shorter. She'd always be sleeping for long periods of time at random times of the day, busy doing homework, or busy watching anime with her other best bud. The past month was an eye opener, because I noticed it felt just like how we were when we first met: Awkward, small talk about things we barely had in common. I think its because of me always having trouble dealing with social interactions, and she eventually got annoyed of our daily conversations.

Then, theres my other friends I hang out with.

At the beginning of this school year (August 2018), my friend Lemon introduced me to 3 of her friends she hangs out with all the time. I wasn't the closest of friends to Suhaymah, but I wasn't opposed to becoming closer with her and her friends either. Toast, Apple, and Butter were different from the people I usually talk to on a day-to-day basis. It was like a new fresh breath of air to me, and I enjoyed it. In October, Jennifer stopped coming to talk to us because she wanted to focus on her studies. Then, on New Years Eve, Toast confessed her feelings for me and avoided all contact with me in school for a month since I rejected her. Now, neither Lemon nor Butter want to talk much since I was the source of their friend's problems. I was seen as the bad guy, but they didn't want to say it to my face. Even the usual guys that I talk to have started talking less and less to me for reasons I wish I knew.

If I'm lucky, the peak of my daily social life will be saying good morning and good night to my best friend. The most I can dream of is going back to when we would watch dramas at 2 AM and have chats that would last for hours on end.

""But why can't you say this to their faces and talk it out?""

First, I'm scared of confrontation. I'd rather chug a gallon of milk before doing anything close to that. Second, I'm afraid my friends won't see and talk to me the same way. I want them to feel at ease and carefree when they're talking to me, because who cares about my problems anyways?

In conclusion: I'm a bafoon that nobody wants to be with.

My life ended ever since the person I look up to posted screenshots of my private messages to her on her public Twitter behind my back and now the trolls/haters that follow me around keep threatening to link to her screenshots of me and I got banned from my favorite Discords because of it.

My kids are all grown up and they're all on their own now with their own families. They never visit. My best friend is my 20yr old daughter in law. How messed up is that?

My wife is always depressed and that's not helping me any. She stays in her own little world reading books all day. (I should say reading all night because she sleeps all day) So we don't have the same type of relationship we used to have. thanks so much for

I'm a musician, but I haven't played the piano or guitar in almost 10 years because my wife decided there wasn't enough room in our house for my gear. All my music instruments are packed away collecting dust in the back of my basement, underneath piles of junk that my wife refuses to get rid of. I'm sure that if I had access to my instruments, I would have an outlet for my sadness.

As per the health conditions from which I'm suffering, I try to get better, go to doctors, etc, but every time I take one step forward, I get shoved back 10 steps by the universe. 

I'm really at the end of my rope here. I have no hope for the future. I mean, I'd never consider suicide, but I really don't care anymore if I live or die.

I got help, changed my life, started to enjoy every experience life had to offer for the shear joy of life.  I finally lived!  I'm in a relationship now, 6 years in.

I only need someone to talk to, someone to listen with compassion and everytime I open up to him, I feel like I have to apologize for it.  Idk what to do, how to talk to him.  Or do I just leave?

153,TurboSpat,1550989843,2,"Virtually everything else in my life is fine. I'm physically healthy, my parents love me. My friends love me. But the love I need isn't what I have right now.

I thought I was going to marry that girl, and she left me as soon as she had an upgrade lined up. As soon as we started getting rocky and she didn't want to fix her issues, the ones she's said has ruined past relationships. Being someone's second choice after almost two years, fucking hell it's been 4 months and it still hurts. It feels like the air got pulled out of me when she left, and I haven't been able to inhale quite like that since. We had our whole lives planned out, and she pissed that away. I should be thankful that she showed her colors before we got any further in our relationship, but I can't help but still feel that deep betrayal.

I tried dating again recently. I ended up having a one night stand and it just wasn't for me. After all the shit she put me through, even though I know she's no longer the girl I fell in love with, I miss the old her terribly. The one whose cheeks would explode with laughter when I'd poke fun at her, who I had dozens of inside jokes with. The girl I had confided literally every part of my past and my life with. The one who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I don't think I ever want to open up like that again. She was the one who told me she was terrified of me leaving her, yet she was the one who ran away as soon as her insecurities got a hold of her. Ran away to the next guy within a couple weeks. And led me to believe we still could have made it work.

I still have videos of us I can't bring myself to get rid of. Hearing her now foreign voice telling me she loved me more than anything, it just stings. Because then I have her voice fresh in my mind of the other things she said about me. That ""It feels like my life has gone unchanged by our breakup, and I think that's a sign."" It feels like lies, yet I can't bring myself to get rid of them. I accept it's done. But I don't want anybody else either. Not for a lack of trying. I've put myself out there and it just doesn't yield any results. I haven't met anyone remotely interesting to me. I don't compare any new girl to my ex, but I have these unreasonable expectations now from what I felt was a perfect relationship, and it worries me that at my age right now (University) I'm not going to find anyone to fit those criteria. Not until I get older I suppose.

156,JohnieScofflaw,1550980130,3,"It's sort of pathetic how much I appreciated that. I know you were just being friendly because I was  the last customer before you're off  for your Saturday night, but I was feeling low and those affectionate words made my night.

I was out running errands for the woman I live with, who I love for some reason but whose feelings will never match mine -- as much as I value her companionship, and as much as she values mine. It's been a year and I don't really know what I am to her. As undefined as it is, it's the closest thing I've ever had to a romantic relationship. 

She knows how I feel about her, and while she hasn't returned the sentiment, she wants me to move to another city with her next year. It's a big step, but she knows I want to be wherever she is, as much as I love my home city, and as much as her home city creeps me out.

I was feeling a bit unappreciated even though I know she does appreciate me, to be clear, just how I felt in the moment. 

All it took was a bright smile and a few kind words from a pretty stranger to set me right. 

I've found that as I've gotten older, woman are often kinder to me than they need to be. I don't know what to attribute that too, maybe my weight loss? I still have a long way to go, but I'm no longer the fattest guy in every single room I enter and that's kind of nice.

I spent my 20s alone, keeping my own company, high all time and in bed all day, just waiting to die. I'm 31 now and in the last year I've made a lot of progress. Lost over 100lbs, got a job, found a woman to share my life, if not my heart, with.

I can't say I'm unhappy these days, certainly not like I used to be, but I do still get lonely, which is why I come here.

The woman I live with, my best friend and soulmate, tells me I'm the kind of man who will always want more and I think she's probably right. As thankful as I am for what we have, I spend a lot of time thinking about other women and what I could have. I haven't even told her about the new girl at work I hit it off with.

I was even intimate with another woman not so long ago, I told her it happened once but it was more than that. And it'll probably happen again. I haven't lied to her about it (unless you count omission, and I don't), and we're not officially together so it's not really cheating, as conflicted as I feel about the experience. I know I would be devastated if she were intimate with another man, and that's not fair but it's how I would feel.

Sometimes I miss my lonesome uncomplicated life - alone in my room all day, living only to please myself. Then I remember how deeply sad and borderline suicidal I used to be. I'm thankful for what I have right now, although she's right, I probably will always want more, whatever's just out of reach.",lonely,Thank you to the cashier who called be 'doll' and 'darling' tonight.,2019-02-24 14:48:50

As soon as the dance started, more and more of my pals started branching off and having fun. Im not mad at them, but it just feels like I‚Äôm not important enough to stay around. I‚Äôm currently writing this in one of the schools bathroom stalls, since I was just about having a small little mental breakdown. Everybody else seems to be having a lot of fun, but all I‚Äôm feeling is lonely. I came with my two best friends, and they already found dance partners. I was going to ask someone to dance, but I couldn‚Äôt make the courage to ask, and when I was about to, she was already walking away. What does everyone else have that I don‚Äôt?

Now, I‚Äôm usually not that sad of a guy. I know I have friends, and I have a group that I hang out with regularly. I like to think that I‚Äôm not that antisocial, but lately I‚Äôve been having some doubts, and tonight may have answered that question for me. I don‚Äôt care if I have a girlfriend or not (not right this second, at least) but I still somehow feel like I‚Äôm never going to find someone. 

Another thing that my friends do is talk to people over Snapchat. I mean, it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt do it either, I talk to some people over snap a lot, but they do it religiously, and then rub it in my face that I don‚Äôt talk to as many girls as they do.

I‚Äôve been telling myself that I am who I am, and I like who I am, but I‚Äôm lying to myself.
I don‚Äôt like the person I am now. I want to change, but for some reason it‚Äôs hard. I just can‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm not a super mopey person either. I don‚Äôt really act sad when I am actually sad. I don‚Äôt try to hard to hide it, because I want people to ask how I am. And I really want to tell someone all my problems and just vent it all out, but I know that won‚Äôt really help me change as a person.

I‚Äôm a shell of a person right now. My friends had been sticking with me for no reason. They‚Äôre more social, more talented, better looking than me, I just don‚Äôt understand. 

And don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm suicidal. I want to live long enough to better myself, and look in the mirror and see myself and smile. I want to make it.

161,PleasantLeave,1550974506,6,"I was in the psychiatric hospital recently, and there was this girl that I was attracted to for reasons that confuse me. She wasn't that physically attractive, at least not at first, but I found that after listening to some of her problems I could relate very well, and ended up liking her. She attempted to commit suicide by overdosing, while I was there for much less serious reasons (I told my brother about some research I'd been doing). She wasn't very charismatic, she mostly just sat alone, and she loved to self-deprecate. She's gay so there was no point in trying anything (not like I would either way because I'm a pussy), she wasn't the only one however. My ex-girlfriend used to self-harm too, and she went really fucking deep, we were together because we were going through the exact same thing at the exact same time, eventually though she ended up getting worse so we had no choice but to break things off, I have no idea where she is now.

Is it wrong to be attracted to someone who's mentally ill because they're mentally ill? People love to say that girls only like guys who have their shit together, but speaking from personal experience that's not true, I think that's only applicable to people who actually live stable lives, so I'm thinking the reverse logic could apply too.

Uni gave me more hope but nothing worked out. I'm still lonely as fuck. It makes me feel so empty. 

It just feels like I missed out on so much fun stuff like parties or just hanging out. It also makes me really insecure. When I'm talking to people or when I'm with a group of people I dont know what to say or how to act. Because I just never experienced it. I really wanna meet new people and talk to people. The only problem is I dont know how.

I have a boyfriend and he is like the only person I see. He has friends and when he does things with them it just makes me sad as shit. I don't wanna hurt him at all, but it's so difficult to listen to something you never experienced. I just shut down and I dont know how to react. 

I also have a lot of issues with myself and my family and together it just puts me in a darker place. It feels like I will never make friends. Like they just don't like me as a person. And it hurts so bad.

It just feels like everyone is better of without me and I will be lonely forever.

Everytime I try to change, and make myself feel better, it's always fleeting. How many times have I said I was going to change, start going to the gym, start eating better, start putting myself out there, just to end up right back where I started. Tired. Lonely.

I don't know what happens, everything is going good I'm feeling better then out of left field I'm invaded with tiredness. I don't want to rely on others but I can't pull through this alone. I have to be strong for my son, I have to be there for him. I know that. How do I find someone that would be interested in me? I don't drink, I don't go to clubs, or bars, i don't attend parties, not that I would be invited to one.

My day to day life mainly consists of going to work, or spending the day with my son. We hang out, go to the park, the mall, etc. But it's just us. On our own. I don't want to be a bad parent, so I'm not going to try and pick a girl up with him present. That to me is not really an option. If he is with his mom, I don't really know what to do. I hate doing stuff alone and I don't really have any friends. I was with my ex wife for 7 years, it was just me and her, we didn't really have any friends, and the ones I did have, i have lost touch with mainly because of her. I don't know, I'm just tired of not knowing what to do. 

Where do I meet women that would be interested in me? I don't really fit in with people where I live. Most of the people here are into fishing, hunting, and riding 4 wheelers. That's not me. I like playing board games, video games, reading books, watching movies, listening to music. I don't like dogs.

I'm sure you know the self-deprecating feeling too. I think it's a bit like a drug. Once you start feeling it, you do things that cause you to feel more of it. Even though it makes you feel like shit, you seek out things that put more of it back in your system.

What works for me is just letting it all go. I spent so much of my life looking for happiness and fulfillment from other people. But thats not where its at at all. Its all within you.We are born intot his world with everything we need to be happy. That if you never had another person in your life that got you. That truly understood you. You can STILLl find joy, you can still find hope and balance.  Just never stop trying, never stop striving for what you want. Dont stop growing and dont listen to anybody that tells you youre not good enough, including yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Theres no way to get away from pain in this life. Loneliness is one of the most painful things ive ever lived through and ive lived with it daily for quite a few decades. But life keeps moving and now im starting to again too. Im not looking for anything from other people. Im looking for what i can do myself to find joy in every moment. Meaning in every movement and thought. Lifes really short and before you know it youre getting older and you blink and even thats gone.

 Dont waste even a moment letting loneliness lie to you. Theres hope and a lot of fun to be had and a lot of good times ahead. But if you listen to loneliness youll miss a lot of those. In my case i missed a lifetime of opportunities. Thats nobodys fault but my own because i listened to the liar.

&amp;#x200B;

Im starting therapy this tuesday and im going to get better and break free from my cage of shadows ive lived in so long. Nobody else can see it but its a lifetime sentence ive been living. But im giving myself early release and gonna get back to living my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to tell you that even if nobody else in the world cares. I do. I dont know you, dont need to. Youre a human being and you deserve love and kindness. Please remember not just me, but you can do that for yourself. Give yourself a pat on the back that you keep trying despite how damn hard it is. I salute you that you keep going. Keep pushing. Youll get there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dont believe loneliness when it tells you its hopeless. Its a damn liar. A charlatan and a fraud. You have a lot to offer and you deserve to be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck to you and seriously have a good day today. Do something kind for yourself, something fun you enjoy. Laugh at something, poke fun at it, stop taking everything so seriously. Especially yourself.  Remember how to smile. All that part of you is still there. Just loneliness told you somebody stole it away. Its not true.

9 months ago I met a girl in class (I was a junior in high school) in a class who I thought was beautiful and we slowly became friends over the course of a couple months and I liked her the entire time and eventually worked up the courage to tell her how I felt and I got the usual sorry but I just like you as a friend shpeal and I was already a druggie at that point and that just intensified it, I was dropping acid and drinking in broad daylight at school hoping to get in trouble and I did, I got caught with some vodka in class and only got some in school suspension and we didn‚Äôt talk much after that.

Over the summer I was super depressed and got arrested in late July DUI even though I wasn‚Äôt driving the car but luckily I didn‚Äôt get charged and I decided to get my act cleaned up and started to get ready for my senior year which went totally normal for me, a few people I talk to while everybody likes me as a ‚Äúschool friend‚Äù where they just talk to me at school and never outside of it. But sometime in October I got a snap from the girl from the previous year just saying hey and I responded and we had a streak going for a while and stuff like that nothing serious, when a couple of days ago I decided to just say hey to her on snap after not talking for a few days which she responded to near instantly. We kept talking for the next few hours and it got personal and eventually she just asked if I wanted to fuck which totally caught me off guard and my heart skipped a beat. We didn‚Äôt fuck unfortunately but we talked more and she asked me to take her out to eat yesterday and I‚Äôm gonna do the same today and I am still in shock of how this has turned out.

Some set-up: I work with a non-profit that has a small group (about 10 of us) working in our office and another group (about 15) working at other locations Monday-Thursday. We all share the office on Fridays. Most of us have teams we belong to, where we share the same job functions and responsibiities. 

I am a part of the group of 10 that practically lives at the office and, unfortunately, I'm only halfway a part of a team; my role differs from the rest of the team's roles and, ultimately, I'm left out of a lot of meetings/get-togethers/chats. It doesn't feel great. My work role seems lonely by nature.

Regarding the rest of the office...

They care about the latest trashy TV episode, celebrity drama, pop music, and drinking/partying. I don't watch much TV (neither do I own Netflix/Hulu/any other streaming service), care about celebrities, listen to pop music, or drink/party. I feel alienated regarding shared interests, and I really don't feel like forcing myself to partake in their interests just to be able to have something to talk about.

I forgot to mention that most people at the office live in the area. I commute about an hour and a half each way every day. Any after work get-togethers are out of my realm; I'm not ready to get home at 3 a.m., since most nights out are house parties or at bars.

I guess I just wanted to vent and put this all out there somewhere. Even now as I'm typing this, I'm sitting alone at lunch while the rest of the office is in another room talking about the Kardashians.

So, i have never had good relationship with my classmates, but in the last period it just became unbearable.

All of them, and i mean EVERY SINGLE ONE, hates the fact that i'm a very good student. Every time i raise my hand to answer a question i hear them saying under their breath stuff like ""get a life"" or ""kill yourself"". Even people that i've known for 10+ years tell me that they hate me in class. Those people are the one that are supposed to be my best friends.

They hate me because im kind of the only one interested in school in my class and teachers always compare me with the other underlying the fact that they don't show nearly as much interest as me, and this increases their hate towards me.

I'd love to talk about politics or literature with someone, but the only topics my classmates chat about are football, local gossip or dumb italian music.

As this wasn't enough, 2 months ago i discovered that one of the girls in my class, whom i liked for 5 years, likes me back. We started dating, but from the beginning i got treated like utter shit. I think that the other girls in my class and her friends kinda changed her mind about me, picturing me as loser, and she totally changed her behavior. She also was a particular kind of person, very serious and, as i later discovered, anaffective. She never kissed me or even hugged me. And in the last period we were seeing eachother she was just trying her best to make me leave her. She wanted me to leave her so she would feel less guilty for how she behaved. That hurted like hell, still does.

The problem now is that i have to see her everyday and i find it very diccult to move one. My friends, even after i explained them how she treated me, still talks to her and act like nothing happened. They now spend much more time with her than before. This makes me feel so alone. 

I have no one to be with in class with (6 hours a day + extra activities) and i have to hear them laughing together everyday. That just hurt so much.

I only have 1 real friend, but i don't see him enough to feel better. And i have no idea how to make new friends. I live in a really small city (50k people) and there aren't many activities for people my age with my interests.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before i start this like i say i am NOT looking for advice. I know im the only one that can fix this but i just feel very overwhelmed atm and have for a really long time (many years).**

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody else deal with long term chronic loneliness and isolation? Im 43 and ive been isolated due to an anxiety disorder for the past id say 20 years. thats longer than a lot of people on reddit have been alive i realize so its not something you can relate to. But think of it in terms of your entire life. Imagine never having a friend, never having anybody call/text etc to even say hey you still alive? Im married but outside of the house i have nobody at all. I try to find penpals and people to play online video games with etc. But thats always temporary. People come and go like the wind. My life feels like a revolving door. 

Over time you start to think whats the point? Its just one big failed experiment after another. It doesnt feel like even talking to people sometimes. I feel like im talking to a computer AI and its just having fun with me. some long never ending practical joke.

Ive just been alone so long like this and unable to connect to people that it feels so exhausting even the idea of talking to people online anymore.People all dissapear, turn out to be crazy, dont give a shit or are so high maintenance its not worth it.  Then my anxiety issues are so bad in person i cant seem to find people that way either. 

I did call and schedule a therapy appointment to start seeing somebody this coming  Tuesday but who knows if it will help. Ive been in and out of therapy my entire life and nothings really helped so far. Im not without hope but working on something for 20 and 30 years with very little to show for it can wear you down. Im a strong person but not invincible. 

Also the fact im a really sensitive person doesnt help either. I read into things a lot of times and over think due to the anxiety. Then the chronic cycle of loneliness causes things to become distorted too so i cant even read people correctly. 

I watched  an interview of this famous writer director the other day. He was saying he felt so out of touch and alienated. The interviewer mentioned how all his movies now were in the past etc. He admitted he felt more comfortable there instead of our ""grim"" present. It was a nice escape.How he avoids new technology and still writes on his old typewriter because thats what hes used to.What feels ""normal"" for him.  I kinda feel like that too. The being unable to connect to the world now. I feel seperate and  out of synch. Out of touch. I have to look up just about everything people are talking about  Because i dont even know who half the famous people or acronyms or sayings or memes oe etc etc are anymore. Part of it is getting older and its normal but part of it is just this isolation.  

Because of this i have just grown to kind of hate and despise society now a days.  I really dont want to. Im a loving, kind caring, open heart and open minded person. I care about people deeply. In todays world though thats almost viewed as some kind of weakness. To me, people just dont seem like people anymore. I start to kind of dissassociate i guess you call it where people just seem like bags of meat walking around. No soul no heart. Just automatons on repeat. Clones of the next clone of the next clone. I really hate that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to find a new normal that doesnt involve sitting in a room everyday waiting to die. Im not even really depressed. Just this constant loneliness is a lot to carry around all the time. Its heavy this vicious cycle. The darkness is kinda blinding. Spiritual fog it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to write poetry sometimes to get bad feelings out. Cant do that anymore the words dont really come because it feels pointless. I used to at least play video games online and i met a group of friends that way and we gamed together for many years. Now i dont see them. Havent had a real life friend besides my wife probably since a little after highschool. I really hope this therapy helps because im at the end of my rope. IVe been in and out of therapy for years nothings really helped.  Im tired of pretending things will get better and trying and trying and nothing really changing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like i say im not depressed but it does get very lonely feeling like I dont even exist anymore.

From the outside my life might look great. I have great friends and I have a job that I like. But everything just feels out of place. I have a crohnic condition that affects my mental health and also the medication for the condition affects my mental health more.

And here is where I think the pinnacle of it all is... There's this girl. Absolutely brilliant, great looking and has a great personality, a person anyone would like to be with. And then there's me... Someone with a crohnic condition and mental health problems, not to mention bad looks, that make it difficult for anyone to love me or even like me. I'm sure she doesn't even think about me. Why would anyone with a life like her want to be with a person like me? In what world would this ever happen?

I'm trying to tell myself that I never have a chance with her, and I should just get over it. And I can't tell her I like her because that would ruin what friendship there is already. Its a die if you do, dead if you don't situation. 

I guess it just makes me happy to know she is doing alright and is happy herself. I doubt she will ever know how I feel about her.

264,wellitsanameiguess,1550687814,3,"Hi there, don't know if anyone would read that but I just want to share my feeling of loneliness that sharply hit me right now and for the last months but tbh for pretty much of all my life.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I have to say I'm not *that* lonely (whatever the standards are). I mean I have friends - including close friends, two roommates friends, caring family, colleagues, fellow students and volunteers, some random people talks to me in the streets or wherever as I talk to them, I meet new people, etc. But despite all those people who would forbid pretty much anyone to describe me as lonely or alone, well, I just really feel like I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that the main reason of my feelings is that I really don't have anyone to talk about or when I do, it really never lasts long. How long ? Well I had friends when I was a child, and then I cut the bridge with them as I went to middle school where I made new friends and then I cut the bridge with them and I made some new friends in high school and as the same time online, and as I moved to another city I cut the bridge with my high school friends and maybe two years after with my online friends. I made some new ones in university and as I know some of them for 6 years, well, I'm starting to think a lot about cutting the bridge with most of them, if not all of them.   


Maybe if you're reading this are you thinking I am a bad person : ""Watch this guy, he has friends, and then he lefts them with no regards, and planning on doing the same again, how selfish or utilitarian do you have to be to do that ?"". Well that kind of true. I don't care that much about people, and I think I just connect with them as they can do stuff with me that I like (playing football or going to concerts for example) or provide me some original thoughts or perspectives. When they can't do any of that anymore (because I or they change their hobbies), well I just stop seeing them. Am I a bad person for doing that ? Sometimes I believe so, and some other ones I don't. I guess I'm just like that. I don't really like people but I do like some activities which are better with others people and I love ideas which people can provide. It's not something like I have everyone, mankind, etc. and maybe on the contrary. I really care about humanity or abstract persons. But concrete ones ? Not so much. Just like that. I'm not proud or desperate of it by any means. I'm just like that, always been, not sure I want to feel otherwise on the subject, not sure I could change on it.  


""What's the problem then ? Just get on with it and lose you friends as you did before"" you could say, but I believe the issue or my feeling about it is a little different this time. Firstly because, as I get older, I don't believe it 's that easy to make new friends anymore, and not that close. I mean I make some new friends over the past years but I really feels like as you get older you kind of lose your space for new relationships and that you can'y really meet new people as you did before. But I'm finding really hard to believe I can make new friends with whom I can go to holidays. Close neighbors or colleagues ? Yes surely. But better than that ? uh. Maybe I sound contradictory (""do you want friends or no ?"") but maybe it is because I didn't said that I love to have friendships, really, but with conditions, which mainly are protecting myself and my goals.  


And that's the main problem here. Some of my closest friends are in another city and for the three or four I have in this one, there is two (including one of my roommate and my best friend) that I just can't stand anymore. Really. Badly. And I suppose that my recent loneliness come from the fact that I'm losing two of my best friends, let alone my introvert and lonely personality. I'm not here for relationship advice because it's not a relationship problem. It's not that I saw them to much in a short time or that we have any issues at the time. I just don't get along with their personalities anymore, and I don't believe they'll change (they didn't really since I meet them and I didn't too). Maybe I'm just sad this as to be. Yeah we're not friends anymore (or I ain't your friend anymore). Just like that. Another great or cool or idk relationship over.

&amp;#x200B;

And maybe I don't feel that good because for the first time I really believe I'll be alone of my life. When I was a teenagers I already had the same kind of thoughts about my friends but at the time, I can of believe it was because as I was in not that big of a city I didn't get to connect with people that could really be my friends for long, knowing my personality and my goals but as I cloud thought the broken bridge with my online friends as an argument for that, I do see it now. It's seems I just can't be friend with people for a lot of time, maybe five dense years at the most. And maybe as I adult, as my relationships are going to be more sporadic, they'll last longer, but they'll end up anyway, in not that long. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm reaching the conclusion of this post, as I had something on my heart and somehow I explain it to me (and to you) here. And I'm kind of scared of the vision I have from the future me, alone, which could reach people but doesn't want to although I'll like to care concretely about anyone else, but I wont. Somehow, and however I don't had any interest for romantic relationships in my entire life (too much of a concern for someone else than me and too much on an affective involvement for my need to be free as I can be are the main reasons), I'm kind of starting to be interest in them,  not in a sexual or a passionate ways, but more in a way where I'll have someone (and children maybe) to share with, regardless of the help it/they can provide, and I could just care about them, helping them making their best. Guess I could do that with my friends of the moment too - but I'm not sure I want too. Maybe the thing is, I shouldn't trying to find people that can be of some help for me, as I always be did, maybe I just should find people that I want to help, just because I'll like them. Do I like or do I like them indirectly, for what and only what they provide me, base on my current needs. Don't know if I'm a jerk or something. Maybe I am and I can be something else, with current friends and relationships or some fresh and new one. I really don't know. Maybe this is really where I'm confuse, and what causes me those feelings that I have. And where I need help. I don't know.

Sadly, I can get desperate to talk to people, and as a result, I tend to mindlessly blurt out whatever I want to say, regardless if it is offensive, insensitive, or not okay. I have really bad social anxiety, and it really fucks with my social life. Since I'm naturally shy and reserved, I tend to stay in the shadows and become awkward when faced with social interaction.

We didn‚Äôt argue or nothing, the day before we was laughing, joking and being a great couple, then BAM!! It ends.

I hear from my ex every single day, sometimes we talk on the phone for 3 hours and before and after that call we talk on texts many dozens of times a day, she mainly initiates communication so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm stalking her.

I was surrounded by close friends and friends of friends and I was confident and happy. Then, a friend of a friend (a beautiful woman without a doubt) started talking to me.

Later she told friends that she was interested in me and wanted to know if I felt the same. 

Then, immediately, that cold dark fear raised it fucking head and I had to run away. I have no idea why this keeps happening. As soon as someone wants romantic involvement, I absolutely panic and make excuses to get out of there. The worst part is that beautiful woman now most likely feels rejected, and it's all because I'm a coward in this aspect of my life.

I suffered quite a lot. After a few weeks I got a little better but I knew that she wasn't in a good place there. She was struggling finding work. I've sent her a good amount of money twice. Things got out of control for her and I said  that if she wants she can come back to UK. ( Her mother is dead and her father is a huge douchebag) I was the only one that was able to help. 

She came back after 3 months. It was awkward and we both agreed that to restart our relationship it will be a huge mistake. 

Now she's been living with me for the last 3-4 months. She's still struggling finding work because she has some form of anxiety and depression. I'm helping her as much as I can but... I miss my lonely time. When she left a felt that I had all that I needed. Enough money, enough time, enough from everything. Now, I care about her. We are playing and joking alot but deep down inside I think I hate her. We are both 25. We've been separated for 8 months. She had a lover where she left. I was seeing nobody and I miss that deeply. To be honest, I miss my time with me. 

Now I'm stressed out almost all the time. We don't have enough money because I'm the only one who's working.

All the friends I have are extremely extroverted and I‚Äôm very introverted and we have very little in common but in the interest of not being alone I feel forced to go to events(ie: parties) that I would never go to and they only ever talk to me when they need something and it‚Äôs hurts .

First thing I noticed was my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù stopped being about. They never visited our new home, stopped calling or inviting me to game online. Eventually I found out they‚Äôd even replaced me online and my spot on our MMO raid teams was filled by ‚Äúthis guy Shane knows‚Äù which kind of hurt. 

I tried to not let this phase me and tried to join things. I‚Äôd played d&amp;d a bit and asked on the local Facebook pages if any groups were about, one replied. Turned up to find no one played d&amp;d there, in fact they had a ‚Äúclub rule‚Äù about long games like that. Stayed for a while but felt I was there to make up numbers and contribute to room hire. Never got invited to the extra gaming days round people‚Äôs houses or meet ups. 

So I tried other things, couple other clubs and a LARP group. Had fun at the larp group but again I was the real life NPC, I was just someone you encountered between A and B, who you never gave much thought too. 

We tried going out on my partners work nights out and I met a couple of the other girls boyfriends. One was a cocaine using meat head who was so off his head he couldn‚Äôt form a coherent sentence. The other guy seemed cool until we were talking about where we lived and his girlfriend (a colleague of my GF) screamed at him for telling me where they lived, after which he just sat quietly and haven‚Äôt spoken to him since.

My therapist says I need to ‚Äúget out there‚Äù and make some friends, but it‚Äôs a load of rubbish. I‚Äôve tried that, I meet people and when they turn their backs I‚Äôm invisible until they trip over me.

My parents still have very strict rules about when I can go out, how long I can be out and so on. This clearly affects both my school and job, I go to college and work as a bartender in the weekends and sometimes in the weekday nights too. Sometimes I stay in school after 4 pm just to have extra lessons or to join a club where I can work over time on my assignments with others. However my parents won‚Äôt let me work till midnight (when I occasionally work on weekdays), they won‚Äôt let me stay in school over time to work on my assignments either.
Whenever I am at home they are very abusive, my dad is severly depressed and therefore aggressive and bitter 24/7, my mom is just silent unless when she is drunk, then she gets extremely abusive and starts to call me names, disrupts me in my room when I am trying to do my assignments or talk to friends over phone also she can occasionally threaten to beat me when she is drunk. I understand that requires a lot of work and that it is a whole another life when living alone without parents but since I have abusive parents I actually think I would be much happier without them, my home would be free for the bad energy my parents constantly give out, I would be more motivated, much happier and so on to finish my education (I want to study psychology after college). I get education support since I live in a scandinavian country, here I get 712 USD every month, I can choose to move to a dorm with other students I go to school with - my moneys will then get limited to 600 USD every month since the 112 USD will go to the total price of dorm room and dorm food in total every month. I don‚Äôt care that I get a little less money than normal, I just want to live in a safe place where I can work on my school and work in my spare time.

I am independent and not clingy, so I dont think I'm pushing friendship  too much. Yet I can not keep friends in my life. It starts the same, we meet hang out, get really close and then they slowly ditch me. This has happened consistently with every single friendship in my life, including ones with some family members that I also considered friends (cousins etc). I always reach out and ask if our friendship is okay because I feel like we are drifting and every time they assure me it's fine and I'm just imagining things on my end. But I can guarantee any of these people will call me if they need help with something. 
This happened very recently with my current (now ex I suppose) best friend. He hasn't really spoken to me since Christmas. We make plans to hang out and he always has a lame excuse; he has to trim his dogs nails, he needs to clean his car, he drank too much all day and is now too drunk to drive to dinner etc. Last week I drug him out for coffee, could tell he didnt want to be there and I asked what was wrong. He told me nothing, everything was fine and we made plans to hang out Saturday night. Saturday rolls around and in text around dinner time asking if he was still interested and he said he couldn't. He forgot he had to go help his mom trim her cats nails. No offer to reschedule, not even a simple sorry. No communication for a week until I got a text asking if I could send him the name of a really great restaurant that I found a few months ago. I sent it and no response, absolutely no texts since then. So I guess this friendship is over too.

318,TalynStarburst,1550539680,9,"I used to be very socially active with people. I lived in a small town and would always run into someone I knew.. there wasn't a whole lot to do but drink and party, and at one point I just felt that I was doing too much of that. For some reason, I wanted to get away from people.. I think I was worried that I would reach a point of no return if I continue to hang out with everyone.. and living in a small town I felt that I had little privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

At 25, I moved back up North around where I was born. I moved to another small town where I had some relatives. For 10 years, I kept a really low profile having only a handful of friends. I discovered the Internet and spent countless hours on it or in front of the TV. I worked small survival jobs that got me by. Life pretty much stayed the same with no development.

&amp;#x200B;

At 35, I decided to make a change and moved to Seattle and went to school and into a career. But I had problems right and left with friends and in the professional workplace. As I never had many personal conflicts in the past, I seemed to constantly run into them. I even got fired for the first time ever from my last job of three and a half years.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I am 45 and I realize that I struggle constantly with loneliness amongst other things. I am very socially awkward and do not know how to get out and meet people like I used to. And I have very few friends left as I driven most of them away. I can't help but think that I had caused a lot of this on myself when I had isolated myself for 10 years. And maybe I had trouble working a full time career job because I lived off of small survival jobs that gave me more personal freedom in which I didn't use so wisely. I am always told that what I had gone through in the last 10 years were things that most people learned in their 20's.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway I am now back in the same spot as I was at 25 trying to figure out what to do with my life. I want to be able to get out again and become social like I was when I was younger.",lonely,10 years of isolating myself has impacted my social skills,2019-02-19 12:28:00

Let me fill you in, I've has issues for more than 3 years with depression and anxiety. All common and reasonable fixes I've tried, I really do mean that in the sense that I wasn't in the hospital. Its been over 1 year since self harm and I still feel just as empty as I did then. My life has been falling apart around me for the past 2 years of my life, My GPA dropped from 3.5 to 1.3, I lost my closest friend, and I still don't have the trust to tell my family who I really am. I likely will have a poor financial future with a post secondary education to match. The two people I held a relationship with during this time left me, both felt that it wouldn't work out and I never really found out why they didn't want to be with me. For the last 2 weeks I struggle to feel anything, and I decided to post here because I always feel alone. I can usually overcome the anxiety or depression but even around people I feel alone.

327,glassesguy99,1550523469,4,"Tl;Dr at the bottom, but I would really appreciate it if you read everything. It'll give you way better context to understand what I want to say.

Context: I'm a member of a particular committee at college, and I handle all the photography. At one particular event, I didn't do any photography, but I sorted and shared the pictures people had taken, which numbered almost 2000.

So it took me about 2 weeks to be completely done with this whole thing, because we had sponsors who wanted separate photos, the performers wanted their photos, random people came up to me every 3-4 days saying they had a folder of about 100-200 photos. And I kept getting more and more frustrated because I was doing this in the week my internal tests were on (my internals are the only thing allowing me to pass).

When I finally upload the folder, people start complaining about there not being any pictures of them, or there being only 1-2 pictures. I tried explaining that I didn't click any pictures, and my pictures weren't there either, but they weren't having it. So I exploded. I ranted on the committee message group about having to sort through 2000 pictures during my exam week, with all the BS I mentioned above, and all they can do is complain? I told them that they should've asked me to make sure their photos come, or even better, should have made sure themselves. This led to the 'we're only joking bro' crap, which made me look like the unhinged asshole.

After that day, I got the distinct feeling that I wasn't very welcome in the committee 'casual chill' circles, people stopped interacting with me, stopped listening to what I had to say, and basically started ignoring me. And they still do to this day, only it's a little less than before, but still enough to be painfully obvious to me and everyone else. I have no idea how to handle this, and I don't want to confront people because I hate doing that.

To make matters worse, our committee was supposed to play 2 songs as a band, wherein I would play the drums, being proficient at playing them and all. Plus, I had an electronic kit at home. They couldn't find any other kit for that day, so they told me to bring my kit, saying that I would definitely get to play, there was 100% chance I could play. And keep in mind, I live about 2 hours away from the college, and at 6.30 in the morning I was lugging my drum bag into the building. Then I spent another 1.5 hours assembling it. Then another hour finding a plug for the power. And 2 hours later, I'm still waiting to play, and I'm told that we won't be performing. So I got mad.

But that's not where it ends. The other guys I was supposed to perform with, went ahead and performed their part while I was disassembling my kit. And that made me hate everyone in the committee, thus leading to my frustration at everyone as I mentioned above.

Sorry for going on so long.

I do pretty well for myself. I stopped medicating about 15 years ago. Instead I smoke weed, which keeps me cool, most times. The older I get, the more I realize how bad it is getting in my head. 

I have always been a social butterfly who smothers you with her presence, whether you want it or not. Before marriage and kids, I was always surrounded by friends and family. I dreamed of the day I would have family, and my life would be full of family and cousins and babies playing with one another.

Until I had kids. And everyone who was there was all of a sudden gone. I don't get asked to hang out anymore. When I try to get the kids together, everyone is busy doing something else. I noticed my cousin was feeling down, and all though I don't celebrate valentines, I bought her a card, a teddy and some candy. The card was really heartfelt, wordy with how she is a great person and to cheer up. All I got was a ""thank you"" and she hasnt talked to me since. We work in the same building, feet away from one another, and I still don't see her or talk to her unless I am making contact. 

In last stitch effort, I made a status ""would anyone care if I disappeared ...... "". Not a soul said anything. No positive encouragement. No let's hang out. Nothing. I have been the one for years trying to hold on to anything I can out there. I had so many dreams about how my life would be once I had a family, how they would have all these cousins to play with,  getting together for family gatherings,  friends who are like family.  But everyone disappeared when I got married and although yes I still have him and my kids,  i'm feeling lonely.  Down.  Like I never mattered to any of them.  Like it was all a lie and I was just someone with a car,  someone who had money,  someone they could use.  

I am so tired of crying over these people. I took down my Facebook, in hopes that since I can't see what they are doing, it won't bother me. I took down my snap chat, another form of social media where you see what everyone else is doing, with out you.  At this point,  all social media is gone and I decided to dl reddit for something to read.

When your party was inside.

I the one who hung around,

Someone to call names.
But how strange is the change
After time has hurried by, 
Four years have passed since then, 
Now I‚Äôm not so quick to cry.
I‚Äôm bigger and I‚Äôm stronger,

I could, if I wanted, 
Be so unkind to you.

And the other boys would do.
But the memory of my pain
Holds back the revenge I‚Äôd planned
And instead I feel much stronger
By offering you my hand.

This poem has brought me a lot of tears.  Over the years that I have had it in.  But a lot of calm as well.

But in my darkest moments it has also brought me hope.

I have stopped growing now.  And I am not so quick to cry.

I still hope to be the popular one.   But I am happy to be who I am, I am not ashamed to be alone.   I am happy to be me by myself if needs be, but a partner would make it better.

 From time to time

 To keep my smile up

 So I won't be asked: ""Why?""

 But as they go away

 Time for another bleed.

 Is there even such a problem

 By feeling lonesome.

 I was close to despair.

 And I still share some feelings

 I could ask of a human being.

 So innocent and pure

 But then I was a killer

 Of joy... and impure.

 Striking down my Angel

 She loved me so much

 And I took her down with my anger.

 Tell her about the things

 The source of my rage.

Throughout all of these tear drops.

2 years ago, we met this guy around the same age as us. I sensed that the guy liked her, so I left them to be. But soon I realised that the guy wasnt really making a move (he's pretty shy and introverted) and he started talking to me too. It wasn't just like how friends talked. We had convos from morning to night. There was a period where he would skype me everyday. I was so confused by all this, because he really seemed to like my best friend in real life, but online he would make me feel so special(??)

So, of course over time, I developed a bit of a crush on him. I'm really shy and awkward, usually guys don't even pay attention to me, so this was a big deal. I was falling for the idea of him.

Today, we went for a show as a huge group (including me, my best friend, and crush). My best friend and crush sat at the end and there were 2 people between them and me. Throughout the whole show they were kind of flirting. My heart was literally shattering. The worst part is that he asked me for my phone so they could take a PICTURE together. Ok, fuck. You. Ugh. I knew a guy wouldnt ever have a genuine crush on me. I'm worthless and hate myself. So yup thats that. Thanks for letting me vent here.. I dont feel like talking to my best friend at this point.

Bf2 didnt want to tell me about the reason why bf1 didnt want to talk with me.
So last week i was depressed in some kind of way seeing that my best friends dump me like that. They hung out without me.
You will probably say that i did something to make them dont like me.,but they dont want to tell me. So remember that i told you that they hung out without me, a year ago when bf1 was annoyed by bf2 we went outside for a walk and he told me not to call bf2 but because i felt like bf2 wasnt fake i told bf1 to fuck off and called bf2 to hang out.

I want to change that. How could I help myself? And why would/wouldn't you be friends with me after reading this? Please read the whole thing :( Soooo here goes I guess...

&amp;#x200B;

* I like photography
* Being alone
* Walking through the park
* Reading on psychology/anything, even though I'm a History and Politics student
* Watching Real Housewives / Desperate Housewives... with my Mum (Company! OMG!)
* Sarcasm, often directed at the lower intellectual classes (jk)
* Human Rights. I'm really shy and struggle to find my voice, so without the law classing me as an individual with rights I'm pretty sure I would have nothing. I thank God everyday that we don't live in a state of nature as I would be the first to go... even though the law is not perfect.
* Recovered from a borderline drinking problem
* God! I'm a religious person, but also one of the most tolerant people you will ever meet. I use the bible to guide me when I'm lost and to prevent me from going off the rails economically and getting lost in the system. I don't tell anyone else what to do, and I'm kind of in love with John Stewart Mill's Harm Principle - everyone should be able to do whatever the fuck they want insofar as it doesn't harm anyone else. I don't hate anyone. I just love what God has done in my life, saving me from death and suicide and such. But I don't judge anyone and I DON'T think anyone is inferior to Christians. The world is for all of us. I hate anyone who looks down on anyone else.
* Skincare. It's like my own scientific experiment, seeing what works and what doesn't. I cured my own acne naturally!
* Nail care. My natural nails are long and almost look fake and I'm really proud of that, even though no one cares.
* Playing the piano. I couldn't afford lessons anymore after the age of 15 which was so heartbreaking for me. But a couple of years ago I chose to pick it up again on my own and I practice in my spare time. It sucks that I don't actually know if I'm any good though because I play... alone.
* Being anxious and depressed. I'm an expert at this one.
* Being an INTJ (if you don't know about Myers Briggs look it up! It's so interesting)
* Looking things up. Absolutely anything. God I'm boring.
* Self deprecating.
* Running out of things to say.
* Failing to be funny.
* Giving up on making friends because I always run out of things to say/do üôÉ
* Sims 4... I'm very ashamed of this one.
* Easily ashamed and embarrassed.
* Oh, and I also really struggle to find a social group because I'm a freak. I'm a bit of a nerd. But also black; female; and sometimes get scouted for model shows (I was on TV! I got rejected though). So yeah, my personality and interests don't match how I come across. I was hesitant to add my race because I don't want anyone's perception of me to be distorted. This sucks. I'm so alone. The type of guys I attract end up hating me because I don't know how to be a girl. A few jocks ruined my life in my first year of college and I still cry about how they treated me every night; it's been 2 years now, and I attempted suicide after the whole ordeal; they were just nagging me in general and turning people against me for choosing not to sleep around. I feel realllyyyyy unfeminine and just unusual in general. But I guess I want to learn more about myself and how to be a functioning member of society... you know?

392,ImNintendoAndDaniel,1550370825,9,"Every time I try to write something it just seems wrong, but I guess Ill try and edit it over and over. I'm a 27 M but I've never posted. Maybe just writing this down will help me. I've lurked Reddit for a while often looking at posts for advice or just for someone interesting, but I've never written anything.

I can't seem to make friends, its really messing with me. I used to be so good at it in high school, but now it seems every person I meet seems receptive and friendly but hardly ever results in just being a casual friend. I had a girlfriend for 5 years who I had a son with, and she always had friends over which was nice, but towards the end she was controlling and abusive. When I finally ended it many people saw it as my fault, and that I had mistreated her. I was pretty heavily depressed for the last year I was with her.  Most of those friends wouldn't speak to me anymore, or at least causally decline to see me.  I slowly had a few people that felt I were on my side and they really helped me through it. 

Shortly after I met a girl, who I'd known while with my girlfriend, but I didn't know her that well.  This girl slowly got closer to me, I talked about my breakup and she talked about hers, but we took it slow because we had both been through a rough time. Eventually we got very close, she told me things she had never told anyone before, I told her a lot I felt too. We had a few ups and downs, but we got to the point in about the last month or two where we were sleeping  in the same bed 3-4 nights a week, we had sex a few times and It just felt right, not like a hookup. She texted every day, without fail. Always wanted to see me, told me everything that was happening.  Almost no one other than her and my family were speaking to me at this point. I really wanted to date her, but was cautious. 

Fast forward to this Monday before Valentines day and we had an argument. We had a date planned ON Valentines Day. She was always so reasonable and understanding and this felt totally out of the blue. She kicked me out of her house and I barely got my shoes back. I was shocked. 2 days later I texted and apologized and said I wanted to talk about why she was upset. She said she needed time. I have no idea why she would just completely shut me out. I have even told her how much her friendship means, We were very close, even just as friends. I always respected that, and tried to help her any way I could. 

But now I'm realizing... I don't really have any other friends, I casually know people at work, and I have my family (All of which live 600+ miles away) But I can't really see anyone to  just say ""Hey, I'm not feeling good, just wanna go hang out"". It feels horrible. She has many close friends and would go and see them. I was invited a few times and then it just didn't happen. I know its really self destructive to think that people just don't want me around but It seems that's the case. I've gone out and talked to people but I can't seem to connect with anyone. It's just made me worse and worse.  

I've been pretty drunk the last 4 days and haven't been working because of the Chinese New Year. (I'm a truck driver at the port) This has to be the biggest low I've had in a long time. Just wish I had ONE friend to hand out with for a night and help me through this. I don't normally drink this much. I don't think its just her, I want to have guy friends or other people I could just talk to.

I'm drunk now, can't believe Im putting this out there, but hey maybe someone will say something. I'm just sitting here feeling like shit and no amount of shots or Xbox is helping.

Aldo i made this account a couple of days ago when i was high on xans. I fell like i need to share my just to pay my deed to you guys, i truly hope you read all the way to the end, Here goes my history and my experience with depression and loneliness. It all started when i was 12, i had a lot of problems in my family and one day (i will remember that day till i die) it all just broke down on me. I woke up hopeless, i woke up like a husk. And since that day, weather did not matter, situations did not matter, people around me did not matter, it was just all grey. A constant switching between anxiety and depression, it was hell for me for a long, long time. I spent my time alone, year after a year, if you passed by my house you would see a kid in a red west and small boots playing all by himself. I escaped into my imagination,and oh boy was i good at escaping and creating walls around my little imaginary world so nobody who would not understand would enter I thought about suicide a lot, but did not do it. It dragged on and on, and situation just kept getting worse.I almost died of alcohol abuse when i was 15 because i saw no way out. All those things forced upon me. Family issues, school grades dropping, first heartbreaks, and since i am a very sensitive person it all got to me really fast. I developed a lot of issues for myself, college began, but i just did not care. I was excited to meet new people and to have a good time. To find a girlfriend. TO have someone to hold me and tell me: Hey, i understand you, it will be okay, i am here for you. I use to dream about that person appearing out of the blue. And you know what? She did appear. A perfection before my eyes, anything i could have asked for. And what next? She left. As quickly as she came into my life. I hated her and loved her at the same time. I drank, booooy, did i drink, just to forget everything and to move on, i did everything just not to think about her and the memories of her. but now i understand, that there is so much a person can handle, and some person just don\`t click no matter how good they seem together. I moved on, made friends, really good friends, had a couple of girlfriends, but none of those relationships seemed to click. Time passed, classes failed, problems building up once again. I felt like i was stuck in a circle. But it got to me, i do not need alcohol to cure me, i do not need xans, i do not to be surrounded by people to be happy. I just need me to think sober and focus on the stuff that makes me happy. As hard and risky as it was, i had to cut out the things out of my life that hurt me. And i started doing so. I  have made plans, started writing and after 13 years, i feel better, i actually feel happy again. My demons still visit me from time to time \`doh. But i always find a way to dodge them and deal with them. I enjoy life now, more than ever before.   
In the end, i know you are going through a tough time, i know it\`s hard, as cliche as it seems, and as it sounds i wanna say one thing. YOU are STRONG. Believe in yourself. Do not judge yourself based on what other people tell you about you. And most importantly, DO NOT GIVE UP. No matter if you are religious or you believe in science, you are all here for a reason, you are good in enough, and strive for greatness every day of your life. Shoot for the stars.    
I love you all, you better believe it &lt;3

I moved to Northern Virginia from London recently and I'm looking for someone to talk to. You don't have to be close-by, though that would be nice, I'm mainly *just* looking for someone to take my mind off things. 

I would say that I'm great at socialising and people around me are usually willing to be around me, yet I can't seem to be interested in most people in my daily life. I don't really seem to be able to get the hang of being emotionally available at the same level as most others around me...if that makes sense. 

I don't usually care about having someone to talk to, but I've recently started to feel a desire of just having one person to talk too without needing to be fake.

We don't need to talk about me either. We can talk about your issues, or things that are on your mind.

I know beggars shouldn't be choosers, but I tend to not be able to stand small talk and such unless I have no choice. I find meaningful discussions to be much more enticing. 

Long story short: I'm looking for just one person to have long-term talks with. Just to keep me sane. 

P.S. I can come across as pretty apathetic, so if that bothers you, least now you know in advance. 
I don't want you to feel offended by this personality flaw.

Though by the same vein, I treat anyone I personally talk to extremely serious, so if you want to be that person I talk to, you can also know in advance that I'll be paying attention to everything about you. 

Oh &amp; lastly, I'm a 20 year old male.

I‚Äôm 17(M) and in my junior year of high school. I do fine academically but a problem I‚Äôve had for as long as I can remember is being social.

The one time in my life where I was the most social was in 8th grade. I had friends, and a girlfriend. However the group of people I chose to hang out with including my girlfriend were toxic people, who were all depressed and anxious just like me and being around them started to deteriorate my wellbeing. 

When I started high school, I pretty much cut everyone I knew from middle school out of my life and have been in and out PHP‚Äôs and have had multiple therapists, as well as having to stay at a psych ward for a week for threats of suicide.

Now, as a junior, not much has changed. I‚Äôve been seeing one therapist who I really trust, and haven‚Äôt needed any kind of PHP to help me bounce back. Still very few friends, though. And I feel like my social skills just aren‚Äôt as impressive as they used to be.

When I try to make new connections with people, I notice all of these toxic behaviors start to resurface. I‚Äôm a super jealous person, I overthink simple interactions with people, and I always need validation from others to make me feel secure about myself.

414,TigerFalco,1550312028,12,"There was a girl that I met here at my college. From the second i saw her i knew i had to be friends with her. I'm a goth, and i could tell from the way she was dressed she was too. I'd never had a goth friend before...at least not in person.

As time went on i realized we had a decent amount in common, we shared a lot of the same interests to differing degrees. I started to become interested in her. I think I get interested in people relatively fast and easy because I've been single for 4 almost 5 years now. As time went on that interest turned into actual feelings. Normally, I don't allow my feelings to develop to the level of a crush and keep it as an interest. These kind of things never go well for me, so it's basically become a pattern. For her it was different, I felt safe letting my walls down with her and I don't know why. I thought she'd be different, when i was around her...I started to remember what being happy was like and when I would hug her...it just felt right.

&amp;#x200B;

I did everything I could so that when the time came, she'd give me a chance. I tried to be reliable, every time she asked for help I agreed even if it was inconvenient to me. There was a time where I had pulled a muscle in my foot...it hurt just to walk, but she needed me to take her to a station so she could get home and I ran to my car despite the pain because I didn't want to let her down. I bought her food on a few occasions when she didn't have any money but i knew she was hungry. When she told me she didn't want anything else, she always got excited when she got her food back and realized I had secretly bought her some desert like Chocolate chip cookies or cheesecake or something in her bag. She said I was sweet...I made her laugh a lot. She eventually figured out I liked her and weaseled some info out of me on what i thought about her. Asked me stuff like, why I like the girl I was into and if I thought she was pretty. She could tell I really liked her, but i told her that if the girl I liked turned be down I'd be fine. I said that I don't get to meet people like her very often so even if the girl turned me down I'd just want to be her friend when it's all said and done. She knew I was talking about her, but apparently it meant nothing.

So, this is my first time on Reddit &amp; can't really see myself using this much either, but since I've been feeling more &amp; more lonely as of late, decided I've got nothing to lose.

I moved from London to America/Virginia about two years ago - when I was 18 - with the family. Since coming, all I do with my life is work &amp; focus on a business I've been doing. Which usually means a lot of studying/research along with sleepless nights mean I'm just living the most fruitless &amp; repetitive life.

I don't usually care about being ""lonely"". Never really have had any significant type of interest in people, but...due to some recent happenings, I've started to feel the need to have someone to talk to.

I'm not looking for anything too special, I would like to think. Honestly, just want someone who's down for some long-term discussion.

I would really appreciate having someone to talk to. With the repetitive lifestyle and the utterly mundane circumstances, I can feel myself submerging into insanity...Lol.

Starting around the beginning of 2018 (I was about 16 at the time) I dated a girl who walked, talked, and looked like she was in her late teens. However, She wasn't quite 13 years old yet. We went to a dance together, went to a few parties together, we hung out and kissed a lot, but nothing beyond that. Not knowing how special it was supposed to be. It took Me awhile to realize that the age gap between the two of us just wasn't going to work out. And when My parents found out that We we're dating, they were, of course, furious. I'm 17 years old now, and she's 13. I still see her a lot, and she takes several classes with Me. I know that our relationship is out of the question, but I can't help but feel emotionally attached to her. Though I don't normally celebrate Valentine's Day, I thought it would be a nice excuse to write My friends some notes telling them that I loved them and cared about them. I wrote this girl a note as well, not wanting her to feel left out. I had a note in My bag that I wrote, thinking that I was going to give it to her. I eventually decided not to give it to her due to the fact that I thought it was a bit too flirty and shit. And I don't want to lead her on and hurt her more. It's just not right. I genuinely see her as a friend, but she seems to want more than that. And I can't help but realize that I don't exactly have an iron will, and I can see Myself giving into her sometimes. There's a get together coming up and she wants to dance with Me there. But I know for a fact My parents are going to lose it if I were to dance with her at this event. The entire thing has been off and on for months and it's absolutely killing Me. I Love her very much and I know that a relationship with her wouldn't be good for either of us right now. So I refuse to let one develop. But she draws Me in. I don't know what to do. I've made a mistake, I've been careless with this person's feelings as well as My own, and I hate Myself for it. Not being able to talk to her normally in front of My parents is driving Me crazy. And I'm sure it's driving her crazy as well. And they don't even pretend to have any interest in helping Me. Every time I bring it up, they have hurtful things to say, and they won;t give Me a chance to speak about it and explain how it's making Me feel. What's wrong with Me? What have I done? Is there anything I can do to fix it? It's bringing out intense feelings of loneliness and sadness, and I don't know why. Can anyone help?",lonely,The end of a relationship,2019-02-16 16:28:23
424,lavenderbruises,1550292558,13,"I had some friends in high school, and I looked forward to making friends in university.

Couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Turns out, as time went by, I became more and more self-conscious, which made making friends that much harder. 

I thought I would have the typical uni experience of every young person...fun, exciting, filled with new experiences. Except I found myself spending most nights alone in my room.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I wasn‚Äôt a COMPLETE loner. I had a handful of friends. But I didn‚Äôt have a best friend, or even a really close one. 

I thought at least, maybe I‚Äôd experience some romance. After all, where else in life would it be easier to find a special someone? So many cute and smart guys around me, if only I could just talk to one. Nope. Never happened. Not even a single date.

I‚Äôm not mad at anyone, or anything. I‚Äôm not even mad at myself. Even if I could go back in time and do these past 4 years all over again, I don‚Äôt think much would have changed. I was always that awkward quiet girl, ever since I could remember. As the years went by, it got better in some ways and worse in others, but I was never completely happy. A small part of me was always lonely and starved for company.

At the end of the day, it all comes down to personality. Some people have personalities that let them make friends with anybody they meet, that lead them on crazy adventures and experiences. Other people are best suited to spending the days watching others live their lives.

I wonder if the replies to this will be from people smart enough to understand online dating, it is a game of pictures, you don't like, you swipe, nobody will ever be enough, you see their pics online, if they are messy looking with a poor life, no, if they have smart clothes with a fancy car, yes yes yes, it is as shallow as a paddling pool there is no substance, no wanting to learn about people, to get to know them, it just becomes a service, what can they do that will service my needs, like a trade if you will and online dating is the equivalent of Yellow Pages, you check the stats, you check their political views, you check their abs or their boobs (but not their personalities)

Anyway, all of this puts things in people's heads that they have to seek strangers online to fill that void, I suffer daily with pain and depression and anxieties and have done this as well but generally to meet as friends and go from there, I have never trolled people or harassed people, I put things out there, if people don't bite then that is fine but I just suffer the pain as a result of all that but they never will, I just think it is all luck in life really, only those with the charms will make it, I think all this seeking for comfort for connection for something that will help decades of loneliness for me has become a disease in itself that has gotten me to not wanting to live anymore, maybe some will understand this maybe they won't, but I think online dating is one of the biggest scams going, just a wall of fake profiles of people who aren't much behind the curtains, will just lead people on with messages and promises and it goes nowhere, like the media, they advertise perfection that nobody can achieve

455,GANDALFthaGANGSTR,1550223076,1,"There's a difference. I used to say that a lot to myself so I wouldn't feel so bad. But it drives me nuts the more I think about it. There is a difference between being alone and being lonely. But they aren't mutually exclusive. And when they hold hands the same way you wish you could with someone else, it feels like there's a piece of you missing that you didn't even know existed before. 

I started telling myself this mantra sometime after my graduation from high school nine years ago. I've kept to one night stands with absolute strangers, and, guy or girl, it always felt the same way. And now as I'm growing older, I realize that the things that give every bit of life its vibrant shades of colors are more beautiful than ever when you open your soul to someone. When you can stand under an umbrella, so close to each other that you can feel each other's body heat. When you hold hands for so long that your skin gets clammy and you both giggle as you wipe your palms on your pants and go right back to it, fingers intertwined. 

When you can tell someone about the things that almost broke you for good, feeling an otherworldly comfort in being vulnerable with someone who wants to wipe your tears off your cheeks and fill every void in your being with an acceptance that has always eluded you.

I hate to be such a clich√©, but as I witnessed people today celebrating their love, I remembered that while it's okay being alone, and loving who you are, it doesn't stop your spirit or your mind from aching for someone to love you the same way. It's an ache that hollows you from the inside out. 

Whoever you are, I just want you to see me for who I am and never let me give up. Because I'm waiting for you, and I'll love you like the storm loves the seeds under our feet. ",lonely,Alone and Being Lonely.,2019-02-15 20:31:16

I have never had many friends, and the few I have I have held dearly.  My closest friend was killed in a car accident last year, leaving just three others.  In 2017, I did have a girlfriend for a few months, but we broke up, and it was pretty bad.  Long story short, she ended up posting a bunch of negative things about me on social media and sent me a text telling me to read them.  I loved her a lot, and it hurt like hell for that to happen.  I'm still not really past that, but I have gotten better.  I do struggle with depression, but for a few days I've been okay.    
    
Over the past few weeks, what few friends I have (or thought I did) distanced themselves from me.  We used to play a lot of games together nearly every night, and talked a lot.  I can't remember the last time any of this happened.  I know they're still online and playing because I can see their online statuses, but they don't respond if I reach out and obviously never do themselves.    
    
Tonight, one of them messaged me asking if I wanted to come to a late dinner to celebrate his job change.  He told me that he had invited my ex because they were on ""good terms"" and so he was pretty sure I wouldn't want to be there.  We're she not coming, I would absolutely go, but he knows the details of the breakup and why both of us being together would be a terrible idea.    
    
Not sure how to react other than hurt.  At best it means he doesn't really want me there.  More likely, he really wants her there, and values her company over mine.  Maybe they're dating, because I know she went for him after we broke up.  I told him that it wouldn't be a good idea if she and I were both there so I wouldn't be able to go, to a reply of, ""okay, sounds good"".  The other friends I have are going.    
    
I guess I just shouldn't care, but I do.  I trusted this guy as a close friend.  All of them really.  I have nobody left but you all here on Reddit, so I'm venting to you.

461,NutritiousTomato,1550208435,1,"Good day, everyone! I know today is a special day, or perhaps an especially sad day for many of us lonely folks. 

But what keeps me going when I‚Äôm feeling particularly alone is working on improving myself so that I can stop being lonely. It‚Äôs part fear and part hope. The fear of being alone forever and never finding love and close friendship. And it‚Äôs also the hope of, wow, how amazing would it be if I get so good at socializing that I could use my skills of charm to win people over at my whim? 

Since I‚Äôve been pretty isolated for many years of my life (it wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to say over a decade), my social skills could use some work. Sometimes I wonder how FAST I‚Äôd improve if only I could have something like the holodeck from Star Trek and just repeatedly practice putting myself in various social situations.  God, that would be a dream.  

We may not have access to any holodecks yet, but there are still lots of ways to practice, with a bit of courage, persistence, and creativity.

Some things I‚Äôve found that help me are, visualization, meditation, exercise, talking to myself out loud, practicing being in social situations alone in a private place (literally acting it out as if I was interacting with people), and certain books. In particular, The Charisma Myth is one of the best books I‚Äôve found for improving social skills! I highly recommend it. :)

Anyway, I thought I‚Äôd make this little ramble of a post to try to encourage some people (as well as myself) who may be feeling lonely.  

I haven‚Äôt been on Reddit in awhile, but seeing people who are experiencing the same problems as me is comforting. And the beauty of places like Reddit is, no matter how alone we are in real life, we can all hop on here and suddenly be connected to the world.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to share with this community the ""boo-hoo"" story of my personal experience with loneliness. I'm not hoping to get sympathy or attention and in fact I'm sure this will sound very melodramatic and self-pitiful. Still, who knows if many of you here haven't¬† felt the way I do in one way or another at some point in your lives.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I can remember I've always had problems connecting with people. It began as far back as my primary school years and went on throughout high school and university. At any social event, party or gathering (and I did go to a fair share of those) I was pretty much only just *there*, busy being invisible and never knowing what to say to anyone. I was the very definition of a wallflower.

Still I pushed myself to be as outgoing as possible even when I wished nothing more than to stay at home immersed in a book or a video game. If I was invited to a birthday party I would always go. A night out? Sure. Most of the times it would be a total disaster. I would be there but I might as well have been invisible. Sometimes I would even leave unannounced just to see if anyone noticed my absence because I definitely felt like no one would. But on a few rare occasions it would actually not be that bad which was what made me keep going out and trying to socialize. On the few occasions when I did manage to step out of my shell during a night out I would always come home knowing that everything would go back to being the way it had always been the next day. I didn't even feel like myself when it happened, like I was faking it and just acting.

About three years ago I moved to London for work and it's been pretty rough. Back home I at least knew I had my friends only a phone call away but now I'm lucky if I manage to see them once a year. Everyone has moved away, started careers, married, having kids and I still siting here not knowing what the hell I'm supposed to be doing with my life. Nothing I'm doing now feels like it's amounting to something. I work from 9am to 6pm every day in a fairly well paid job but that's pretty much it. I wouldn't bother trying to start writing a diary because every entry would literally be the same.

I've tried finding hobbies, resorting to Meetups and also online dating and although I've met a lot of people during my time here, the inability to make a click with anyone still prevails. I'm 30 now and starting to feel a bit old and hopeless. Do you ever get the feeling like you're waiting to catch a train that's departed a long time ago?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that being shy, quiet and introverted will deprive me of the many things in life I desire, specially making meaningful connections with someone. I also¬†understand why people might distance themselves from me over time.¬†I blame no one else other than myself for that because I know I don't or have ever tried hard enough. I¬†expect too much and give back too little. But there is also a part of me which can't help but feel angry that life has to be that way. Why can't I get a break every once in a while? As a kid all I ever wanted was to be happy, loved and accepted for who I was and I was fairly certain that would happen eventually if I always carried a smile on my face and treated everyone with respect. But back then I didn't understand that you can't simply stay idle in your own little sphere of existence and expect the world to be placed at your feet. Today I know that life, like everything else, requires a lot of hard work and for you to constantly improve yourself. Friendships require work to stay alive. Nothing can be taken for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

I will save you the bother of telling me that¬†I shouldn't measure the success of my personality on the approval of others or think I'm only as good as the attention I get from my peers. I know I shouldn't model myself to what I think people expect me to be and instead I should concentrate on being myself and learn to¬†be comfortable that way.¬†Part of that I already do today.¬†I'm okay with being the way I am and I like not needing to be around people all the time and I like being able to enjoy the little things in life with or without the company of others. I don't have any attachments. If I want to do something I do it. If I want to go somewhere I'll go. And if I don't do it or don't go then I won't feel bad about it or like I've let someone down.¬†But the cruel irony is that I firmly believe I need people around to keep me from falling into an endless cycle of self examination and self-pity. I get a lot of energy when I'm around people who can motivate me to be a better¬†person . The problem is this impenetrable wall I sense between me and everybody else all the time, a wall that keeps on growing. The bricklayer: my low self esteem and¬†lack of confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to sound unappreciative so I would just end this by saying that even though I suffer and complain I still love life and all the little things in it that bring me joy every day.¬†I may not have many friends but I'm lucky that the few I have are loyal and accepting of who I am. My family has also been there for me when I needed the most. If I had only one regret in life is that I have never really told or showed them how much they all mean to me.

But¬†I'm just so tired of fighting against myself all the time. I'm tired of how small and detached my world feels from everyone and life outside my windows. I'm tired that being 'normal' is such a struggle to me. I don't know how to step out of this hole I'm in. On the one hand I know what I need to do but on the other I'm like an old dog who can't learn new tricks. I don't know... Maybe I just don't love myself enough to change and seek help for my problems or I've gotten too comfortable with my depression that I don't know what happiness is anymore.¬†I know that when you become so obsessed with seeking an idea or concept of happiness you can spend your entire life chasing a white whale and become completely blind to what's around you. You find yourself never being happy with anything.

I'm tired of trying to pretend that I don't care or I'm not hurt by what other people do. I'm tired of holding back my tears only for it to be shed at home when no one's around. I'm tired of making up situations in my head where I'll find a friend or significant other I can openly tell my problems to and recieve affection. 

All I see around me are intimate friend groups that always share laughs  and inside jokes, couples that resonates their affection from merely holding each other's hands, and families where members feel  like they have a sense of unconditional belonging. I honestly don't know if all this is real since  I can only interpret what I see, but by the looks of it and from my experience, I think it's pretty rare to not have a single person that you can talk to openly, or to find someone that actually cares for you?

Before, I would sometimes wake up to a text (a wonderful experience) or if I stepped away for a bit, be bombarded with msgs asking where I went. But.. after my mistake.. just really flat conversations. If I step away, no msgs. No msgs in the mornings. I stopped sending msgs and none came to me. After a week or two, I msg again, but it's hard to get a conversation off the ground. Today, after days of no msgs, I say we should go our separate ways (because she doesn't seem to want to talk to me, just one or two word replies, forgets I sent a msg, lets conversation die, unlike before).. and we spent a little while talking about it.. she's so nice and I can't be mad.. but I am heartbroken. She meant so much to me... I wanted her to say, ""no, don't go"" or ""you can stay, you're still my friend."" And I hinted at it throughout our goodbyes.. but no, she didn't seem to want to stop me. She said nice things and still called me friend, but I was almost begging, in between the lines, for it not to end. If I said so, she would be there for me even now, I'm sure, but that's not the same... Idk if I should've, but I realized something and I said that I didn't want someone who would be there if needed, but someone who actually wanted to talk to me. And she just said, ""yea...""

I‚Äôm in a great mood right now after being pretty lonely and miserable the past week for some inexplicable reason. I woke up after sleeping in, got some coffee at a local place and relaxed there, ate a great lunch, and am now sitting alone studying. 

I recently got a gift for myself I have been enjoying and am about to start a new book in a serious I like. Tonight I‚Äôm starting a new show I‚Äôve wanted to start forever, and ordering my favorite pizza from my favorite pizza place. 

Now, to the point: Sometimes I feel that loneliness can be extremely beautiful and poetic at times. It sounds literally insane typing out that sentence, but the freedom and quietness I experience makes me so happy every once in awhile. I see people so caught up and anxious about society and being left out and what not, but due to my loneliness over the years I‚Äôve actually learned to become more independent and completely fine with utter silence for days at a time. Sometimes having no events is such a nice feeling, for me at least. 

I‚Äôm *definitely* not saying this advice 100% cures me, but I hope some of you get the point I‚Äôm trying to make here. I hope I‚Äôm not mistaken. I have a chronic illness and am often too fatigued to do anything so loneliness is almost like a limb for me. 

I‚Äôve also learned a lot about mindfulness and taking the present moment as it is, whatever that may be.   Our brains tend to always push towards wanting stuff we don‚Äôt have instead of accepting it all, which can be very dangerous to our mental health. 

Shoot me a DM if anyone wants to just chill out online together. Have a great week.

I've been single for years and it never helps having anxiety, loneliness and depression but I suppose it's just another day like Christmas to act like you care when the rest of the year is spent forgetting people, I think you shouldn't need to have set days per year to care more about other people it should be a regular occurrence, people show off their partners online or the presents they get for yuletide.

If I had someone worth any effort, I'd wine and dine her, throw scented rose petals at her feet, nurture them while snuggling up on the couch watching a movie, whisper sweet lullabies all evening, then at bed time I'll be fast asleep, can't give them everything at once lol",lonely,What have all the single ladies and gentlemen got planned over Valentine's Day?,2019-02-14 11:25:51

540,xopeachesox,1550098611,1,"So my boyfriend (m26) and I (f21) have been together for almost half a year now and from the start we had an almost fairytale relationship, we fell in love so fast, got along perfectly, balanced each other out, etc etc. We were in that nice new couple ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù phase of our relationship when out of no where my boyfriend started suffering from severe health anxiety and panic disorders.

This all started in January when he suffered what he thought was a heart attack (he‚Äôs 26, bit of a gym freak and seemingly fit &amp; healthy). He got checked at the hospital and was told it was a panic attack and that he was fine. It happened again a couple of days later when he was at his work and again he was told it was a panic attack and his heart was fit and healthy and his breathlessness had been brought on by stress and anxiety. And since that day everything just went downhill.

My boyfriend started using google to self diagnose himself with various conditions such as a pulmonary embolism, heart failure, edemas, kidney failure etc. Since last week he‚Äôs visited a doctor either in the emergency room or at his general practice every day or had paramedics at his house. They can‚Äôt find anything wrong with him other than panic disorder.

The whole thing started a month ago. I love my boyfriend to bits but because of all of this our relationship has been neglected, he barely talks about anything other than his health and gets annoyed at me for not being with him when I have free time. I try to talk to him about stuff but he‚Äôs despondent and uninterested. We‚Äôve had to cancel various trips and a holiday we had booked for Milan. We no longer do things together and most of the time I feel like the relationship is one sided.

I just feel so alone, I don‚Äôt have any close friends or family to confide in or anyone I can talk about my situation with. We used to go out lots and talk for hours about anything and everything and I miss it so much. I have spoken with him about how I‚Äôm feeling and he just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll understand if you leave me‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt want to leave him because he‚Äôs clearly mentally unwell and is seeking treatment but I think his poor mental health is starting to really affect my own. I believe that this is a test that our relationship will withstand but in the meantime I just don‚Äôt know how to cope with the loneliness. 

I guess this post isn‚Äôt really looking for advice or whatever I just needed to share how I‚Äôm feeling because I don‚Äôt have anyone else.

I hung out with my friends today, and I really felt extremely alone when they left. I should feel less lonely, right? This doesn‚Äôt even make sense, how do I even feel alright if I‚Äôm only going to feel worse when everybody‚Äôs gone?

And In this state I suddenly realized that my communication with the very few people who I think at least somewhat care about me has been incredibly one-sides for quite a long time now. How could I not notice that they don‚Äôt really ask questions or try to talk about things that interest me? I must really hate this realization. 

I‚Äôm different, and if you care enough to read up until here you probably are too.

So I need to give you a backstory first before I ask my question.

I had a pretty normal life until the age of 15. I had a great school and I had some close friends. But at age 15 I got sick with a disease called Meniere‚Äôs Disease. It‚Äôs nothing too serious but it affected my life a lot and my life went downhills from that point. Soon I wasn‚Äôt even able to go to school. So I didn‚Äôt go to school that year. Although my friends were very supportive at first we started to drift apart. Next year I was much better so I got back to school (I don‚Äôt know what its called in USA and other countries but I started something similar to homeschooling). In the end I managed to finish high school. My disease is all gone now and next year I will be starting college. But right now I only have two friends. And we don‚Äôt really talk anymore. I don‚Äôt think they want to be friends with me anymore.

I feel very lonely and I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to except my parents and my brother. A couple of months ago I started seeing a therapist but talking with my therapist doesn‚Äôt really help. I don‚Äôt really know how to meet with new people and I have a little bit of social anxiety.
 
I don‚Äôt know what to do. So I need some advice on how to deal with loneliness. It‚Äôs really painful to be lonely.

It just bothers me that he never really initiates any of it. I'll be the first one to pull in for a hug or kiss, or say I love you (which he says back, but rarely just says it on his own to me) and it's gotten to be extremely lonely over the years. 

I have talked to him about this on multiple occasions so he knows how I feel about it. I've also told him about how my anxiety gets bad sometimes when we don't talk as much on a daily basis because I just assume he doesn't want me around so I don't interact with him. And if I am slightly isolating myself he doesn't really come try and talk to me either which can be disheartening.

It's so strange because it is like part of me is holding on to the nothing tangible we really ever had, however I don't let that dream stop me from trying to find a life with another.  I look at her Facebook about one every two months or so, just to see how she is and stuff.  I'm glad she never blocked me but I didn't really ever do anything too inappropriate.  I just think it is an innocent crush.  I don't think I am a creep or anything for holding a spark for her, and would never do anything to hurt her.   I don't even want to ever visit D.C. because I don't want the off chance of seeing her however minute the chance is.  Anyways it has been 7 years since I was with a girlfriend I actually liked, and one year since I had a girlfriend.  I very well may go to the grave with these feelings, but I guess that is life.

And they keep saying they want me around and I want to believe it but I can't help feeling that they hate me.

619,tordilla,1549932535,1,"I‚Äôve always trusted too much. My first experience with friends in elementary school turned out to be a group that truly couldn‚Äôt stand my presence, and it took me overhearing one of their conversations to find out after a long 4 years. Natural insecurities came; I was never confident with my weight, I had glasses, and after this encounter, I always felt that there was something wrong with me because all these ‚Äúfriends‚Äù shared negative opinions of me. 

Middle school, I wasn‚Äôt afraid to share my feelings, and that always led me to a sense of discomfort for the other person and they would stop associating with me. From my end, I was always confused as to why they stopped talking to me, realizing later that I had bonded with them too quickly, not vice versa. 

On a nightly basis, I felt like I had no one. It seemed like understood this feeling, this pit of emptiness within me. My life seemed to be a distraction to everyone else and a waste of time. I began to bottle up my feelings, I stopped talking to people unless they talked to me, and I became slow to trust others. I grew up in a cliquey environment, so my poor relationship with one person deemed me an untouchable for anyone else that they spoke to. It took me a long time to ever regain my own confidence, and it took me even longer to figure out what I had been doing wrong. Loneliness wasn‚Äôt just sitting at home on the weekends by myself, though that took up a lot of my time. It was laying in bed with pessimism. It was the recurring thought that nobody could do more wrong than I could, and nothing could change that except for the persona I adopted to try to get others to like me, which never truly worked. It was the feeling that any past mistakes I had made with others have already determined my future and prevented me from any human interactions that could ever be remotely beneficial to my social being. My imagination ran deeper and deeper as I stared at the ceiling night after night with tears temporarily staining my pillow. For a while I went to a therapist, but he decided that playing chess would be a better alternative than trying to figure out the solution to the mental void I was stuck in. 

My solution came in high school, because I just stopped caring. If people wanted to judge me, they could. If they wanted to be friendly, even better. Friends came, girlfriends came, lifelong memories came. I never felt better in my life after I accepted who I was 

Stop caring, let go. When you can find self acceptance, confidence comes with it. When you‚Äôre confident, nothing can stop you. The sun will come up when you stop paying attention to the moon. &lt;3",lonely,Be confident in yourself,2019-02-12 11:48:55

When I hear about someone passing away (and Lord forgive me for this)...I think what a lucky person they are to be free of this life unless its a child....of course. And yes, I sound terrible. But I'm so pissed. 
My coworkers are so happy with their families and spouses and I'm blessed with my two teens but I'm left alone with the burden to provide for all three of us and there's no money for fun. I just sit at home because it's all I can do to provide for us. Again, I'm blessed by my kids and love them immensely. I'm just frustrated and yes I'm being childish. But I had to let off some steam.

625,WintermadeLemonade,1549913675,1,"How would you describe happiness?

I get off the bus. A dirty old thing it was, barely managing to keep up with the chaotic rhythm of uptown traffic. It reeks of age, a stale smell that still stings, no matter how much you'd hoped you'd gotten used to it. And yet somehow I like that bus more than I'd care to admit. The doors hang open slightly, letting cool air in during hot summer days. Water has leaked between the two panes of windows, creating a makeshift aquarium - the mesmerizing shapes the water takes as the bus rumbles along uneven roads, the algae that's slowly creeping up the sides of the window giving it a vibrant green tint. The seats, dusty and matted from years of use, but as comfortable as your grandmother's gaudy old couch with most of its springs missing. Stickers and pins, some more than twice my age, adorn the driver's side of the bus. The regatta of 89, a simplistic shape of an ice cream cone that's no doubt a cut-out from an old magazine, a large ''Welcome!'' sign with its corners torn off and edges scratched. And sometimes, I even miss the smell.

It's like an old friend now. The years you spent together, going from place to place, seeing all sorts of things, through thick and thin. But from afar you can see that they're struggling. Their stride falls shorter, their voice coarsens, and every once in a while a rogue cough escapes their lips, no matter how hard they try to hide it. And you know that it won't be long now. Before something happens. I frown a bit, as I see it leave the station, sputtering and grumbling all the way. To feel this way about a bus seems a bit weird, I admit. But that's alright. 

I decide to rest a little on the station bench. A rare quiet moment creeps up on the otherwise fairly busy bus stop. Some passers by quickly walk along, paying no attention to me, or anything else for that matter, stuck deep in their own thoughts. A couple of pidgeons strut about, making their way to who knows where to do who knows what. A particular spot of ground seems to be cozy enough for them to stay put - the shade of the bench, sheltered from the ongoing rain. They preen their feathers for a while, giving me the chance to appreciate how pretty they look. One, brown all over, dappled with spots of darker brown and beige. The other, a mixture of deeper and lighter grays with a wonderful dim purple collar. And their eyes shining bright orange, like looking at a fading speck of flame. I freeze as I hear a sound I haven't heard in far too long. 

A pidgeon's coo. 

Such a simple thing, really. But even simple things can be profound in their own way. When I was little, every single day I'd use to wait for the bus at a nearby park. Though calling it a park would be exaggerating a bit. A yellowing patch of grass with a few raggedy chestnut trees. It was usual for flocks of pigeons to waddle around, combing the area for something to eat. I loved listening them coo and ruffle their feathers, watching them keenly as they made their way from one end of the park to the other. I used to stand under an old chestnut tree to wait for them to land, sometimes even missing the bus. I learned to think of them as friends. And they were always there, without fail. A constant in my life, like true friends are.

As usual though, you begin to change, to forget. And so I did. Years went by. The commute stayed the same. Rather than the pigeons who brought with them a sense of calm after a long and hectic day, I chose to stare blankly at nothing, turning off the outside world and falling into a deep haze of daydreams - or more commonly - dull, empty thoughts.

Now, hearing these two pidgeons cooing sweet nothings at each-other made me remember. Another old friend come to visit. For a second, I felt like I was back there, under that very same chestnut tree. For a second, I felt like a kid again. For a second, I felt loved. A feeling so unbearably foreign.

I take a look at my watch out of habit, not really caring if time goes by or not. Happy. I feel happy.

635,Pennyinthebox,1549892883,1,"My apologies for the ramblings of a fool but my chest weighs heavy with old and new pain and this stupid loneliness I have brought upon myself and inability to engage in normal conversations makes it harder for me to talk about it with others close or far from me. That is why I want to write it all down, this beautiful nonsense I call my life. I am not well versed in the English language thus my sincere apologies again.

I was born in 1980 in a small town in the Netherlands and my youth was filled with joy, parental love and happiness. We had not much but my father provided enough so that he, my mother, me and my older brother could live a simple, happy life. Those days are far behind me and I cherish those memories of old times. The time I was sitting on my nieces‚Äô her lap singing songs and when she stopped singing she would spread her knees apart so that I fell on the floor, laughing. When I did the groceries with my mother I put one candy in my pocket. I had to apologise to the shopkeeper in person when my mother found out. There were many painful memories as well. But you have to take the sweet with the sour. The sour in those days I do remember but never bother me in my old age. Parents fighting, brother teasing, dog biting, car running me over, almost drowning.
The usual kids stuff.

When I turned 13 or fourteen I started to asking questions someone of my age or any age of that matter must never ask but we all start asking anyway. Do I matter? Am I the best in anything? I forgot one variable in those days and I was in my late twenties when I understood my error. In my youth I believed that I was not on top of anything. I was and am not the fastest, never the smartest nor prettiest. I was never a good kisser nor the most romantic boyfriend. In everything I could not find anything I was the top of the class of.
I also thought that if someone loved another the other had to be the best in something. He is the cutest, she is the cuddliest, he is the strongest. How foolish I was to believe that because I am not the best in anything It is useless to search for love for to find love you must be the best in something.
If you, dear reader, want to learn one lesson from an old idiot Please learn this. A star shines when someone tells it shines. If someone tells you that you are the best kisser then you are the best kisser. And to find the one who tells you you are the best in something accept every heart that is given to you and feel love and be heartbroken many times. It is necessary to live. 

In my twenties I have closed my heart for any love. Yes, I had some one-night pleasures but not love. Even had a moment when I started caring for a young woman but never accepted her love and thus losing her. Even today I miss her but alas she is gone. From that moment on I doubted my rigid believe. But the damage was already done. I doubted myself, I doubted my abilities, I had trouble engaging in any conversation to express myself. I was gaining the believe that I could find love but lost confidence that I would ever find it.

Now I am 38 years old. Life has been kind and hard on me. The normal things a life will throw at you and you have to deal with.
I am a math teacher on a private school. I do not think I am a good teacher but I am adequate though. I know my students will forget me when they leave school. I am not that special or important. 
I care alot for my students and their wellbeing. I believe if you want to succeed your mind and heart have to be clear. A teacher has to work hard on those things. I listen to their grievings, their problems, their dreams, their joy.Then I try to teach them the math as good as I can. I try to learn them How to solve math problems by first exploring the problem, finding a plan to solve the problem and reflecting every step on the way. No manager or fellow worker is interested in What I do. They have their own work to do and problems to solve.  It is stressfull work but fullfilling.
My mood swings like a pendulum. Happy and angry. I fear students starts to hate my lessons or even me.

A few years ago because of my brothers‚Äô su√Øcide I again was confronted How important love is for he had none and could not vent his emotions. Burnout from work, doubt about the future and selfloathing Made him hang himself. Mind you, his passing never weighed heavy on my chest. I do not mourn for the dead. I cherish his memories that are close to my heart. I am not putting my head in the sand for I understand He has passed away. At the end we will all die.
And like My father always says: do not wait and pray for heaven you must work hard to make heaven here on earth. And at the end when you look back you can die happy.
I thought my home was heaven. Enough boardgames and computer games to enjoy for a lifetime. Music fills a warm and cosy living room. The scent of a well prepared meal like the Indonesian RengDang or Indian curries hangs in the air.
Now I notice:
When I bought my games they had te be played solitair.
When I play music it is to drown out the silene.
When I cook it is to eat my troubles away.
Now I notice how lonely I am.

And I want to change, I need to change for the sake of my own wellbeing. I want to meet others who understand this feeling because I know I am not alone in this. And maybe, maybe, maybe I will find that what I thought never would get.
One may dream of golden mountains but I want to search for them but I have no clue where to begin.

With much love,
Me

I feel this problem within me, brewing, even as time progresses it is haunting me. I feel like true happiness is not attainable for me because what I really desire is either not of this Earth or my need is greater than what I am capable of producing.

I‚Äôm aware of so many things now, I‚Äôm helping myself and fueling my mind as best I can to push past this grief, but the roots are there, deep in me and they don‚Äôt seem to ever leave. 

A girl recently came into my life who I was fond of for some time. We only text at the moment but I really do take an interest in her. To the point where it almost scares me? She‚Äôs intelligent, witty, has a very bright sense of humor and is very easy to talk to. I can‚Äôt help but feel if she shows any interest in me I will cave in, I‚Äôm worried I have to prove myself to her in a way.

I know this isn‚Äôt how relationships are but it‚Äôs what I perceive. I feel inferior to everyone I meet and thus I feel as if every friendship and relationship I may have will be a battle for me to prove my worth to them because my subconscious tells me they hate me and don‚Äôt want me around.

That‚Äôs what I feel now with this girl, she is superior to me and I have to constantly fight to make my presence needed. 

These feelings seem wired into me, if I end up in a relationship they will not leave and will drive me crazy. Because I refuse to tell anyone this is how I think or feel, I know I can‚Äôt open up and have to shelter these emotions until they either kill me or somehow I battle through them.

I don‚Äôt want to delve too dark but I feel as though it is destiny for me to end this, end this life, end this strife, end it all. Because this belief that I am inferior is always in me and eating at me. I can‚Äôt see past it, I sometimes feel worthy but there is always a voice in my head telling me that any meager semblance of self confidence is arrogant and doesn‚Äôt deserve to be expressed.

I know what the solutions are, I know what directions I should take. But because of what I am, it would all be a mistake. I would drag myself and everyone else down with my negativity if I were to express it and I do not want to be remembered in a negative light. So I must bottle it up and that will be the death me, so what can I honestly do? (No answer required there)

I long for a release, somewhere to be, something beautiful to see. But I feel it isn‚Äôt there.

The scariest part about it all is that loneliness is starting to not really identify as an emotion to m anymore, more so, just a trait of my character. I am built to feel this in any position I am, good or bad. And in a morbid way, I feel I deserve it. Maybe I was a bad person in a past life, maybe I have done too much bad already in my current one. 

I just wish I could be something different, something pure, something that wasn‚Äôt so burdened with cosmic inconsistencies and the battle between my heart and my mind.

We are coming to the final hours of my 22nd birthday.  I was really looking forward to today.  I've always had great birthdays, feeling loved by those closest to me.

&amp;#x200B;

This year was different.  Nobody cared.  I can count on one hand how many of my closest friends even acknowledged me today.  Everyone that I've grown up with, been friends with for 10 years, they didn't say anything.  Even my ex girlfriend, who I haven't talked to in two months, said something.  But not those that I have always considered closest to me.

&amp;#x200B;

This year has already been hard for me.  All my life, I have felt like I was always the afterthought, the one who was always forgotten when plans were made, etc.  I don't know what I did to deserve it.  But all those feelings would fade away on my birthday, when I realized people really do care about me.  All I really want is to feel like I am special to someone, but I've never really felt that.  Instead, I have always felt like I was just convenient.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't all bad though.  My parents and brother and his fiance came to my school and took me out to dinner at Red Lobster, my favorite.  It was fun.  I love my family a lot.  It makes me sad knowing I'll be halfway across the country in a few months for school.  I'll miss them a lot.  They have always made me feel special when nobody else would.  

&amp;#x200B;

People have sometimes said that birthdays don't mean anything when you get older, and more and more people will forget.  Maybe that's what has happened.  But apparently everyone forgot at once.  Life is funny like that, isn't it?  Billy Joel (the greatest songwriter of any generation, I will fight you on that) put it best: ""A man my age is very young, so I'm told.  Why do I feel so old?  Tell me why.""

I feel like that new year's meme with squidward. It's no special event anymore. I woke up, played video games, ate cake, cried, played more video games, procrastinated homework, and will go back to sleep at some absurd time for a normal teenager with school at 7:45 the next morning. So, I wanna talk about my problems. I like to be organized so I'll do it one by one, describing each and how they make me feel. First, being fat. I've always been insecure about my weight, and its grown ever so apparent how much it affects my life now. I'm only in high school and the road ahead isn't looking too great.

Anyway, being fat doesn‚Äôt just affect the non-existence of a dating life, it hinders everyday activities, brings death one step closer, and embarrasses me every chance it gets. I feel like I don‚Äôt look right doing anything. Sitting down and walking too. I end up trying to ignore others and keep my head down. People, especially at work, pinch my man boob nipples as some sort of joke. Yea, real funny. P.E.? Forget it. I can‚Äôt do half the activities in there. The least worrying thing to me is the health issues. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm quite obese enough for it to make a drastic difference, but I know it does. Problem numero dos: I‚Äôm introverted as \*\*\*\* and I can‚Äôt help but to stay silent most of the time. I am so anti-social the classmate that knew me the best thought I was asexual because of how monotone and boring I was‚Ä¶ ouch. I feel like my parents don‚Äôt know jack about me, and it‚Äôs partially my fault. But they never bother to ask or look into the things I do tell them about. They simply don‚Äôt care so I stopped telling them anything. What do you mean how was school? It was the same boring \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* as yesterday! What would you care anyway if -------- and some girl had a fight? You don‚Äôt know them. I really despise those questions. The I-don‚Äôt-actually-care-about-your-day-but-I-have-to-pretend-to kind of questions. Or a lot of the times when I‚Äôm tired and people ask me really rhetorical questions I answer sarcastically. Probably shouldn‚Äôt but they infuriate me. Problem three: What does the future hold? My grades have started slipping. I think it‚Äôs a combination of my work getting harder and me starting to care less and less. I don‚Äôt have a plan for when I get out of high school. Maybe I‚Äôll follow my dad and -------, it‚Äôd be easier. Or I did take some interest in being an ATC. Literally everyone I‚Äôve talked to that has taken the test for it didn‚Äôt make it though and I‚Äôd have to move to Oklahoma for a month or two. I'm still not good at doing things on my own, my mom babied me for a long time. Suddenly she‚Äôs like ‚Äúgo get some groceries‚Äù but I‚Äôm like I don‚Äôt \*\*\*\*\*\*\* know how to pay for \*\*\*\* and frankly I don‚Äôt wanna be seen in public anyway. Back to occupations, what else interests me? Uhhh, Rubik‚Äôs Cubes, aviation, computers. So let's knock em down one by one. There‚Äôs no way to make a career out of solving cubes. The field of aviation is a lot more hard work than it is interesting. Computers is way too competitive of a field and it‚Äôs too much education wise for something so iffy. So, where do I stand right now in my life? I feel lonely, I feel like I will end up getting a job I‚Äôm miserable doing, and I‚Äôll never have the mental strength to overcome any obstacles including being fat and everything else. It feels nice materializing these thoughts. It won‚Äôt change anything though. ",lonely,So much for that 99.99%...,2019-02-11 15:37:03

669,ReetoJun_vas_Shellen,1549830915,1,"2 years ago I made good close friends for the first and only time. It was great. Having people who care about you and appreciate the care you give for them.

All good things must come to end however and it did. Even though I live in the same town as them and even get educated at the place we just fell apart. No fight, no argument, just faded.

They made new friends. And I tried to. I really did. 

I used to be extremely abrasive and convinced friends and romantic partners were just a waste of time and brain power. Extra responsibility that would distract me from what I wanted to do and cry and whine about shit that's making them upset and constantly get in my way and judge me and also expect me to do things for them. My friends convinced me otherwise so now I thought I could be a new person and I would have no trouble making new friends if I was just a kinder and more approachable person

So that's what I did. I treated people with respect and joined in on conversations without being rude. I stopped insulting people so frequently and I made personal sacrifices for others thinking they would do the same for me. And would they bollocks. 

Its been nearly 2 years and I haven't got anyone that could be considered more than an acquaintance who talk to me during college and that's it. They all hang out without me and that's... Not bullshit really. They don't have to be my friends but they are the closest I have to such yet I hardly have a presence in their minds.

I've been trying yo hold onto my ""humanity"" as it were and stay kind and respectful. But I just feel hollow. Maintaining this fake smile is too much work for people who don't deserve it so I'm going to embrace it.

People are a distraction and of I want to accomplish my degree I need to focus on my work and I don't need """""""" friends """""""" for that. Just colleagues that can follow orders or listen to and make suggestions. I'm sick of spending too much time thinking about how nobody gives a shit about me and that no one messages me first and even when I message them trying to stop talking to me ASAP and I'm going to focus on what I want to do and what I want to accomplish without any retarded, dipshit meatsacks that wouldn't know their ass from their elbow if I didn't explain it to some of them holding me back.

If they want something from me they damn well work for it or get it from someone els because I don't personally give shit if it doesn't effect me

I've been debating this switch in attitude for a while hopefully this post can be seen as some form of closure for me.

702,sadandangry15,1549765280,1,"I'm a 16-year-old male who is attracted to quiet, smart, focused (for the lack of a better word), and generally introverted quirky people. I'm often told that I have really weird or odd tastes in girls and most of the people I've had relationships with or investment in are people who others call unattractive or unnoticeable. However, on the flip side, I am a two-sided person. 

On the inside in my personal life (AKA everywhere outside school), I've been depressed since 3rd grade and considered an outcast up until the last two and a half years while my whole life I've pushed my parents away from me because they don't understand my mental problems evident by my sister also being depressed but they won't let her go to therapy or be treated, (the ""you're fine"" type of parents). As a result, I've grown up deceptive and secretive to my problems always **appearing** happy while pushing everyone away (from a personal and emotional standpoint at least) and feeling alone like no one has ever understood me. As for the cherry on top, for elementary school, I went to a private Catholic school and thus most of my natural behavior has been oppressed by the authorities around me causing me to be the rebellious outcast I mentioned earlier. 

While on the outside, I've always been an energetic loud-mouth extrovert who can't stop socializing with others. That may sound contradictory to what I previously said, but my whole life I have had personal life problems while seemingly not been able to stop socializing. It is important to note that this socializing is only limited to being friends who play video games and play at recess, there was nothing beyond that, no personal life talk or any signs of sadness shown. 

This almost marks me as someone depressed whos also an extreme extrovert always filling the room as the loudest one. However, in recent years, I've become significantly more depressed despite being a successful person. This has caused me to amplify my extroverted side into becoming almost carefree and reckless. However, you might be able to see that that reckless and extroverted side of me literally repels those that I'm attracted to. As I previously mentioned I'm super attracted to kinda oddball, quirky, introverted, and smart people. But this fundamentally contradicts the personality I possess. While the fundamental way I interact with people is detached, low maintiance, and care-free, how can I have ANY chance with people that fundamentally think and look at the world differently?

That one introverted, smart, quirky but quiet girl mannerly sitting in the back listening to the lecture intently that barely talks with anyone in the class?

Together with the loud-mouth extroverted, vulgar, care-free, forthright guy that's always sitting with his chair backwards and ear-buds in his ear taking up all the room in the class?

*Simply Unheard of*

&amp;#x200B;

And to elaborate, I'd rather have a meaningful relationship than just some fling. That's why I've been off the saddle, its cause all the girls that are interested in me just annoy me or wanna have sex.

That brings me to the conclusion that I simply scare off the type of people I've been attracted to all my life, and I have no idea what to do about it. These two sides of me have been with me all my life.

And to be completely honest, I really am not attracted at all to girls that are like my introverted side.

I have taken that literally. Writing is my passion. I‚Äôve written so much in terms of my life, fiction, my fantasies that I want. 

Once I became an alcoholic, it made for an even better story, I said. I‚Äôll be the one to make it through this addiction and be a role model and someone that others can learn from.

Well, I made it through. I had 19 months of sobriety, lost it due to pills and alcohol, and here I am again, sober once again, got through another wave.

It‚Äôs different though. I don‚Äôt feel like a role model. I actually feel like a bunch of nothing right now. I‚Äôm sitting here typing this in a completely dark room completely numb to it all. Drinking sounds like such a better option right now than this.

716,carlos376798,1549732366,1,"Hello I‚Äôm a 19 year old kid with a lot of dreams and ambitions, when I was in high school I had a lot of strong negative feelings towards school, I wanted to drop out but instead worked hard enough to graduate early. After high school I became a freelance videographer, it was the one thing I was truly passionate about, making videos. I was just starting so I didn‚Äôt have many clients..my family didn‚Äôt really believe in me and were making it pretty clear I was a disappointment to them for not going to college. For a year it was a constant struggle between trying to make my business grow and proving my parents wrong, I constantly kept getting kicked out and had to spend A lot of time living at my sisters house, not to mention I had gotten a dog as a dream of mine that no one really wanted but I never gave up or lost hope. By this time all my other friends and classmates were about to graduate so I decided I‚Äôll give college a try to at least be able to start at the same time with my classmates. 
Long story short it was a really bad experience for me, I truly did try but college is just not a place for me so I dropped out of all my classes on the first semester. This time I came back and joined my dads business doing AC work, the arguing continued but at least I had a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job. 
I saved up enough money and before I knew it, I had enough money to move out, out of instinct I naturally moved out pretty fast. This happened pretty fast and almost unbelievable, I remember taking the day off work for my move in date, driving to my apartment closer towards the city with a car full of boxes and stuff sunny day playing ‚Äúsend me on my way‚Äù by rusted root. I thought about how I‚Äôll wake up and make eggs and drink orange juice while jamming out to music like I used to when my parents weren‚Äôt home. I‚Äôve always had a lot of positive moments like this, it‚Äôs what kept me going.  I remember thinking my home would be a safe place for me, my dog and all my friends, and for a moment I guess it was, it was definitely a new experience.

 It‚Äôs now been a few months living here on my and the holidays have passed. 
I gotta say it‚Äôs pretty different than I had imagined. I wake up every day pretty depressed and lonely, I feel like I‚Äôve isolated myself from everyone... I live on my own and go to work with the same guys, I can‚Äôt really meet anyone new like I wish I could. I know some things have to change but I even started my freelance videography business again and business has been doing better than ever but if I‚Äôm being honest it now seems like I‚Äôm just grabbing for anything to spark up that joy I had, I find myself wanting to cry a lot but not being able to, there‚Äôs days where it all suddenly comes out really hard and that usually feels really good. I‚Äôm trying to get back into dating because I could use it, I haven‚Äôt been in a real relationship after a tough breakup almost two years ago, but shit that gets harder as you get older, and anyone that‚Äôs been on a dating app knows how much those are bullshit. Every time I get close to going on a date I get stood up or ghosted, now to be rude or anything but girls can be assholes sometimes especially to guys with big ass hearts. I want to try and meet new people but everyone that‚Äôs ‚Äúout in the world‚Äù are much older than me and anyone my age are either in school or idk doing their own thing. Imean I did it I moved out with my dog closer to the city, me and my parents relationship is better than it has ever been, I‚Äôm growing with my dream job etc. but I‚Äôm just not happy or satisfied. 
And I keep trying to fill that satisfaction and I know that‚Äôs such a dangerous phrase to say, and I‚Äôm just fucking scared. 
I‚Äôm lost and I‚Äôm scared and I‚Äôm more alone than I have ever been in my entire life. 
I‚Äôm learning, I‚Äôm learning to appreciate. I‚Äôve always struggled with mental health my entire life but I‚Äôve always come out winning. Sure this is the hardest one I‚Äôve had to face, but I‚Äôm learning. To appreciate my family more, to appreciate the present more, my youth, and to know that there‚Äôs still plenty left in my life, I‚Äôm scared that this age will affect my future in a negative way but I don‚Äôt know I still have a lot to learn I guess I just wanted to get all of this off my chest, is this a normal thing in life?

Please bear with me.

I'm kind of the exact opposite of lonely. I'm male, 39, happily married for the past 10 years, have two children, businessman with my own construction company, backpacker, motorcycle rider, gamer, DnD player, with many tight close friends I meet every week for beers, games, bbqs.

Whatever. None of that would have been possible if I hadn't spent about 2 years when I was 18-20 by myself, searching for meaning in my life, and in life in general. Doing meditation, yoga, martial arts, introspection, therapy, and anything I could get my hands on, that would help me understand how the fuck I work, what are the inner workings of my mind.

Lots of people helped me back then, and I learned how to be helped and ask for help. So when I got here my first reaction was ""wow, some of these people don't know some really basic shit"". And really I can't blame you. There's basic stuff about being human that is not taught on schools. Society expects you to know so much stuff that nobody teaches you. 

I'm not trying to erect myself as some Master PhD or teacher, let alone a therapist. But I'm pretty sure if you need help, I can come up with something, a tiny thing, that would help in some way or another. Tiny things lead to small things, and so on and so forth.

So, this is me, offering to help you. No catch. I don't care about your sex or orientation or race or age. I don't want anything in return. I was helped when I needed it, so maybe this is my chance to pay that back. If you wanna take me up on my offer, shoot me a PM.

No one wants to listen to what I have to say, things I am passionate about and no one appreciates the knowledge I have in certain areas/subjects. I am a piece of meat. Seems like I am not worth anything more than that. 

Whenever I meet a guy he disappears after the sex even though I make him wait for up to like 6 months. I, myself feel like I am a good catch as I got the looks, intelligence, emphatic/caring personality and even humor but then why does no guy want to get to know me?
Every night I cry myself to sleep in a pile of text messages from horny men that just wants my body, every time I go clubbing I experience sexual harrasment to a scary amount, every time I try to make genuine friends I fail.
I live in a dysfunctional family where violence and alcoholism is common so I crave a lot of genuine love since I can‚Äôt get it at home.

My self worth has dropped to it‚Äôs end, I am losing hope and have been thinking about suicide for years now but I don‚Äôt think I can hold on any longer.

I am surrounded by so many people every day that praises me yet I am extremely lonely and depressed inside. No one sees my demons.

I just wanted to have this off my chest since I can‚Äôt tell anyone. Also I‚Äôd like to make a point clear for every girl out there that must be jealous of the ‚Äúpopular girl‚Äù: Popularity and beauty is not EVERYTHING, it‚Äôs overrated and it definitely doesn‚Äôt bring you genuine happiness but only a temporarily ego boost.

723,historyfetish,1549702574,1,"Well, I just wrote put a whole post and then accidentally deleted it. Thanks moble. 

I'm having a good bit of issues, if you want to take a look in my post history for some backdrop, though not all, be my guest.

I'm alone in my apartment for the first time in what feels like forever, roommates gone, BF gone. And I hate it. I've been largely alone all week.

 I was gearing up to open up to my BF tonight (it's his off day) and try to have his friends over and actually participate with them. The complete opposite has happened, he's partying at a high school friend's house hours away from here. I'm stuck at home, wondering what's wrong with me that I cant handle being alone, letting my bf live his own life, wondering why I wasnt invited. I don't know how to handle it. 

And yes, I know, I should be in therapy. I'm trying to get to therapy, but that doesn't happen on weekends.

I don't have the option of friends to talk to. I don't want to make my BF feel bad, because me being this way isn't his fault. The last of my friends from high school are gone, one was toxic and the others just ghosted me. I cant reach out to my boyfriends friends, because they always ask why I don't reach out to my boyfriend instead. All of my new college friends. . . We don't talk outside of class and I'm not in classes right now, so there's no one there anyway.

I'm feeling like the only person on earth right now, and I don't know what to do about it. I really don't. I have a phone app that tracks my emotions that I could use, but using AI can just make me feel more distant and alienated/isolated. ",lonely,Not sure how to handle my loneliness.,2019-02-09 19:56:14

I was so excited to finally be going on a date (I haven't been on a date for three years, not for lack of trying). She mentioned how her dog chewed up her makeup brushes a few weeks ago, and she can't buy new ones any time soon, so the night before I went to like 3 different stores trying to find the makeup brushes that she lost to her dog so that I could suprise her with them the next day. I spent a shitload of money. I got home that night, get in bed and couldn't sleep because I was so damn nervous and I was really hoping this could go well. I only ended up getting like an hour and a half of sleep because I was thinking about literally everything that I could do the next day to fuck it all up. When I woke up the next day, I noticed that she had posted on her Snapchat story a ton, but hadn't replied to my message where I asked her where she wanted me to pick her up. I shot her another text, and a few more in the few hours between when I woke up and when our date was supposed to be. She never answered. She never even opened the message.

also, i noticed smth else. this might sound dumb and childish but still... she didn‚Äôt follow anyone on instagram bc she didn‚Äôt like seeing other people‚Äôs posts. but now she started to follow the pple she hangouts with and the pple close w her. also she started to follow a girl ‚Äòwe‚Äô hate (they‚Äôre not close at all). she started following all these people except me. i know this sounds stupid &amp; childish bc not everything‚Äôs about ‚Äòfollowers‚Äô but like why? does she hate me? i didn‚Äôt do anything to her, i always ask how she is, how her day was, what she‚Äôs doing etc etc. i started to feel so lonely bc of all this.

I sometimes visit him and when I'm there he starts texting all the girls number he has, or calls some of them to show me, puts the loud speaker on .

If I don't visit he does and does the same thing.

760,Pink_Grey,1549635013,1,"Hi! This is my first post, I've been a lurker of reddit for a really long time and I was hoping to get some opinions! Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place, please let me know if so! 

Let me start off by saying I'm 18 I'm a woman and I'm a virgin, I've never had an actual relationship, I struggle with anxiety, OCD and an ED, all three of which control my life, but I make a huge effort to be friendly and get out there, but at times it seems no one really wants to have anything to do with me... I keep telling myself over and over: ""I just need to get out there, to meet new people, be patient.""
But everyday I feel more and more hopeless. I just want to meet new people and make friends. 

Honestly I had managed to cope with it until recently... I have 1 really close friend, and I hang out with her friend group because I'm lucky enough she includes me, she's my best friend and her friends are nice too.. but lately it seems like all they do is make fun of me for being a virgin. laughing and joking, purposefully asking me what certain sexual acts are to test how 'innocent' I am. I may be a virgin but I'm not stupid...
I know it's just a joke but it's yet another reminder that I'm alone and inadequate, when they start discussing and bragging about sex I feel so alone, I wish I could ask them to just stop the joking but I genuinely fear the confrontation, I don't want to lose them. 

Knowing I'm a virgin makes me feel like I'm less of a woman, like I'm a child, I feel so incompetent, I feel like even if I did have a relationship it wouldn't work because I can't be comfortable with someone, hell I can't even make new friends let alone relationships...

I don't know... part of me needs to know is it possible to meet someone who id actually be comfortable enough with? I'm just so scared to actually meet someone, if in fact anyone would want to meet me... 
Should I try harder to just be more comfortable so I can try and meet people and loose my virginity..? 
I'm so conflicted and I feel awfully pathetic and small, but I'm trying to stay positive, I just honestly want to meet nice new people who I can get to know without feeling pressured and uncomfortable.

Now , i do have friends, but most of them are far better known as just hi/bye friends.99% of the people i used to be somewhat close with have already left high school just like me and have carried on with their lives . Now , in college , ive made 2 good friends , but they too , i only see only during classes , and dont get to see them outside to hang out cause we‚Äôre not close enough to really hang out . Ive been struggling , literally feel so much of anxiety and depression because of my loneliness . I feel like the vibe that I tend to give is more of a ‚Äò i rather be alone dont talk to me / arragont , but to some that i do really talk to , they say im well spoken and nice , but not even ONE has had the desire to be close to me. I try my very best to wear a shield around me and not depend on anyone for happiness. Ive always been very very independent with my emotions and my craft , but i dont just want to live the rest of my life being alone at home all the time , and only being able to talk to my boyfriend/mom/ sister (now they‚Äôre not really here for me anyways )-about my life . How i wish i could find a true friend, that could be there for me when i need them , and for me to spend my life with . It doesnt even matter if i have a so called ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô because quite frankly ive never made any and it doesnt seem like i am making any .. but it just really sucks to be this way . My social media , somehow has a big following , i may look like im social , but in real life i am really lonely and miserable  .. I really do believe that if i live my life more , and explore more , i could be so much more productive and to never have to feel this void in me that I pretend to never affect me.

763,Leuhhhhh,1549629811,1,"I was told I don‚Äôt make a presence. It‚Äôs kind of been a theme in my life. I didn‚Äôt make much friends because of who I was when I was younger. I was lucky enough that no one really cared about me either tho. I was just there another part of the furniture. A background character to everyone else‚Äôs life. At my job it‚Äôs the same I could be gone for days and everyone forgets I work there even the managers to a certain extent obviously. I try to go above and beyond but just  don‚Äôt make an impact in people‚Äôs lives. I‚Äôve seen people all my life make such a great impact with people and make friends in new situations, just like that without a problem. I always wanted to be like that. I was always just  a loner kind of just wandering. I go to bars by myself eat at restaurant by myself. I celebrated my birthday by myself. I celebrate the few good news I get by myself. Go to parks by myself.Which is not bad but people do it because they want alone time, I don‚Äôt. I want a group of friends y‚Äôknow. I don‚Äôt get it sometimes.  My work promoted people and a lot of people started when I did. I put in a lot of hard work and put in a lot of hours. I did a lot for this company and I I got skipped for promotion and actually got demoted. Because they saw I‚Äôm better as a background cleaning and getting dirty then a in your face person.

764,Capnnipples,1549612717,1,"So I used to use Omegle like religiously to find Kik groups and make ""friends"" but now it's filled with bots and I think all the cool Kik groups are just gone. And I kinda suck at making friends at school. Or maybe I should clarify, female friends. Cause that's the part of me that's really lonely. 

I had 3 friends, but we had a falling out with one of them, so now it's just down to two friends, which has drastically reduced the group messages and meme content.

 So now that I have even more free time because me and my few friends don't talk much. I'm just feeling incredibly lonely again. Every time Valentine's comes up too I just remember how long I've been single and how long it's been since I've been able to hold someone intimately (I mean idek if cuddling is that intimate but damn is it nice). And it's just a super shitty feeling.

Also, I'm a college student, and I kinda try? To make friends in my classes. Usually I'll just try to strike up a conversation through the school email after I ask someone what I missed in class lol. I was talking to a girl for a minute but her boyfriend got jealous and made her stop talking to me -_- to be fair I probably would have tried to woo her eh eh eh. At least in my head lol. And I hit up another because she had a big chungus meme in her binder and I found one about it so I wanted to send it to her but in class she mentioned it and from that and her writing I got a strong low self-esteem/loner vibe from her. But I ended up emailing her again and I probably shouldn't have. If she doesn't reply by Monday I'm thinking of just sending ""well tomorrow is going to be awkward""

But so long rant short. I would like some other loner friends maybe? I dig music, memes, and nature. There is a lot of other stuff I'm interested in but those are key things for me. ",lonely,I miss when omegle had normalish people,2019-02-08 18:58:37
765,WhiteAsianHybrid,1549612090,1,"I have nothing to show for my life so far. Well, next to nothing. Nothing that matters to me. I feel like I don‚Äôt exist anymore, and the want(need?) for attention makes me feel like an attention whore child that needs other people to get along in life. I hate going to class and not existing. I have moved around my entire life, and while I have a few good friends, they have either moved away, I have moved away, or I have had fallouts with them, which is my current situation. 

I feel sick to myself when I feel a huge dopamine rush when someone asks me to do something for them, like picking up their pencil or letting them borrow a phone charger, I immediately feel bad after I realize that conversation will most likely never go past the few words that someone directs towards me asking for something.

I hate being a little bitch. I don‚Äôt want to admit that I feel upset or depressed, but it‚Äôs so hard to shake the feeling when I get home from a long day at school, where I accomplished nothing, because I am bad at studying and procrastinate. They say people who grew up trying wish they had fun, and people that grew up having fun wish they tried. I have done neither. I graduate high school in a few months (maybe), and I have no one. Nothing. I have plans, and I will move on eventually, I will force myself to if I have to, but I still hate it. I hate being here. 

If that isn‚Äôt bad enough, I actually have had special people in my life, but I would fuck up her life or she would fuck up mine, the problem is, both of these times I have been the cause, or I have been able to prevent it. 

I don‚Äôt actually think I‚Äôm horribly hideous or have a bad personality, I mean I‚Äôm negative as you can see by the post above, but I try to care about things that matter. My parents, my little sibling are the only light in my life. I enjoy making and listening to music to ease up the burdens of life, but this only makes things worse. If I knew I had absolutely nothing to offer, I would just off myself and be done with it, but I still feel like I have something worth having, I don‚Äôt know what but I‚Äôm TRYING at least to move forward and accomplish. 

Honestly I have thought that after I‚Äôm out of the house I should just get some alcohol, drugs, and hookers, because I have pretty much given up on people. I care dearly about them, much too dearly, but they do not care about me. I know this is just life, but for whatever reason it is the hardest thing for me to process.

but lately it's been more than just that. i suspected i might have fallen for one of those people from the start, but now it's pretty sure. 

i'm in an art school, and we usually do lots of art projects, and this person stopped by my desk and sat next to me while i was working and complimented my project, they also asked a few questions about it (man i was so nervous). too bad the teacher got into the class just as all of this happened, haha.

yesterday i was sitting at a desk next to them and as i was taking notes i forgot how to write out of nervousness.

and today i fucked up by forgetting to say ""thank you"" after they passed me some paint for art class lol (i got detached from reality for a second, i guess it's true when people say love can make you dumb)

Except....i have no friends and the ones i have are so fake.
I got excited this week because someone asked to hang out with me. They needed help on something that had to do with an old hobby of mine I‚Äôve been too depressed to continue. I was so excited i even started working on my own stuff. It was really nice and i felt like my old self for a bit. I realized later that they were there for selfish reasons. They were very nice throughout the whole thing and it came out great and really helped my mood at the time but.... they wont text me back. They read the messages and say nothing. Whenever i had asked for help on the same thing they had stood me up. Then i heard them say that if it hadn‚Äôt been ‚Äúcrunch time‚Äù they probably would have done it again. They also act superior to me a lot when i have 10 years experience in this hobby and they have 3 and don‚Äôt make any of their own things. Its even weirder because they act like they‚Äôre a pro but they cant actually do any of the technical parts of it. They‚Äôre just charismatic so people latch on to them easier.

It makes me feel horrible. Ive been inviting them to participate with me since middle school and we are in our 20s now. It feels like no matter how often i go out of my way for people it never matters.

Or am i selfish for wanting that returned affection? That feeling of someone comforting them and wanting to be around? The only person i have in my life is my boyfriend and he has asd so it is harder to feel that affection reflected back even when he tries.

773,easylifelonely,1549598760,1,"I'm genuinely sad/depressed because my life seems too fucking easy; I hate it so much and unfair to others. I grew up from a middle-class family, but I decided to invest in cryptocurrency three years ago. After Bitcoin came shooting up in price, I decided not to pursue school anymore due to wealth. So, I decided to learn cryptocurrency trading and I day traded over two years every single day. It was wake up, trade, eat, sleep and repeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, since I grew up as a middle-class family; everyone in the family tree is like WOW! Who's this wealthy boy. They all want to use me as their ""sugar daddy"" suddenly when I grew up they weren't supportive at all. You don't know how much pressure they put on me when I'm near the '20s and tell me I should buy a house for them to flex to their friends; Meanwhile, I barely have any except 1-2 because I fucked up in Life and I want to cry because I can't since it's my fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fucked up &amp; I hate life because I am an introvert and has low blood pressure, have migraines now, and then, that feels stupid because I'm not going to school like my old friends/normal friends since I don't have the grades to apply for a good university. You guys might think this; My life is way better than yours. Not when you don't have friends, low blood pressure like when you wake up feel light-headed, sometimes faint/blackout out of nowhere or feel utterly weak. I have a luxury car and such, but I don't want to be a dickhead to society and spend money on a Ferrari because I have no friends to show to. And feeling stupid while being dumb rich is worse because one of my family members is the smartest person in computer science in one of the universities when he talks to me. It's like what the fuck are you talking about Or makes my mind GO BOOM.

Last Year, When I found the love of my life despite there were so many red flags about her, and I got rejected due to her having a boyfriend, and she confessed a day later while having a boyfriend?! ( Oh fuck no. ) After that everything went down... I lost almost all my friends and still lonely with no girlfriend to the present day ( today ), and I tried to day trade; the day after I got rejected, I lost everything 90% of the amount I invested ( It was about 5% of my money ) because I forgot to triple check my selling price, I enter 1, less zero.

For example, I sped down a street at 100 km/h in a 50 zone, and I pulled up beside a police car. At that moment, I thought I was fucking toasted but nope! I didn't get caught for some reason, and I don't know why. I just smiled and waved at him, and he nodded.

What does being stronger mean to you? What is your reason to win? Why at times, you cannot feel love but only anger and hatred? Where are you actually going? Why are you so afraid of life, but excited for death? Look at yourself in a mirror and ask, who are you?

My answer for all of you is: 
1) Being stronger is not a reason or a teaching, but a passion for who and what you want fight for.
2) ""What is your reason to win?"" That question is irrelevant. But more, what is your reason to lose?
3) You only feel anger and hatred because you want to understand but you also choose to ignore. You confuse yourself too much, that you cannot see the love in front of you.
4) Learn from what happened from your past, no matter how dark. Do not think, but feel. Even if you don't know, just take the next step to move towards the future.
5) We are all afraid of life, there is no shame in that. But if you choose to keep on running away from life like a coward, you will always have fear in your heart and in the end, the only option is to throw it all away. Therefore, you will never be strong. But you must know that even though you think that you are nothing, there are other people that see in you as something.
6) ""Who are you....?"" That is answer that you are going to have to figure out yourself. But I can help you a little bit with this. You are a person that wishes to learn from the past, in order to become stronger in the future, even if it is small. As long as you give your best, it will mean so much more.

I hope this helps you, even if it is a little bit. If you guys ever feel alone, don't. Because there are so many people that care so much about you. All you have to do is just see the love in front of you. And that is something that makes you stronger! ",lonely,Something I've been wanting to say to those who are down today.,2019-02-08 10:10:36

797,litbydayclitbynight,1549567984,1,"I guess it'd be limited to two or three but we talk to each other once in a month or so. It's pretty much same like others- I am an introvert, have been depressed for quite a long time which has decreased my productivity, fucked up my studies and increased my libido (idk if that sounds weird). My taste in music is different from people around me, I play only the CS:GO game, read books but suck at writing and if I have to speak (presentation in class or a similar activity) it makes me cry (idk why). For the last seven years people have been making fun of me and even I make fun of them but somewhere I don't know why I get hurt when they don't really intend to hurt me. 

Also I cannot fight back. It's the worst quality I've. I mean why the fuck in hell and heavens can't I just fight back and hurt people. This world deserves the storm that it gets. I know being too nice is just going to crush me. I try to man up ( I think that's the word) but I fail. I fail miserably every single time I try to do that. 

And it's one of the reasons I don't want to be committed to someone or get married and rejected even the ones who loved me. Because I have to provide the girl/women safety, save and rescue her from the demons but how do I guard someone else when I can't do it for myself ? How do I fight someone else's devil when I can't fight my own ones ? And besides that I don't earn so I can't take her out for a lunch or dinner date and shopping ( I mean women love shopping) or surprise them. 

Pretty much same with the friends. I can't fight for a friend and what kind of a friend would I be if I don't fight for him and help him when he need me? Why would someone befriend me when he knows I won't be able to help him in the bad times ? You can't just be with him only when it's the happy times. Friends share happiness and help in crisis. 

And I'm doing nothing to make my life better but writing this stupid post which some of you who I won't ever come across are going to read ( or maybe not as it's too long). 

Moreover I don't look good either. And as if that's not enough, I'm an empath. My MBTI type is INFP. So you can imagine now how much I can feel and overthink. Even the tiniest bit of a shit which shouldn't even matter to me would burn a hole in my heart. 

And the mother of all of this ‚Äì I'm cursed with being able to fuck up any situation or conversation in like 2 seconds flat. 

I know life is beautiful. I have a zest for it. But it doesn't seem to get better and by the time it'd get better, I guess it'd be too late. I'm just holding on to it for my parents. I know that all they have is me. And so I just want to give them every moment of happiness and joy that they deserve. I just want to be here until they're here making sure it's peaceful.

All that mattered was that in that moment or two, I lacked at something. I'm the one that needs to go to therapy to fix myself, or the one that needs to take things less seriously, or the one that needs to have sex more often, or the one that has to put my duties aside in order to make them happy, or the one that needs to spend more time with them after I'e finished a 12 hour shift. And the worst part? Knowing that you really gave it your all, and really enjoyed your time through the ups and downs, just to have someone criticize you and then ignore you. I can't understand how someone can say they love you one day, to loathing you and never wanting to hear from you the next. I just really can't. Sometimes I feel like a leaf blowing in the wind, where occasionally someone will recognize its beauty before letting it float away, and the rest of the times it'll just be swatted away.

799,Chad_Bonago,1549564618,1,"I am almost glad this sub exists, because it keeps people away from stuff like niceguys, MGTOW, and incels (and the female and non-binary equivalents, I am not sure what they are though). These are cults that prey on vulnerable people and rob them of any hope.

Anyway, I am a lonely person who really wants to be in a relationship to ""fill the void."" But at the same time I realize that filling the void is not the same as loving someone. 

I found this article which gives some perspective:

[https://byrslf.co/is-it-love-or-are-you-just-filling-a-void-mastering-aloneness-and-creating-a-real-relationship-1d57f990fe31](https://byrslf.co/is-it-love-or-are-you-just-filling-a-void-mastering-aloneness-and-creating-a-real-relationship-1d57f990fe31)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, it's really hard to know what ""real love"" is when you spend so much time pitying yourself. I am in a transitory stage where I am part self pity and part trying to take care of myself. I understand that many of you are in the exact same place, or worse. Its hard when people say ""just love yourself"" because it feels like they're invalidating all of our emotions and attitude up until this point. I still feel this resentment sometimes.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, all I wanted to say is that you guys and gals and xals are not alone, we are together in our loneliness. Just try to have hope everyone, even when it feels like there is not. It's exhausting, it's disheartening, and it's downright infuriating.

But I usually try my best not to seem too overboard? I have really bad anxiety, actually training service dog now for it, which is really nice. He's the cutest little Malmute ever.

Anyways, since I went to a lot of different schools as a little kid, I never really bothered getting close to people because I knew id move in 3 months. So when i finally got to high school and I was told that we would be here for a few years, I was pretty happy!  I met a girl named Lauren who seemed nice and we got along really well. I also met a boy named Rory and his girlfriend Destiny. I liked these kids a lot. They were really awesome to hang around. But eventually they stopped inviting me to things and I didn't understand why. 

They'd post things on Instagram, they'd brag about what a fun weekend they had in front of me. One day I decided to pm Rory, and asked him why I wasn't being invited to things. I asked him to be honest, because I genuinely didn't understand. 

Now I dont remember exactky what he said but it went down like this... M= Me, R= Rory

M: Hey man, been wondering why you havnt been inviting me to things lately. Please be honest.

R: well, Lauren and Destiny just kind of thought you were a weird kid? To be honest, it's like walking on eggshells around you

(I didn't understand why it would be walking on eggshells around me. I barely talk most of the time) 

M:  what do you mean?

R: you're just really annoying and we keep you around because we don't really want to be rude?  but that's really it. 

M: oh. K.

At this point I was pretty mad, and basically heartbroken, because i started to realise thag they weren't  laughing with me when they made jokes about me, they were laughing  at me this whole time. saying things to my face Like ""you look like an anorexic 12 year old"".  Which they knew I had those medical issues because of an abusive parent. 

I took a few days offline after that, because my aunt had died the same week, and we were really close, so I didn't go to school for a little bit either. 

When I got back, I had neglected to straighten my hair, so i left it curly that day. I sat in class away from everyone else and Rory walks in. I put my headphones on and looked away from him. 

I see him signalling to my headphones and talking so I take them off. 

""Did you get a haircut?"" He asked. At this point, I had two options. Basically let them keep laughing behind my back and treating like I'm not a person, or to have some self respect. I look away from him and ignore him and everyone else in that friend group for the rest of the year. 

I just wish I had said something to him. Out of everyone I think he was the only one who felt bad about how they treated me. 

Ended up leaving that school a year later, and met some new people in my first year of University. (This year)  I just hope they become better friends.

I have a small group of friends that I go see movies with, jam together with, and take classes with. But I feel as though there's been some kind of barrier between the three of us since our groups inception. I constantly feel left out, or like I'm not being included. Even during group activities. Of course, friendships should never feel formulaic in any way. But I can't help but feel like that's the best way to describe it. It's almost like they feel like they have to be friends with Me sometimes. Although I'm sure that's nonsense. Apart from spending time with My best buddies, I pretty much hang out with Myself. I practice guitar for hours in My bedroom and don't come out until dinner, I skateboard at the end of My street by Myself, and I write stories, poetry, and lyrics to anything and everything. There's a certain sort of closure that comes with being all by Yourself. And it's not a bad thing. But I can't help but feel like having friends can be more trouble than it's worth sometimes.

I forget entire conversations i have with people. There are even people that ive met, and when they approach me, they are total strangers yet they know my name, my job, my age, where I live etc.

I even forget things I explicitly do. It's like there's someone fucking with me on a hourly basis. My keys are in my shoes, my wallet is in my pillow, or my socks will be tied together. 

And I know im the one doing it. Idk why. But i never remember doing it.

Since my ex was fucking other dudes, i thought she was just fucking with me. 

But now I have a full time job and i live with my girlfriend.

But I feel like I'm living a lie. None of them know how truly fucked I am. I should have told her sooner. But i didn't. And i cant tell her now.

830,IndependentHS,1549469217,1,"Hello out there! 

This is my first every Reddit post - so yay :)

I am a 29y old from London. I was in a long term relationship between 21 and 26 - It was my first ever relationship and it ended quite badly! It was very toxic for a number of reasons which I didn't really understand or see at the time. He had a major drinking problem which I wasn't aware  of until we moved in together 1.5years later. He was American and came over here to be with me, so getting out of it was a little harder for me than just walking away (not sure if that makes sense). Anyway, it doesn't matter now, but the trauma really affected me. And I only notice how much it affected me now I am 'trying' to date again. 

To deal with the break up, I put all my energy into developing myself in my work, fitness, mental health, spiritual health- opened a business and I am doing well for myself. I developed my personality, and am just about to buy my 1st property with a healthy deposit so I feel like I am proud of myself. 

My issue is: I don't know where or how to meet people. Females for some reason just don't like to approach me, I try and pay compliments when I see fit females or women doing well at networking events etc. But that is where it stops! I don'talk about my work at all because I have experienced some people act funny around me so I modestly say I work in consultancy. 

In 2018 - I did try and 'date' again after the break up in 2015 - I met someone who was smart, and educated and successful in their career - so we 'dated/got to know each other' for approx 4 months. Nothing physical because I am not sure I am ready yet. But, meals, coffee, just being social and adventurous. I was trying to get to know him without too much emotion from sex getting in the way. A clear head because I am trying to date with the intention of marriage and not just fun! 

In the end, I ended it. Because within 3 weeks he had declared love for me and actually contacted my parents to ask for my hand. I had told him about my past and that I needed to take things very slow. I communicated on various occasions that I was looking for date for 1 to 2 years before the talk of marriage really solidified. And he respected that (from what he said) and agreed. I feel like I was open with all elements of how I was feeling with him. When I would get anxiety attacks they would usually be from him pushing me to the 'next level' so quickly. For example, he found out where I lived online, and send me roses and lilies. Which I guess can be cute and a little freaky at the same time. I went with the former after speaking to some gf's - but then the gifts and flowers kept coming. At least once a week. He also had something to say after everything I said. Everything. I couldn't understand it. It was like he was competing with me with knowledge. And I told him many times - you don't have to have an eho with me. Take me as I am and I will do the same. I am not your enemy. But he said, he just liked to share his opinion. (All theeeee time)! 

I was suffocated. And the pressure was too much for me to deal with. Especially as he wasn't listening when I was saying, please slow down. When things ended, he actually said to me - You are so independent, if you don't lighten up you will be alone forever. Which I thought was just a reaction to him being hurt maybe. Sometimes men can be really spiteful when they don't get their way. 

My dilemma - All my gf's are married with kids. And housewives. Which is a full time job and I respect them for it. But as a result, I travel alone around the world. All the time. I try and meet people when travelling. But 98% of guys I meet on my travels think this will end in a hookup and its not subtle. The girls tend to be with their bf's so not third wheeling. I end up just chilling alone, or talking to 'older' people - 50's and above. Which is lovely, but sometimes I just want to have a conversation with someone from my age range! 

My parents keep saying my time is going and I need to meet someone. My last single mate is getting married next month and I know in her culture she needs to adapt to the family home so I probably wont be able to see her as much! 

How do any of you independent single ladies deal with loneliness? Just having a good conversation with someone. I work from home so that is another challenge and adds to the isolation. 

I am trying to be 'open' to meeting people - but I dont want to use Tinder etc. I may be in the Millennial Bracket - but I like old school courting!

831,Last_Exit_To,1549464173,1,"So, I've been feeling very lonely and depressed lately. The reason is that my best friend told me that she will get married and move to a different country. That means that we can't see each other anymore because I don't have money to travel to see her. 

She has been the closest friend I ever had. We have had so many good times together. We have traveled together and told each other everything. She has been more closer to me than my previous girlfriends. She is basically like a sister for me. Her leaving just makes me devastated. Nobody will be like her to me. I know that whatever happens, I won't find anybody like her again. I just know that I'll be constantly lonely when she's gone.

840,nazzy72,1549426399,1,"I will try to make this post as short as possible
First of all, I very easily fall in love, and to my demise, I fall in love with girls who are unavailable to me(not necessarily meaning they are in a relationship). I have this awful quality-looks are very important to me. I've had the worst time of my life when I started to develop feelings to an objectively not very good girl and person,and she wasn't even attractive,so I'm very inconsistent. And my best friend at the time(former best friend now) knew that I liked her. And he had sex with her. Many times
In a park and on a rooftop. At the time I was going to a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with schizotypal disorder. Basically,symptoms of schizophrenia but not as severe. And I was on meds that didn't help at all and tried jumping at a car and that same asshole saved my life. How surprising.

I also have a girl friend, let's call her Kate,who I got acquainted with by my other friend who was in a relationship with her at that time. After awhile,I started realising I really liked Kate,but I didn't let her boyfriend-my friend-know.
And so he needed a place he could have sex at.
And that place turned out to be my house. Again, multiple times. Obviously I felt like shit,but my friend thought it was because I had an inferiority complex of being a virgin,which to an extent,was true. It was only after quite some time I let him know my true feelings for Kate,and he said he was sorry,he said didn't want to treat me this way,but he continued. Due to some circumstances (those circumstances not relating to me) they had to make a pause in their relationship,basically like a short-term breakup with the intent of getting together after some time. I tried forgetting Kate and tried getting a girlfriend. Luckily, a perfect opportunity came:my other friend got me acquainted with his girlfriend's friend. That was my first and only relationship and it lasted 24 days(yes,I counted). Turned out to be a very shit relationship,so I broke up with her. After the breakup I saw Kate for the first time in a couple months and realised that POSSIBLY I didn't have feelings for my girlfriend-I had feelings for Kate. That day I had to meet Kate face to face for the first time to discuss some of our problems. We hung out for a couple hours and then Kate had to meet with her ex-boyfriend,my friend,and at the end of the day the three of us were supposed to meet. And when I saw them,they were holding hands again. That made me very sad. On one hand, I was obviously happy for them,because they are my only two friends-my best friends.  On the contrary, it isn't very pleasant to have your best friends have sex with the girls you like,all within period of a month.

 and I recently moved to the US to study. I am doing very well academically,but the problem is in my social interactions. Schizotypal disorder includes social anxiety and I have that to a maximum level:when I even think about approaching someone,I feel as if I'm having a panic attack. This disorder also makes your facial expressions look very poor so I look repelling to others. I haven't been to a psychiatrist in half a year,but my medication is helping me now. Psychotherapy is meant to help with social situations,but I won't be getting that for almost two more months. Although I stay with my relatives here, I feel like I don't have anyone here. My only friends are on another continent and I am here left to myself. Sit in my room all day where I study,cry,and jerk-off. 

I've been listening to the same song for a week straight-almost all day, non-stop. It's called 'true love waits' and it is pretty self-explanatory. I think about two things while listening to it:
1) Kate
2) How not a single person in this planet is capable of loving a shizoid
I think I should end here.

I have known some of these people online for 3 or 4 years now and they are some of my best friends but all our chats started to gradually die as time went on. The last of the closest ones to me are slowly coming online less and less and we are talking nowhere near as frequently as before. I wish things were just back to how they were when we would send hundreds of messages every day and or call every day and just fuck around playing Minecraft or whatever. I just want to spend time with them again.,lonely,The last of my friends are drifting away,2019-02-06 09:25:56

So I adopted a dog from a no-kill shelter, for times when I don't have my kids.  He doesn't judge me and is happy to see me (or he just wants a treat).  Either way, his wagging tail makes my day better.  
It would still be awesome to have a person just ask me how my day went. Or just say hi.  But since that is obviously fantasy, I'll settle for my dog.  ",lonely,Dogs are better than people,2019-02-06 07:28:59
854,throw_away_whiner,1549390287,1,"In an effort to try and do more interesting things, I went to keystone over the weekend. Snow was pretty icy, but thought I'd try and enjoy it anyway. Better than just hanging around my place by myself doing nothing. Was really crowded Sunday morning. Sharing chairs with other small groups here and there. They pretty much all have their own conversations going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get to the top of the outback lift, and sit down to strap in. As I'm doing this, I notice this couple getting off the lift, being very flirty. Playfully pushing each other. I spend a few moments just kind of low-key eye them with envy. Being reminded of what I don't have.

&amp;#x200B;

I then head off into the wooded area. A lot less crowds there. The terrain is tricky, and I'm not handling it nearly as gracefully as I'd like to. At one point, my board feels like it snags something, and I face plant into the snow. After a somersault to get onto my back, I feel some snow get thrown in my face. Once I'm up, there's this guy 10 yards ahead of me looking at me and laughing. I'm not sure if he's laughing at that pathetic fall I took, or the snow in my face. I'm honestly not sure if he did that, or if I managed to do that to myself on the somersault. He did ask if I was okay, then headed off. Though I'm fairly certain he was laughing at me.

&amp;#x200B;

A little further on, I stop for a breather. In the middle of nowhere in the woods. Nobody around. My mind just starts to wander. Mainly about how nice it'd be to have someone with me out here. Then I remember a reddit post I came across saying something to the effect of ""You're probably good enough for dating. Plenty of shit people get dates all the time"". That post keeps popping up in my thoughts from time to time. One of those things I want to believe. But sitting there, I realize, that an absolute minimum would be for good enough would be a girl being interested. And they just don't seem interested at all. So it really seems like I'm not good enough.

# Rules:

There are now 3 rules for this subreddit, although more would not be discouraged if anyone has any ideas. You can read about them more in depth on the sidebar. The three rules are: 

1. No Discrimination
2. Please Be Kind
3. No Suicide Encouragement

&amp;#x200B;

# Subreddit chat room:

Reddit has the ability to allow for the creation of chat rooms, if anyone would like me to make one so that we can all chat in there I shall do so.

&amp;#x200B;

# Smaller Changes:

I have cleared out all of the recent modmail, if I have missed yours please get into contact. The reported posts have also been cleared and removed where necessary, so any newly reported posts can be more easily seen. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Aesthetic Changes:

I have changed the bio of the subreddit, and changed the ""subscribed"" to ""Lonely Hearts"" because it seemed cute. I have also turned on flairs, so if you would like to give yourself a flair on here to distinguish yourself, you can, but please keep them appropriate. If you can think of any changes you'd like (colour change,  a banner/logo, anything like that) just let me know and I'll be happy to consider and implement them.

So every Sunday, my parents take me to a restaurant to eat with their friends after morning church services. Yesterday, it turned out that the family I talked about last week was going to be joining us (they normally never do), and with a stroke of luck, our seating arrangements made it so that they were sitting in my vicinity. The perfect opportunity to finally get to talk to them.

Unfortunatel, I just couldn't do it. I was too nervous and I couldn't think of a thing to say. But surprisintly, they all voluntarily said some full sentences to me. That cheered me up a little at first, but when I got home and started playing Kingdom Hearts 3 with no one to share the experience with, I remembered that they were only tolerating me because I was sitting in their vicinity at lunch and they weren't actually happy that I was there. It made me sad again and I sat through evening services completely dejected and watched the people who briefly talked to me legitimately enjoy my parents' company.

Today I played some more KH3 while thinking of the family that acknowledged me, and when the game did one of its trademark speeches about friendship, I just broke down and cried while playing the game. Eventually I turned it off because it was dinnertime, but instead I continued to sit there in silence for about an hour, crying.

I called the people i want to talk to and they r either sleeping or not answering. Different timezones so i cant blame them. Doesnt mean it doesnt make me feel even more alone. I really should understand that they are not making me feel lonely on purpose, but my feelings dont understand logic and ratiionality apparently.

Basically, im in a new city, no friends or family. Been here for a few months. Im working, taking a few lessons, and starting college next year. Im 18 btw. im on a gap year, you could say. For some reason, i thought moving to a new city it would be easy to find friends and go to parites and have fun on my own but no soap. (Not moving back home by the way, also i odnt have any friends there except my mum). Its been like 5 months and i cant call anyone ive met here a friend. Just coworkers. I try but no soap. I guess im not trying hard enough. How much do i have to try? Do i literally have to change myself?

Im always picking fights with my brother who I am incredibly jealous of (i dont want to be but i cant help it i guess). He seems to be doing everything right, and is charming and sociable and has lots of friends who love him for who he is, parties with him, etc. I wish i had that. I keep thinking maybe it will get betyer in uni but will it really? Its just me. This is how it was in high school why shiuld college be any different?

Im just not the person i want to be. I hate my personality, the way i interactcwith people. I have nothing interesting to say. Even though i do try to speak a lot to people it always feels like a one sided conversation, me just askign pointless questions. Today i tried commenting on something, nd the person just said mmhmm really awkwardly, when they were having big conversations with others, and i felt so shitty and worthless.

A big part of this gap year was to find myself, nd im scared to say that maybe i have - im just uninteresting and lonely by nature. I dont want that to be the case!! I want to lvoemyself and have fun and not worry if people like me or not. I want to not give a fuck. But when i try and im still lonely sad friendless in a city alone, what am i trying for?

875,Imthatguy0029,1549330145,1,"So, this is gonna take some background info, so get ready for a bit of a story. I'll put a TL;DR at the end to summarize.

A kind of long while back, I had a bittersweet dream of a girl at a campfire. Basically, we looked at one another and felt the same way, she jumped into my arms and we kissed. We knew we may never see each other again either because we knew this was a dream or we were just parting ways. It stayed in my memory because of how satisfying and how good it felt, then how bittersweet it was following. The girl in this dream related to no one that I knew in real life.

I had another dream last night where I got somewhat of a similar feeling. I saw a girl that I've known since childhood. Before I talk about the 2nd dream, I'm gonna give backstory on this girl.

We have a long history, basically an unofficial long distance relationship for many years before she started liking other guys while I still loved her, and proceeded to help her through many bad relationships, being that guy. 10 years after we met, I was in highschool and decided to finally tell her how I felt and got denied. I shut down at first, but after a few years I was over her until I felt mature enough to talk to her again and be friends. We spent so much of our childhood together that we're surprisingly similar, but as with her most recent relationship, she cut me off because her boyfriend didn't want her talking to other guys that he didn't know, even tho I was willing to meet him too. At that point I decided that was an immature and messed up thing to do to a friend, and I won't forgive her unless she apologized. Haven't talked to her in probably about a year now.

So, onto the dream last night, I found her. We immediately hugged and it felt amazing, like I finally found someone who cares about me again enough to give me a real, loving hug. But then I remember she commented something stressing that it was as a friend, which I was okay with in the dream since I at least had someone who I felt close to again, but still a little disappointed. We then moved on to whatever we were up to next together, and I woke up or don't remember anymore.

It's not that I still want to be with her. I'm pretty sure I am over her. But i'm only 24 years old and crushing on her took up so much of my life. Because of that experience, I never actually engaged in any experiences relating to a real relationship. I've never had a real relationship. I can't imagine myself having a relationship with anyone because I don't know anyone.

Idk what this really accomplishes. I guess I'm just venting, telling a story and reflecting on it a bit. Comment what you'd like and I'll reply as soon as I can. Might fall asleep soon though, in which case I'll reply early in the morning.

TL;DR: I had a dream where I met a childhood friend (that threw me away as a friend irl) and we hugged. It felt nice. Woke up and wondered why I'd even think about her anymore. Pretty sure I just couldn't imagine any other person.",lonely,Another bittersweet dream,2019-02-05 12:29:05

So here is what happened.

Well, it was immature of me, and I made sex jokes, and his parents read our texts, and thought we were gay and I was a predator.

We also snuck out once... he was suicidal, he almost committed, and I couldn't tell anyone for fear of making it worse. I did tell his older brother when he wanted to commit.

I'm technically not allowed to talk to him as he stopped going to church

I feel like I should apologize for that.

This part is really tearing me apart. I feel like a pedo for doing this Mind you, I didn't ask for them, nor did I want them, but he sent me pics of him shirtless before, like he didn't even really ask, but he wanted to make sure his pictures looked good for his gf. He sent me multiple.

I'm so scared I can't make a relationship last. Fuck i hate myself.

I don't know what to do. Its the only friendship I really have, and his parents probably think I'm a predator. I don't want to do. They read our texts, and he resents them for it, and what not.

I told him his parents are not the best, as he experienced abuse in the past, and his parents often get drunk, and also fight.

They didn't tell him to stop texting me. So idk. I wanna hang out , with irl. I feel so dumb.

I[](as relevant as that may or may not be), think I lost a friend tonight and I dont know how I feel about it. I don't have many friends at all, to where I would have considered him 1 of only 2 people I really would have consider ""friend"" more than ""awkward acquaintance"" who I never talk to unless specific events happen. This was kind of a straw that broke a camel's back situation, which is why I don't quite why I feel a mix of upset and a neutral of ""alright, that happened, on to the next thing""

So, I've known this person for 4 years and we became friends probably about 2 years ago. He was always a bit of an eccentric character, but so am I in a sense, so who am I to judge. This was part of the final straw though. When messaging him, no matter what the subject, serious or not. He would completely change the subject, would lead with things that sound serious in the context of the sentence before, and just go completely off the deep end, saying things that are frankly nonsensical that, would change the subject entirely. It was very frustrating to me, someone who doesn't ever have serious conversations with people like some were, yet wants them with someone I actually know. This is where I kind of snapped a little and told him to ""talk to me again when he can stop with that bullshit"". A bit impulsive, but the frustration had gotten to me at that point.

The other thing that bothered me a lot more but I was going to just let go without making a fuss was something he said this past December. He said (I'm paraphrasing. I didnt write down what he said exactly, but it was to this effect), ""people like us don't need to have a bunch of friends"" with absolutely zero social awareness of the complete differing situations we are in. He has friends he talks to all the time, hangs out with, chats with, and whatever all the time. I had(have, I guess, I really don't know) two friends. I haven't been invited over to a friend's place in at least a decade. I don't hang out with people ever unless it's something where people are forced to be around me. It's not uncommon for me to go weeks during breaks and the summer without someone so much as saying hi. He knows that I have struggled on and off with the thought that I will die of old age alone in every possible way. A seemingly ridiculous conclusion that I have thought since probably around late elementary school. (yeah, I realize it likely teenage angst or whatever. That doesn't help the circumstances of my life are currently playing out to be exactly like that) I was even in kind of an upswing at that moment, and was feeling optimistic about what could be for the first time in a bit. Now I'm seeing it play out like I have hoped so desperately my life wouldn't. My relationships with my friends being slowly worn away, and being left with nothing.

I wish I could do more to prevent this, I really do. It's been a struggle just to get what little I have in the friends department. With a mix of some bad social anxiety, and depression, to go along with the typical teenage self image of terriblsness. It makes it hard to even say hello to people sometimes. I know I'm not perfect to go along with this. I'm anal retentive, I have a dislike of touching people for the most part. It makes it difficult to really do anything without being explicitly invited or required to go, which is why having the few friends I had was such a godsend as it was, and why I gave him so many chances and mild requests to stop with it for me to get irritated about it.

When I'm around people, I like to think I'm respectful and helpful where applicable, and I try to put on a mask of confidence, in theory helping to build confidence, and I think it's going somewhere, but then I get a moment like this where it all falls apart, I feel like I'm back at square one, and I'm just venting away nonsensically into the internet. This feeling sucks.

912,EatingRawMaca,1549238176,1,"I'm mid 30's, I haven't had a girlfriend (and all that that entails) for many, many years. I'm not saying how long ago, it's so embarrassing. And I now know, deep down, it's never going to happen - it can't happen. My personality is fucked with a devastating mix of avoidant, schizoid and social anxiety traits. I have no real friends, I have no fun in my life and spend so much of my free time thinking of jumping under a train and being done with it. I am so insanely, so unhealthily, lonely in life and I'm so desperately lost. 

I've spent almost my whole life without any intimacy, any connection with others, any sense of having value to any other human being. 

Humans need skin to skin contact for mental well being, and yet it forever eludes me. Without that, the soul shrivels. It's different if it's a choice, or if by religious dictate etc. But my whole sexual self has basically become a poison to me, slowly eating me up from the inside: I want to connect, but I just can't. I'm always alone and adrift in the world. And the whole world seems to be mocking me with opportunities that can never be realised, reminding me constantly of how easily others throw away in boredom what I would cherish for every second. 

I am so desperately lonely. I yearn for human contact, but I can't feasibly get it. It's forever out of reach. I want to show love, share intimacy, be totally open and affectionate with another. I want to snuggle, cuddle, embrace. If I could trade with the universe ‚Äì let me have just 6 months of experiencing what every ""normal"" man gets to experience, and I'll give the universe my death in return ‚Äì *I'd make that trade*. A life without companionship, intimacy, affection, is meaningless to me. I've had 30+ years of it, and I've had enough. 

I find it very very difficult to relate to people in real life. My social skills are totally shot. I get nervous easily, and often anxious. I go red around pretty girls. I'm a fully grown man, and I blush around women. I'm quiet, shy, unconfident in everything I do. I function well enough to hold down a job, to go shopping, etc, but I kinda go through life with a mask on. It's like being a robot, and I'm following a script. As though I have a set series of commands I can voice to work my way through society - ""Hello? How are you? Can I buy the..?"" etc. 
But there is no real connection with people. I can't reach people, I can't move them, I can't bond with them. Every day, fleeting interactions, of no substance, of no lasting meaning.

I feel dead, like my mouth is moving, making sounds, but it is all fakery. It's not really me. The real me is locked up, desperate to find someone who I can finally relate to. Because of this, I often drift into schizoid fantasy about what it would be like not to be me. For example, I'll see a cute girl, and I get lost in a daydream about her and me sitting on a sofa, lights are off, we're snuggled up watching a movie, every now and then there is a amusing moment and we make eye contact and smile, or squeeze hands in recognition of each other, and later she's falling asleep in my arms, and I'm so happy to be sharing such a trivial, but loving, moment with another human.

I never had anyone to hold me when I was a child crying alone in my bedroom. I never had anyone to hold me when I was a teen slashing myself with glass. I never had anyone to hold me when I was in my twenties and destroying myself with alcohol. And I have no one to hold me now, when I'm desperate for something, for someone, to make a difference to my life, to feel some sort of affection in life, to feel some sense of value as a person.

Work schedules conflict but generally, if there's free time, we spend it together.

I sleep on a couch six feet from her bed. Having me here makes her feel safe, she says I'm a stabilizing influence in her life. 

That makes me feel pretty good about myself as a human man, I'm 31 and this is the closest thing to a relationship I've ever been in. Until we met in June, I had been living the neckbeard life at mom's house. Depressed and just sort of waiting to die.

It's not that we haven't been affectionate and even a intimate a handful of times. Just not lately. When I bring it up, my feelings and desires, she gets a bit annoyed with me so I avoid the subject because I don't want to risk losing what we have by pushing for more than she's willing to give.

But she's not feeling affectionate these past few months. At this point she's 9 months pregnant (her exs, he kicked her out when she got pregnant shortly after she and I began hanging out) so I can understand her not feeling sexual, and beween you and me I know that she doesn't find me physically attractive. 

I'm not her type.. and between you and me, shes not really mine either.      Her looks are pretty far from the most interesting thing about her for me.

I'm having one of my moods where I just want to crawl into her bed and lay with her. Ultimately I'm a coward, just going to wait for an invitation that won't be coming. 

I have the number of an attractive sex worker I've seen a couple of times, next time I have a few bucks to play with I'll get this nonsense out of my system. 

My friend/soulmate/whatever knows I see this girl when I need a physical outlet. She doesn't love it but is more or less okay with it. It makes me feel about human garbage because I'm not sure I'd be ok if she were intimate with somebody else :/


I love her and the connection that we have. I'm afraid of the future. A baby is entering the picture in a couple of weeks tops and that's scary as shit. I'm still going to be here. For her and for the baby. 

But this pining after her, constant heartache and the fresh rejection waiting for me the next time I bring up starting an actual relationship.. I need to set boundaries that I'm just not capable of setting with her.

I don't know why I posted this here. I suppose I'm not super lonely, just intensely craving physical affection that I just can't have right now.

I play a little bit of everything but I'm especially playing Black Ops 4 and Monster Hunter recently as well as Minecraft and maybe looking to get into WoW. I've also been playing Rust recently. looking at maybe getting into Ark...basically I'm really, really indecisive. I just got Escape from Tarkov so it would be cool playing that with someone.

I'm also down to try other things I'm sure that we can find something to play together. I have tons of co-op games I haven't played yet because I don't have anyone to play with so maybe we could play some of those.

The reason I'm looking for a lonely girl specifically is because well, I'm really lonely. I'm working on things in my life right now and building a foundation for it and I can't really make a woman happy in real life..at least not yet but I'm working on myself hard so that I can be a stable person that can provide value to a relationship other than being funny and being able to make someone smile b. And in the mean time I guess I'm hoping maybe I can be in a LDR someone where I can just chat wit[h them and game a bunch and text and just sort of talk and maybe it'll become a real thing someday, once I've built that foundation but in the mean time I Just want someone awesome to talk to over Discord while we game. I just want to be transparent about what I'd like someday.

I'm a really nice person, I like to make people smile and I'm really down to earth I've been told. I'm sure that we'll have a lot of fun together and make some fun gaming memories. I know that this post is really like..jarring and straight-forward but I'm just really honest and I just want someone to talk to and make memories with. I'm just really introverted in real life and I've come to kind of accept gaming is my main hobby and at hte same time I don't like going out and partying or anything like that so I've kind of accepted I'm a homebody who just loves videogames and I want someone to share that with.

You can watch a movie alone but can't experience the laughter and fun which only friends can give you. You can study alone, live alone, do everything alone but at some point you'll experience this void inside you which needs to be filled. That hollowness and emptiness inside you which only friends‚Äô warmth and camaraderie can fill up. You'll see them celebrate birthdays together, hang out together, party, play, tease, have fun together and you'll feel oh it's okay I can live without all that. But a time will come when you'll be so overwhelmed by your own loneliness, you'll want to escape and kill yourself. Because you'll be fed up living with your own self. It is a horrendous and macabre feeling. You'll feel helpless in difficult times, times when you need a person to hold you and listen to you, to hug and comfort you, to give you strength and be there for you. It's at such times, you'll find yourself utterly lonely and long for a friend. If you're happy, there would be no one to celebrate with and multiply your joys, if you're morose, there will be no one to divide your sorrrows. You'll have no stories to tell your children, no memories of happy times spent with friends, no experiences to share. You might survive without them through the week but you'd start hating weekends. You'll be holed up in your room while everyone's out there hanging with their friends, eating, dancing, drinking, having a good time. You'll think oh it's fine, I don't need them,I'll go out to eat alone, don't people eat at restaurants by themselves? You'll be okay at first but over time it'll crush you inside. Everytime you go out to eat, you'll see them eating together, the feelings of warmth, laughter and love that they have, you'll long for it too. You'll feel hurt and think I was better holed up in my room than eating here alone. When people see you don't have any friends, you'll be perceived as weird, strange and even rude. They'll think there's some fundamental problem with you and avoid you. It'll lead you to lose your self confidence and you'll end up being socially awkward, feel complexed and avoid people altogether. You'll feel hurt, you'll try to isolate yourself, it will consume you, leaving you with an ennui inside you and you'll end up being an isolated lost depressed soul."" Quora Answer

Life has been somewhat shitty since 2012. I haven't worked in years now due to my health. We lost our house (although have just managed to buy a new one by selling the rental properties we had). I went through a horrible lawsuit because of the car accident that left me brain damaged. A business I tried to start imploded because I had no idea I can't perform the way I used to before becoming brain injured and severely bipolar.

  
Along the way in the past 5 or so years, all my friends have disappeared. Once you mention things like brain injury or bipolar, a lot of people conveniently forget to call you. I may have also pushed some people away during depression periods where it's easier not to interact with people.

  
So, now it's 2019 and I literally have no friends. Not a single one. I have nobody other than my wife and son to talk to.   


I spend all day alone by myself. Some days I just long for bedtime so I can take my sleeping pills and get some respite.

Living Room Conversations are a conversational bridge across issues that divide and separate us. They provide an easy structure for engaging in friendly yet meaningful conversation with those with whom we may not agree. These conversations increase understanding, reveal common ground, and sometimes even allow us to discuss possible solutions.

We have had people in the past express that our conversations have helped to alleviate loneliness and I hope that it may be able to help some of you as well. We host approximately 2-3 virtual conversations a week and some of these groups have gone on to form cohorts of people that meet regularly. We use Zoom, a program that allows you to see the faces of everyone in the group(or, if you are more comfortable, communicate solely with voice). Some groups also meet in person and we are looking to expand our in-person conversations as well.

Here is a link to our upcoming events: [https://www.livingroomconversations.org/events/](https://www.livingroomconversations.org/events/)

I was popular in high school: joining clubs, sports teams, prom, being elected School President, etc. 

I didn't go to college because I got a good paying job in my field where I could work from home! (In hindsight: the work from home part was a mistake.)

I worked at that job for over ten years, keeping occasional contact with friends from school on Facebook, texting, etc.

At 27, I had my first of what has turned out to be many seizures. I'm a full on epileptic now. (This severely limits my travel. I also had to move back in with my parents because my seizures are now so frequent and so severe, I can't live on my own.)

Looking On Facebook, it's like my life has been on pause, while my friends have been in fast forward. I message and text friends, but I think more and more I'm forgotten...

Oh, did I mention I'm in the closet? (I'm gay.) I've met a few gay friends on facebook, but even they're moving out, getting married, adopting children.

I guess it's more of a vent/rant. I just needed to get all of this out and I don't really have anyone to talk about it with. I couldn't stop crying tonight and so I thought maybe putting all of this somewhere might help.

I'm 23 years old in my first year of medical school and I feel like I have nobody. I've never felt like this before. I was treated for mild depression when I was younger but I really thought it was better. It was for years but now it's not.

College was great for me. I had a lot of friends, was involved, in a sorority, etc. I never once felt lonely. Every second of free time I had I spent with friends. We went out, went to parties, hung out at coffee shops, studied together, etc.

I remember my first day of classes here and feeling like I was living a dream. Being a doctor is the only thing I've ever wanted to do. I never wanted to be a teacher or a pilot or an architect or whatever else kids want to be. I just wanted to be a doctor like my dad. He's an orthopedic surgeon. I remember begging him to make time to come to my class in middle school on the day people parents came and talked about their careers. I really thought he had the coolest job in the world. He fixes people with his own hands. I knew med school would be harder than undergrad and it is but it's not as bad as I was afraid it would be. Like how the transition from high school to college was difficult but manageable if you worked harder, this is kind of the same relationship to undergrad. The part that's different is that I almost immediately fell into a great group of friends when I started college. I never felt like I didn't have people I could go to with stuff.

It's not that there's not stuff going on. My classmates are social and I really like most of them. I just feel like I haven't really connected with any of them in a meaningful way. It's really competitive and I just feel like everyone is waiting for everyone else to slip up. *It really hit me a few weeks ago on my birthday.* My parents called me and we chatted for awhile and eventually they asked me if I was doing anything with ""my friends"" to celebrate and it really hit me when I had to stop myself from telling them ""I don't have any friends."" But I can't tell them that so I just said yeah. And I did invite a lot of my classmates to go grab drinks that night and some of them came. Probably most of the people I invited showed up and told me happy birthday and some even got me a card or a present or told me they were buying my drinks that night. I just kind of felt isolated. They all have their friend groups and hung out with their friend groups that night and I'm not really in any of them. I just felt like I was kind of there as a supporting cast member on my own birthday. I went home and cried and I don't even know why. I wasn't expecting anything different but it still hurt. I hate having to ask other people if I can hang out when their friends it just makes me feel pathetic. I just feel invisible right now and I can't do this. I'm stressed and tired all of the time but I can handle that. What I can't handle is being so alone. All of my friends from undergrad are out living life and making new friends and working and starting families or whatever and they all seem so happy. I almost called my best friend from college tonight but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. We've drifted apart and she's engaged and working at her dream job and just doing so much. And then I almost called my last ex from college but I couldn't do that either. I broke up with him last spring because he was fully prepared to come here with me and go to grad school in the same city and it hurt but I knew that he got into his dream grad school in another country and I couldn't be the reason he gave that opportunity up. We still text occasionally but I just can't dump all of this on him given that if I let him follow me here, I probably wouldn't be in this exact situation. I know he still cares about me and I do too but we just can't talk about stuff this deep anymore.

And I can't tell my parents about any of this. I don't want them to worry or think I can't do this because I know I can and I want to. I still enjoy going to class and love what I'm learning but it just sucks. I know there are groups of my classmates studying together and I'm sitting at my kitchen table alone every day studying by myself because they don't invite me. And I know I'm not here to make friends but I'm a fairly social person. I don't do well alone. I thought maybe dating would help but everyone I met on tinder who wanted more than a hookup wanted more of my time than I can afford to give.

I live in one of the biggest cities in the world and I feel completely alone. There was one guy I was pretty good friends with. He was my lab partner this fall and we got along really well. We hung out all the time - we'd get dinner together then go to my place and split a bottle of wine and study together almost every night. We got drinks together every Friday night. I told him things that I wouldn't tell just anyone. I thought we were best friends. Then on Christmas day he called me and told me he was really into me and how every night we spent studying together all he wanted to do was kiss me and just spilled his feelings. I didn't expect it at all and I didn't know what to say. I didn't feel the same so I told him that and said I really valued our friendship and cared about him but that was all it was going to be and that I hoped he understood. I told him I didn't want anything to change between us but he got kind of angry and hung up in the middle of a sentence from me and we're barely spoken since. I texted him a couple times after Christmas and asked if he wanted to meet up and talk about what happened but he never replied. He sits on the other side of classrooms from me and won't even look at me if I see him at the library. I think that's what hurts the most. The one person I thought I was close to turned out to have a completely different agenda that didn't involve being my friend.

So I just don't know what to do. My school offers counseling but I'm just not interested in going because I've tried seeing a therapist before and I just can't open up like I need to for it to be effective. And there's always the fear in the back of my head that anything I do now could potentially hurt my future career. I know all about HIPPA and confidentiality but I'm still afraid someone would find out if I was seeing a therapist or taking medication and it would ruin everything. Even though medicine is about helping sick people, there's a huge stigma about medical students and doctors needing help themselves.

I feel like I have nobody in the world anymore and it's killing me. I don't know if I can do this for another year and a half at least.",lonely,In my first year of medical school and I've never been this lonely before,2019-02-02 15:52:30

I've always been the shy, quiet, nice type. I'm sure most people here are that way. I've never been great at making friends, being social, small talk, etc. And this has led me throughout life with very few friends.

Over the last couple of years the ""friends"" I had in high school faded away, people I rode with at the skate park ceased to exist once I stopped riding, and i was left with 2 friends. These 2 friends were fun to hang out with, we all had the same personality and enjoyed the same things so it was nice to have these 2 people, regardless of not having anyone else I could call friends. 

Over the course of the last couple months though, they had started going places and kind of trying to hide it unless I asked them about it and even more recently they've began to just not talk to me much at all. I'll get a snapchat or text every so often, maybe some meme they found funny and wanted to share. But not much.

Fast forward to today, and I've talked to them maybe 1 or 2 times over the course of the last couple weeks. I tried inviting them somewhere and was simply ignored until the next day when they both just so happen to ""not have seen my invite"". Havent heard anything else from them in about a week now. 

I'm sad to lose these people in my life, they were good friends, and the last few that I had. I dont know what happened, but I do know that I wish it hadn't.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just really down today and need to vent a little bit. I hope you all are doing well. ",lonely,"I now have no friends left, and I dont know why my last ones have left me..",2019-02-02 10:56:24

And I know people will say its up to me to change but I don't really know how, I could hit the gym but that wouldn't change my quiet, introverted personality. I should get friends that actually share some interests but obviously thats easier said than done.

While this can mean being accepting of solitude i think as social animals we all sort of need a social group psychologically.

 Which is why i wish there were sort of group homes for it or an organization that meets. You'd have people struggling with social anxiety and anything else that causes or contributes to general loneliness. And you'd have legitimately a supervised party. With maybe some therapists or professionals, but also just very friendly people as coaches. Cause if you're alone for long enough, being social is so hard. 

What if someone could actually sit there and say ""hey, thats a great conversation topic and you're doing really well"" to reassure us or say ""hey, calm down there you're getting a bit excited"" or even pull us out our shell and ease us into conversations. 

Better yet the coaches would even have group chats and personal messages occasionally to hit every aspect. 

Essentially training us to be social and giving us a group of people who all understand it. I think it could help social anxiety a lot, but also social akwarness and other struggles. For that internalized loneliness where people feel lonely even around others while acting normal; having a therapist or psychologist on hand to directly observe them could be so helpful. They could work to determine the underlying causes of that emotion and develop a treatment unique to those individuals. 

Does anyone else think that would be helpful? Is there something like that? A sort of group dedicated to these issues. Cause its becoming enough of an epidmic to warrant it imo.",lonely,Loneliness help group? Lonelies anoymous?,2019-02-02 09:05:52

He was dealing with something and I helped him trough it but in the meantime I was falling in love with him. When I confessed he said that he wasn't interested because I am FTM and also told me that he has been dating his ex online. He was hiding that from me for 2 months.

I was hurt and very low. After few days of trying to get myself back together I had one of those days when you just say the wrong thing and bad things just happen.
I told him that we are not twins anymore because he almost never said anything about us being twins.

Some time passed and we continued being friends. I felt so guilty for saying what I did and I was angry at him for not defending it. I thought we resolved it so I moved on.

He was giving me mixed signals. I tried to read them but I would only end up confused. Sometimes he would react not in a way that a friend would... He would react as a person that had romantic feelings for me.

So me being me - I made a move on my very straight and very close soulmate that already told me that he is not interested... You know just to make sure 100%...

After he assured me that he is not into me he forced me to talk about it. We had a fight. We were both hurting and said some things... After we had a talk about it and I apologized and we resolved the issue.

After this he became very cold towards me. I was heartbroken and the person that I expected to be there was now completely different. He claimed that this was the real him and kept telling me that he is not going back. I wept for days and felt like my friend has died.

I thought he was being cold because of my feelings for him but he said that he was like this because of twin thing.
Whenever I talked with him I tried making him feel better. I focused on him and tried to fix what I broke.
Today we had a conversation about it. I asked him how to fix it and then again he said he doesn't think it can be fixed. Then he went on to talk about how he treats me better then his other friends and I realized something.
He does this with everyone - he becomes good friends and the moment we say something wrong he shuts us out. So he told me to be like everyone else and leave.

And I did.

For the longest time I felt like I was being punished for things I said, for whatever other people have said and for my love for him.

so in this dream i was at some kind of school/community centre? and everyone there hated and avoided me because of something (personal reasons related to my past) and i was really sad and lonely but a really kind boy befriended me and we quickly became best friends. we'd often sit at a table just the two of us and just chilll and talk about things. i was so happy in this dream. i wasnt lonely anymore.

but then one day he suddenly told me he has a disease. i was devastated and asked him, ""is that why you didnt mind my past and chose to befriend me?"" he didnt say shit.

i dont know what happened after. i just suddenly found myself at his funeral and it was at a beach during dusk. the sun was setting and it was beautiful. there were lots of people dressed in black. some guys laid his coffin down at the shore and as it slowly drifted out to the sea i completely broke down and fell to my knees and sobbed hard, like really hard. i was dreaming but i could literally feel my chest hurt. it felt so real as if i really lost something important

and then i woke up and stayed in bed and cried for a good five minute or so lol... this is the most vivid and cherished dream i ever had that made my loneliness go away even just for a while and i dont think i will ever forget this person my brain somehow created. call me crazy but i still think about this imaginary person from time to time. sometimes if i think too hard about it i tear up because i am THAT attached to this imaginary person wtf. what's sad though, is that i remember everything about the dream but not his face...

I still listen to basic feel-good-feel-bad music, like Linkin Park/Green Day/Papa Roach/System of a Down, interspersed with Aesop Rock. Basically any kind of 'gritty' music that is full of ""negative""  thoughts that oddly make me feel a little bit better, or at least...a bit good? Even if my migraines are back or my eyes are hurting too much that day. Music's an escape. 

I still have no friends, I still hate myself. The only difference between middle school, early high school me and current me is I have even less hopes/future plans, and I'm not as fat. I see the posts from years ago and give or take a few details it's the same BS. 

I'm just...tired of this cycle. I want to end it, but it feels like I'm forced into this shell against my will. I know I have the resources- 100mg/kg is the sure overdose, I have 200mg of pills to spare, and I could possibly find a backup method just to be sure this time- but, odds are, I probably won't go through with it. 

I should probably wait, and be calm, but I've tried that every day this week and it hasn't worked. My dad would be pissed as fuck, but I'll admit anonymously that every night this week I cried myself to sleep. I wrote a massive wall of text about everything that's bugging me- from eye disease moans to outdoor club problems to my POS pickup and lack of car knowledge, my bad college experience, ""I did everything I could and it still didn't work, I followed all the advice"". But really, no one wants to read that. I just wanted to say I wish I had someone to break down to in person. I wish I had someone to say, ""I want to die, but I don't want my already disappointed family to hate me even worse."", and not hear ""fuck, do it already."" I wanted to at least see the ocean before I die, but since the club treasurer lied about sending the deposits and got the ski trip and most likely the Maine trip cancelled, not like I have funds to go personally, I don't know if that'll happen. Fuck, it's probably just like a saltier Lake Ontario anyways. 

Odds are, I'm going to finish this rant; I probably won't try another attempt; and I'm going to keep grinding- Class, gym, meetings, memes. I...I just wanted to write this out. There's a lot of hurting souls here, and I'm sorry I don't reach out to more of you when you're hurting; I just hope we all see better times. A good change for once.

I was in a relationship (my first) about 8 months ago, and ever since then, I have painfully missed the love and emotion that relationships can provide, I have tried so hard to meet new people by trying to find things that interest meet and subsequent groups that are related, but I find it harder and harder to enjoy doing anything anymore, let alone find people who also enjoy things. More than anything, I wish I could just make more female friends, not even for relationships, but be able to be comfortable around girls, at that point I could then find a cuddle buddy or (in my dreams) a subsequent relationship, but thanks to that last relationship, whenever I even think about meeting girls I shudder and just feel really hopeless, and if I think about talking to them, I actually begin to shake and twitch pretty violently, when I was in high school I didn't have a problem talking to girls or anyone for that matter and I never had anxiety, I just never met anybody who I wanted to have a relationship with, but now its just, inexplicable, so anyways, Is there anyone who can give me suggestions to help myself be more social and less anxious. idk I'm ranting a bit here so i'll just hit post :/",lonely,18 And Already In A Rut,2019-02-01 13:47:01

1028,TheStrongLettuce,1548988511,1,"So, I just have to get this off my chest. I'm lonely as fuck.... 

I do have a significant other, but we don't really see each other often and even when we do, we don't do very much together. We are both gamers but he usually games with his friend group which he says he's uncomfortable with me being in because he's a competitive gamer and doesn't want to worry about upsetting me as he tends to rag on his friends when they fall short depending on his mood. Its ironic because I am a PlayStation baby but I bought an Xbox One when my PlayStation stopped working just so we could game. Now I'm stuck on a platform where I have no friends.

I do have a couple friends irl, but we don't talk very often. By ""we"" I mean they don't talk to me very much; mostly each other as they have a lot in common between the three of them. Also, they are free to hang out whenever and have constant access to rides. I on the other hand have a little one and while he is my life and I enjoy every second of him, I'm not as free to drop what I'm doing and go. For this reason and a couple others I'm kind of the group outcast. I would love to at least game with them but only one of them games and like me, she prefers PlayStation so we can't really play together. 

Most days I feel like I have no one to talk to at all. I feel like I'm isolated. There's a ton I want to do but I'm just so sick of doing it by myself. I thought of just making new friends online or even through games but I have bad generalized anxiety, so bad that I will freeze up when it comes to making the first move. I also have had depression for many years which only serves to discourage me further from making an attempt. It's been a long while now since I've really played now, so I feel like I'll be bad and I don't want to ruin the experience for others. I also love to do digital art and write but I just can't seem to bring myself to.
