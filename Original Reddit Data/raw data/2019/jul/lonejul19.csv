&amp;#x200B;

In general, few people really meet my initial standards for a friendship, and when they do, I'm too shy to approach them, or I figure there's no point since they're popular or in a large group already. Call me selfish but I don't want to just be a insignificant blip on their radar.

&amp;#x200B;

I had 3 childhood friends that I used to hang out with but they dropped one by one. One of them I thought was a best friend, but it became clear that she didn't think of me as such since she made no effort to hide that she hung out with another group (that she never really did invite me into). The other one, who I regarded as a best friend, I was the one who left her. Our core values had grown too different. I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her and also that I was simply settling for her when I had no one else. One time she was about to get confrontational again and I just left her and blocked her on everything. It's not as if she would have no idea what she did wrong anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

And that leaves me with 2 'friends' that I only occasionally hang out with. I feel sometimes that I'm a piece of toxic waste that drives everyone away.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I feel that if I had a significant other I could cope with all this, because a SO that I could rely on would outweigh any shallowness I could come across in the real world, and I would learn to appreciate people more. I don't think I've ever truly loved anyone in my life, and in return no one has ever truly loved me. It would be nice to love someone and provide for someone. But I'm too broken, anxious and unstable to date, never mind get something long-term. Not to mention ugly. Despite having a normal weight and trying to improve my sense of fashion and my skin, the only picture of myself I had ever sent out to the internet was met with trolling and mean comments. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, one problem feeds into another. I don't think I'll ever get out of that viscious cycle. And doing crazy stuff just to experience life might just come to be more negative experiences for me.",lonely,I have such low expectations from people.,2019-07-31 23:30:23

He said that he had never had attention or sexual attention from women before and he was utterly nervous talking to me. He then kept apologising for breaking down. I told him everything was fine and that we could stop and just get to know each other/meme/vidya. He seemed to appreciate that.

5,nowandmewebsite,1564566449,2," There have been times when I felt really alone and lonely. There have been times when I have wanted to share my feelings with someone but I didn’t know whom I can go to. I felt the void of having “my person” who would always be there for me, listen to me and would not judge me. After all, all you want is interaction with people who feel like home and don’t make you feel like a burden for sharing your feelings.

Then, I realized how important it was to just vent out and to let my feelings out, no matter what. Opening up takes courage but once it’s done, there’s nothing but liberation that you feel.

There have been times when I used to just write down my feelings in a journal and just keep it locked away. So, basically my feelings never got out in the space, really.

After some time, I started sharing my feelings on the platform, **Now and Me,** [**http://www.nowandme.com**](http://www.nowandme.com/) , which is a safe space to share your struggles, issues, mental health problems etc. with people in a no-judgement zone. I interacted with so many people who really understood me, which helped me heal, grow and learn. The mixed experiences of other people made me believe that I was not alone.

Rather than feeling that how you should get rid of it, I think you should embrace these feelings and put them out there where you will be heard.",lonely,I always feel alone.

I should’ve understood, because she has an insanely rare pure hearted personality. However, I’m too used to the ungodly city life where you have to be a cold shell of a person in order to survive.

25,lonelybeaut,1564544442,4,"Hello, I'm new to reddit and I love watching reddit videos on youtube since I have nothing else to kill time with. All my life I've ever only had one friend, H, who was forced to be my friend in kindergarten by her cousin. Her cousin saw that I was the only kid with no friends and she was friends with everyone in the class. At the time, I thought she wanted to be my friend and I was happy to finally meet someone. I have always been a super shy and awkward person my whole life and have been made fun of for it. My family tells me constantly that its abnormal for a girl like me to not have friends when my siblings have many. I grew up with H and only talked to her since she was the one who made friends for us. We separated in 3rd grade and I went back to being a loner. Every girl in my classes would often make fun of me for not being like them and I never cared until I got older and understood why they never liked me. H and I reunited again in middle school and everything went back to how it was. She made lots of friends during our time apart and I forced myself into her group. We later separated again in high school and I was back to how I always was. 

In high school, I joined the choir to make friends with people who were interested in the things I was, singing. At first, it was all good, I had lots of friends and none of them knew my past loneliness. I thought being alone was a thing of the past, I was wrong. I started being more confident and happy with the people around me. They began to think I was annoyingly too happy and slowly stopped inviting me to events while I watched their stories on instagram and snapchat. When H would contact me during high school to hang out, I would be excited to see her as I didn't get to see her often. It was always just the two of us until she got a boyfriend. Our time together started to shorten so I decided I needed a boyfriend as well to fill up my emptiness. My first boyfriend was a close friend of mine in high school and things were great until he started asking me for sexual favors in our sophomore year. I would always try to decline as polite as possible as I didn't want to ruin my first relationship. He pressured me more daily and eventually I gave into the pressure and was too scared to tell anyone what he would force me to do. Eventually, after telling H about my problems, she gave me the courage to stand up for myself and stop seeing him since he was very manipulative and didn't care about my well being. He started to harass me during school and luckily I had another friend in my high school who would defend me against him when I couldn't. I looked up to her as an older sister and we hung out when H was too busy with her boyfriend. 

I met my sister figure, F, in my Freshman year English class when she transferred from out of state. We instantly clicked and I wasn't sad that my choir ""friends"" wouldn't talk to me. We spent every day together and she took care of me so I wouldn't be hurt again by another guy. F hated the way my first boyfriend treated me and never wanted it to happen again. She protected me when H wasn't there for me. Later on, in senior year, we made friends with lots of people who transferred from out of state and we became best friends. F started dating one of the guys and I felt genuine happiness for her. It wasn't until he was only using her to be close to me and when F found out, she dumped me too along with our other friends calling me a homewrecker. Her ex was quickly forgiven and brought back into the group but I was forever shunned from everyone because I had been seen as an attention seeker. H was also disappointed in me and took F's side and I was left alone the rest of my senior year. I was about to buy grad nite tickets to Disneyland with my friends before the events all played out. When my old choir friends heard out the news they took me back in as if nothing happened before. I slowly recovered from it and started to be happy again when my ex started talking trash to my choir friends and they believed his lies. They pretended to invite me places but never tell me the time and date. I would later see everyone hanging out without me. On our choir instagram page, I was left out of every major photo. They talked about family and how everyone belongs but would always exclude me in everything. 

F also started hanging out with my ex and created an instagram account to trash talk me to everyone they knew. F knew a lot of people in our high school and was fairly popular. I was very introverted and only knew choir people and my old friends. Rumors spread fast that I was a thot who would have sex for test answers and homework. I didn't find out about it until a choir friend asked me about my services. I tried to kill myself that night and my family didn't understand why I didn't want to go back to school. I pretended to be happy for the rest of my time there since it was only a few more months until college. I managed to graduate without killing myself and started going to my community college. I went into a Filipino community where I thought I could start fresh with people who would want to learn the culture with me. F moved back to her country and H pretended nothing bad happened in high school. My old friends tried to reach me since F left saying she threatened to stop talking to them if they were still friends with me. Being the naive pushover I was, I accepted their apology and became friends with them again. F's ex went to a university so I wouldn't be able to see him. My ex went to the same community college as me but we haven't seen each other yet. H went to a better university away from her boyfriend making her have more time to message me. Our hangouts when she came home started having more people and eventually, everyone ignored me. 

During H's birthday party, all her friends insisted on watching a horror movie even though H knew fully well I don't enjoy horror movies. That night I cried and everyone there made fun of me saying I shouldn't be scared because I'm not a baby anymore. One of H's friends was in my class and he would constantly make fun of me to her and she wouldn't tell him to stop. He told her multiple hurtful things about me as she laughed. I later found out he wanted to be with her badly and even told H's boyfriend if he could steal her away. H was very offended by this but he's still more of a best friend than I am. H and I are in summer classes at the moment and I recently found out she still talks to my ex. She used to tell me when I would ask for advice that he was a bad person. Now, he hangs out with her boyfriend and talks to her as if she's his best friend. 

I recently tried to kill myself again because of how much everyone around me is hurting me and its not like anyone would notice. I had been telling my parents constantly to put me in another high school because of everything that happened to me but they always refused because my siblings went there and had lots of good friends there. I was sent to a mental facility and my parents didn't care if I killed myself or not. Till this day, all of my choir friends and H are fake friends pretending our bond has been special and they've never had a friend like me. My parents forget about what happens to me also, saying that depression and anxiety don't exist. 

I don't know if anyone will bother to read everything and get to the end, but if you do, thank you. I really wish I had a real friend and I often dream about having good memories with them. Going to disneyland and prom are still two things I wish I could experience in my life.

31,hamartiated,1564539764,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

37,CJ_Thomas,1564530680,5,"For context I'm 25\[M\]:

I recently quit dating entirely, it's been like a week maybe so very recently. Partly because I knew that I was starting to be unhealthy with my obsession with trying to date - it wasn't hard to see how desperate I was, which ironically made it difficult to date because no-one wants the desperate-self doubty guy. I knew the first few weeks would be rough but its pretty bad. I feel completely unlovable. I feel like I've been duped into believing that I'd be worth something, and that I'd be loved someday and the only thing keeping me from waking up to that reality was sheer stubbornness and cowardice.

I've lost my home, I lost my only real relationship, I feel abandoned by God, and I'm finally starting to lose my will to live. I've usually got a pretty good intuition for where I think life/the universe/God is directing me - it's something I've lived a large portion of life with, and with which I've seen some pretty weird shit. I realize without specifics thats super weird and non-commital but I've been trying to explain to people just how important that intuition is to me. Everytime i even approach dating, or women in general the only feeling I get is a general ominous feeling of ""NO."" 

I don't really know how else to explain it, I feel like I've been totally forbidden to have anything remotely resembling real happiness and I've only just started to accept that it's all basically over. It's like I shot for the moon, and missed and now I'm just floating off into nothing.",lonely,"I recently quit dating, I'm out",2019-07-31 09:51:20
38,unicorn_ear,1564530202,3,"Hi I moved to another country because I loved the city and I wanted to start a life that I had dreamed about and built up in my mind. Sadly i have depression and have had it for a while and it has not been easy in this new place even though I have my boyfriend here who I live with. I am extremely lonely and have made only 1-3 friends who are all just acquaintance level (met up 2 times). The one friend I felt closest to in this year ghosted me for no reason. 

My boyfriend doesn’t seem to understand my struggle right now beyond suggesting I do things and generally making me feel like it’s my fault. 

My closest friends are these 3 people who I met in college and they live in another country and city. I reach out to them often and I visited them last year. 

Although they seemed to reassure me and act all friendly when I visited—- they have their own lives and are busy and happier than I am. I am beginning to feel like the relationships are one sided.

I am the only one to reach out to everyone.

I don’t get checked on for my well-being. But I am going through one of the hardest times in my life. This includes my mom, and my dad. All the people I care about the most: They all reply to me and set up times to talk on video chat, which is always nice, but I am always the one arranging it all. 

My time here so far feels like a failure as 1 year down the line I still don’t have a job or salary. I depend on my boyfriend now for everything, since leaving my last service industry hourly job that sucked. 

I have a bachelors degree but it isn’t working out for me in this new country as I had hoped. 

I’m growing resentment for my friends and family who seem to not care about me very much. I am feeling even lower about myself because they will not reach out to say “hey how are you doing lately” like I do with them ... I feel like the close feelings I have felt towards them are not real. 

And I don’t understand my own parents. Why do they not care to reach out to me? My dad never called me or tried to talk when I lived in his town, and I think part of me left the country to make that pill easier to swallow. But it’s not.

 I don’t know what to do, even my therapist doesn’t seem to want to talk to me. I make all of our appointments and if I don’t text her she doesn’t check on me.

I’m just on a downward spiral and what’s worse is I can feel that those around me pity me but they don’t try to help me.",lonely,Feeling very alone,2019-07-31 09:43:22

45,Amnocreative,1564523392,2,"I am a case of the-by-now-standard 24 year old guy who is incredibly lonely and who's never had any interest from girls. Last couple of years everything hit me all of sudden, spiralling me into a not-so-positive mindset. Basically: hating my life every second of the day.

My brother's been together with this girl for a couple years now... and I've developped feelings for her since about last year (didn't know her before then). I feel absolutely pathetic for even writing this, especially because I'm really close with my brother.

If this were a random girl (who was in a relationship with someone, thus not being available), I'd probably try to distance myself from her for my own mental well-being. Seeing someone you like like someone else is one of the worst feelings possible.

Problem is: I've 'joined' their friend group (since a couple of months before developping feelings, also should probably say 'group', I basically only talk to my brother and his gf), and I see her A LOT. Her and I get along really well. I even dare to say, if she weren't dating my brother, I'd have a shot. I obviously don't want anything to ACTUALLY happen (I obviously love my brother and wouldn't even dare doing something like this to him), but I just can't stop myself from messaging her and asking to hang out, fantasizing about other outcomes.

How in the world am I supposed to get over her if I see her so much? How am I supposed to get over her if we talk basically every day because I'm too weak to stop myself? How do I stop fantasizing about something that's impossible?",lonely,I can't stop myself and I hate it,2019-07-31 07:49:52

74,NatDru,1564487947,2,"I’d like to know if it’s a bad thing that I discard people when I don’t like an aspect of their personality? I know some people stay friends with others that aren’t that nice just to have friends and people to hang out with. But, I can’t seem to do this. 

I’m a 31yr old female living in Los Angeles, this is where I’ve lived my whole life. I‘m a pretty likable person, I think. Although I am more of an introvert, I know the importance of making small talk, asking questions, being charming, not awkward and all of that. Therefore, when I meet other girls at events or gatherings I seem to be liked, more than once they have asked me for my number to grab lunch or coffee in the future and just hang out. 

My issue though is that I can read people extremely well. So, right off the bat I know if someone truly can be a potential friend or not. So that excludes a bunch of people as soon as I meet them. And, let’s say I do like a girl and would like to be friends with her, the moment I notice something off in her personality I step away. Think Maya Angelou and her famous quote, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” I’m actually more forgiving than Miss Angelou and give everyone the benefit of a doubt, a second chance if you will. I figure sometimes people are having a bad day or they expressed themselves incorrectly without realizing it. But, after a while I realize they’re not very nice or centered people so I discard them. I don’t want friends like that, I like nice, kind people and I feel I shouldn’t have to put up with crap like that. And so my question is, Is that a bad thing? Because I genuinely would like to have friends, I just can’t seem to find people I’d like to be friends with. Is it that I’m just too judgmental? I don’t know...

I’ll give you a few examples - 

1. I met a lady who was about 15 years older than me, a professor, she was really fun and energetic. Yet, she tended to be rude to people. I noticed it once and let it pass since I figured that’s how her and her friend got along. But, then we went to a karaoke party and she was so rude to multiple people on the same night and towards people she didn’t even know well. So, I thought, this is how she will eventually want to treat me at some point. No thanks. She was also a lesbian and although she assured me that she’d never hit on me since we were friends she did try a few times. She’d get just a little too close for comfort at times and that was very distressing for me. I’m a straight woman and have zero desire to be with another woman, ever. 

2. I met another girl whose very well spoken, truly eloquent, and I liked that because I feel I need to be more that way. She was around my age, fun to hang out with. A wannabe actress, but I figured I wouldn’t judge her for it. We do live in LA. Yet, she made multiple comments about how she wants to meet a rich man to marry so that she never has to work again in her life, she doesn’t want to have kids or deal with pets and just wants to be taken care of. I went to her apartment once and she had a bunch of vision boards all throughout her apartment, like a good 30. Now, I’m not saying we can’t have dreams and aspirations, but some of her comments sounded down right delusional. I also know beauty isn’t everything, but she’s like a solid 4, and saying things like that just sounded stupid to me. It was very off putting. 

3. Then I had another friend and she was unemployed although she’d tell everyone we met that she was in PR and dealt with clients. At first I didn’t know she was unemployed, but I caught on as we hung out more and she opened up to me about the interviews she was going to. She had—had a 7 month relationship with a guy who ended things with her since he didn’t want anything more than a girlfriend and didn’t want to waste her time since he knew she would eventually want to get married and he just didn’t see that in his future plans. So, anyway, here her and I were talking about this ex boyfriend still after a year and a half after he dumped her. She’d been mourning the breakup longer than what they were even together, which technically was only 4 months since the first 3 they were just friends. Any who, she’d also throw little tantrums here and there sometimes and it was very uncomfortable for me since I don’t like causing scenes in public. 

If you’ve gotten to this point of my post I want to thank you for reading it all the way through. I honestly just want to know if I’m being too picky with the friends I choose and if that’s a good thing or a bad thing? I don’t mind my company, I like doing things alone all the time. But, it would be nice to have a friend I could go have a drink with sometimes or a girls dinner date. I haven’t had a boyfriend in two years so I’d like to go to a bar every once in a while with a friend and see if we can meet guys. I obviously can’t do this by myself, so if you guys have any advice for me I’d greatly appreciate it. 

Thank you in advance :)",lonely,"I don’t have friends, but it’s by choice... I think.",2019-07-30 21:59:07

I dated a view guys and girls over the last year but it never went farther then one meeting. After that i got scared and didnt answeared them or i didnt liked them.

I also tried dating apps but right before we met i deleted the match. ONS arent my thing i cant sleep l with stranger because i also think im not good enough or cant trust them.

That's probably why I feel lonely sometimes. For the most parts, I'm doing really well. I just have the void in me which seeks for companionship. I miss the morning texts, the late night calls, the weekend plan together no matter the distance between us.

 A few things about me fyi: 

- I'm 30  yo, but I'm an old soul. 

- I like handwritten letters. I used to have a penpal on here whom I ended up exchanging letters with for a year. He was no longer up for it in the end which was a shame. 

- I'm chill &amp; easy to talk to, so I've been told by a lot of people.   

- I will forever be a dog person. If you're a dog owner, you're my kind of person (50%)  

- I like people with good sense of humor because we all need to laugh more often.   

- I like voice call too if I know you enough to switch to another platform.   

- I'd love to find someone who's interested in watching movies/series together. This is easier said than done because I've given it a few tries &amp; people aren't really committed to it.

I just can't seem to bring myself to want to do anything anymore. Even before summer break, when I was in school, I would feel like this. All I do is stay in my bed, and sometimes go on Reddit. I just have no motivation to draw, or practice my instrument, or study, or do anything. 

No one really contacts me, and I don't really want to contact anyone. I'm so lonely but hanging out with others just doesn't seem to fix it. Sometimes people ask me if I want to hang out, and I make excuses to decline. It feels so weird: my hobbies don't bring me enjoyment and neither do the people I consider friends. Nothing brings me enjoyment. Life just feels really gray and blurry. 

Everyone around this age is getting a driver's license, and I don't even have my learner's. I just don't care: I feel indifference. I don't even go anywhere anyway. It seems like everyone on social media too is in a relationship, and I just can't stand seeing other people so happy in companionship when all I'm doing is staying in bed. I have a part time job, but I rarely got any shifts this summer because there's not enough work, so I feel lazy and useless.

My little brother [13 M] doesn't even want to see me most of the time, and my parents work long hours, so I just feel really lonely all the time, even from my own family. When I see my parents, I usually get really short with them and sometimes say really mean things when I don't mean it at all. 

My mom asked me if I wanted to celebrate my upcoming birthday in August, but I don't even want to celebrate it. There just seems to be no point. I can't even think of anyone I would invite to a birthday celebration.

I often hear from adults that these are supposed to be the best years of my life. If that is the case, then I cringe when I think of what the rest of my life will be like. 

Sorry this is so long.

I always feel like i'm bothering people in some sort of way, since I usually don't talk much. Even if I do say something it comes out in a very unnatural way, like it i'm just trying to be funny or it sounds fake. 

 I always start thinking that people probably find me boring or weird and, because I know that nobody is really befriended with me like they are with each other, It makes sense that they might not like me at all. I know they say the opposite, but being constantly sad around them doesn't make me the most fun person to hang out with. 

Besides that I also have social anxiety. I'm literally afraid to talk to my friends sometimes and it makes that I don't really socialize with others either. I am scared every time I have to ask a friend to chill and i'm miserable when I don't get asked to come along. 

I do hang out a lot, because of my home situation, but my parents are very strict and don't really let me go out. So I also feel like i'm missing out. And sometimes it distracts me all day and I feel lonely the whole time. 

I just always need someone to be my best friend, so I can cry about everything and nothing, but i simply don't want to burden people with that. Making myself saddle with my own sadness all day. 

And then I'm stuck with my useless sadness and fake(?)friends who probably pity me.

 I see the world a lot differently. It's sad to say but in life looks do help you tremendously. If you look good chances are you're gonna have decent chances of meeting more people. People only want to be with you if you have something to offer. They are only in it for themselves. Therapists only listen if you pay. That's just how it goes in life.

126,This_Seal,1564422736,3,"Hi, I just thought about writing this, since I just found this subreddit. 

I've always considered myself as resilient to true lonelyness. After all, I didn't felt like I was suffering from having few friends or from spending my weekends on my own at home. I considered myself to be a shy introvert, but a satisfied one. After all, I have a best friend and managed to escape the destiny of becoming a wizard at age 30, lol. 

I also thought I was doing fine progress-wise in my life. In 2013 I failed at college and dropped out. I spend the next 1,5 years trying to study something else, but I was just running away from reality and my own feeling of shame and failure. Then I made the brave step to quit, this time because I wanted to. It took me a year to find a job-based education and I'm now close to finishing it after 3 years. In those 3 years, I moved out and started living in my first own apartment. I also have a job offer on hand, so I can keep working at the same place after finishing my education. Its going to be a boring job in accounting, but I was so glad to not having to register as unemployed next month and to not be forced to have my job hunt to be driven by existential fears. Only thing I was looking forward to, was finding a better apartment, as mine is in a very old house and hasn't seen any upgrade in decades.

And then I got my heart broken. 

A man I had fallen in love with at first sight (literally), confessed that he doesn't think he has romantic feelings for me. And although I had been rejected before in my life and felt some lovesickness, not even the break-up with my boyfriend felt this bad. I never felt so intense for anyone ever (I've been single for 8 years). He was just so...perfect in any way.

Now I know I'm not as resilient, as I thought I was. I'm lonly and afraid. Suddenly it does matter, that my friends and parents don't live close by. And I feel so unwanted, unloveable , I see all my flaws and the fear, that I'll end up all alone for the rest of my life is back. It just hurts. And there is nothing I can fall back on, as everything I considered okay/decent is now void of any joy or pragmatic satisfaction. I hate my apartment, I hate the upcomming job and the city I live in. Even my own hobbies don't give me the satisfaction and joy they once did. There is no ""at least I have X"" argument I could come up with, to ease the negative feelings.

But I'm missing having an emotional and intimate connection with somebody. Honestly, I miss the physical connection as well. Like a lot.

148,Trebuchet_Spy,1564381829,3,"Never in my life had I thought I would have to face something so excruciating as I am now.

Every day, I can’t get away from that feeling of loneliness whenever I see a group of friends hanging out.  To make it worse, the self-accusing of selfishness  haunts me every time I lay in bed.

I know it’s greedy, I know it’s not kind.  I wish somebody would prefer me over anyone else, as a friend.  I moved a lot in my childhood, and there is one thing I have learned.  You might think you can get over past friends, but when you fall in that dark pit of loneliness, all you can think about are those lost friendships.  My old friends have all moved away or slowly distances themselves from me.  My only two friends are all I have left.  I tried to make myself stop feeling these horrible feelings of attachment, but I still have fallen head over heels for one of the two friends I have left.  On the rare times I hang out, I can’t control myself from feeling jealousy when my other friends does anything with my crush.  It’s mortifying.  Hell, I’m starting to be confused about my emotions.  I’m uninterested in intimacy at this point.  I just want somebody that would always be at my side, who I could always trust.  My father told me a long time ago that it wasn’t important to have a lot of friends, but to have a few of your closest ones.  I can’t agree more, because Ive seen how true that is.  But now, I’m just a casual friend to those I cling to.  I have no *best* friends.  They all have someone closer, someone they prefer more to hang out with.  I just want it to end.

Not end my life though.  It’s strange, I know things will get better, I know things will straighten themselves out.  It’s just this episode has darkened my life.  I sometimes think it’s worse than suicide, having just to suffer on the thought that things will get better.  So if my friends read this, and recognize who I’m referencing, I want to say I still love both of you, and that I’m not going anywhere.  It’s just I wish I could get help with these emotions.

Most people tell me it’s not true and I only feel this way because I stay up late and get too deep in my thoughts. I know that can’t be the case because I feel lonely all the time. I used to see a therapist but as my life became more chaotic I had fewer and fewer appointments made until one day I called and said I’m okay, that I don’t need help. 

Plus I’ve talked with my therapist before about my chronic feeling of being alone, so I know what he would have said to me. It’s never really changed anything.

Most of them I met when I got there junior year (11th grade) and they had already been a tight knit group but welcomed me. Senior year, I get on the bowling team with them and  I fit into the group even more. After graduating,  I went off to college and kept in touch when possible for the first two years. My 3rd year slot of shit happened and I came home and spent more time working and spending time with the gf. 

Meanwhile the group got even closer. I kept in touch still but became more of the guy who went off to school hours away. But recently, I got in contact with them. a member of the highschool group was coming back to the state for her sister's graduation so she wanted to see the old group. So I went and it felt like old times. The next weekend, one of the guys invited me to another party at their house (alot of the group lives together now) and it was still fun. Kinda awkward because they all have so many inside jokes and strong relationships with one another (its guys and girls, some dating some just friends) but I was still included.

160,hamartiated,1564373893,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

She's pulled away from me several times, which I totally understand. Sometimes you just need to take a step back, get some perspective. All good. But every time she did, I felt lonely and hurt. It was like breaking up all over again.

Last night was particularly bad. We had been talking again for a few days after one of our breaks, and I went to see her. We had a good conversation that I felt cleared the air a bit. But then I left and she started drinking, and her real thoughts came out. I felt personally attacked. She said I don't care about anything, that I moved on too quickly from the breakup, and that I was somehow stupid to want to marry her.

I think this is the last time I'm going to let her hurt me, but it still stings. I'm upset that she would say those things to me, that she thinks of me that way, and that I'm going to lose a close friend.

i am not currently at full time work or in education and when i was i had a few friends who i wasnt necessarily close with and around 3 whom i was closest with. but not seeing them hardly anymore after seeing them almost every day for a long time has made an impact on me. especially as i am not particularly close with any of my family members. as a person who enjoys being alone i thought i would be okay but i have not. even at work i will go full shifts without seeing or speaking to anyone except myself due to the job i am in, meaning when i get home it is especially lonely as i am less busy so the loneliness becomes more prominent and overwhelming as i am less able to try and take my mind off of it. even when going into public places i feel isolated and like i dont want to make social interactions because i dont want to later on feel the punch of loneliness to hit me again because company has been taken away.

I have never had sex. I have never had a real, in-person relationship. Most people do not believe me when I say this.

It's come up a few times over the years with a doctor or therapist and yes, my best friend, as to whether I masturbate because I've always been alone. Certainly I must, for exactly that reason. But I almost never do. And even then it's usually just a necessity, not something to look forward to.

Because seeing nude photos or videos or sexual content just makes me sad. Or numb. It's disheartening. For the longest time, I wouldn't even watch a video with a man in it because I couldn't imagine it. Reality eclipsed fantasy. Sex is just something I didn't get to have. Does anyone else experience this? A sadness instead of arousal?

I've been trying to find someone to spend time with, to cuddle with, in particular, or anything else they might be interested in doing. And I keep getting told reddit isn't the place for that.

202,raviolipocketoli20,1564320601,3,"A embarrassing experience happened to me (20m) last night at a estranged cousin's quinceanera.

 I get dressed in my own style which is like a light blue button up long sleeve shirt, sliver chain, classy watch and khakis with leather shoes. This is really different from what I used to wear in high school. I wore only two shirts in highschool being from a poor family now I'm doing great for myself. What I wore was really different from everyone else who wore suits, nice boots, cowboy hats, and just really formal clothing. I really misread the dress code and given the oppurtunity I would've dressed nicer. For what I was wearing I looked good but I stuck out.

Anyways something unexpected happened and a couple of tables away I see people who I used to go highschool with. I had no friends in highschool and didn't get attention from girls. I had really bad anxiety and decided to go catch up with them to try and get out of my shell. 

I start small talk and catching up with the four of them but I really just talked to the two guys while one girl whispered something in the other girl's ear.

I didn't hear much of what she whispered but I could tell it was something bad just from the way the girl said ""that's the guy that..."", I just shrugged it off and continued my conversation with the guys. The history with me and the girl who wispered something was that I used to talk to her through IG DM to try and take her on a date, this was a few years ago and I don't want to be rude but she let her self go. The girl she was wispering to is really beautiful and she's really outgoing (opposite from me), she and I were making eye contact alot and When I waved to say hi she looked away at the last second leaving me hanging.

I could sense my awkwardness and decided to leave the table to my family's table. I had a bout of depression after and told my family I'd be going now and left the party somewhat early.

 I planned to go to a strip club just to have someone close even if I did have to pay for it but I just settled eating frozen yogurt in my car at the parking lot of a walmart like a fucking loser. The guy I was talking to invited me to downtown to get drunk but that isn't like me so I refused.

But also in the hopes I’d find someone to fix the empty feeling I had inside. (Obviously the second reason wasn’t that great) 

5 months on, and it hit me. I’m not alone, I’m just lonely. I have lots of people around me who love me, I don’t need to be in a relationship to fix this feeling. 
I’m not missing being in a relationship. I’m just missing the routine of being in a couple. 

Once I realised this, I’ve found it a lot easier to cope. The fact that I just need to relearn how to be selfish. I’ve been so focused on how to make him happy and working towards ‘our future’ that I’ve disregarded my own future.

Basically it’s time I made myself a priority, because I’m not alone, I’m just lonely and that’s okay, because it’s just a temporary feeling.

I have severe social anxiety..like everyone apparently does today. Hey look, it's even present online! Not having anyone to talk to gets kinda dull doesn't it? Getting ghosted isn't very fun is it? I found it gets hard to reach out after doing it once or twice and then you get blown off or ignored. Then when it comes time to post, I hesitate. I surely won't hit the 'Post' button after I finish typing this. No way. I mean I didn't even put any thought into this, I'm just.. really freaking lonely!!! But not miserable. Just..bored.

A little about me: I've been struggling with depression and loneliness for a while now, the last years have been especially rough. Loneliness can take a toll on you, but I realized once I started trying to improve my perspective, things just started falling into place.

 The first baby step I took on my journey realizing 

1. It's normal to feel lonely sometimes; it's ok and you're not alone.  

Everyone feels lonely at some point in their lives, some of us more than others. If there weren't so many lonely people out there, this subreddit wouldn't even exist. It happens to some of us you wouldn't even think of. I remember reading about Elvis writing [a note](https://www.facebook.com/evidenceelvispresleyisalive/photos/in-1976-elvis-wrote-the-letter-in-his-las-vegas-suite-and-later-put-them-in-a-tr/540809042736470/) to himself about how he struggles with loneliness. He actually had to deal with it [throughout his life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecidnb6e9Xg)

Lets break this down.

I'm 26 years old and in a place in my life with a TON of free time even though I'm trying to keep myself as busy as possible.

Lets list all my horrific problems shall we?

1) I'm religious (Which isn't a ""problem"" per say). I truly believe it but have a difficult time living it out. I live far away from the closest group to me that shares my faith and I have to travel quite a bit to get there. I overall feel like I complete failure in this part of my life which is ironic cause even the people who know my faults who are part of my faith group do not judge me or make me to feel bad. I'm much harder on myself than basically anyone Ive ever met.

2)I have all kinds of emotional issues. I'm hypersensitive though I typically do an ok job hiding it. I'm insecure, I think no one wants to be around me. Which is obviously not true cause its very common for me to hangout with friends 5+ times a week. If they didn't like me they wouldn't keep inviting me back. I'm a funny guy, i get people to laugh more than I use to (finally developed a sense of humor). But once I get back home its just all gone. All I'm left with is this empty feeling.

3) I want to have a close intimate relationship with a woman. Ive only ever had one girlfriend and it was a long distance relationship (We meet initially online, spent several years as friends, but then decided to be a couple and met in person). So I never really had a lot of physical contact. Its not even about sex for me, its the desire to feel known and loved, to have physical (and emotional) affection. Last time I got a hug was around 6 months ago.

4)I'm an addict. I have an addiction to what I'm going to call ""Lust"", but in a nutshell. When I feel tired and lonely I seek out porn and cybersex to make myself feel better. I just want to feel a connection with someone and so I seek it out. Its become compulsive and destroying my life to be honest. I'll stay up until 4am some nights trying to find someone only to collapse asleep when I can't and then try again the next day. Eventually I'll get through my binging, and try to stop the behavior but then its not to long till I'm back again. I hate myself even while I'm seeking it out. I just don't know how to stop because its the ONLY connection I really feel to other people. I feel like a woman is never going to want me (which objectively is false, thats an issue i'm working through in therapy). At least if I'm voice chatting with a woman online I feel something with someone. At least thats what i tell myself. I'm currently in a 12 step group for it.

5) I'm in a 12 step group, its an over an hour away from where I live, which is exhausting (living in the middle of nowhere sucks especially when you can't move for a few more years). I struggle to call my sponsor , i struggle to call other people and talk about my feelings and emotions. My whole life I was always told that my feelings were wrong, and truth be told many of them (Like the insecurities) ARE wrong. But constantly being told that and living with someone deeply manipulative fucked me up really good. The internet with it anonymity is the only place i feel safe to express myself in any way.

6) I'll never find what I want online. I straight up won't. What do I want? well thats easy. I want to find a woman around my age I can talk to with COMPLETE transparency (while still retaining anonymity). Someone I can explore the sexual stuff with who won't try to make me feel guilty but also won't try to keep me from feeling guilty either. Someone I can talk to and share stuff with right out of the gate without the bullshit and the games. Who has clear boundaries and clearly respects my boundaries. Someone who I can just be, completely emotionally naked with, as well as talk about sexual stuff casually with where she is just as comfortable talking to me about emotions as she is talking to me about a porn video I enjoyed.

Yeah, I'm fucked up. I""m crazy I guess. I feel insane and alone. Ive been in therapy, but its not really helping. I don't know what to do anymore.",lonely,I(26m) and so lonely and broken i can't imagine anyone wanting me,2019-07-28 09:56:10

Hey there!  looking for long-term friendships, kind souls to talk to and (maybe) to push each other to become better people!

i'm into web development, writing poetry, reading books, cooking, MOOCs (even though so far I haven't finished a single one ugh). I'm not your typical guy since i'm not into sports (especially football), and since i can get very emotional most of the time. my taste in music is also unpopular: i can go from lana del rey &amp; sufjan stevens, to lofi hiphop beats, classical music, and those cute small aesthetic tracks that are just SO BEAUTIFUL (please listen to this, i'm sure you'll love it! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl8a9b76GMg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl8a9b76GMg))

i also LOVE learning languages, and occasionally watching netflix shows or anime (just to be distracted) i also play games sometimes on my pc, but the ones i play are also not that well-known; i can use some recommendations though! I would love to travel the world, even though for now I haven't been to any place outside of my country, but i hope i will after highschool or uni. I love to learn about new stuff, new cultures, meet amazing people, and broaden my mind. I like psychology and the idea of analyzing oneself's behavior, or other peoples', and I like to talk about interesting topics which may be qualified as 'deep', and have a nice long chat about something philosophical or just enlightening. small talk, consistently and continuously, just repels me tbh.

Apart of my interests, I can say that i'm fairly an optimistic guy (except when i feel too lonely/sad), with a kind warm heart (which is the thing i value most). some people might say i'm ambitious too!

I think the most important thing i'm looking for in a person is someone who is \*kind\*, who will not ghost and who will try to keep the conversation going! i can get really uncomfortable if i feel like i'm the one trying to get the conversation going and/or the other person doesn't want to talk. most importantly, i'm looking for someone who's willing to become somewhat of close friends, or at least try!

I know a lot of people, and during the last year, i've been trying to be as sociable as possible, going to events, joining clubs, participating in contests, just for me to meet as many people as possible and hopefully find myself a close/best friend. while i have indeed met very nice people, i have sadly not found one who i can truly consider as a very close friend to me, and i really hope i'll get to meet one from here =)

Thank you for reading this long, i'm sure there's a lot of other stuff i didn't say (yea lol after all that; i'm talkative too btw xd, obviously), mainly because i'm still getting to know myself =) hit me up and we can chat on discord, for now!

PS: even if there's not a lot of stuff/any stuff we share in common, still hit me up. we can always learn from each other and get to know new stuff!",lonely,"17M, looking for genuine long-term friendships, who's lonely in spite of good social skills and many acquaintances",2019-07-28 08:29:50

245,theglowaroundthemoon,1564257806,16,"Anyone else feel the absolute emptiest and loneliest in the moments when you're spending time with other people? For me, it happens when realizing the superficiality of everything.

All that's really happening here is my mask is meeting your mask. We are having these conversations that mean nothing; trying to impress one another, putting forth the more acceptable/likable sides of ourselves, and keeping in the most important stuff. I'll admit I'm just as guilty of this. I see it being done all around me so I know the only way I'll be able to 'connect' with other humans is to play along with these dumb games. Social conventions, presenting ourselves in certain ways, engaging in small talk... I'm sure you know what I mean.

I sometimes feel like I've constructed this whole entire social 'self' around who it is that other people expect me to be. Or even who they need me to be. And I just keep waiting. Waiting for someone else to show the slightest hint that they, too, are fucking sick of all the pretending. I just want a genuine soul to soul connection that transcends all of this menial day-to-day stuff. 

At this point it just brings me down so much lower whenever I try to put myself out there and spend time with other people. I feel most comfortable when I'm completely alone - where I can be my truest and freest self - either out doing something peaceful in nature (far away from any other humans) or engrossed in some creative pursuit at home.

247,SirSimonP,1564254648,1,"Taken from my blog, but I had positive comments so thought I'd share

 I'm 25 and feel incredibly lonely.

I grew up in a normal sized town, went to university in another county and now that I'm back I don't fit in with my friends that stayed here. I got a job here with people that are older than me and so don't really socialise with them because they have family's etc. So what can I do? I've tried getting back in with the old group, but am tired of trying, I have looked at starting night classes to meet new people, but some are very expensive and the actual course doesn't interest me. I can't go to a bar and chat to people because that is ""Weird"" and ""creepy"" by today's standards, so what can i do? Advice and comments are appreciated.

I've decided to join a running club, as exercise is good for the body and mind and hopefully running with others will bring new social groups for me. Only one way to find out I guess? I am terrified by this, but need to push myself to get out of the comfort box that is my room.

Anyway, I have constantly worked on stream-lining my life to increase the amount of time I have and work on making certain jobs I have to do more efficient. However as a lonely person with quite a bit of free time and a routine which is probably bad for me, I have decided to use this as a positive thing. I am using it to watch movies which are supposed to be great, read books and the news, this is difficult and sometimes I don't want to do it, I just want to play video games or sleep or watch TV. But it needs to be done, in order to be able to socialise I need to be able to get pop culture references and be able to relate to what is going on in the world and this is a key part. In my mind, if I don't do this I won't fit in when I do get out there and socialise (whenever that will be!), it's a small step and I am finding things I really enjoy, new writers and favourite movies (Shawshank Redemption is amazing!). This kind of growth is something that I haven't experienced in years and it feels great.

In terms of holidays, which can be a big issue for people, I recently went on a ""Contiki"" which is a holiday for solo travellers, basically a bus load of solo travellers do a certain route and see certain things etc. There is a guide and they make it so much fun, you can meet so many cool people and make real friends. It is definitely worth it, scary as hell as first - but so much fun! There are a lot of different companies that do it, can be anywhere in the world, can be as long or as short as you want it to be, so just look into and take a risk, I did and I will do another one soon and am looking forward to it. I did a tour from New York to New Orleans and visited the Kennedy Space Centre, Miami and Orlando to name a few, it was Epic!

I speak to my therapist a lot about the loneliness I feel and about how I feel left behind, and honestly I'd much rather have no friends then have friends who don't make the effort. If they don't want me then I don't want them, simple as that. I know that isn't easy for everyone and everyone has their own battles going on, but I have just given up with trying to be ""in"" with the group, if they want a coffee or something then that's okay, but it has been over half a year and I can't see that happening now!

I've gone on too long and I apologise for this, but the topic of loneliness is something that isn't seen as being common in millennial's. This is because people are too busy looking at their mobile phones to notice and posting on Instagram to distract them from being lonely and make themselves look more social than they are. I hate it and I hate what social media has done to today's generation.

While I am not at all ashamed of my illnesses, beliefs nor hobbies, I know I’d be judged hardcore. Just like my aunt I guess.

So, in conclusion: I’ll have to cry it all out and get used the fact that no one will ever love me romantically.

268,The_Ghost_Muffin,1564224426,1,"Ever since people moved on from Xbox 360 to Xbox One, I've just been feeling pretty lonely with most of my childhood friends now playing on the One instead of the 360. It also makes Minecraft more lonely since I have so much stuff and a bunch of shelters but it's all useless if I don't have someone to share it with. When I can start working next year, I'm either gonna save up for the Xbox One with Minecraft just so I can try reuniting with some of my best friends and have one of those ""Me and the boys"" moments.

It's been so long since I've actually seen/talked to any of my Irl friends and it just sucks, knowing that they see me as the annoying little brother and coincidentally, I am the annoying little brother. I sort of feel as if my online friends think of me like this as well and it just sucks since they're all I have since I don't have much of a relationship with my family since we all just mind our own business except for my brother and sister who are pretty much friends. 

I did manage to reunite with two of my female best friends (One younger by a year and the other older by a year) but apparently, the younger friend lied about me and even said that we dated even though that never happened at all. I did date the older friend though at one point since they had a crush on me and I was too scared to say no but we're still pretty good friends to this day. 

I usually just stay holed up in my house, on my computer or Xbox, and playing video games, watching YouTube, and talking to my online friends. My parents criticize me for doing so even though I only go out with friends about once every 2-3 months. If you're still reading for some reason, I'm sorry for how long this is but it's just sorta therapeutic to talk about some of my problems like this.

I do try to go to conventions and even spent my birthday at one but even then, I still get left out the majority of times and just stick with an older cosplayer () I met who also got left out from the main group most of the time.

I wanted to change myself this summer by exercising to get rid of my noodle arms, using Duolingo to learn German and maybe another language, and just improving myself in every way I can but it's just turning into another summer of isolation.

I always feel left out at any and all events, sorta just making me feel like that one weird person. After I sang in another town for 2 days, I made some friends, which felt nice since I felt like I stuck out, being the only boy in Soprano 1 (There was like 2-3 other guys in my choir) but I never managed to get in contact with those friends I made which made me silently break down while thinking about my loneliness since they treated me better than most of my Irl friends. I just want good friends.

292,leader_kim_jong_spez,1564202539,1,"Ended a long term relationship toward the end of last year. I didn't take the relationship seriously and didn't put in enough effort. She used to be obsessed with me, but I took what I had for granted. If I could go back I'd work harder to keep her obsessed with me and I'd make sure to show her I felt about her. I always thought I would be thinking about marriage, buying a house, and kids by the time I was 30 but here I am, about to turn 29 and I'm single and alone living in an apartment. We used to live in a nice house that had a beautiful yard. I had an office room, a garage and things were looking good, although I didn't realize it at the time.

The friends I had been socializing with for the past few years and getting to know were my ex gf's long time friend group, and understandibly, I don't get invited to their social events anymore. Me and her met through one of my best friends from high school who is part of that group. I thought me and him at least would be able to retain a friendship but I've reached out to him and been blown off so many times that I now understand I'm losing one of my best friends through this breakup. 

I've reached out to old friends and had good conversations and caught up with them, but they are all busy with their lives and SOs. I can't pester them any more without revealing how needy and lonely I am. I'm not going to be able to build those friendships back up to what they once were.

I work from home so I spend all day inside a small apartment and only have human interaction over the phone and text chat. The days are all running together. Wake up, do work that I've grown to hate, then kill time until I go to sleep.

I used to be fine being alone. ""Killing time"" was awesome because I could get into a video game or something and entertain myself. In fact me needing ""alone time"" caused several fights in my last relationship. Welp now all my time is alone time and im miserable. Turns out It's not what I want at all. 

I feel like I've died inside. I can't entertain like I used to. All of my old hobbies and things I have such great memories of doing feel so pointless. I'll try to force myself to sit down and play games that I used to obsess over but I just feel like I'm wasting my time and turn it off. All the knowlege and random skills I've been so proud to obtain mean nothing. They aren't going to help me meet anyone.

I feel like I have run out of time to do anything that doesn't directly contribute to improving things or doesn't feel like ""progress"". The only thing that matters to me now is getting a girlfriend or getting back with my ex... unhealthy thought I know. She randomly texts me sometimes and says shit like she misses me and we catch up but nothing happens. Ive said we should catch up in person sometime but she hasn't taken me up on it and im not going to push it. I need to move on. I know I should be able to be happy alone but I'm not. 

I want someone to do things with, to travel with and build a relationship with.  I've learned from my mistakes in my last relationship. The only problem is meeting someone. I just don't know how... I'm planning to do online dating but I still need to get in better shape and get better pictures before I start. Maybe online dating will work out and im complaining for nothing, but from what I read it is difficult for men, so a part of me feels like being trapped in my apartment is all I have left to live for.

313,throwthisoneaway424,1564187931,8,"[[Warning: This post is hella long because I needed to get a lot off my chest. Sorry/thanks in advance if you read it. If not that's all good.]]

This kinda all started when I (19F) met a guy online. This guy was very sweet and was immediately kinda flirty with me. I liked that type of attention so I kept it going just as a playful thing. He vented to me a lot and I felt comfortable around him. Hearing him vent, feeling comfortable to vent my own frustrations. He also liked me as I was, and I never felt like I had to change myself for his praise. I fell for him and I thought something could come out of it. I told him I liked him, eventually he said he liked me back, but I don't find that to be true anymore. I lost him because I feel like I pushed him away. I do that a lot I guess. I try to get people away before I can mess it up for myself, but every time I mess it up more.

Anyways, rewind a little bit: while I was with him, my mood would shift very quickly from happy to sad, and my friends noticed. My friends had a bad opinion of this guy because he was on the same server as us and he would often cause some ruckus. As a staff member of the server, I was kind of playing both sides, so to speak. One of my friends told me that she noticed that I was always sad in the morning but happy at night (when we would talk). It was true. At the time I thought she was 100% right and that this was a huge red flag, that he ignored me when it wasn't convenient to him. But I also have an anxious-insecure attachment so I feel like I was just hyped on the new relationship and felt sad when he was gone, not that he was ignoring me (because he wasn't, people can't be with me 24/7, I realize that. But when she told me that, I just started crying because it just made sense and I respected her opinion a lot, so I just went with it.) Maybe she was still right, I don't know. But I don't think that was what was happening exactly. But I was so convinced at the time, and I came to him about it. I said I need time and that was that. I immediately felt soul-crushed and wanted to run back to him. He started ignoring me after that. I hate losing people. It's been almost 3 weeks since then and he still doesn't talk to me the way he did before if at all. I feel like we will never mend this relationship and we were only able to know each other for a short period of time. But I really really felt like he ""got it"". Like, everything he would say or complain about, I felt. He would admire my respond time on texts, he would complain about people who use others for their own benefit, etc. I thought he would be the last person to ditch me. But he's kinda doing everything that he was preaching people shouldn't. So now I don't know who to trust.

At the same time, though, his reaction feels justified because I feel like I did the worst thing I could have possibly done to that guy. He used to vent about how he doesn't know who really truly likes him or is just using him, and how he never feels like his relationships can be trusted. And then I immediately go and break his trust by telling him I have to go because it's not convenient for me anymore. And that it's too much. Of course he hates me. I betrayed him. And now I got back exactly what I dished out.

During the time that I was ""grieving"" I would rant to my friends a lot. Eventually they too got pretty bored of me I think. I feel like I grew very distant from a lot of them, and none of them reach out to me anymore, even to share something funny they found online like they usually did. The negativity got to them, and yeah I don't blame them. But now I have no one. I'm estranged from my family. (I don't talk closely to my mom, my dad, or extended family.) I have no friends in real life. And I don't mean that ""my friends don't invite me out with them"". No, I mean actually no friends. I dropped out of High School at 15 and then immediately went to community college after getting my degree equivalent. Community college students don't make friends. I know absolutely no one. I'm transferring to University this semester at a state school, and my main drive for even pursuing higher education was to meet people. That's why I'm going in debt. So I can maybe have friends. But this experience is so destructive that I don't even want to meet anyone anymore. I just wanna lay here and forget I exist. I want my friends back and I want the guy that I really felt this connection with back even more.

I keep texting this guy hoping he'll for some reason want to take me back, or listen to my problems, but of course I don't get a response, or the response is never what I want. He just dismisses me, and I can't help but think about how it's my fault. Or, at least, that if I hadn't listened to that friend back then, none of this would have had to go like this and my life wouldn't have been this terrible. I could have developed a good relationship and I could have kept my friends by being a more positive person. Lots of ""coulds"" because I know there were possibilities of it going wrong. But it's so much worse when you know it was self-inflicted. I caused my own pain, and now I have to live in it and rot. And I keep digging myself deeper with the more unanswered texts I send. It's like, how desperate can I get until I implode?

I'm feeling very hopeless right now and I don't know what I can do anymore because nothing feels worth doing. I just sit at my desk or lay in bed and listen to depressing music until I fall asleep, usually sleeping way longer than I should. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've consistently felt terrible. There are some better days but every time I think I'm getting better, the next day just destroys me. It's like I can be fine and then suddenly I hit a wall and my energy is at 0 again. It feels like the whole world is coming crashing down around me a bit. I wish none of this happened. I wish I had people to talk to.

I just sent him a long message a few hours ago telling him that I felt really alone and needed someone to vent to. I've seen him go online and offline a couple times, meaning I'm assuming he's read it. I feel pathetic and worthless right now, and frankly- embarrassed with myself. It all happened so quickly and all at once, me estranging myself from my family and the sudden change from ALWAYS getting attention from this boy and my friends to absolutely none at all. The internet was a place for me to escape because of how shitty my real life is. Like, I literally joined this server that all my friends are in *because* I lost all my friends and dropped out of school. After 3 years of being in there I built up some amazing connections. But now my online life is shitty too, and I don't really have anywhere else to go. If my offline and online are both this bad, what's left?

I needed to write all of this just to get it out of my system. Sorry again for the post being this long.

316,itstimetodo,1564184997,3,"SHORT VERSION:

I'm pretty broken as a person, but at least I'm self aware. I come online and try and get to know people sometimes because I don't have to hide anything. I can be completely open and the worst that can happen is they block me. Ive noticed a pattern. I tend to click with people who are broken in the same way I am. People who are lonely, insecure, depressed, just trying to get through life but there isn't much joy. Honestly there is no joy at all.

I'm religious but a failure at practicing what I believe, the most inexperienced S*x addict on the planet (With ALL of my acting out being online). I Just want to feel something with someone and I go down bad path after bad path trying to find it. I want love but if I can't find that then at least I can find someone to put up with me. I just want to numb the pain, the never ending pain that seems to crash through my life.

LONG VERSION:

&gt; Lets break this down.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm 26 years old and in a place in my life with a TON of free time even though I'm trying to keep myself as busy as possible.
&gt; 
&gt;  Lets list all my horrific problems shall we?
&gt; 
&gt;    I'm religious (Which isn't a ""problem"" per say). I truly believe it but have a difficult time living it out. I live far away from the closest group to me that shares my faith and I have to travel quite a bit to get there. I overall feel like I complete failure in this part of my life which is ironic cause even the people who know my faults who are part of my faith group do not judge me or make me to feel bad. I'm much harder on myself than basically anyone Ive ever met.
&gt; 
&gt;   2)I have all kinds of emotional issues. I'm hypersensitive though I typically do an ok job hiding it. I'm insecure, I think no one wants to be around me. Which is obviously not true cause its very common for me to hangout with friends 5+ times a week. If they didn't like me they wouldn't keep inviting me back. I'm a funny guy, i get people to laugh more than I use to (finally developed a sense of humor). But once I get back home its just all gone. All I'm left with is this empty feeling.
&gt; 
&gt;   3) I want to have a close intimate relationship with a woman. Ive only ever had one girlfriend and it was a long distance relationship (We meet initially online, spent several years as friends, but then decided to be a couple and met in person). So I never really had a lot of physical contact. Its not even about sex for me, its the desire to feel known and loved, to have physical (and emotional) affection. Last time I got a hug was around 6 months ago.
&gt; 
&gt; 4)I'm an addict. I have an addiction to what I'm going to call ""Lust"", but in a nutshell. When I feel tired and lonely I seek out porn and cybersex to make myself feel better. I just want to feel a connection with someone and so I seek it out. Its become compulsive and destroying my life to be honest. I'll stay up until 4am some nights trying to find someone only to collapse asleep when I can't and then try again the next day. Eventually I'll get through my binging, and try to stop the behavior but then its not to long till I'm back again. I hate myself even while I'm seeking it out. I just don't know how to stop because its the ONLY connection I really feel to other people. I feel like a woman is never going to want me (which objectively is false, thats an issue i'm working through in therapy). At least if I'm voice chatting with a woman online I feel something with someone. At least thats what i tell myself. I'm currently in a 12 step group for it.
&gt; 
&gt;  5) I'm in a 12 step group, its an over an hour away from where I live, which is exhausting (living in the middle of nowhere sucks especially when you can't move for a few more years). I struggle to call my sponsor , i struggle to call other people and talk about my feelings and emotions. My whole life I was always told that my feelings were wrong, and truth be told many of them (Like the insecurities) ARE wrong. But constantly being told that and living with someone deeply manipulative fucked me up really good. The internet with it anonymity is the only place i feel safe to express myself in any way.
&gt; 
&gt;   6) I'll never find what I want online. I straight up won't. What do I want? well thats easy. I want to find a woman around my age I can talk to with COMPLETE transparency (while still retaining anonymity). Someone I can explore the sexual stuff with who won't try to make me feel guilty but also won't try to keep me from feeling guilty either. Someone I can talk to and share stuff with right out of the gate without the bullshit and the games. Who has clear boundaries and clearly respects my boundaries. Someone who I can just be, completely emotionally naked with, as well as talk about sexual stuff casually with where she is just as comfortable talking to me about emotions as she is talking to me about a porn video I enjoyed.
&gt; 
&gt;   Yeah, I'm fucked up. I""m crazy I guess. I feel insane and alone. Ive been in therapy, but its not really helping. I don't know what to do anymore.",lonely,"I'm tired lonely and fucked up. Here is everything wrong with me, both the long and the short versions.",2019-07-27 09:49:57

I started becoming an introvert. I would never leave the house, my friends (at the time) would always invite me out, but I'd refuse.

This carried on over the years, I'd slowly lose all of my friends, and now, I literally have no friends. I never leave my house, thankfully I don't need to even for my job, I haven't had person-to-person contact with someone in a year. I do like it sometimes, but it gets too much. I am alone with my thoughts too much it just all comes crashing down.

I have been lonely for two and a half years, and it's taking a toll on my mind, because I am struggling with the conversation and understanding others. It hurts me to always have to contact people first, yet I see the same people calling others first. And when I say I feel lonely they are like - oh, you know, we all don't have time - but that's a lie - I see them having a plenty of time for others. It's not like I can't make friends or that people dislike me - seems like the opposite, but I don't know why everyone acts like I don't exist, even if I am trying. For all this time, for only 4 days someone gave me a minute of their attention, for all this two and a half years. It feels especially horrible, because, for almost all this time I have been severely sick - daily pains all over my body, and I lie in the bed for a long time because I am tired, having headaches, and so on... And they know it: when I call them I am always sick and laying, still, not even a one support message. It hurts - sometimes I have thoughts of sending them a message how they hurt me neglecting my existence, and telling them to erase my number because I will erase theirs, and I don't act out because there's one hairline of hope it will be better; but it never does.

Did anyone have a similar experience? How do you stay at peace with people like these? How do you find strength to continue? I am not seeking to make friends here, but I would love if someone answered me: how do you battle with this?",lonely,Lonely for 2+ years,2019-07-27 06:23:02

I’d spend most of my time by myself watching movies, tv shows and listening to music. I was fine, I was happy. Then I started working and things changed. 

The group of people I’m working with are also students like me. We were all strangers coming into this place, but as the weeks went by, they slowly began socializing with each other. Negative thoughts crept up on me.  They made it look so easy. Making friends has never been easy for me. 

Yesterday was the worst day ever. It was a slow day so there wasn’t much to do. They were all talking to each other, laughing, and having a good time. Then there was me, an outcast, alone. My mind was filled with negative thoughts at this point. I started thinking that maybe there’s something wrong with me. Why was it easy for them but so hard for me? I was getting frustrated and angry seeing them like that. Then these feelings turned to sadness.

A few days ago, I attempted suicide during one of my university lectures. Yes, in a lecture in front of about one hundred people, who only noticed that something was wrong with me about 45 minutes into it, even after crying and having shoelaces tied around my neck. Yes, you may call it attention seeking. In a way, I wanted somebody to see me. I wanted somebody to care for me in a way that nobody jas ever cared for me. That wasn't the complete motivation for my attempt, but I can't lie and say that it wasn't at the back of my mind. I wanted people to care. In the end, they only cared for a few minutes because I was interrupting their lecture. How inconsiderate of me. 

In the aftermath, I haven't felt more invisible. None of them even looked me in the eye when I walked. My only friend in the class, hours removed from my attempt, sent a message saying that we should distance ourselves from each other. If I felt like dirt before, I felt non existent now. That's how I feel, non existent. Alone. Nothing. Maybe I should have finished the job that day. It's not like anybody would care, right?

I know there are some who see this as a selfish act. It's okay if you do. I can't change your thoughts about it. I know some people see me as dramatic. It's okay if you do. I just wanted to get this off my chest because after my attempt, I've never felt lonelier. Maybe after this post, I'll feel even more lonely. Maybe the only solution is my death.

I'm very picky about the people I keep around me, I'm pretty radical and I need my friends to match that energy. Now, take that and apply it to the fact that I'm a Lesbian, who went to a **Catholic** highschool in Texas. That environment was slim pickings because of the rampant homophobia, and no pickings with girlfriends. I was the only openly wlw (women who love women) at my **Catholic** highschool, which I attended all 4 years. So, that whole time I only made 2 close friends. One of those friends I had a falling out with my Sophomore year of college, and the other lives an hour away from me so we don't see eachother often. I have 4 friends in total, my best friend/roommate, her boyfriend, and my only remaining friend from highschool who lives an hour away, and my sister. I turn 21 in 2 months  so as of now I can't even go out to bars with my best friend/roommate who is 21. My friend who lives an hour away has mental health issues (and a boyfriend as well) so I have a difficult time motivating her to hang out. My new job has yet to start because their shitty HR department takes eons to do a single background check, and I'm not involve in any extracurriculars. I go to a therapist every week but the last 2 weeks my therapist hasn't show up to the appointments. The first time it happened I texted her and called, and a few minutes later I only got a single text from saying she was in the hospital. My next appointment was supposed to be today so I called and left a voicemail but she has yet to get back to me and I'm afraid something tragic has happened to her. I guess that's the main reason I'm really here, because my therapist is out of commission until further notice, and I need to express myself to somebody, in some way and soon, because I definitely spent too much time recently zoning out in a haze of depression recently. I've been using Tindr for over a year and have gone out on so many firsts dates it ridiculous. The only girl I did take on a second date moved to a school in another state up north and my most recent date stood me up. Both my best friends have boyfriends as I've already stated, and they have a great sex life too. I've never had good sex, or a serious relationship (a few months with a dumb boy in highschool doesn't count for me). I'm extroverted and make a lot of friendly acquaintances but rarely any **friends,** ya know? I'm not really asking for advice but I'd be glad to receive it. I know what I have to do, hit up my sister and old friend who both live an hour away, start my job, turn 21, join some student clubs, and go out on more dates. But rn I seem to be in a rut where I can only do 2 of those 5 things (go on dates and hang with my sister or old friend), and with the luck I've had I'm getting more and more reluctant to put my heart out there just to receive another dose of disappoint in dating. And because my sister works so much I doubt she'll be able to hang anytime soon (of course I'm going to ask anyways tho). And my old friend... it's like pulling teeth to get her to hang out.

368,hamartiated,1564107276,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

371,darkawsten,1564104667,1,"   So I just moved to America a few months ago from Japan. I had lived in Japan for 4 years and before that, America again. I've only made one friend here so far and he lives half an hour away. 

 It's like most of my friends have drifted away since I moved. The 13 hour difference doesn't help but they don't even try and reach out. It makes me sad because I don't want to reach out to them if they don't respond to me.

  I'm starting highschool, hopefully, I'm not sure if I passed my test, but if I did I start August 7th and I'm hoping I can get out of this lonely pit for a bit. But then I'm moving again in a year so my life is never ending loneliness. My brother doesn't get it and he's moving out soon, so I have no one to talk to except my therapist who I see once a month. 

 I wish I had some friends, it's not the same to talk to them over the internet which might make me sound stupid. But I love interacting irl because you can hug people and see them laughing.

I'm not by any means claiming to be a Saint or a people pleaser, but you can ""feel"" it when you do right by others. Deep down in your chest. I've fucked up plenty in my lifetime. Offer an ear to someone else who is hurting. Help someone out by lending a hand. Show compassion and empathy. Respect others the way you would like to be treated. That sort of thing. 

I never did any of those things while consciously asking for anything in return. But I can't help but wonder after all of the years if it ever meant anything. I still haven't found peace and just feel shattered by loneliness. When will my turn come? At 30 years old I'm sure not getting any younger. 

It's like a flame that's slowly going out, suffocating without any oxygen. I try to be happy for others and that sad feeling just ends up slipping out like blood to a bandaged wound. I keep quiet and suffer in silence despite spilling ""blood"" everywhere I go. It's like I'm trying to convince to myself I'm okay when low key I'm losing consciousness and the will to fight on.

Maybe peace will come in another lifetime. Maybe I just haven't erased enough negativity yet. Maybe this is just it until I stop breathing and I've been a sucker my whole lifetime. 

I don't plan on changing my ways for worse but I can't help but feel more and more sad. I know I'm not entitled to anything. The natural order of things should be altruism and cooperation. But does it really get you anywhere in life? I can't say for certain.

I am accepted in high school that i wanted most to be in(interior design and design for industrial items) but i dont think people will accept me there... I have recently moved to another city fo finish 8th grade (in my country school goes like this)

1st-8th grade(normal school)
Than it goes again 1st-4th year (highschool)
And 1st -4th year collage 

In my new school (the one that i went to finish 8th grade) was horrible i got bullied,(i am a pretty big guy and muscular) almoast got beaten to critical state (it was 5 them against single me) even teachers gave me lower grades that other got even if i had answer same questions....

But my suffering didnt start there. I used to live very happily life with my family(mom ,dad,gradma..and so on) but when i started going to school it all fell apart...

My mother's mom died when i was attending 1st grade(7yrs old). I didnt even cry then i just knew that my grandma is gone... Soon after that my mom got in fight with my fathers mother and i have nevver seen them again until my parents divorced..

It was good in school I was good with every one but my teacher....(where i live u only had 1 teacher in 1st-4th year of school) she always blamed everything on me (my slow writing and so on..) so my frends started hateing me bcz my teacher did so... i only had 4 frends then who knew that is BS...

When i was 4th grade, my parents got devorced(my father cheated on my mother) and i was left to live with my mother....

Only her and me in whole house... Her work schedule was like this 

every day she goes to work at 7am and comes home at 7 or even 8pm so i had to get used to cooking my meals and makeing dinner for my mother.( I finish school at 6.15 pm and im home at 6.30pm (i lived in a small town)

It was like that untill the 7th grade started it was like i was blind the whole time and i realized that everyone is avoiding me so i just stopped talking with everyone and knew i was going to be alone....

One of my best girl-friends relaised that i had changed and asked what the reason of it was, I didn't know what to say so i just said ""I'm leaving"" that was near the end of 7th grade

No one knew that i was going to move places and not finish school with them....Even i found out that at the start of the second half of the 7th grade.

So on summer i moved to other town where my dad lives to finish school...

I thought the things are gonna change that i will be acepted like ther new friend...But those were only thoughts it was like hell near the end of 8th grade i met 2 guys that accepted me but i knew that they are soon gonna be gone bcz im not going to the same high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Freshman Year = Things going into freshman year we're really good I had a solid group of friends from the year before and on the first day of school my friend group (all boys) clashed with a friend group of all girls from seniors to sophomores and it was pretty great for maybe a month or two then everyone started dating as expected and that quickly turned to breakups which broke the group up. I then became really good friends with one of the girls in the group and one of my best friends started to hit on her which I was angry about cause I was interested in her but had not expressed to him or her that I liked her so me being really dumb in this situation I decide to completely cut off my best friend of two years prior because I was mad over a girl. Me and this girl became really really close we would tell each other crazy personal shit that was happening in our life's and it was ""good"" but this whole time I had been getting slowly more depressed for many different reasons one of which was that I had basically cut off all of my other friends cause I just wanted to spend my time with this girl. she had a lot of personal issues and family issues so I got this weird joy of """"""Helping"""""" this girl out with her problems and she would do the same for me. to shorten it up we were both just really toxic for each other and I had gotten so depressed that for weeks I would sit and my room thinking about dying and my father who I lived with at the time did not seem to understand what was happening with me he would just say ""quit moping around."" I was in therapy at the time and I had expressed these thoughts to my therapist and by law they have to tell my parent that I was having suicidal thoughts and so my therapist brought my dad in and explained this to him and all he said was ""OK"" and not a word when we got home. I know now that he probably just didn't know how to handle the situation but man did that hurt because to me at the time it just sounded like he didn't care if I died. Skip forward to spring break that year me, my brother, mom and stepdad all went out to visit my oldest brother in Seattle and I was at my worst I was so sad and depressed and mom saw it immediately and we were eating at a restaurant and she tells me to follow her outside and she asked if everything was alright which I can not express to y'all how amazing that felt because up to that point nobody tried to ask me what was up even though I would be in my room for weeks at a time crying and just having these awful thoughts and even after my therapist had told my dad that I was having these thoughts which blows my mind that he didn't even tell anyone he just kept it to himself. My mom then tells me that I should come and live with her and my stepdad for the summer which I was very much not for at first because my only backbone was a few friends I still had (they were toxic people for me and I was also toxic) but it was all I had. I eventually accepted that I had a real problem and that I should get away from the environment I was in. I moved there that summer and man was it a breath of fresh air I really got to thinking about what I liked and what I wanted to do, It was a really good experience and I got a job there that I really enjoyed so when it came time to go back I just thought to myself ""what's there for me at my dads house?"" and the answer was nothing I had built something kinda decent for myself living with my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

Sophomore Year = Sophomore year was when the loneliness really started to take place, I was in a new school and I was hopeless making friends so throughout the year I maybe talked to one kid for a week and that was it. I just could not make friends I was so scared to talk to people after all that stuff that happened freshman year so I showed up every day did the work went home and copy-paste the whole year. After that year ended my mom got offered a job maybe 2 hours from where my dads' house is and that wasn't a big deal to me as I was still away from all those kids I had met freshman year. Also when I left the school nobody tried to contact me or anything, not that anyone could even contact me nobody had my number or knew me which sucked.

&amp;#x200B;

Junior Year = Basically the same thing as sophomore year (moved to a new school and didn't make any friends) but this time since I was only 2 hours away from my old high school I got into contact with an old friends from 8th/Freshman year who was always nice to me and we never had issues so I said why not hang out with him. We started to hang out somewhat often and he quickly introduced me to weed (he was a massive stoner) and that year I got heavily into smoking and it was a great way to forget about all the loneliness and other bullshit I had going on cause it just set my mind totally straight it was pretty amazing but that quickly became a crutch and at the height of my weed smoking I was going through about an OZ a month winch was clearly an issue I would smoke instead of doing shit that I needed to be doing. I would show up to school high out of my mind but since everybody overlooked me anyway nobody really noticed. It was a really great way to get through school but it was doing more harm than good. Which brings me to now I've stopped smoking and it's been about a month since I stopped and it's actually been pretty great and I cut off the friend who introduced me to it because I know if I continue being his friend I won't be able to stop smoking (nothing against him I think he is a fine person) but it was sending me down a path that I do not want to go down. Now I have no friends which is hard but I have my mom who has been an angel to me this whole time. It's just hard going day in and day out with no friends, nobody to hang out with or go see a movie with or whatever.

I can’t even hook up with anyone. I couldn’t if I tried. I’m no womanizer by any stretch of means. I’d like to think I’m good looking. Friends say I’m a blast to be around. I’m funny, passionate, caring, selfless, I have all of these traits that you’d want in someone. But here I am, writing this depressing ass letter to myself about how I will never find someone. 

I’m craving someone to cuddle with, someone to talk with at night, someone to struggle with, and someone to grow old with. This thought of being with someone consumes me every single dam day of my life. I can’t stop thinking about it. I just wanna be with someone. It’s not fair. It seems as if like all my friends around me have a girlfriend, hell, some are engaged/married already. I’m only 23 but I’m confident as hell that I won’t make it to 30 with this mindset that I have had. Hell, I’m starting to think I won’t make it to 25. I’ve been thinking like this ever since late high school and it’s not going to change. Ive already tried and attempted suicide once and sometimes I wish I went through with it. But other times, I hold on to this thought that I will find someone eventually. All it takes is one. So I push through and just take it one day at a time. But everyday, the thought of trying to kill myself is in the back of my mind. I’ve been going to the gym a lot recently. It’s  something to try to keep my mind off it and it works for as long as I’m there. But at the end of the day, it all just comes back. 

I have these dreams that seem so fucking real. Holding and caressing someone that I care about. Seeing them smile. That’s what sticks out about these dreams, the smile. I would love to make a woman happy. It’s not a particular woman that I dream about, but many different ones on almost a nightly occurrence. And then I wake up. My dreams are so much better than the reality that I live in. That’s the worst part. Living a useless life that’s not going anywhere. 

Maybe I’m just not fit to live a full life. I’m not ready for the real world. I can’t do anything right. I failed 2 classes. I still live with my parents. I lie to them constantly about my performance in school. I’m a failure. Now as I’m writing about it, the more depressed I’m getting. I’m so fucking alone. I know being in a relationship won’t fix all of my problems but it’s something I’ve always wanted to experience but I just can’t seem to get it. 

All of the advice I get is to try to love myself before I love anyone else. That’s all I hear. It’s horseshit. Even if I did love myself, it wouldn’t change a thing. No women out there would still wanna be with me even if I was in the best possible shape of my life physically and mentally. I go to counseling, it doesn’t help. I vent, they listen, but it just brings out these feelings of hopelessness and not being loved that I try to hide. Nothing is going to change and quite frankly, I’m fine with going on this path that I’m on, hopefully it will bring me closer to ending my life, this time for good.

I feel like I can fly, am free but then.... I am still chained to the ground.... My hands are still tied... My body is constantly changing.. My face - not the same as yesterday... My mind is not my own... 

I have many wished and many desires but when I start to think none of them are really mine, are they? I want to polish my nails, dress differently... But do I really? After all I'm not allowed to if I want to live... I make goals and plans but then dismiss them after a day thinking that they're foolish...

All of what I'm feeling is... Unknown.. I do not know if what I'm feeling is love or a intent to murder and destroy. One moment I'm grabbing my razor and another I put it down without applying that beautiful colour... I put a rope around my neck and next thing I know - I have stowed it away...

Some time ago I could have told this to someone but of course they wouldn't have understood. Now I learnt that it doesn't matter to whom you tell.. They won't understand and so you'll only be wasting your breath..... 

I am very lonely but... Can people fix it? I used to think yes... But now, after all that happened, it seems that they can't to shit.. I am the only one who can fix it.. After all I am the only one who you can truly trust. Who won't turn your back on you and leave you waiting in the cold rain...

I'm lonely as f\*\*\*. I have tried using Reddit chat rooms, some posts here and there, but the reality is, no one wants to talk to(for long) or be friends with someone that's basically depressed or a downer. They might talk to you once. But that's pretty much it. I found some really nice people that lent me their ear and listened to me vent about my recent shitty break-up but, they are gone, or their lives are busier than I imagined. 

I somehow keep hoping I'll be able to find some people( just to be online or real-life friends) from a post or chat on Reddit. Chatting is ok to a point, but I feel more comfortable when I can hear the other person and they can hear me and have a voice conversation, not via phone, but apps that allow you to call someone, without having their phone number.

452,moody_jazz,1563987140,1,"I think about this every single day. Why no one ever texts me, calls me, why no one asks me to hang out, why I'm always left on read, etc. People tell me nothing is wrong with me, but I feel really really really worthless when I constantly am reminded that **everyone else** has friends except me. It almost makes me want to kill myself, how I haven't been able to figure out the source of my unlikeability for over 25 years.

Am I awkward? I used to be as a kid, but not so much now.

Am I quiet? Usually, yes, I tend to socially withdraw from others. Even worse when I'm depressed, which I have been for the past 2 years 

Am I boring? I think so? I'm not really good at making others laugh, for example. I don't have a lot of hobbies or interests either, because depression makes it hard to be interested in anything.   And it's not exactly like I can just talk about books and games all the time; I have to be able to talk about my personal life too, which I struggle with for various reasons.

Do I have low self esteem? Apparently. I mean, I think I'm worthless because I don't have close friends. I think I'm worth less than those who do have friends, lots of friends, close friends, etc (even if that's not actually true). I don't really like the sound of my voice, either, nor my body in general, it's complicated.

Apparently some people tell me I make them feel uncomfortable. Like when I ask them to hang out one on one, it apparently makes them feel like they're put on the spot. But I don't really know what I do that makes others uncomfortable. I don't think I am very touchy feely (in fact, I've developed a bit of an anxiety about even hugging people because I fear I might be intruding in on their personal space), and it's not like I do really weird, bizarre things during social interactions. In fact, most of the time I just try to talk like a ""normal"" person, so I don't really get why people tell me this.

When people stop replying to my messages, I often wonder if it's because I'm not interesting them. Because I think I could be a good listener, but people never text me first, even to talk about themselves. They don't see me as someone they can trust, apparently. Am I not trustworthy, is this what they think about me?

Whenvcer I post about my loneliness people are like, ""You have to love yourself first fren, work on yourself, try to be happy being alone, meet new people"". And they're not **wrong**. But I don't think at this point it's possible for me to be happy alone all the time. Alone as in, ""I don't even get texts"" alone. I've reached an all time low in loneliness, whereas a few years back people would at least message me in group chats and I would actually feel included. Now I just feel disconnected from everyone. And the whole idea of ""detaching your self esteem on the number of friends you have, or how much they like/love you, how close you are with them"", it's so much easier said than done. I have to remind myself like hundrends of times a day that I'm not worthless, when I see a bunch of people on the streets calling their friends, getting a ton of text notifications on their phones, people on reddit even talking about how much they are loved by their friends. It all makes me want to die, because it always makes me think that I'm never good enough for anyone.",lonely,Rant about how I can't figure out the reason that I'm so unlikeable.,2019-07-25 02:52:20

465,Royal_Blueberry,1563944307,3,"In a bit over a year and a half I've lost two very close friends, mostly due to being lied to by both of them.  One of them I had been friends with for 5 - 10+ years (depending on how you look at it) and the other not too long, but she meant a lot to me anyway.

I had another friend that I've barely spoken to in over two years now and while I probably could talk to him, I wouldn't know what to say.  Drama and life (ugh) pushed him away.

A very close friend of mine just moved from being a day trip away to the other side of the country as well, although we're ok but who knows when I'll get to see him next.

My girlfriend of 13+ months (who would ""never leave me"") broke up with me back in April and also explained to me that she had effectively been leading me on the entire time.  This was the longest relationship that I've ever had.  I don't miss her too much since we weren't that great together (it's possible that I would've broken up with her myself if she didn't do it first), but I do miss the companionship a lot and at this very moment in time I wish that I had her to talk to.

She was the first girlfriend that I'd had in over 4 years.

I hung out with a couple of friends that I've barely interacted with in the passed year (we used to be very close) this passed Saturday and while things are fine, they're just not the people that they used to be anymore/they're only out for themselves most of the time it seems.

I believe I simultaneously ""screwed up"" (I was trying to do the right thing and I'm told by others that I didn't really do anything wrong or even that noteworthy) today with two other close friends (a married couple) and their friend that I really liked and that they wanted to hook me up with (although that seemingly was going nowhere, but maybe I'm wrong).  So I think that friendship is over with.  The husband I've been ""best friends"" with for almost 20 years now and I used to really like his wife and be sort of close with her, but she's chosen to create a ton of drama and ruin things for seemingly everyone involved.

On top of that, I realized that the aforementioned couple has been using me for years now (although I sometimes think the husband is so clueless that he doesn't realize what he's doing), so that's nice.

I really feel like this new girl was my only shot at a relationship for the rest of my life, or at least for as long as I live around here.  There really aren't ""plenty of fish in the sea"" due to the culture and I guess ""demographic"" of the environment (people only want hookups, have very specific political ideologies that are the only thing that matters to them, and just plain suck, have no sense of common decency/courtesy, or commitment, and can't carry on a normal conversation).

Girls and relationships have always been very difficult for me.  I've been lead on a million times, ghosted, lied to, physically and mentally abused (yes, I'm a guy and the abuse didn't get to me too badly but it still really sucked knowing that she would at least try to do those things to me), etc.

It's rare to get to talk to anyone (both in person and on dating apps), it's rarer to meet someone that will actually go on a date, it's even rarer than that for that date to lead into another date, and it's extremely improbable that any of that will turn into a relationship, especially a good one.

I'm not the only person that feels that way around here either.  A lot of married couples my age that haven't been together long have told me that even they see how hard it's suddenly become for seemingly no reason.  Some of them have experience from trying to help their friends meet people.

For reference me and my friends are all in our 30s.

When I'm single, I find myself missing my ex that broke up with me 6+ years ago a lot (2nd girlfriend).  She broke up with me because she only wanted a hookup and I inadvertently roped her into a relationship.  She eventually realized that I loved her and decided that that was a reason to break up with me since she was only keeping me around for the sex (I guess that's a compliment).  I know there's no point in contacting her (and I won't), but sometimes I want to.  I guess I just feel that she was a great voice of reason for me and her personality is just what I always wanted (a cold, standoffish doctor that I was able to break through to).

On top of all this, I realized that I can't really relate to my parents anymore.  The older they get, the harder it is to reason with them on any level.  They're always right, etc.

Also I hate my job more than anything (luckily I mostly work from home), but who doesn't?

I have barely any direction on where to go if I moved and despite everything that I said above, I do have a couple of important local friends (although they're just not great to talk to about these kinds of things, especially since some of them are in similar situations), and my parents need me so I can't go that far.

I don't know why I'm typing all of this, I guess I'm just looking for some direction.

I'm 20, going into my junior year of college, and I've had basically had no real close friends, or anything beyond friendly acquaintances/classmates, for the whole time. But it's not without a lack of trying. I do everything you're suppose to. I'm part of student clubs and organizations. I go to school events and the few parties I seldom get invited to. I get to know and talk with classmates. I engage with people in general when I can. 

I do all of this, despite feeling depressed and worthless most of the time. Despite the fact that I sometimes have panic attacks in the bathroom before forcing myself to go to some social event. But I still do it. I still try. But nothing's happened.

I've tried and am on so many different medications. I have weekly therapy sessions. I even did the modern equivalent of shock therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and yet, I still feel empty and unhappy.

Even my therapist has expressed how unfortunate it is that despite all my efforts I can't seem to catch a break. I know it sounds like something the person at fault would say, but it genuinely feels like it's everyone else who're the problem. Like idk what more I can do. I'm so paranoid and obsessed with how I treat others, and always always do my very best to make my interactions with everyone I encounter pleasant. Those that are close to me, like friends from back home, say I'm funny and creative. However, it's like I'm not enough for anyone here.

My issue is that of the people giving my profile likes, I'm not attracted to them in the slightest. Either it's looks or they have personalities that clash with mine. I'm a very quiet person with geeky interests and the majority of the people who are open to giving me a shot are all bombastic and have extroverted habits or personalities. This makes me feel like even if I got together with any of these women, it would never be a long-lasting relationship if we had no shared interests.

Furthermore, due to my age - a significant amount of the women giving my profile likes are single moms and if I can barely take care of myself I can't imagine being a step-father any time soon. While I may have a full-time job, a car and a house I share with my younger brother I am just not ready for that sort of commitment or the possible drama/baggage that out of wedlock children may carry.

507,filthyrobots,1563892055,4,"My first real relationship was in highschool. We dated for three years. She was beautiful, smart, funny, we had almost all the same interests, had similar views on the world. It was the best years of my life (even with the shitshow with my family). Three months before grad I proposed and she said yes, made plans to leave the day after grad.

She had been abused by her father for over ten years when I met her, how she ever came to love me (man) I’ll never know. She told me she felt safe with me. What I didn’t know was he had also been raping her for the last four years. I knew she was terrified of her father but she was to scared to leave (what if he found her). She never told me and I never had the slightest inkling that it was that bad.

Two weeks before grad I hadn’t heard from her in two days. We never went a day without at least a phone call (she was homeschooled). I got really worried so I rushed to her place. Heard screaming and sounds of a struggle. Smashed through the door only to find her father standing over her in the bathtub. He had tried to rape her again, she couldn’t take it and slit her wrists. Needless to say I beat the living hell out of him, making sure to bootfuck his genitals. She died in my arms.

Her father was killed in prison before he hot to trail. I was furious! I wanted to kill him! Took me many years to date again.

My first marriage lasted less than three months. We had been seeing each other for two and a half years, exclusive for nine months beforehand. After we got married we moved to another province. I couldn’t find a job right away so she had to get one. Two months later we moved back, into her parents place. A week after returning she left to visit a sister. And fucked every guy at a party. 

Worst thing was she was pregnant (mine) but didn’t tell me. I only found out AFTER she gave it up for adoption. I ended up getting my child but for (many) years after I had ZERO trust in women. I would date but only for the physicality, whenever it started to get serious I’d end it.

I’m married again, been together 17 years, three kids. And I’ve never been more lonely. I almost left eight years ago because she became distant. She promised to get help. Things were better for a while. Four years ago she started again. Been three years since we made love, been two years that we’ve even hugged.

I think the only reason I stay is because a: I literally have nowhere to go (have no family I care about) and b: I’m a coward! 45 with health issues that prevent me from working full time. Take $500 a month in meds that I wouldn’t be able to afford without income assistance.

So here I sit, day after day, in the couch watching Youtube videos or, when not to hot, in my shop woodworking. We might see each other two, maybe three hours a day. Don’t really say much to each other that doesn’t revolve around kids/bills/menu...

I have no friends. Moved around so much I just stopped trying. The few I have had, most betrayed me one way or another, resulting in me having zero trust in anyone.

I am in no way suicidal, goes against everything I believe (I’m atheist btw), but every morning my first thoughts are, “Damn, I didn’t die in my sleep...” But every day I just keep going. I always keep going.

517,Malammore762,1563873180,16,"It's like my imagination turns into this giant paintbrush and anything conceivable instantly plays out in my head. 

Sometimes I'm the brave protagonist. Sometimes I'm the ceaseless and loyal supporting character. Other times I may be the underdog and actually ""lose"". But no matter what the scenario, people show me  the same love and respect that I put forth. It's so hard to explain. 

I often feel as if I'm this highly misunderstood backroom noise in life. When I daydream, the disappointing things in life like unanswered texts or unrequited love do not exist. Everything serves a purpose and ultimately contributes to some sort of greater good. I always felt that a narcissist makes things revolve around themselves. I don't have a problem with not being the center of some greater ""plot"", I simply have a roll in it rather than it being about myself. To be a spoke on a wheel but to be recognized and loved is enough to make me imagine happily for hours. Especially before sleep.

I get so bored of neutrality and ""realism"" that it's like my brain longs for something more desirable and dramatic. I ""fill in"" the emptiness with excitement and joy. 

These thoughts are extremely vivid. Everything down to the color of a garment or even ""dialogue"" become part of the daydream. Sometimes it motivates me to write stories of my own, but on the other hand sometimes I ""awake"" feeling lonely and sad. 

There are probably much better ways to describe this, forgive me it's just been an excruciatingly long day. I'm overtired. Can anyone else somewhat relate or am I just batshit crazy?

I have a few friends that I know would listen and would give me usefull advice but when I try to talk about it my mind goes blank and I can't even say one word.
This is the lowest point of my life and I feel so lonely I can't even sleep at night so I just toss around.

569,cubingtothegame,1563814658,6,"Idk they’re still my friends but do you ever get the feeling that you’re still lonely even with some friends? Couple of my friends who would always stay late night talking on discord with me about everything recently both got into a relationship with other people. 

They’ve been talking to each other more without me to discuss relationship advice and that shit and how their relationships are going and I only know this cause I accidentally joined their voice call one time and they didn’t hear me join so I overheard a lot of shit and when they realized I was there, they changed the topic real quick. Then it transitioned to them having private calls without me.

Idk I still talk to them but I feel left out since these friends have talked to me about them having crushes which are now their sig other. And like when I do speak with them, they mention things like “oh wait you don’t want me to say what happened yet.” And clearly that’s like oh they talked about what happened but they don’t want to tell me but ok I see how it is. 

Idk it’s a different type of lonely I guess. We each have our own version but man i just don’t know how to respond to them anymore in discord calls when they accidentally mention something that they talked about without me.

Here's the sum of my situation: due to Universe hating me, non-emotional parents that kept buying me things, spoiling me, and bullying in school, I've never developed proper social skills and still talk like a &lt;12 year old (I am 20). Add into a mix some unhealthy coping mechanisms, extreme sensitivity and depression that came out of all of this, and you get my inability to feel emotions - at least not often - which causes me to have memory problems and fleeting interest in anything. THAT is why I have no friends and likely never will. Oh yeah, I'm also a narcissist, or so I am told, even though I would love to smash my face in with a hammer whenever it shows up in the mirror.

THE IMPORTANT PART: So ok, I have my life analyzed, I KNOW why I can not be with people, and I KNOW I need to study constantly to be of some use to the world, but I constantly feel like a lost puppy. The summer feels like I am just wasting my entire life no matter what I do, even though there is nothing that needs to be done. There is this irrational desire for guidance. Studies start in autumn, if I finish these, there is a probability I might find a decent job to stuff the entirety of my boring existence into it and finish this properly, no failure on my part. Makes sense, right? But I feel bored. I feel like I \*have\* to do something, even though that mf universe won't tell me what. I'm a loser! What else do you want from me?!

This might just humiliate myself but I'm sick of having no one to talk to openly.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how long its been since I've opened up to someone, not with just drunken incoherent

pleas and all that but something meaningful and actually asking for assistance with my problems.

I can't be open with anyone except myself, anytime I mutter anything personal, people shy away or

leave from my life entirely or maybe I'm just shutting them out because they now know to much,

something ridiculous like that probably. I'm awful at explaining my feelings with words (I seem

to be very high in Neuroticism), the only constant emotion I can make out is

Humiliation.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even say that I feel like I'm going insane because almost everyone feels that, when growing

up at least, I hate that possibly everyone has the same problems as me. When those shite self-help

companies have the same cut and paste responses to all problems to ever exist it absolutely

infuriates me, the most common being ""You are not alone, plenty of people feel what you feel"".

I'm trying to think why it angers me and put it into a short sentence but its not coming to me,

this will probably be a common thing I say throughout this because my thoughts are so disorganised.

I've looked through so many self-help websites and have found almost nothing of use, I can't identify

the problem so how am I to solve it, I've listened to a lot of Jordan B Peterson for a long while and

he has helped me the most so far so at least I have that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared of becoming resentful but I feel I am anyway, I hate most things I'm very irritated often.

I know I have the capability to kill someone and even enjoy it, more so family and friends than

strangers which is something I'm quite ashamed about. I think about murdering a lot, getting caught

up in violent daydreams and become extremely excited by them (not sexually so far), I also have common

extremely vivid nightmares; which have involved beating my mother to death, getting my jugular ripped

out messily with plier cutters and getting so enraged at my sister that it actually started to scare

myself, enough to wake me up. My dreams often are dystopian versions of life paired up with separate

dreams of me in the center of made up humiliating events or sometimes about insects attacking me for

some reason. I don't really know what dreams mean or if they're helpful in anyway but here they are.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost so much as a kid, I had a beautiful 2 story house in a nice suburb and a secure family,

I had many other things that weren't just materialistic but the point is that my family and I lost

many privileges when my father left to never return, its been about 8-12 years I think since then.

We moved to a little house that we could afford and if my family wasn't a bit of a mess before it sure

is after that. I've had to cope with so many shitty step-dads who made my life miserable until

my mum finally decided to go out with someone sane, that relationship didn't last long though which

really pained me because I thought I would finally have a proper father figure in my life.

I plan to talk to my father one day and ask why he left, which I think is because of me, i'd explain

but that's to much context to go over. I guess I feel quite guilty for ruining my family, which I've

only continued to ruin over the years, its not like they've given me a reason not to do so since

all they do is make me miserable, now that I write that I notice how selfish that is.

I never got to say goodbye to my father, it took me awhile to realise he wasn't coming back,

I don't think my mother told me for whatever reason maybe to ""protect"" me or something, all that did

though is make me more bitter.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't trust my friends and end up isolating them, going cold when they ask whats wrong. I feel

so distant from them somehow physically as well as emotionally. Anytime I talk I feel humiliated, 

inferior perhaps? Anyway I don't feel like I'm even on the same planet as my friends, I don't

understand them and they probably don't understand me either, they say I'm very weird and mysterious

to them so I'd say I'm right. I'm almost always dissociated from them or anything really, I don't

know where I am or who I'm with, I mean that somewhat literally, I'm just so confused.

I often lose focus on what the date or time is, one day could go by and it feels like a week,

I've forgotten the year before which surprised me, I am just so lost.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I feel so humiliated and I don't know how to explain it either, that feeling might 

just be so ingrained in me that its become part of me, whatever it is its driving me crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

I have these moments where my body goes cold and weak, objects seem unreal and I can't really make

out what they really are as they expand and shrink at the same time, at these moments I feel the most

confused, I'm completely lost in my surroundings and my body itself. It usually happens when I'm by

myself and am stuck in my thoughts for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

If I could meet my young self I would tear him apart with my hands, I fucking despise myself for the

shit I've done, I can't trust myself to do anything anymore because of my fuck ups and the reactions

I got from them. I just shut down now when anything difficult comes my way, I can't trust others to

help me so I'm just stuck in that mode until I slowly get through it or the time passes and I

don't have to worry anymore. The only thing I know about myself is that I'm pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I even thinking anymore? I really just want to die, I know it will be painful but everything

is painful anyway, I feel like my whole nervous system was designed just to feel pain: I have barely

been hugged in my life, maybe If I do so I might have something to live for. Its something so small

to ask for but I never ask anyway, so I stand cold seemingly forever. I am so cold.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to scream. Can I even feel? All I do is feel without understanding. Everything I write still

doesn't feel like me. Does everyone just feel this and live with it, why can't I.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend, possibly best friend I don't know, is probably going to die soon. He's always ill probably

because he smokes all the time, and I don't even care. If he died I really don't think I'd care, I'd

just have a lot of spare time on my hands I guess, I don't even think I like him. He actually asked me

if I'd care if he died (he probably expects the same thing as me), and I basically said ""not really"".

I'm just such an evil person, I'm pretty much this guy's only proper friend and that's what I do to him.

He's on anti-depressants and he lives in absolute hell and I don't even care. When I grew up and looked

back on all the humiliating shit I've done I told myself I wouldn't repeat it, yet here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my few early memories is back when I was nine perhaps, I was waiting for a friend to come over

and suddenly started crying for no reason. My mum, confused, asks me whats wrong. I really didn't

know what so I just stood there crying for ages till I blurted ""I don't want to live"" or something

along those lines. My friend arrived at that moment so my mum went to open the door as I wiped the

tears as to not embarrass myself, my mum hasn't ever mentioned that moment since, I don't know how

someone could forget something like that. My mum thinks there's something wrong with me without

me saying anything remotely personal since so maybe she does remember or I'm just so broken that its

easy to tell, I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could be close to someone, I say this but I don't respond to peoples messages so maybe that's

a lie, I really don't know how to be open and I wish someone could just teach me how.

&amp;#x200B;

I could actually have a future, I'm somewhat a musician, I'm in a band that's horribly failing and I

really just want to ditch it but I'm going to set something right in my life for once and turn it

around, god I'm for once going to do something right because unlike the doomed and hopeless I actually 

have a chance. I'm an artist as well and I could really do something with my skills, make a side career

out of it maybe, its not like I'm bad at art I just don't work hard enough, I actually have hope.

611,hamartiated,1563762657,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

Unlike how some may believe I do not have many friends (friends being people who I gain enjoyment out of spending my time with and I talk to on a somewhat daily basis) no I have many people I know, have talked to and that's it, few I actually want to spend time with, for a lot of reason, for simplicity's sake let's just say I'm picky.

I'm sat, in my living room, tv paused, listening to the clock tick thinking what's the point, I get up spend all day doing nothing, just trying to pass the time, my friends are never able to hang out and I'm too fed up to go on my usual walk out side for 24.5 km alone. I want to just lay in bed and sleep, not because I'm lazy but because I don't have to live in this fucking hell of a reality, when I'm asleep it's either nothing so I don't think or a dream where the 1 thing that should be is again. When I'm awake it's like a race to the quickest distraction, make coffee, drink it, go upstairs, watch t.v., ect. That stops and I keep staring at my life and wishing it was not like it is, it's hell.

I don't go though it every single day with some grand plan, no, I used to, but now it fails in comparison to what I have lost. Oh and let's talk about how my parents consistently manage to make me feel like shit, if it was just 1 or two things sure I'd say suck it up and stop moaning, but it's not just 1 thing, I'm used to not having friends, or meeting up with friends for most of my  life it's been that way, but now, I want to escape, but can't.

I hate it, everything feels utterly shit and the one person who made me feel like I have meaning is no longer in my life, i miss her everyday. I keep hoping she'll come back or at least try to start from scratch with me.

Aside from that hope I honestly hate existing, it's not just a feeling of boredom it's like an ache and I wake up everyday with it, and I know that there's only one way it goes away, hence why I hope.

I’d love to have more friends for sure, but friends are generally easier to make. But aside from that I’m a pretty private person. I don’t like being overly gushy or lovey, I’m not a very physical person with just my friends. My best friend is a person who is almost always down for a hug and they cuddle with their other friends. But it just makes me so so uncomfortable if it’s anyone less than a romantic partner. If they’re comfortable with being super lovey with everyone they care for, that’s fine. But for me I’d rather save that intimacy for somebody I’m really really close to romantically. And I’m so so sick and tired of having nobody like that and feeling so alone all the time. 

I’m just about to turn eighteen, so hitting that milestone gives me some hope of being able to get out more and maybe meet more people in general. But at the same time, I’m also a pre-T transguy and that tends to make things difficult when it comes to dating.

I dunno, I’m just tired. I’ve dated one person in my life so far and it was a long distance relationship, and we never met before breaking it off. I tried forcing myself out of my comfort zone for my aforementioned friend but I had to tell them I just couldn’t do that anymore because I felt so wrong and tense because I don’t see them as anything more than a friend.

To find someone who didn’t immediately want nudes or erotic video chat was a challenge to say the least. I’m trying to make this as brief as possible so will summarize by saying I formed friendships with four men-not at the same time. Each one seemed so nice at first. Paid me compliments, which I’m not used to hearing. My starved ego ate it up. Each one ghosted me after my “trial period”-I’m assuming they found someone better to talk to.  I was up front with each of them, warning them up front I had huge trust issues based on the last friendship. Each one assured me they weren’t like other men and wouldn’t hurt me. Well, earlier today the last one blocked me on Facebook and I don’t know why. It has bothered me more than I want to admit. The likelihood of me ever meeting him was pretty much zero given the distance but he was nice to talk to-until I said I couldn’t engage in any casual hookups. I can’t even participate in the group I was in because he’s so popular there and is the one that starts all the conversation threads.

They even were super clingy, but this type of joy, true love, (they felt the same, and I indeed showed all the more love, but each time all the more taken for granted.) I’ve basically been dead inside and nothing but a zombie for six months. Then get a few days of relief before somebody changes again. I was a fool. All I stern to do is the above. As long as I’m with him or her, and and can look he or she in the eyes and smile, I’m happy. They always were too. Super blissful, than they apologetically change, due to long distance or just me having to fall for two narcissistic, batshit people who I wanna truly exhausted myself for, and they laughed it off psychopathically. Anyway. I don’t give a fuck about sex, I give a fuck about spending my life with somebody and making them happy, without me the root of their happiness and love of their life changing, as it has, inspire if constant forgiveness, patience and love even amidst being revoltingly mistreated. So, I never change, and it sucks, because I’m at a crossroads, and I’m down to have a happy life that stems from spending it with my soulmate, wherever, as long as I’m with her, than my love and bliss uncontainable.

Don't really have any plans as I got hit by a truck Friday (no one was injured, my newly purchased forester saved my life), so all this week I have is meetings, anxiety, coping, maybe some writing or kayaking. I wrote more yesterday than I've written in years, so who knows, maybe I'll write an anthology of crash-related stories until I've fully processed everything. 

Last week there was a very popular post by /u/iPercussion [(original thread here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/cdsi6u/we_should_make_this_subreddit_about_how_to_not_be/) on how maybe this sub should be used for finding ways to feel less lonely or improve. 

So I was thinking maybe we could have a weekly thread where people can talk about their plans or ideas for the week, then update us once they happened with how it went. At the least, it might establish a support group and a safe community to improve ourselves in. 

Thank you for reading, for possibly participating, and of course, be safe out there, no matter if you're a good driver or not. The ambulance crew said it doesn't matter, as accidents will happen. NY is a no fault state, and insurance started it's investigation to figure out whose at fault (I was too incoherent to give my side of the story at the crash scene, and the Samaritan who pulled me out and said I was in the right ended up not talking to police), but one second can be the difference between peacefully going about your business and getting smashed so hard you can't speak coherently. Please, be safe out there, and enjoy your week. 

P.S. If you have ever stopped at the scene of a crash to get those involved to safety or just to check on them, or called the police, or acted as a witness, thank you so much. It meant a lot, even though the Samaritan didn't stay. I've been a witness for a crash before, and I know it sucks- just giving a two sentence report took over an hour of standing in freezing rain- but it can really help.",lonely,"Let's keep the ""how not to be lonely"" ball rolling.

So I am about to be a first semester senior in college. I’ve always struggled to make friends and when I do it seems like I am always doing the work just to get blow off. I had a really close friend that I met in middle school and we ended up being roommates my freshmen year. However, she changed a lot. She was always off with other people and never inviting me. She got really into drugs, which usually doesn’t bother me, and became a totally different person. She only spent time with me when all her other friends were busy. I ended meeting a girl through my parents and we lived together for a summer. However, her and my other friend became really close. When it was time for us all to sign a lease, they found a place without me, moved out and stole some of my stuff. I ended up moving in with my boyfriend. While I love him very much I can’t help but feel lonely and like I’m missing out. He works and does not attend college so I feel like I miss out a lot. I don’t go to parties or football games or really anything besides go to class. I am in a sorority but it seems like all the girls have found their cliques. None of them are mean to me but I feel like they are all just acquaintances. I have no one to turn to about my problems and I feel so lonely.
A lot of times when I do talk to people they tell me they always thought I was a bitch because I don’t talk much. I guess I suffer from RBF. I don’t know what to do and I just feel like this is going to be the rest of my life. Before I met my boyfriend I would just hook up with random guys so I wasn’t just sitting alone in my dorm.

I don’t usually feel like this but almost every night when I sit in my room by myself I start thinking about my entire life and everything wrong and bad

I’m 19 years old and I’ve never been in a relationship. I’m not the most attractive human, but I’m ok, and I like to think I have an ok personality as well. Lots of times I guess I lack confidence to speak to women and “test the waters” so to speak. It’s like I need a fresh start, all the girls who know me from school i feel awkward contacting, or they are in a relationship, or blah blah blah (lots of excuses) but i have a hard time meeting girls as well, I’m not legally old enough to be going out to bars, i work, i have college, etc (more excuses I guess) and i don’t know where to begin online. It seems like a lot of Russian porn bots and not a lot of real life women. I just need a body, somebody I can hold and lay with and be there for and love and I don’t know where to find it (here comes the actual point of this post I’m ranting because I’m sad, sorry)


So a few days ago, i was partying with a cousin of mine. She was dog sitting for somebody and my parents are on vacation so I decided I’d hang with here for a few days. So at this party, she invited a few of her friends from her school over (most of them I know because my cousin and i are extremely close, pretty much brother and sister) but she brought over this new girl whom I’d never met before, and she was amazing. She’s beautiful and intelligent and kind. We didn’t even talk that much the first night but everyone came over again for RD 2 the next night and we started talking more. Still looking back it isn’t that much only a few hours and a lot of it wasn’t even one on one but I really thought she was cool. By the very end of the night everyone was in bed and I was laying on her lap while we were flipping through some music and signing songs together. Her lotion smelled so good and all I can remember from that night is that last image as we hung out. I never knew I needed that in my life so much.


I always thought I didn’t need/want a girlfriend or anything like that, because I’ve gone so long without one. But just being in her presence changed my life even if we were both drunk and just doing whatever.

The problem is now I’m worried that I will never see or talk to her again. I followed her on Instagram the next day but there’s really nothing else I can do. Like I said she’s my cousins friend and I can’t just DM her because I don’t want to make it weird. Does she even think of me or was she just drunk too? Would it be awkward between any of us? 

I barely knew her name and now I can’t stop thinking about her as I lay in bed and cry rn. Maybe this says something about me because I fell so fast. I never get attention like that and I crave it so so badly. I want more and more but it seems so hopeless. I’ve got nobody to share my problems or stories with and I don’t know what to do. There’s so much more I have going on than this but i think a shoulder to cry on and an ear to listen would help so so much



If any single person read this I appreciate you so much, I know this was a massive rant but I needed to get this off my chest ❤️

I hate summer so much. Before I was old enough to work, summer was even worse for me. I don't have friends in my area. In high school, I had people I spoke to at school but never hung out with anyone. No one invited me anywhere and no one accepted my invitations to go anywhere. I'm so lonely in the summer and with all my spare time, I can't help but spiral into all of my negative thought. Until this year, I also hated being outside, so I would sit inside and drown in the internet to avoid drowning in my emotions. Even still, I got overwhelmed some many times that I did some things I'm not proud of that have left permanent marks on my body. Now, I've finished my first year of college and have some amazing friends and a loving boyfriend, but they all live two hours or more away. I can't really visit them because my parents are a bit strict on me traveling alone, so I can talk to them online, but it's honestly not the same. I'm drowning myself by working two jobs and taking a college Spanish course online so that I don't drown in my emotions and loneliness and cut myself again.

680,MauroDiogo,1563676180,3,"Hey! 
I've been single for 4 years now. The first two years of it weren't too bad. I was dating regularly and connecting meaningfully with people but for some reason... the last two years have been dire.
Most days I'm alone. I work from home (something I'm trying to change) and the only single friend I have, I see for about 2 or 3 hrs at the weekends. Sometimes weekly, sometimes not. 

I live in a small town. No particular ""social"" events I could sign up to and meet people like me. 
I've just turned 30. I'm a big introvert. 
I have Tinder and I don't think I'm particularly unattractive but I still struggle to get matched with people I find attractive. I'm not very picky either. 
But I've been single for so long that (I've always had it) it has made my depression a lot worse. 
I try to treat myself to days out. But they don't feel fulfilling. They don't bring me happiness. 
And I'm always wishing I had someone to share them with. 
I'm getting more and more depressed. Feeling really low these days. It's affecting my personality as I just feel ""boring"" and ""uninteresting"". Which in turn affects my self esteem and self confidence. Which then affects any chances at dating and my overall mental health. 

So I just feel lonelier and lonelier and like this situation will just keep ""getting"" worse. 
It's one of the biggest causes of my depression so it's something I try to work actively on. But at the same time... at times it hurts so much to go on Tinder. Seeing people I could see myself with and would make a great fit and... just be completely ignored. 
I take ""breaks"" from using Tinder. Sometimes for a few months. But it just makes me feel worse. Like I'm losing months of my life on ""breaks"" and forcing myself to step away from things and be emotionally unavailable... when I'm available and looking. It's just what the situation drove me to do. 

With the depression and loneliness I just feel like I'm losing my passions too. I don't think I have many dreams anymore. My passions lie in all sorts of geekery, animals, art, food &amp; music but how do I meet like minded people through those? Where I live it's pretty dire. 
The prospect of signing up or going to events with the purpose of finding someone seems weird to me too. 
A 30 year old guy, standing there alone, striking up conversations with random girls in hopes of eventually landing a date? It feels weird to me. 

But all I know is that every night I just lay here... in a very low mood. Going into panic/desperation/crisis mode. 
Tearing up alone and having a weird and painful crushing feeling in my chest. 
I feel so down it gives me strong headaches and makes me nauseous at times.

I am currently living in a new city that’s a 60 hour drive from where I grew up, and ever since I graduated high school I’ve never lived in one place for longer than 8 months. I’m going into my fourth year of university and I’ve already been to 3 different schools, all in different locations. Every time I make friends at university I end up leaving them all behind and starting over the next year. It seems everywhere I go there are people that have known each other their whole life and then I just sorta show up not knowing anybody, make a few friends, but then throw it all away and do it all over again. Even this summer I managed to do this again. Instead of taking the 60 hour drive back home, I decided to stay where I was, except pretty much all my new friends from school went home so I ended up living in this unknown city mostly by myself. I got a job at a local golf course and even there I just feel so out of place. Most of the guys there grew up in the area and all know each other, and then I just sorta show up out of nowhere. Kind of like a plant that gets uprooted and transplanted somewhere else. It feels like most people are still living where they grew up, or atleast stayed at the same university for their entire degree and went home for the summer. I am doing none of that; I’m not living where I grew up, I’ve gone to a different school every single year, and I’m not going home for the summer.

Just a bit of background, I am 23 years old and have never had a stable and reliable friendship or relationship. I have never had anyone who I can open up to and be completely honest with. Even those who have claimed to care have come and gone without genuinely caring about me. Those rare few that I have tried to build a deeper connection with have always dwindled away rapidly for a seemingly unknown reason. After years of letdown, I am done wasting my time and effort to try and connect with people who have no real desire to get to know me. Which is fine as I have become very satisfied with my lonesome lifestyle, despite the fact I would love to find that special someone to spend my life with. 

Now, the reason I am dreading the future. Since I have not yet found that someone special and I am now becoming a successful engineer as well as starting my own business, I have had more people showing interest in me at face value. I have become fairly good at reading people and most, I can tell are just intrigued by my money and bright future; however, I don’t want to squander that potential opportunity for a life partner because of this.

Not my family, not my ‘friends’, no one has ever asked me how I am. If they did I’d tell them...
I’d love to say “im alright” but I’m not, mentally I feel wrecked. Loneliness is killing me.
I live with my family at home but at uni I live in a flat with my ‘friends’. Even though im surrounded by people I feel so ALONE...why? 
Every girl ive talked to and taken on a date, i seem to distance myself from immediately, like my brain just finds any reason to say no! Its like im afraid to get close to anyone.
Maybe Im just scared that I’ll tell the girl everything about my like immediately, and pour out my feelings that ive bottled up all these years. Feelings that I cant discuss with anyone. 
I go through the months floating in and out of what i assume is depression. 
My head hurts, I just want to vent all my feelings out to someone.
 I just want someone to speak to.
 Someone to hug me tight. 
Someone to tell me they care and actually mean it. 
I want to feel loved. 
Im a 22yr old broken man. 
197 phone numbers saved on my phone, 361 friends on snapchat. And not one, NOT EVEN ONE person that I can call or message to tell them how I feel. Why is that? 
If I message them I know they’ll just feel burdened by a broken grown man trying to shed some tears. Why do men have to act so ‘brave’? Why do I have to act like its all okay and bottle it all in? 
I just need someone I can talk to. A true friend. Is that too much to ask for? 
22 years later, and after meeting so many people I still don't have any friend I can trust.
Ive been deceived so many times by so many people who were my ‘friends’ from different friendship groups. If I am the problem why should I exist? Ive tried to change myself, to be less extrovert, I removed my confidence and replaced it with a shy demeanour. I go out less, I meet less people, I talk less around people, yet they still hate me, they still talk bad behind my back.
My head is going to explode with all these thoughts.

695,Ritik_is_online,1563662456,1,"I'm going to start from my experience when I was young. I was always noticeably above average, but never ""amazing"" as such at mathematics. I was one of the better students in my top level math class in my sophomore year of highschool, but now in my junior year after taking the IB curriculum, I found myself struggling because I'm not good at IB hl math. No matter, I dropped down to SL. You can still get into many nice programs in the United States with SL math, I think. I don't know.

I mean, admissions officers for universities have no idea what the difficulty of the HL math curriculum actually is. I talked to an admissions officer recently and queried her, would she prefer a 5 in HL math or a 7 in SL math? Which of the two would be viewed more competitively? She said that both were great scores, but she'd prefer to take the student who got 7 in SL math and a 3 or a 4 in either of those courses would be what would make her worry more. The thing is that a 4 in HL math is actually harder to achieve than a 7 in SL math is.

I got told by a US university counselor at my school that I couldn't handle engineering if I couldn't handle HL math, but if that's the case, why did I hear an anecdote from my math teacher about a student who got into Warwick (British university) with a 5 in SL math, that being a school far more competitive than I'd hope to get into and with a math grade below what I'd expect to be getting in the future? Tons of kids do standard A level math and get in as well, and that's a syllabus even easier than SL math. So what's the scenario here?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I guess another thing that universities in the United States are supposed to take into account is extracurriculars. Seems like a fair way to differentiate the students who sit at home and play videogames all day from the students who do productive work, right? Unfortunately, no. In my experience and opinion this only benefits kids with highly liberal parents and highly competitive extracurriculars. I know that if you grew up in the Bronx, they'd probably take that into account if you're applying to MIT, and you weren't president of the robotics club or something. But I'm growing up in bloody Dubai, I'm going to one fo the best IB schools there is (even though it's one without great STEM resources), and I hardly have that many extracurriculars. Why is that? It's because my parents haven't allowed me to partake in those activities. We have the finances for sure, and I honestly have the time as well. It's just that they'd rather have me spend that time sleeping or working on schoolwork, the latter of which they view as the most fucking important thing next to oxygen (and the former as something to supplement the latter).

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many things I wanted to do and wish I could do that I haven't been able to do. Join the STEM society at my school (which doesn't exist, despite my best efforts), build a tube amplifier (which they never allowed me to do), join a robotics club (a waste of time, apparently) etc. These are all things universities will take into account alongside my grades, which would make sense. It makes sense. The good grades I have are in subjects I like and have liked. There has been no variance in my interests throughout time. They have always been two things; history, and science (mainly physics). I don't see my interests changing, not saying they won't, but I'm not giving the ""other paths"" a try because I have no faith in them. We need more engineering historians in this century, anyways.

Sometimes I have so many ideas on where to go, what to do and what to let consume my energy. I have a boyfriend, but recently he has made me feel even more alone because of his lack of engagement in things. He sleeps till midday and disregards plans we made the night before. I spend the rest of my day waiting for him to wake up and get going... it never happens. My other childhood friend is busy with family. She has her cousin’s and sibling’s company all the time, so she’s never available. My phone is dead most of the time and no one is interested to ever invite me out. That one other friend who parted ways a long time ago disappears after we hang out and never calls again. I find myself to be a nice, non-judgmental person who initiates conversations about everything. I don’t think I have made anyone feel bad before and I am not annoying. I just have had a hard time making friends because I am a social outcast and a very introverted person. All it takes for someone to get close to me is the first approach and then I am the one who takes other steps.

Aside from all of that, I just want to look forward to getting used to loneliness now. To getting used to isolation and quit looking at how others are socializing and going places because that will never be me. I don’t want the next upcoming years to be as miserable as this one was due to crying every night because of the loneliness And worthlessness I feel. All this time I’ve been hoping that maybe I could reconcile with my old friends but it wasn’t possible due to unreturned interest. I have no one to rely on anymore, I miss how my boyfriend used to be and I miss my self. I have lost sense of who I am. I was a happy person, I still try to be whenever I can, I try dress up for my liking, I try to have fun but I have realized that the clothes I buy ..I have nowhere to wear, the fun I want to have is impossible to achieve with no one around me, and the laughter I aspire is nowhere near.",lonely,How do I get used to loneliness?,2019-07-21 01:13:20

727,VentingSpareAccount,1563614182,8,"Pretty early this summer, I practically found out that my worst fear would be to live a life where I'm not making anyone happy. Just thinking about it, living a life where everyone is so indifferent to you and no one would recognize you, that gives me goosebumps. I do feel lonely at times, but to be so lonely that the world will never be moved by anything I do, that alone makes me shit my pants.

&amp;#x200B;

So this summer, losing a lot of my friends really makes me scared of what's coming up in the future for me. I kept just one friend from high school and we recently had a falling out. I also had a couple of online friends but recently, they've just been falling away from me too. Lastly, I had a love interest that I've been talking to for 5 years now. Although we were just online friends, it was basically known between us that we would be together if only we lived closer. We also fell out together and all this happened in just a two month span. I'm scared that I've basically maximized what I person I could become. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can't grasp why all those people in my mind are just so turned away from me. Even my online friends and the people I barely knew when I went to school, I honestly loved. I can't tell you how much I love hearing about what people go through, what they love, what they want to be, what they love or hate. Just the fact that everyone human goes home and will experience something completely different is what makes the world so beautiful to me. Even though I didn't talk to much people, I loved listening to what people had to say about their day or week. With my online friends especially, I would do things like gift them with things. I remember writing an essay for one and they got a B and were really happy since it was a boring topic. For one online friend, I gave them a playlist and I found out all their favorite songs because they told me they weren't going to get gifts from anyone else. Even for that love interest, for her birthday last year, I went back to all of our conversations from all the social media we had together and I took my favorite messages she sent me and put it in a Google Doc with a custom link so she could read them all and think about the time we had together. In the end, she seemed really manipulative to me but she was the one to cut ties. This one especially hurt me. I was telling her about how I wasn't able to talk to her for a while since I had to go through things and right when I started talking about how she was hurting me, she told me to never talk to her again. And then right after that I got into an argument with my best friend from high school and it was the same story. It was the exact second I tried talking about how they were hurting me, they told me to never talk to them again. And right after that I started losing just so many others, right around the first half of summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel my problem is out of frustration. This is the first time I've ever truly felt lonely. I feel as if I can't make people as happy as other people can, no matter how much effort I put in. It's just as heartbreaking as having a crush on a girl or a boy and just never feeling like you're gonna be enough for them. I know this is gonna sound /r/niceguys of me to say, but I wish I had the opportunity to make someone a happy person. It's kind of a big meme to be like ""hehe why can't these girls give ME a chance"", but shit. I wish I would have the chance to make someone just the happiest person alive and I don't even think I'm alone on thinking like this.

It's interesting when I'm far away they would reach out in social media and say that they miss me or that I should visit so we can do stuff like before but It doesn't really feel that way once I'm here, being lonely hurts more when people are within reach and chooses not hang, most of the day left alone, people canceling plans, changing their minds, or just don't make time.

So... what do you do when you feel like this, like you have nothing left, I've done the ""Hit the gym, focus on yourself find a hobby"" for years I've been single and find my passion but sometimes life just doesn't work out. No one to talk really, no one who understands really, no one who cares really, I live by myself in a different city and I don't know anyone, somehow my lonely moments alone are less painful, they still hurt but I guess choosing being alone It's better and being left alone, not wanted.  


&amp;#x200B;

And my god I've tried to stay socially active, make friends all over the place, irl, reddit, dating apps, you name it, of course I worry that I'm just boring or not attractive but once you've tried everything patiently waited years for something to happen and nothing ever happens in fact things get worse, what do you do?

748,CallMeJack2112,1563586079,9,"Just a heads up, this might be a mess. Having a hard time organizing my thoughts. 

Just got a call from my only friend. We live on opposite sides of the world. She's pretty much been the only consistent relationship of any kind I've had for years. I had feelings for her, honestly. I've told her as much in the past. She just told me that another guy, who she also knew from online, just flew over to see her and they're a thing now. She'd tell me about local guys she was fooling around with and it sucked, but it was fine. 

This feels different. 

On the one hand: I'm happy for her. Genuinely. I told her as much. The guy seems like a good guy. He's known  longer than I have and he apparently makes ""Fly a cross the world"" money. It seems like things are going great for her, and I'm glad.

On the other hand: It feels like a bomb just went off. I have this vague feeling of being uncomfortable, but I'm mostly just numb. I feel like I got through the conversation alright. We usually talk via text, but she decided to call me so I guess she wanted to really drive the point home.

When something like this would happen before, she would be the only person I would tell. But now who do I tell? She's the only real friend I've had in years. It's pathetic to admit, but I hoped to be able to see her some day and tell her exactly how I felt in person. Maybe even proposing. 

We flirted in the past. Sent a few pics to each other once or twice, but things died down for a good while. For some reason, some part of me still thought something could be there.

Within the past 6 months I've had someone lie about liking me and only wanted sex who then proceeded to ghost me after getting it (I think he took advantage of me as I told him I really liked him), then a couple months later (aka last week) had someone who I thought was a friend lie about liking me when in reality he used me to cheat on his girlfriend and now he has me blocked, and have had a couple people who I thought were friends as well just completely ignore me (its been months) and ghost me (I also had told them I was going through a rough time, but I guess they just don't care enough about me - understandable lol). And then yesterday, an acquaintance of mine got engaged and has been talking about how happy and in love she is (real talk - I can't even be happy for my own 'friend' because of how miserable I am). All these events together have really just broke me down. I'm so miserable and so so alone. No matter how hard I try to be outgoing and make friends and be the cool girl, it ends up hurting. I try a lot of the time to give this persona of not caring at all, but after the most recent incident it made me realize how I just bottle up everything and how hard it is to be alone. I really underestimate how hard it is to be alone. To have no friends. To have no one like you. To have no one care for you. The loneliness is absolutely killing me. Every single day I ask ""why me?"" on both a micro and macro scale. Why did my friend choose me to screw over. Why does life do this to me. I've never been happy and have always been alone.

771,painfullyreal,1563563170,5,"**SHORT VERSION:**


I'm pretty broken as a person, but at least I'm self aware. I come online and try and get to know people sometimes because I don't have to hide anything. I can be completely open and the worst that can happen is they block me. Ive noticed a pattern. I tend to click with people who are broken in the same way I am. People who are lonely, insecure, depressed, just trying to get through life but there isn't much joy. Honestly there is no joy at all.

I'm religious but a failure at practicing what I believe, the most inexperienced S*x addict on the planet (With ALL of my acting out being online). I Just want to feel something with someone and I go down bad path after bad path trying to find it. I want love but if I can't find that then at least I can find someone to put up with me. I just want to numb the pain, the never ending pain that seems to crash through my life.

**LONG VERSION:**
&gt; 
&gt;  Lets break this down.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm 26 years old and in a place in my life with a TON of free time even though I'm trying to keep myself as busy as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Lets list all my horrific problems shall we?
&gt; 
&gt; 1) I'm religious (Which isn't a ""problem"" per say). I truly believe it but have a difficult time living it out. I live far away from the closest group to me that shares my faith and I have to travel quite a bit to get there. I overall feel like I complete failure in this part of my life which is ironic cause even the people who know my faults who are part of my faith group do not judge me or make me to feel bad. I'm much harder on myself than basically anyone Ive ever met.
&gt; 
&gt; 2)I have all kinds of emotional issues. I'm hypersensitive though I typically do an ok job hiding it. I'm insecure, I think no one wants to be around me. Which is obviously not true cause its very common for me to hangout with friends 5+ times a week. If they didn't like me they wouldn't keep inviting me back. I'm a funny guy, i get people to laugh more than I use to (finally developed a sense of humor). But once I get back home its just all gone. All I'm left with is this empty feeling.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) I want to have a close intimate relationship with a woman. Ive only ever had one girlfriend and it was a long distance relationship (We meet initially online, spent several years as friends, but then decided to be a couple and met in person). So I never really had a lot of physical contact. Its not even about sex for me, its the desire to feel known and loved, to have physical (and emotional) affection. Last time I got a hug was around 6 months ago.
&gt; 
&gt; 4)I'm an addict. I have an addiction to what I'm going to call ""Lust"", but in a nutshell. When I feel tired and lonely I seek out porn and cybersex to make myself feel better. I just want to feel a connection with someone and so I seek it out. Its become compulsive and destroying my life to be honest. I'll stay up until 4am some nights trying to find someone only to collapse asleep when I can't and then try again the next day. Eventually I'll get through my binging, and try to stop the behavior but then its not to long till I'm back again. I hate myself even while I'm seeking it out. I just don't know how to stop because its the ONLY connection I really feel to other people. I feel like a woman is never going to want me (which objectively is false, thats an issue i'm working through in therapy). At least if I'm voice chatting with a woman online I feel something with someone. At least thats what i tell myself. I'm currently in a 12 step group for it.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) I'm in a 12 step group, its an over an hour away from where I live, which is exhausting (living in the middle of nowhere sucks especially when you can't move for a few more years). I struggle to call my sponsor , i struggle to call other people and talk about my feelings and emotions. My whole life I was always told that my feelings were wrong, and truth be told many of them (Like the insecurities) ARE wrong. But constantly being told that and living with someone deeply manipulative fucked me up really good. The internet with it anonymity is the only place i feel safe to express myself in any way.
&gt; 
&gt; 6) I'll never find what I want online. I straight up won't. What do I want? well thats easy. I want to find a woman around my age I can talk to with COMPLETE transparency (while still retaining anonymity). Someone I can explore the sexual stuff with who won't try to make me feel guilty but also won't try to keep me from feeling guilty either. Someone I can talk to and share stuff with right out of the gate without the bullshit and the games. Who has clear boundaries and clearly respects my boundaries. Someone who I can just be, completely emotionally naked with, as well as talk about sexual stuff casually with where she is just as comfortable talking to me about emotions as she is talking to me about a porn video I enjoyed.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I'm fucked up. I""m crazy I guess. I feel insane and alone. Ive been in therapy, but its not really helping. I don't know what to do anymore.",lonely,I(26m) am incredibly lonely and I only ever seem to relate to people as broken as I am (both a long and a short version of this post included),2019-07-20 05:06:10

Recently read “Digital Minimalism” by Cal Newport and that book helped me realize how much time I really spent mindlessly scrolling through the newsfeeds, seeking those “likes” and getting that dopamine hit when I got one of those nice shiny notifications. 

Here lately I’ve decided to just embrace these feelings of loneliness and truly discover who I am. I understand that some people don’t want to completely get rid of their social media and that’s totally okay. Just be mindful of how you are using it.

I love giving love to others like hugging, treating people to meals, etc. I guess the main reason why I do so is because I do it in hopes that I'll receive love back. It's become a habit of mine and now I do it unconsciously and it's led to me being taken advantage of but thankfully, I've cut off those kinds of people from my life. 

I have my circle of friends and I'm one of the wilder, talkative ones in the group but I used to be someone really awkward and socially inept. I broke out of my shell a few years ago because I got sick of being lonely and it worked. But romantically, I'm a lost cause.

I'm a huge hopeless romantic. I cuddle my pillows, fantasize about scenarios, listen to BFE audios and I would always find myself hoping to find love one day. But when it comes to the opposite gender, I'm just... Awkward. No matter how hard I try. I'm an 18 y/o straight girl and I still find it hard to make or even maintain eye contact with guys. Flirting is a definite mess for me if done through conversation but through text, I'm very smooth. When it comes to romance, my defense mechanism just shoots through the roof and I unconsciously push away anyone who comes close :( This eventually led to people to stop pursuing me romantically because they think I'm just playing with them or that I'm just emotionally unavailable. Countless times already I've wondered to myself, ""what am I doing wrong?"". I've been trying my best to overcome this but it's been tough

Basically, my hopeless romantic side is amplifying my loneliness each passing day. It's especially worse this year as well and now my loneliness is so bad, I think my friends are starting to notice.

I try to avoid thinking of my ex fiancee. Like she dosnt exist. It keeps me from hurting but I have theses moments where I realize what I'm doing and then It all hits me at once. Like I rember what we used to be like and how she must feel  with me ignoring her like this. I feel so selfish but at the same time I don't want to hurt this bad. Idk where I'm going I feel like I'm just doing stuff cause I should. I go to work cause I should have money and stay finacially stable. I talk to girls and go on dates cause I should be trying to get out there and rebound. I'm loseing weight cause I should be trying to better myself after the break up.

Omg I'm fucking crying over this shit like how pathetic is this. I can't not love her and it takes everything in me to not feel like my chest is being ripped open every time I hear her call him babe or hear her say I love you to him. I guess thats what I get for agreeing to stay friends. I just get so mad and Idk what I want to do but it's not ok.

804,hamartiated,1563499790,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

For a while, I was so weirded out by my own reactions to her every time she spoke to me, I couldn't understand why I was acting and feeling the way I was. But now I think I know what is it about this girl that filled me with butterflies every time she talked to me, and I kind of hate the answer...

She treated me normally.

That's really all that happened. For the first time in my life. A cute girl didn't ignore me or treat me like a weirdo. She just talked to me like a normal human being, as equals, and seemingly enjoyed our conversation a little even.

The reason I hate the way I feel, is because it reveals how little positive female presence I've had in my life that I'm thirsty enough to start falling for the first girl that \**doesn't*\* treat me badly. It's the common fall-at-first-sign-of-affection syndrome.

What I like about this feeling though, is that it's... really good, and comforting, and peaceful, and makes my chest expand and feel warm in ways I never thought it could. It's a new feeling. I've never actually felt this way before. Never truly felt that I liked someone enough to want to see them again, and never understood 'love', and even if this feeling is temporary, at the very least it allows me to see that this feeling is possible. It's like a new horizon had opened up for me that I didn't know even existed.

Sorry if you think I'm creepy (I've been told that before, as you can probably imagine, to the point that I can't distinguish what's creepy or not anymore), but I just write my feelings as they are.

I feel like the best part of my life is over an far behind me now...I don't know what to do with my life,every goal I set is failed ...everything I want in life ...I get told is unrealistic an not reasonable with society .

Iv spent all summer in my bed room ,sleeping ,smoking an playing video games,I feel my only reason to keep going is to make money to make profit for someone else ,I feel like a slave to society but I also feel outcasted an unwanted by anyone.

820,TurboDyke,1563470514,4,"So im alone and I drink a lot. An awful lot but it's ok. Just now I'm drunk, I guess that's why im posting. I originally had something to say then a post on this forum caught my eye. It was in regards to loneliness making you crazy. I'm sorry to who posted it, I cant remember but you talked about having full blown conversations with your self and strange behaviour. Shit that hit, I know. I just rattle about this house drinking and talking to myself these days.

I didn't realise I was going mad, it seems to have just happened. I originally came on here today to say I cried. I dont know the last time I did but man it was a bit of a release. I know what it's like, I'm a guy single 32 no hope. I feel all the pressures from family and society you guys do. I also I understand that for my generation there isn't much hope, we got shafted in terms of jobs, no education? No hope of career progression. I was on my way to being a mortgage advisor, the bank got fucked and so did I. I stack things on shelves now. I'm grateful for the job but I didnt see this coming. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is we need to find those small releases. If its crying, drinking smoking I know some are bad but does it help from time to time. Try it. Not the drugs, the crying, try it man please.",lonely,Where to start?,2019-07-19 03:21:54

822,YungTenes,1563463884,2,"In the winter of 2014 I changed school and city. I didn't like the amount of change but had no choice. Everything was different, the teachers, the kids,.. I felt alone and scared to talk to people. When they showed me my class I felt uneasy about everything but noticed a good energy coming from a girl in the front row. She was the pretty girl that everyone liked, to my surprise she came to me after the lesson and wanted to show me around the school, she also gave her number and said if there is anything I needed that I just had to call her. Me and her became good friends and this allowed me to feel better in the new school. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only a few weeks later I started to notice that a girl (not the same girl) was trying to get my attention. Had no clue who she was but I liked the mysterious vibes she was giving me. I had so many mixed feelings and didn't understand what I was feeling. I didn't want it to end, but before I realized she came up to me and my heart started to race so fast. We clicked instantly and talked everyday. She was 13y at the time and I was 14y so everything felt so bizarre and fun. We were totally in love. I started to feel so many things when looking at her down the hallway. She made me forget about the bad things.

&amp;#x200B;

Our love was like the love in books, pure joy and happiness. Sadly enough after a bit over a year we got separated. It felt like my world was ending.. but time heals so I got over it for a while. There is more about the ending but I don't feel comfortable talking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The actual reason why I am here is to talk to people or get some similar story's about what they have felt. I am 19 years old now turning 20 and got my diploma this year. I am still young but now that I feel like my school years are almost over I feel like life is almost over. Next year I am starting UNI and after that I go to the real world. Recently though I have not been able to stop thinking about 2014. For some reason I am so scared about my futhur and I have been feeling so alone. I still feel like there is so much more for me to understand as a younger person. Lately it's been pure loneliness and the thought of not finding that same type of love. Obviously this only so much of the story but I am so confused about life and the futher that I wanted to open myself to other peoples story's

I am kinda shy sure, but not socially anxious or anything, I do however have aspergers or autism or something. I was getting better this school year, I was doing super well academically, was honestly really enjoying school, and was starting to make friends. I even went on a couple dates but it was kinda hopeless, and she ghosted me. All my “friends” did so too, and I have made zero contact with anyone. 

I am trying to stay productive, trying to get a job, preparing for Uni coming up in a couple months, sticking to my productive hobbies, even exercising a bunch, and staying healthy but now I can’t stick to that for much longer, as I have started to wake up 2, and go to bed at 3, and have just been staying at home, doing pretty much nothing. That girl I briefly mentioned going on dates with, I also think about her a lot still. Not even really about being in a ‘relationship but just talking, talking about life. I know I am in rough spot when I fantasise about talking about my feelings… 

Honestly at this point I just want a friend I can talk too about these things and who actually cares about me. Sure University is coming up, but I am not even excited anymore, living thinking that once I get to this and it will all be fixed is unrealistic and unhealthy, I need to do something now. 

What the hell do I do? I don’t really want anymore online friends, sure that's good but I can’t stay online in my room all day, I want someone real. I have tried to get in contact with people in school but they seem to ignore me. I could get a job I guess, but I am currently trying, and just hate the process.

Have you ever had those days where you’re tired of being alone? Not having someone to spend time with? Wondering when you’ll find the one?

But you wait and wait for a single match back... it doesn’t come immediately, it takes a while. And when you finally get that match your heart starts pumping anxious to finally message the potential “one”.
And then they unmatch you... 
I guess your simple “hey” or cheesy pickup line or creative one liner didn’t work. 
You feel empty and wonder why? 
And then the next match appears a couple days later and you feel good. Things are hitting off.

842,GaysMibble,1563423056,2,"It might be loneliness. Lately I've felt this simple ""I want a significant other"" feeling (I'm still confused about my sexuality bear with me) more than I ever had before my ex. I didn't care about relationship then my ex rolled around, it's been four months since I broke up with him, (it was fairly mutual) it's hard because I feel good. I often don't feel the crushing sadness anymore, the guilt for things he did or that I wanted to take the blame for because I didn't want him to have the fault. I've fairly distributed the blame where it's due and owned up to my issues only three days after we broke up. He gave me a half added fake apology a month later but flipped the script the next day so I'm pretty sure it was more of his lies to hide the truth. 

He's in my dreams. I think about him every day. He may have never been attracted to me, maybe he never loved me, maybe he thought he did and he didn't. I'm mostly over it, but stuff gets to me at night.
I want a boyfriend I think, I've only ever dated guys before but I've had a crush on a girl once so it's confusing. 
I want someone who will actually text me first sometimes, or maybe ask me to hang out more than once a month, someone who will be proud to call me their boyfriend and who will want to work through issues that may arise. Imagine someone loving you, the way you love others. I want someone who will communicate with me and who I can communicate with. And someone who would actually find me attractive.

I don't know when I'll find that person, and it's hard. There's so many things I'd love to do with a partner, be it tiny mundane things. My ex always told me we'd build a pillow fort together and watch Netflix. We never did. But I always wanted to do something fun and stupid like that. Laying around, just cuddling. And goddammiit I can't help it I want to have a partner that I can be intimate with and who will want to be intimate with me. My ex made me feel like that was gross, like I'm this gross person for wanting sex. I don't think it's gross, I took it so slow because I'm a virgin and we dated for eleven months and never had sex. I'm not trying to rush into it or anything. It's just. When I love someone, I show it, and feel it the most through physical affection. And intimacy is a part of that.

I draw everyday hoping to get into my dream school and away from my tiny town. I just dive into my work hoping to God one day hell give me a real apology. But I know that won't happen.

I just want a boyfriend who really loves me. I dont want to keep getting my heart broken I really just dont. I want a mutual relationship where someone will choose me and I choose them and we choose to tackle problems we face and discuss our feelings and shit. I want someone who I'm as comfortable around as I am my brothers. 

It sounds impossible and sometimes I lay here wondering if all that boyfriend will be is a fantasy. Am I truly asking too much? My ex lived 10 minutes away and we could only hang out once a month, twice if I'm lucky. He stopped wanting to even touch me or hold my hand let alone kiss me. He wouldn't ever text me first and I initiated every single time we hung out or spent time together and even then I can count the amount of times we spent time together on my fingers. Is it supposed to be that way?
I don't want it to be that way.
I'll find a boyfriend who will put in effort for me right? That's not selfish right?
I work on myself and take blame for things that aren't my problem. I'm trying to figure out and fix why I got so anxious as soon as I started dating my ex and it was probably from a lack of truly knowing him. I want to be with someone who doesn't make me anxious. I try so hard to just be a good person and do good and shit because the things he said that weren't even true, stick with me. 

It's hard. It's just really difficult. I hope a person that will love me exists. I can't wait to lay around with them and watch shows. There are some shows I want to watch but feel like I can't get because they're my exs favorite. I made progress though! I'm on season two of the office and that, black mirror, and shameless are his favorite shows.

Anyways if you made it this far, thanks for listening to my lonely bitter rant. I try not to be too bitter but it's 12:10 and I'm ruminating.",lonely,I Dont Know How I'm Feeling,2019-07-18 14:10:56

845,hamartiated,1563421489,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

My mom hates that I go to the gym and whines about it constantly. It is bringing me down insanely. I only go for an hour a week anyways, most of my friends go for way longer. It's not just limited to sports.

I also have zero friends or social life. People say ""oh go join a club"" or ""make friends outside of school"" but I can't do that either and I don't have any friends at school. My parents barely let me go out, they never let me go to parties, etc, I'm never really even allowed to leave the house unless they're taking me somewhere.

(TLDR at the bottom)

I’m 21 M and me and my ex girlfriend have been broken up for 12 months now and I am finally over it after a difficult year of getting through things and working on myself.

The only issue I have now is that I feel quite lonely when it comes to the women side of life. I know for a fact that I’m still too young to be in a relationship as I find being in a relationship pointless at this age as it most likely will end in a couple of years and never go anywhere that serious. So yeah in order to save myself any pain like that again I think it’s wise to not be in a relationship. But the only other alternative is what? Smashing tinder girls? I did that about 7 months ago and that got a bit repetitive after a while. Anyone else going through similar stuff/having similar thoughts?

865,EastCoastAA,1563392574,3,"I never go out. For the past several years I've, for the most part, stayed inside and shut myself away from the world. Everyone and everything changing while I just slowly decayed.

A friend I've had since middle school that I've kept in touch with on and off invited me over today to hang out and I finally got the courage to wake up at a normal hour, try to make myself look as not-shit as possible, and went over to their place. I thought I was doing great at first.

But when I got there and when they greeted me, I just felt... so... out of place and like I didn't belong.

I looked at them and they looked and sounded so different. No surprise, it's been years since I last met them in person. But it was still so jarring. I remembered when they were a little more... I don't even know how to describe it. I'm really at a loss for words.

They offered me a smoke and I turned it down since I don't smoke and I was never really sure when they started smoking. We sat in their room, they quietly played games on their PC and I just sat in the back looking around, glancing at them, and just... thinking. I saw a large array of wine, I saw a tattoo on them and I had no idea they even had tattoos, I saw condoms laying around, I saw notification letters and trinkets and drawings and...

I just felt so impossibly out of place. Even just setting aside drinking and smoking, two things that have never been up my alley, I just... I don't know. In some ways it feels like the person I knew back in middle school is dead and replaced by someone else and perhaps they much prefer the way they are now and more power to them if so.

But then I think about what sort of lives people in my age group must be living compared to mine and I guess I just.. I'm feeling like just throwing in the towel again. Like I can't handle how much catching up I need to do because even if I caught up in terms of life stuff, I'd feel so incredibly out of place and like a stranger in my own skin.

They tried to be courteous, or as courteous as their personality permits, offering to make some lunch and stuff. When they left the room I was pulled in two directions, staying put and trying to talk and better myself like I had planned to do today, or gathering my things and leaving.

I gathered my things. Stepped outside, told them I had to go home. I'm not sure if they really cared about my sudden departure, I wasn't doing it for attention anyway and they seemed a little high. Asked me if I knew the way out and I just sorta mumbled that I did and then I think they simply said ""so go."" and.. off I went.

I don't know why I typed all of this. There's no one I can talk to about this. Normally I'd message *them* about these sorts of feelings, but... I guess I just feel like maybe I made a mistake meeting them like that. Or maybe my mistake was allowing myself to be myself. I don't know.

I think I came close to it in high school, I met this reserved guy that I found really cute and approachable. We even swapped numbers, and I got surprised on Valentine's day, something I never would have expected. Everything was going well until I accidentally insulted Team Fortress 2, and he demanded that I not speak to him until I'd thought about what I'd done and begged forgiveness. Not kidding.

After that experience, I was quick to shut down the next couple attempts from other classmates (please, do not blame me). I resolved myself to the idea that high school relationships just weren't for me, and I honestly don't regret this. Most of my friends had terrible experiences with dating in high school. Still, when I hear mention of the romantic exploits of people my age today, I feel pretty insecure and inexperienced.

I know I'm not an Instagram thottie, but I maintain a pretty good self image, which I believe to be the most important ingredient in a mutual attraction.

897,Nephba,1563327556,2,"Hello whoever is reading this, I wrote this because I wanted to share some thoughts and this subreddit seems like a nice fit.

I feel lonely. You wouldn’t think that’s possible in a city so big. Don’t mistake me for being alone. I have people around me, good people. And I am lonely because they are good people. I don’t think I deserve these people. They are positive, uplifting, cheerful, what ever you want to call it, but I can’t seem to find me in them. It seems like everyone has a best friend and no room for another. 

I don’t want to be someone I’m not. I don’t want to fake me to you. And sure I’m not just this depressing piece of shit. I like to help people, I often visit r/depression or r/suicidewatch to find people on the edge of breaking. I have given 2 people another night and many others a reason. I will keep their name out of this but they helped me as much as I helped them. I would like to celebrate those small victories with someone but I don’t have someone. 

If you made it this far, thank you. It means a lot even though you can’t feel text. The title probably seems odd. Well, it is. “In the bleak midwinter” is a poem, but I like to use it as a quote (Thanks Thomas Shelby). It has to do with death, a personal death. No one has died yet but I can feel it. A ominous vibe or a unwelcoming present. I know it’s just a feeling and it will pass, but it doesn’t make it any easier to deal with. 

Thanks for reading this trippy passage. Enjoy your day. Here’s a visual of what I’m [feeling](https://imgur.com/gallery/EJTkKOX).",lonely,In the bleak midwinter...,2019-07-17 11:39:16

For me it's like a big tease. I get to see so many people with friends, in relationships, etc.. even my coworker who is a girl constantly talks about her boyfriends she's had and it's just like a constant reminder. It's sad man. I have a lot of sympathy for people in my shoes, or to anyone struggling. 

I've ranted a lot lately. I put in so much effort in life and was given a big fat L. Meanwhile others put in 0 effort and get back so much. I'm tired of life man.

I feel like even my own family don't even know who I am, and I fucking live with them.

Even if I ask them that, their response is usually pretty vague and others that put in a bit more effort, usually never satisfy my question, and without that satisfaction and the lack of it, I just hit them up with a ""Thanks, same here."".

906,PissinBullets,1563316979,1,"I'm 19M and there's this girl in my university that's just absolutely amazing. I didn't have much of a social life and I had practically given up on making friends because every friend I made I was only able to keep for a few weeks. I found her one day and we just clicked. I was scared since I had given up on trying to make friends. But she was such a bundle of joy that she made me forget I was ever alone. I hadn't received attention like what she gave me for a long time. So, I legit fell in love with her in just a few weeks. This was different though, I didn't want to have sex with her or even a relationship, I just never wanted her to leave me. I had a really good thing going with her for like 3 months ( do remember that this was a one of the longest friendships I've had ever ). I did a lot of favors for her, did assignments for her, helped her with tests and stuff. This was all regular for me, I didn't think much of it. 

But, right after we were done with the semester and went on break, things fell completely apart. It was all good, until one day she seemed really off while we were chatting late night. I started asking what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me. I begged her to tell me why she was sad and she still wouldn't. I met her the next day and she literally shut me out. I saw her buying some food and I went to confront her. She wouldn't talk to me and I literally chased her to get her to talk. And it did create quite a scene, people were staring at me and laughing but I didn't care. My friend was sad and I didn't give a shit about anything else. But while I was chasing her, she told me that she didn't want to be with me anymore. And it tore me to pieces. I just stood there, frozen and allowed her to walk away. She didn't even look back. Later in the day, I texted her to ask if she wants to remain friends with me and she simply said ""no"". And I legit started crying tbh. I felt used that till the time I was doing stuff for her, she stayed with me. But as soon as we went on semester break, she told me that she didn't want to be with me. This really hurt and a week later I found out something.

Basically, I was with someone who was also friends with that girl. The guy told me that there was something wrong with her medically but she made that guy promise not to tell anyone. I was dying to know what she had. The guy went to the bathroom and left his phone unlocked. Me being the fking weirdo I am, I checked his phone and turns out the girl was vomiting blood and stuff around the time we started having problems. She had migraines and shit too. The message said that she was scheduled for an MRI the next day. 

I'm really dying to ask her what the results said. But I'm not even supposed to know. What do I do? I feel used and betrayed but I still care a lot about her and blame the illness for her reaction. I really hope that some way we can get back together. She was my last attempt at friendship. What do you guys have to say about this? Whats your take?

I've sulked and bitched on here, I've tried offering condolences here, and occasionally lurked intermittently on this sub for a long time. Definitely a year. Maybe even two. Idk.

/u/iPercussion suggested making this sub more about how not to be lonely; this has been brought up multiple times, but it's going to take a bit of work to do so. And more than just one poster.

So I might as well share something I did as part of my 'adapt or die' attitude towards life. 

I could go on and on bout my tragic backstory, but fuck that, this is about how I helped myself enjoy an activity without friends- enjoying your life will bring you happiness, which might get you out of the funk, out of loneliness, and into friendship eventually. Or at least, that's what I hope. If you want the tl;dr: it's worth it, go see your favorite bands! 

I love music. I used to do band and was bullied by band nerds, to give you the idea of my lameness, for being slightly off rhythm no matter how many practices or private lessons I spent being locked in a room with only a metronome, but I still love music. I never really met anyone who liked any of the bands I did enough to go see in concert, really. I've been to a few, but not too many, and occasionally I've passed up on seeing bands I really liked because it would mean going alone. Those missed opportunities still bother me at night. I had a chance to see  X Ambassadors Live. The last time I saw them was in Denver years ago. They were coming to Buffalo, and I live an hour away, which is very doable.

I made plans with friends, but they bailed two weeks prior to the concert, and my ex I'm still painfully friends with had seen them already this summer, so she was out- I'm lowkey glad- I don't want painful memories associated with one of my favorite bands. 

Concerts are stereo-typically activities for couples and friend groups, even my sister said it'd be weird to go alone; I hate driving to a strange place alone; I dislike being alone in crowded areas; it took me years to work up the courage just to get lunch by myself; but damn it, X-Ambassadors is amazing live, I know their words to almost every song on Orion as I've listened to it daily since it came out, and I wanted to see them.

So here's how it went, if anyone is thinking of going to a concert but nervous about doing it alone: 

It went great! I showed up almost late, but it turns out there were many opening acts before X-Ambassadors, and the first act didn't start until 6:30pm when the venue stated the concert started at 6. X-Ambassadors went on at 10-ish, and my phone had 20% when I was waiting in line at 6:01. So first barrier: My coping tool, my phone, would be barely usable. I needed to save at least 5% of battery to get to the thruway after the show.

As a result, I tried wandering the venue, the Buffalo Riverworks. A lot of Rochester people talk about how we wish we had something like the Buffalo Riverworks, so it was cool to actually see it. Buffalo did a great job reusing the industrial waterfront, with bars, restaurants, arcades, carnival, climbing and ziplines, concert venues, etc. Unfortunately, I don't turn 21 til August, so I got an X marked on my hand and was restricted to the underage areas. No cool upper story for me, no adult beverages or solo bar stools. I didn't feel like crashing a table and asking the people there to sit down, so I stood for the whole thing. 

Without my phone, I tried people watching, but timidly- there was a 'carnival theme' with cosplayers, actors, girls on stilts and entertainers such as jugglers going around engaging people to entertain them between or during acts. I may have been scared constantly they would try goading me into getting a photo with one of the cat girls or during their act, rope me with a hula hoop, but that was just paranoia, lol. I don't think I got a single look. The opening act was really fun, btw, as their first song was [""no one likes the opening band"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAxYwx_lIyA) It instantly turned my grumbly, on-edge mood around, and I decided I should be more open and give the opening bands a chance. I might like them. 

Like I said, I'm a socially anxious ADD mess with bad eyes and slightly hearing damaged ears that are somehow still very sensitive to noise. I hate 'wasting the time I have with working eyes' or hearing on stuff I don't deem worth it, which kinda ruined my mood for the opening acts, even with the plea from the openers to give em a chance. ""I can't even understand a word they're saying, I'm worsening my titunus for this?"", was on my mind for some of them, I'll admit. I was also hungry, but didn't see good cheap vegetarian options other than overpriced fries. Without a phone, food, I didn't know what to do, but I tried my best not to people-watch and overhear convos, or stare when a girl ran up and looked like she was gonna slap her boyfriend for looking at another girl, or laugh when I saw a guy my grandpa's age dressed more fashionably than me taking a selfie with an Iphone; I tried to ignore what felt like eyes glaring at me when I'm standing alone in the middle of the floor, imagining all the cute, trendy hipster girls and guys round me were wondering where my friends were, or if I was just a bearded creep. I shook feelings like that off throughout the night with ""well, I'm a guy who looks old with a big stamp on my hand saying underage. They're probably trying to figure that out.""

My half-grumbly, half ""why don't I have friends"", ""why did I come here"", ""This isn't worth it"", ""they're staring at me"" attitude, all came to an end when X-Ambassadors did play. I will admit, I did find out a few of the other bands were pretty good and have been listening to them since Sunday. X-Ambassadors is a band I have loved since I first heard them, and doubled down when I saw them live for the first time in- i don't know, maybe 2016, Fiddlers Green in Denver? This time, since it was a small venue, I could actually see the members and hear them naturally. Their energy was great, and throughout the night I had been hesitant to move, to clap when the bands ask you to- I have haunting memories of teachers and peers laughing at my lack of rhythm-, or whatever; but with the first notes, that melted away. My boredom of sitting through hours of alt rock with not a single friend or internet distraction had been melted away and turned into excitement, and it felt like their set ended as quickly as it came- the music had washed away any sense of time. My voice was hoarse and breathless. I didn't care if I had no friends there, I enjoyed myself honestly, and that hour of music made up for everything else that had happened that night or even that week. 

Some hippie band, I think Nahko, sings about finding your form of spiritual medicine for whatever societal ills ails you, and the importance to use it. Depression, loneliness, stress, etc are all becoming a public health crisis; I think it's fair to say most people know or are someone suffering from one of those, and many users here know someone who passed away as a result of those three. Medicines and therapy are incredibly necessary, and nothing is a substitute for honest medical help, but if you ever truly love a band, if it's songs are the literal bright notes of your day, if they make you feel for once in your life you are not alone in your sentiments- go see them. Don't give a fuck if you're going alone. Find your medicine, use it.",lonely,"On the topic of posting topics on how not to be lonely...I went to a concert solo, a first for me.",2019-07-17 02:30:41

925,telbu1,1563293449,2,"This night, I () dreamed something I think was beautiful. I still think about it now 6 hours later.

I remember I was with my mom's side family who were going on vacation to warmer areas. I wasn't going to join them on the vacation, but I joined them until they were leaving for the airport. Before the airport, we were at a hotel or restaurant or something where we said our goodbye's. I noticed a girl was with us, unknown to me. She had blonde hair, a pink jumper, and light blue jeans. 

I can't remember much from before we went to the hotel, which was a 1970's dark brown wooden building with flat roofs weirdly enough. I think me and this girl shared a few laughs before then. At the hotel in the dining area, all the seats and tables were taken, so I had to sit on the floor. I think someone else sat on the floor with me, but I can't remember. I sat by the wall behind where the girl sat on the chair by the table; she turned around and faced me, and we chatted. I can't remember what we talked about, but as she conversed with the others on the table, she turned to me several times and we talked and we laughed. I asked her her name, and I can't remember what her name was, but after that, she kissed me. The kiss felt real and physical. She kissed me by the table, and I remember the others by the table saying, ""Why did you kiss him? You have fever."" That one was pretty random I think, but I didn't mind it in the dream. After, we walked around the hotel, laughing and talking until they left for the airport. I was pretty happy in my dream, and I think I added her on snapchat.

When I went to go home, I noticed an old friend who I'm no longer friends with work at the hotel. As I was walking home, he stopped me and we left together. We talked about what we were doing with our lives, and what we are studying and such. This time the streets looked like a street in Oxford in England (I'm not English), a street I only have seen photos of, but I didn't think about it then, only until now. We then went to a football/soccer pitch which was just across the street. This pitch resembles the football pitch nearby me. I remember I then went home to get dress myself up in athletic clothes, but I lost them in the washing room and I was frustrated that I couldn't find the clothes; that's when I woke up.

I woke up to a feeling of hopelessness, helplessness and anger. I thought I had slept for hours, but I only slept and hour because I woke up sometime before I dreamt this. I felt this hopelessness when I woke up because I realised this isn't my life; this girl who was full of life and was happy to talk to me has never existed. The dream about my old friend has made me realise what a miserable life I am living now, that I have no friends, no future.

You're not a bad person if you want sex and no relationship, people have been doing that since, well, people.

You're not unlikeable or annoying if you talk a lot. Just make sure you believe what you say. If your friends think that's annoying, they're not your friends.

You aren't destined to become whatever your parents tell you. All it takes to have a kid is a series of stupid decisions. And if you relate to this, you're probably smarter than them. Hang on to that.

You're not a bad person if you're lonely. People are really REALLY bad at dealing with social problems. All it takes to give life another chance is for someone to open up and say ""I'm lonely too"" and I think we've got that in spades here.

I have been alone far to long.
Sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold.

 When I was in my 20's I fell in love for the second and last time.
We were together for 14 years.

 YES, I made my share of mistakes and often took for granted that she would always be there for me (us).

Until one morning as we were getting ready for work she told me that she was leaving me and moving out. 
This devastated my soul.

 And while I have dated since then, I just haven't found anyone to spend my life with.
Someone to share the good along with the hardships that are just a normal part of life.
 
 I am college educated and hold degrees in engineering along with long time studies in psychology.
 
 As the weather turned warm, I watched people as they went about their day, hand in hand.
 Maybe I shouldn't admit this but it brings a tear to my eyes.

Someone who loves to discover life,
Someone who enjoys debating life, love and the nature of the universe.

934,GraysonJune_,1563270112,1,"Hey everyone. I'm sort of venting here, so don't mind me. 

I'm 21. And I have practically no friends. This is either due to unfortunate circumstances of my own doing or mostly things out of my control. Either way, i am learning to accept the role I've played, however big or small.

I've been in two relationships that were long distance and both have ended terribly. I've learned a few things from both, but the most prominent for me is ""Never put your ALL burdens on one person"" and since I'm obviously here in the subreddit, I'm incredibly lonely. They were my only source of reliable therapy sessions. Why would I seek professional help when I have a girlfriend and a therapeutic confidant? Right?

Well. Bit of backstory, I haven't been single since I was 18. I never truly experienced the single life and the freedom it has. And after my last relationship ended recently, I made it clear myself that I would improve myself, for myself. 

That means, therapy. Making friends and not being lonely all the damn time. Having an exercise routine. Finding hobbies that I enjoy solely for self entertainment. Practicing self love. Etc.

I know for sure I'm a handsome guy so I won't be lonely too long. Especially once I start college. But I need to put the work in. I'm lonely because of ME. and me alone. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that for me, and for a lot of you guys, that loneliness can be beautiful. A time of reflection, and introspection. A time to adjust to yourself and realize what you want from life. I don't know. It's 5:40 am where I am currently and I just felt the need to type this up.

Maybe as a way to feel a bit less alone. Not too sure. Anyway, I hope you have a good day assuming you've read all of my ramblings.

935,Bucky_Drizzle,1563264306,5,"to be honest, i don’t know why i’m writing this. i literally just typed in “r/lonely” to see what would come up because that’s exactly how i feel right now. 

i’m what i’d call at this point an unwilling misanthrope. i truly wish i were better at talking to people, i really do try my hardest to be social when possible and maintaining a general positive energy. but the problem is, i can’t fucking stand being around like 99% of the people i come across. like there’s just something in my brain that makes me absolutely loathe the idea of interacting with people and trying to make friends. 

there’s approximately 4 people in my life that i can stand to be around. one is my own mom, the other three are friends i’ve made throughout my life. the problem is, i feel like i’ve grown apart from each and every one of them and i feel like i alienate myself further with each passing day. i hardly talk to my mom anymore, two of my friends are in different states and hardly talk to me outside of sending the occasional meme or something. as if to acknowledge that they still know i exist and making sure i’m still alive. 

there is one person in my life that is in close approximation that i tolerate. in fact, i don’t just tolerate him. i love him, he’s the best friend i’ve ever had and he’s one of the few people i’ve ever felt comfortable around. the problem is, i feel like i’m growing slowly more dependent on him and it feels like i just have a constant voice in my head telling me that someday he’s going to find someone that he likes being around more than me and i’m going to get dropped. i have some really bad abandonment issues due to trauma in my past and i try my hard to reassure myself but it always just gets stronger and stronger until it completely overwhelms me. 

i don’t know what to do with myself. the people i used to love are either no longer in my life or are slowly inching their way out of it. i don’t even know why i’m writing this to be honest. i think i just needed to let all of this out. it doesn’t really matter if anyone reads this. if you somehow read all of that without blowing your skull out the back of your head, i will be genuinely astonished and i offer my sincerest apologies for wasting your time with my angsty, depressive, insignificant drek.",lonely,i feel like there’s something broken,2019-07-16 18:05:06

I don't want my sister to feel responsible to keep me entertained and feel guilty, but I don't have anyone else. My mom sometimes yells at me to stop complaining about being bored, I don't think it's because she's being an asshole, but rather she's heartbroken for me and doesn't know how to fix it. 

My parents don't let me out of the house alone because I've gotten involved with boys and that sort of stuff, so they don't trust me. Im 18, going to turn 19 next month. Also because there's homeless people, drug users and such where I live. I have a nice body and I'm small so my mom's afraid of me getting abducted and sex trafficked....so am I. 

I've talked to a lot of people online and met up with a few strictly for hook ups, never for a friendship. It truly hurts when I see other people having fun with their friends on insta and irl. I get so...angry and jealous because I know it's just in arm's reach yet so far. 

My mom says that I *need* to join a club in college and has bribed me in the past with cool backpacks, video games, etc. and has even threatened to take my phone away as a ""consequence"". I have social anxiety and literally no one during my senior year has ever batted a fucking eye lash at me...except to ask for a missing homework assignment. 

I'm just so tired. I'm tired of panicking, I'm tired of feeling pressured at parties to socialize and when I don't, I get yelled at. 

My mom has told me that she's afraid that my loneliness will turn into anger, but it's too late. It's only a matter of time until I explode. What's holding me back?

941,Omegalodong,1563253498,1,"Well. I at once should‘ve gotten this of my chest (not like 6am after a sleepless night is the best time, but f*ck it). But first, let me describe myself a bit, aight? 

Hi! Im Omega (real name hidden for obvious reasons), 21 years young and a swiss citizen. Im still living at home, am single and had somewhat a „normal“ childhood. Normal in the case being raised the old fashioned way, respext my elders, finish what you eat etc. My early years were somewhat nice, having a few friends to play with in the old neighbourhood, but fewer at school. Got bullied for 6 years straight and kinda let myself be the lonely one with minor points where i stood up for myself. After that like any normal teen gotten an apprenticeship at a local store. Through there met some nice folk, but only talked whilst i was at buisness school. Following 5 months been working w my father, working on that dad-son bond i felt was not as it should have been. Till that point (19 y/o) i tried to date a few lovely women, but always got rejected (5 times was it?) either because i messed up or showed my feelings to no approval. 

After my time working with my dad, i got drafted in because service is mandatory here where i live, and i cant deny its not as bad as i thought. But i never had anyone considered a friend i talked outside my profession/work besides some short and longterm online buddies. This went on till November last year, where i decided and pulled through to become a Sgt. After training for that i continued back in my old unit, w the same CO i had before. In between my dear father suffered a stroke which left me now with enjoyment of snuff to a certain degree (various from week to week where sometimes i endulge myself lavishly or dont snort at all. At first it was to REALLY numb the psychological stress, but after that its more for enjoyment). Now im more than 1,5 yrs in military and begin to approach the end of this time. Havent dated since about 2,5 yrs, still live at home. Dad is still on rehab, my mom handling quite well for herself. Me on compensational leave, vegetating since yesterday in my room.

I always relfected upon my life, what i did, how i approached it.

To the unkeen eye im a carefree extrovert, i talk open about most things and i love (most) people. I invest myself in learning others, what drives them and generally show interest in most things. My work ethic is: without genuine effort nothing is gonna work. And still i sometimes feel pity for myself, do i overthink myself? Am i the best i can be? Or am i still learning what life is and what i should do with it?

After long consideration, theres so much id love to change, things i wouldve done or said, but right now?

I think im happy and okay with who i am. Yes, i dont go out on weekends and trash myself with alcohol, mainly because i hate loud places, secondly is my lack of friends. 

Maybe im just a bit in need of sleep or a bit „high“ on the nicotin from the snuff. Guess this one of those „existencial crysis“ kind of things where i dont know how to put things or think of them.

In the here and now, i somewhat feel accomplishement with what i did till now in my life, and the many years to come.

I am accepted in high school that i wanted mot to be in(interior design and design for industrial items) but i dont think people will accept me there... I have recently moved to another city fo finish 8th grade (in my country school goes like this)

1st-8th grade(normal school)
Than it goes again 1st-4th year (highschool)
And 1st -4th year collage 

In my new school (the one that i went to finish 8th grade) was horrible i got bullied,(i am a pretty big guy and muscular) amoast got beaten to critical state (it was 5 them against single me) even teachers gave mi lower grades that other got even if i had answer same questions....

But my suffering didnt start there. I used to live very happily life with my family(mom ,dad,gradma..and so on) but when i started going to school it all fell apart...

My mother's mom died when i was attending 1st grade(7yrs old). I didnt even cry then i just knew that my grandma is gone... Soon after that my mom got in fight with my fathers mother and i have nevver seen them again until my parents divorced..

It was good in school I was good with every one but my teacher....(where i live u only had 1 teacher in 1st-4th year of school) she always blamed everything on me (my slow writing and so on..) so my frends started hateing me bcz my teacher did so... i only had 4 frends then who knew that is BS...

When i was 4th grade, my parents got devorced(my father cheated on my mother) and i was left to live with my mother....

Only her and me in whole house... Her work schedule was like this 

every day she goes to work at 7am and comes home at 7 or even 8pm so i had to get used to cooking my meals and makeing dinner for my mother.( I finish school at 6.15 pm and im home at 6.30pm (i lived in a small town)

It was like that untill the 7th grade started it was like i was blind the whole time and i realized that everyone is avoiding me so i just stopped talking with everyone and knew i was going to be alone....

One of my best girl-friends relaised that i had changed and asked what the reason of it was, I didn't know what to say so i just said ""I'm leaving"" that was near the end of 7th grade

No one knew that i was going to move places and not finish school with them....Even i found out that at the start of the second half of the 7th grade.

So on summer i moved to other town where my dad lives to finish school...

I thought the things are gonna change that i will be acepted like ther new friend...But those were only thoughts it was like hell near the end of 8th grade i met 2 guys that accepted me but i knew that they are soon gonna be gone bcz im not going to the same high school.

957,hamartiated,1563240345,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat),2019-07-16 11:25:45

One ""friend"" in particular has really been getting under my skin lately. We haven't hung out in about 7 weeks (oh, yeah. That's usually how it always goes. We'll literally see each other maaaybe once a month at the very most -- definitely a great friendship), and I'm constantly being pushed aside regardless. The worst part is, this person thinks they are my best friend; they will say all the things we're going to do, and how much my friendship means to them... It's been like this for far too long. We'll both be off for an extended amount of time, and we won't even see each other once. I really thought this person would be as excited and anxious to hang out with me as I've been to hang out with them. I would have no problem moving some things around to see them, but I'm just not getting the same energy back. I've come to the conclusion that this person is selfish, but pretends not to be. They even recently posted photos of me, and various other people that they deem important online, proclaiming how important we all are, and what we mean to them... Ironic. I used to think this person's intentions were good, but now I just feel as though the entire thing is an act (I wasn't even asked if my photo could be put up, and I'm sorry, but I don't find it necssary to state any of what was said in a public social media setting for everyone to see). I need to remove this person from my life.

I have a problem and although I hope no one else feels the way I do, I still have to ask you this question.

One thing I have noticed as I age is that people come and go. Friends move away to new places and you get out of touch. They get girlfriends and loose interest in you. This has given me a feeling of hopelessness. Like there is no point in making new friends since they all go away in the end any way.

I miss someone in my life that I can get to know and that I can talk to everyday. Someone that does not just leave like it's nothing.

He has a son, I guess my nephew, and another child on the way. He is married and the two kids are from the same woman. The only reason I bring this up  is because he recently asked me to move back down to California  and movie in with him and his wife to work with him.

Im 23, I work a boring ass sedentary office job. I go to community college part time. I live an extremely isolated lifestyle, I never go out or do anything other than go see a movie alone sometimes, and I spend 90% of my time in my bedroom.

My income is decent and my school is getting paid for with tuition reimbursement, but its extremely stressful, I’m “walking on thin ice”, and the workload sucks the life out of me. I don’t feel happy at all. It’s a weight on my shoulders. 

My social skills aren’t very good either. I can tell people don’t take me as seriously because I’m a bit naive and too nice. I’m kinda awkward, and it feels like “work” when I go out with people or try to host/initiate something. I don’t really have ANY close friends that I talk to on a regular basis. I can’t really relate to anyone either. 

I wish I had a partner that would genuinely want me and love me for who I am and want to HUG me.. **tight.** It really sucks not having that. Just the comfort and warmth of holding another person. I want that so badly. Dating definitely becomes 10x harder once you’re out of college and you get into the real world and away from a school campus.. 

Dating sites never worked out for me either; even when I paid for the premium account. Always got ghosted. So I’ve given up on those. I’m most likely gonna visit a brothel or hire a prostitute where it’s legal. Seems like the best/realistic route for someone in my situation with my personality to have an intimate/sexual experience for once.

I don’t live or work around people who are my age. Most of the people around me are in their late 40s and 50s. 

I think I might have developed a mild form of depression recently because I lost a LOT of motivation and energy all the sudden that I used to have not too long ago. I used to go to car shows, city festivals, go to the beach, and go to the gym religiously. 

Now I really don’t give a shit about any of that. I don’t really see the point anymore. I just come home from work and immediately either take a nap, get off to porn until I’m burnt out, or just play games on my PC.

I don't feel truly connected to anyone and I always find myself focusing on my negative qualities. It all feels fake. I always smile, say hi and good morning and treat everyone with respect but idk it seems like I'm off putting and it pushes them away.

They want to make plans to go to a bar or something to catch up with me but never follow through and I always feel avoided.

995,BetterLYF_Official,1563195979,6,"**Understand Loneliness**

The desire to be around people, being heard and understood is a very natural one and when unfulfilled, it results in a feeling of loneliness. Loneliness is an emotional response to lack of companionship, loss of connection and [communication](https://www.betterlyf.com/articles/relationships/nine-steps-towards-better-communication/). It is a state of mind that craves for connection but somehow stops us from making one. 

Loneliness strikes in when we lack a ‘true connection’. Irrespective of the number of friends we have, we might still feel lonely if we’re unable to find companionship or don’t feel understood. Loneliness brings about a huge change in how we perceive things around us.

* We may assume “no one understands me” based on earlier experiences
* We may feel sad or unwanted in a crowd.
* We may fall into a relationship very quickly out of the need of having someone around and end up feeling lonelier when we fail to make a true connection.
* Thought of “why me” may stress us out and add to the whole struggle when we see people around us happy and getting along well with people.

**Dealing with Loneliness**

* Recognize what makes you lonely- First step towards helping loneliness is to find out what is that we want in order to feel better. Unless we find out what triggers our loneliness and what is missing, we won’t be able to work towards it.
* Initiate- While we have in mind what makes us sad, initiating a connection would help us reach out to people and reduce loneliness. Drowned in isolation we may unknowingly keep ourselves from initiating. This is something we can change.
* Find potential places- We can go out in search of places or activities that engage masses. These may work as a medium of finding like-minded people and building new networks.
* Focus on quality- Our focus must be on building a ‘true relation’ rather than ‘for the sake of having one’. Once we find a quality relationship, we may not care about the number of relationships we have.
* Use alone time- Loneliness could be used to explore our own selves better than ever. We can invest this time in pursuing the interests that would help us feel light and fresh.
* Positive self-talk- In loneliness, we may very often think negatively about ourselves. This may reflect in our perception of surroundings and in turn, we may expect rejection from people all the time. Talking positively to ourselves will help us improve our self-image and attitude in social relationships.

Share your experience with us. Let us connect to make ourselves fulfilled.",lonely,LONELINESS,2019-07-15 23:06:19

I have known them both for over 20 years and I would do ANYTHING for them. they are also both serial monogamist. As for me, it has been over 10 years since I have been in a physical relationship. as far as sexual orientation I don't really lean one way or the other.  I just like to be alone. my space is MY space.  

to get back to what I was saying it has been over a month since I have spoken to either of them. they message me  and I don't get back to them. one of my friends is an expected father and I skipped the baby shower. I said I had work and I couldn't get out of it. which was true enough. but truth be told I didn't want to go.
I am very happy for him, I was the first person he told that he was going to be a dad. I just couldn't be fucked to go and celebrate with people I didn't want to be around.

Time keeps moving forward and I am just sitting here. Not willing to move forward, obstinate and unchanging. I feel like the only way my friends can move forward in their life is by cutting me out of it. I am a shitty friend. I kind of feel like I am forcing their hand to getting rid of me.

I'm just drunk and rambling at this point. these two friends I would do anything for... It's like that song:""I would do anything for love, but i won't do that""

Had a boyfriend. Very Rocky relationship but I wasnt alone and I felt loved despite the arguments. Now I'm alone again, but with a fresh new set of memories that make me 30% more depressed. 

I fell in love with him over the course of our 6 month relationship. I’ve had plenty of relationships before but never been in love. He was perfect for me despite the fact we didn't have the best relationship. The highs were high and the lows were low (at least 1-2 large monthly arguments). He was almost my dream person. I was his. We spent too much time around other people but we we were good when we were alone. too many friends ended up getting hit by one (weakest hit ever didn't even feel it) I'm so confused. He's hurt me so much but I can't get over him. I'm mad. I usually just get over people quickly. I say ""f them"" and move on but I can't

He broke me 

Every negative thing that's happened and that he said keeps playing over and over in my mind. I already had severe clinical depression and anxiety and was dealing with it well but now I want to give up. He tipped me over the edge. He was the first person I've ever 100% opened up too. Told the extent of my mental illness. Told of my trauma which I never tell anyone and it all blew up in my face. 

He wasn't very good with words and was blunt. He's made me so self conscious of my personality. And my MI. And now I feel like I'm intruding in this world more than ever. 

Over the course of our relationship I kept a list of what he has said during our arguments. These were always on private and He would always apologize. And I have a shall mouth too but never called him names 

- Immature 
- Always act like the victim
- childish 
- I'm embarrassing
- Awkward/Make things uncomfortable (He said this alot)
- Make things weird (in a group)
- Pathetic
- Always think I'm right
- Insecure 
- Act like a child 
- Always have to have my way
- Too dominant
- Just go on and on 
- Always break down 
- pointed out that I have No friends 
- Don't know how to act around people
- ""You've probably between doing this your whole life and no one s ever told you""

Alot of these were repeated like bingo and became predictable during arguments. 

Other things that messed me up
- he grilled me about my response to a traumatic event I told him about the week before despite me breaking down and having a panic attack (he was just wondering and realized it came off bad) and then got mad I got depressed and slept with someone else. We weren't ""official"" at this time even though we were
- constantly interrupted me whenever I spoke and cut me off. When I finally pointed out he did this, he said he didn't realize it. But the next week I pointed it out and he said it's because I don't get to the point quick enough sometimes. He really really struggled with not interrupting me
- during one of our last big arguments he broke up with me, told me to leave then physically wouldn't let leave for 30 mins which obviously made the argument worse. He then said he didn't actually want to break up with me and didn't actually want me to leave
- after our last big and final fight. He sent me 30 texts basically outlining how good of a boyfriend he was ""I pay for everything, I drive, I incorporates you into my life and my friends etc."" I didn't respond. He never let me pay and i always was the one to drive 30 mins to his house so obviously he's going to drive us to dates and the other stuff just pissed me off

Obviously there's a lot more 

Not sure what the point of this is but yeah I don't know how to get him out of my mind.  All the stuff he's said and done have really messed me up. Like really really badly and I'm lost",lonely,"All alone again, but worse",2019-07-15 18:22:10
1006,alone_at_midnight,1563178383,0,"It's time for a background information dump. Please grab your popcorn and soda and head to the front...

In all seriousness, I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for years. Ever since my 14th birthday, it has been as if a hurricane had formed around me. It got to the point where I was barely functioning day to day. I didn't want to do anything. I cried until my eyes became deserts and couldn't squeeze out any more tears. And what did everybody do? They ran. That's what you do from a hurricane right? You run and you spare your losses(I'm not a hurricane expert, I imagine that's what people do). I became too tired to chase anymore. My legs felt like they were cut from under me. I felt trapped inside of my head, in a glass box while a beast stalked me, scratching at my cage and wanting to pull me under.(Fact 1: I am very dramatic). 

I thought I was over that. I thought that, after my stint in a mental hospital this year, that it was all behind me. That I could become...""normal"". Not obnoxious, not annoying... just normal. Whatever qualifies as normal these days. I thought that I was free from the hurricane, that I had broken the cage, that I had slain the beast. But no. These past few months have been a reminder that I will always fuck it up. I will always be a fuck up. I will always push people away. I'll always be the last picked. 

So I come here today, filled with nerves and a shaking finger above my screen, hoping that I can find somebody to connect to. Because that's what I crave. Connection. Something to make me feel...alive. A connection that will light up my nerve endings and put a spark back into my eyes. Maybe... Maybe I can find one today...

Some random facts about me to help the search:
1. Read above... or don't. I'm very dramatic. That's the fact. It's up there somewhere as well though. I think. 

2. I am a huge gamer, to the point that I'm starting a YouTube channel surrounding gaming. I know, a millennial with a YouTube channel. Original. I'm trying to use the channel to bring smiles to people's faces and spread positivity. That's the number one goal. 

3. Oh right my age. That boring admin stuff. I am a 19 year old male with the enthusiasm of a 9 year old and the back of a 59 year old. I am open to talking to people of any age... not in like a weird way. You know what I mean. 

4. I am very passionate about music, specifically rap, RnB and pop, but I'm open to all genres. Music is a beautiful form of connection. 

5. I collect Pokemon cards solely because I think they're cute. That's literally the reason. 

I think that's enough about me. If you're interested (completely or even vaguely. Like 1% interested is enough I feel) , please DM/PM me or leave a comment. I'm here for anything: if you want to make a friend, if you want to talk about your experience with loneliness and depression, if you want to talk about soup, I'm here. Hopefully you're here too.

This all started with my girlfriend and I breaking up. Both of us moved our own ways and I didn't think too much of it. 

Its been 2 months and every time I see my roommates(that are currently in a relationship) being lovey and such, I get quite jealous and I do feel like I'm missing a lot. I've tried to get back out and try to bring myself up from it, I always stall and just lose self-confidence. 

(This may not be the place for this next section, you may skip if you find it irrelevant)
Here is another great thing: My roommates works at the same place and they invited one of their mutual friends, Let's call her A for the sake of things, over. We all got together and started to play board games. When we started to play, I didn't feel that kind of sadness or loneliness in me. I felt so happy, secure, and assured that it was the four of us and it was amazing. Her and I baked cookies against my roommates, we watched movies, and even went to the mall and it felt like I was whole and back to being happy. As all thing do come to an end, she left and I am back dust. 

Moving along, yesterday and today has felt like a bog and has really taken a toll on me to a point that I haven't left my room. I enjoy my roommates, but I think they will find all of my worries odd and brush them off. 

I am lost in my own self-pitty that I can't seem to crawl out of and I am not sure what I can do.

1024,DeathByE5Pawn,1563161103,3,"Is it possible that I am not physically unattractive or don’t have social anxiety but just an awkward, lazy coward who avoids responsibilty at every oppurtunity and this is actually why I am lonely? 

Honestly I feel so damn worthless just thinking about what privelages and oppurtunity for good I had, yet still managing day in day out to utterly waste them away. I don’t even think I have any mental issues that I couldn’t have control over, not very poor, not a bad childhood, yet ending up so damn unsatisfied.

I think it has gave me actual depression over the past few months just living by myself, only going outside to get food and excercise to get a little dopamine rush for a couple hours, then back inside to my miserable existence. It gets especially bad at nigts, I frequently have suicidal thoughts of just throwing myself out the balcony. On the occasional morning that I feel a bit better, I think to myself that maybe this can actually be the day that I can start doing something with my life even though I am late, yet a few hours later I am back in this hole again.

Is there anyone else here that feels a similar way? Would you tell me to suck it up and take more responsibility? Is it possible to turn it around? (I know it should be, but actually possible with my crap mindset).

I am sorry for venting so much, I just needed to get these thoughts off somewhere even if no one reads it. I have been resisting for a couple months, just lurking the past week or so.

1030,hamartiated,1563154208,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Sadly this doesn't happen a lot, even though there are a lot of people around me I've always felt lonely, due to the people around me not giving a frick about me.
That's why I have never and will never speak about this irl, my biggest fear is people thinking I do it for attention because as I mentioned, there are a lot of people with whom I come in contact on a daily basis (mostly close family and school ""friends"").
A second reason why I have never said anything is because I know that there are people out there who have it way worse than me, (cringe warning very sorry) but like 2 months ago a girl in my science class touched my hand cause she said it looked soft, after that there were no more interactions (as with most of my other classmates) and I legitimately thought for like 2 weeks that I was in love.

Just felt like warning you all.  Sometimes, being with people is way more lonely than being alone.

I've been married for over ten years.  Have what many of you would consider the dream situation.  Good paying job, wife and four kids all doing well in school.  It feels like a prison to me most of the time.  Wife loves me, but doesn't understand me.  Kids don't get how much work I out into making their childhood better than mine.  Most of my friends have moved on (once you get married your single friends mice on, and your married friends are too busy).  No one takes care of me.  I am so aline, while surrounded by so many people

For you single lonely people, please do not rush into a relationship just to avoid being lonely.  Take you time, and marry a friend, not someone based just on looks or money.

I look at my family from the outside, and it looks so damn perfect.  From the inside, I'm depressed, don't find joy in coming home to my wife, and am dying inside.

The only thing that would make it worse is a divorce, which isn't currently in the picture, but would destroy me.  I am not looking to leave.  May sound strange to you, but I want to honor my wife an cherish taking care of my family.

I'm keep working on my loneliness every day, and my relationship everyday, but it is hard.  And slow.  And painful.

Just, please, for me, take your time and find someone who makes you happy.  I get that loneliness sucks.  O so badly it sucks, but it beats being with the wrong person, or even a good person who simply doesn't understand how to make you happy. 

Hang in there.  Take chances.  Get your heart stomped on a couple of times.  It is all worth it to find that right person.

Good luck to you all.  I pray for each and everyone of you.  You deserve to be happy, and not alone.

Feel free to write to me if it helps.  I don't have all the answers, or even most of them, but I have an open ear.

1068,adequatelymysterious,1563119526,1,"But, emotionally I keep falling into ruts and having intrusive thoughts that tell me I am and I deserve what I’m going through. I am at the end of a multiple year marriage to someone I chose because of my fear of abandonment. At this point, the pattern of pursuing people emotionally unavailable to me is clear. But, I’ve been incredibly codependent and haven’t done much of anything to make friends or self-care and connect to myself. I focused on being their backbone and support. Now that it’s over, or that paperwork is being filed, I feel such grief. It’s like someone has died.  We still live together for the next few months and they’ve already begun moving on. We’re also in a new city, miles from anyone I know or trust and to top everything off I’m struggling with major trust issues. 
I’m either completely contained and unwilling to try or oversharing my deepest hurts (irony) with people who haven’t proven that they won’t hurt me as well. I mean they’re mere acquaintances or internet strangers. All in the attempt to connect on a genuine level and find some friendship, some community or support. Sigh. Knowing that ultimately my choices are the reason for the position I’m in. And those are because of my attachment style and fear of abandonment which stem from the way I was raised- is helpful. I at least feel like I’m not alone in that way. But, I know that I have SO much work ahead of me to develop self compassion, love myself and be secure that I worry I won’t make it and I’ll be stuck feeling this awful ICKY (la Brea tar pit stuck) static miserable feeling forever.",lonely,Logically I know I’m not the only one,2019-07-15 01:52:06
1069,lonelyanxiousfreak,1563118773,1,"So I always, like a kid, admired kid messages and one I like is “Be yourself.”

I don’t get why being blunt and honest I need to change. I don’t get how I am aggressive, defensive and unpleasant. Someone said I attacked others and I never realized until they said what they meant by that. I call out mistakes, get angry over people using pronouns and not being specific, etc.  I try to get along and it always ends with the person calling out my mistakes emotionally (my emotional ones, not them being emotional although they probably are).

I hate the outdoors and am probably allergic to the seasons except winter. I hate standing still for three minutes or more because of pain. I hate anything active and then people claim I am just inflexible. I am but I want fun too without pain, not my fucking problem. My parents say to stop complaining and just move on because it is incurable, but I can’t help it. My hypersensitivity issues with my hearing, food texture, smell and fabrics also makes me bitch and moan constantly because even toilet flushing hurts my ears and makes me tremble.

People I swear to god suck ass at following my rules. I don’t mention my rules at first because they seem uninviting apparently, but as soon as someone breaks it I will call them out. My rules are broad but general ones are not being specific or being indirect and pissing me off so fucking much. Like what the fuck, how would I know what you’re talking about if you aren’t saying what you mean. Like Jesus Christ use logic and shit.

I use a point system to determine if I like someone. If they smile, help me, thank me, obey the rules, etc I will add a point. If they argue, frown, glare, break any rules like talking while the teacher is, I will subtract a point. I notice most are on the negative spectrum.

My cat passed away recently and I cried over it and can’t imagine what would happen if my dog died. I had 17 surgeries (you may recognize my main account, just organizing my account for normal and sad self) and have two conditions. My dog makes my life not hell and I get homesick whenever he is away from me such as school or going to an event. He comforts me both emotionally and physically (sensory meltdowns). I would never commit suicide but feel like if he died I would question why I am alive miserable.

Not sure if my background matters but I was abandoned as a newborn and had several deformities (someone nice I met said to use a new word, so help me out with that maybe). Partial hearing loss due to hole in eardrum, moderate scoliosis, Klippel Feil (fused neck bones), MRKH (missing uterus and vagina), ectopic kidney, extreme underbite (fixed but was bullied for it), cleft palate (fixed), extra finger (gone), and honestly, not to sound pitying, I probably forgot something on the list. But that should be it.

I was a socially oblivious kid (still am sometimes) and have been bullied several times without realizing it. I just do when I would casually tell my mom someone told me to commit suicide and she would storm into the school (exaggerating, just calls them). She made two girls apologize in a letter but they crossed out “sorry” and I found it odd then showed my mom and she got angry again. After my jaw surgery I never got asked why I was weird looking, an ogre, etc

I am usually happy and such but just realizing how many flaws I have and realizing no one likes me IRL makes me feel upset or something negative. I know people like me but it just feels like they don’t because of how many arguments I get into compared to good conversations which leads to negative points on my system.

Socializing is not exhausting but it is if I try my best to not be myself (more agreeable, friendly outwardly, etc). Imagine a math formula. You cannot solve an equation that is scrambled and needs to be reformatted to match the formula to substitute and solve it. Like maybe you need to factor the equation before you use the formula but you never even knew that was the formula you used then. Say I have a solid idea you like chocolate ice cream and then way way later into the conversation you say you dislike it. That immediately destroys my memory (I rely on memorization and premade responses) and then I will call you out. Obviously ice cream flavor is a bit more petty to be angry over. But one scenario that happened was a guy said how I was and then “I guess I’ll have to find someone else to pass time.” It was less than ten minutes and I started the message with “You’re a bit clingy.” I called out his bullshit but my online friend said starting with attacking (I see attacking as insulting him, I was not insulting) would not help me. I asked if he was really 18+ and he said he was married and had two kids and I said I highly doubted that because, well, I don’t think he acts like a married man in his 30s. He called me unpleasant and blocked me. That shit pisses me off and I now know it’s my fault but I can’t help calling someone’s bullshit out. If someone says something completely out of reasoning or predictability I have no clue what to do and will have a mini tantrum over the shit they are doing.",lonely,When you’re lonely and don’t want to change anything about yourself despite receiving a lot feedback,2019-07-15 01:39:33
1070,KebosKebbit,1563118421,2,"Imagine living right now, where the world is at your fingertips, we are more connected than we have ever been in the history of mankind, yet we feel so alone and hopeless and that there is no one out there for us.

1071,smellslikeautism,1563117900,23,"About a year ago, I deleted my facebook account. I waited the... (I think two weeks?) time that elapses before it permanently deletes... and reactivated it. I missed seeing posts related to my business, and from family and the few friends that I have.  

Fast forward to a few months ago. I decided to unfriend and block people that make me feel bad in any way. For political reasons, or they haven't liked or commented on anything of mine in years, so I feel they are not a positive part of my life, I unfriended them.  

So now all I see is advertisements and the occasional post from family or neighbors. I am mostly annoyed by these posts and don't find them funny or engaging in any way.  

Twitter is a cesspool. Instagram is for narcissists. But when I disengage from all of it, I still feel unfulfilled and lost.  

It is tough for a 39 year old to make new friends, and although I am married to a great wife and have three wonderful children, I do miss having a ""bro"" or someone I can drink a beer with. My neighbors are not that. So I am venting here, with no real expectations but it feels good to get it off my chest.

1073,ablondepotato,1563115379,11,"so i posted on r/depression today. i guess that sums up how i’m feeling. i keep getting dizzy, and it feels like the world is swaying around me, but nothing is wrong with me. i need to talk to someone but simultaneously cannot stand the thought of trying to do so. it’s a draining dilemma, and it’s been this way for a while. i keep thinking “yeah, i have the energy to talk to people!” and post on subs lime r/needafriend and r/makenewfriendshere, but as soon as replies flood in, i realise “oh. uhoh.” and shrink away. it’s a vicious cycle.

so, i’m lonely as ever, of course. i don’t know what to do. if this post does get any replies, i’m sorry if i suddenly disappear or stop talking. but, that said, i probs it don’t have to worry about it because i’ve most likely turned away any chance i have of people talking to me now, yikes. in conclusion - how formal - i’m lonely through no one’s fault but my own. and yes, i want to do something about it, but seem incapable of doing so. hope everyone’s alright anyway.",lonely,"just another depressed, not-so-quirky (more like boring) girl :/",2019-07-15 00:42:59
1074,iDislikeSn0w,1563114767,13,"I'm 18 years old, about to turn 19 in a week or 2 and I'm kinda starting to give up...  

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a whole lot of succes with girls; my first 'relationship' lasted about 9 months. Things ended between me and the girl, we didn't talk for a while and then we became friends again.  

&amp;#x200B;

We were for about 3 years until she confessed to me a month or 2 ago she never felt anything for me. and was with me out of pity because 'I was so sweet and I didn't want to break your heart' but I was apparantly still 'special' since I was her first kiss. It stung alot, so I decided to cut contact with her and move on. A bit later she contacted me again, I told her off again and finally she unfollowed me.  

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I was with another girl but we both knew it wasn't working so yeah that lasted about 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I was with another girl, which barely even lasted 2 montshs because there were so many issues in the end.  

&amp;#x200B;

Those 3 encounters were, what, 3-4 years ago now?  

&amp;#x200B;

So I met a girl online last April, around the end of that month. She broke up with her ex earlier about 2 weeks earlier before we met, but that's okay. We got really close, got sexual as well over text and met up for 2 'dates'

 (or whatever I should consider them) - once to the cinema, and once to a cat café.  

&amp;#x200B;

Well, last month she got really moody and went a bit quiet on Discord. Afterwards, she told me she got back together with her ex.  

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I'm happy for her, but I needed some time away from her to get over my feelings before we can be friends again. She went really mad at that for some reason, told my friends (who don't buy into her words) I got mad at her for rejecting me, and then everyone left her Discord server (which we both created so we can both meet each other's friend, since we are both lonely). So that was that, June 16th, haven't heard of her since and am not expecting to.  

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my story. Honestly, after all these encounters I'm kinda just giving up hope and I think I'm just gonna focus on college, work and my family &amp; friends and I'll see who will stumble upon my path... It's super dissapointing though...

&amp;#x200B;

I even tried Tinder but so far everyone ghosts, can't seem to hold a conversation, acts uninterested, never replies or unmatches.  No new matches either in the past few days ;(.

1077,tylerlee6775,1563103609,2,"This is the last of quite a few posts here that I'll be posting.

I'm broken. Mentally I can't remember a time in my life where I was lower. Where I felt more shit. Even during my addiction and throughout the time of my life I was told I'd never walk again I didn't feel this bad. This is a new low. The people I cared about, that I truly loved have walked away and decided they don't want me in their life anymore. The people I hung around with at college are all hanging out together and I haven't heard from any of them since we left. Every waking moment I'm trying to hold back tears although I have none left to cry. 

Emotionally I feel shit. I hate everything that I am, the way I look, my sexuality, my identity. There is t one part of who I am that I can say that I like or that I'm comfortable with. And now, more than ever, I have no one to turn to. Everyone I thought that cared enough about me to stick around seems to busy or have moved on with their life and left me behind, even those that I dedicated hours upon hours of my life talking to and helping.

Physically I'm in pain. I can't eat, hello again anorexia haven't seen you in a while, I can't sleep and at work I can barely keep up with what I have to do. Drinking has become a chore, taking my medication when I should be is near impossible. Showering feels like running a marathon. I can't even function anymore.

I don't know who to turn to as my family don't care and don't understand. They're homophobic so I can't talk to them about my sexuality or identity. They think people with mental health issues are just attention seeking so I can't talk to them.

All I want is a few people I can truly call my friends and talk to and help them as much as they do me. A few long term friends is all I want and even that seems like miles too much to ask for",lonely,Rant and I need someone that cares. I want friends,2019-07-14 21:26:49

1082,SanskritKettlebomb,1563096125,1,"I have a mild disability. It's not severe enough to warrant sick pay, so I work real jobs in the real world, which in general is a privilege, but it's also not just handed out.

I once got a job based on my qualifications. When the boss's boss saw me, he suddenly changed the job profile to target my particular disabilities, forced me to sign a paper with the job description and told me that I was there to defraud the company for workman's comp. I was fired on the spot after one day. Maybe that happened to him before, but I was confounded that wanting to be able to eat entailed that much imagination and contrivance. When I brought this up on another subreddit, the resounding consensus was that I deserved to be fired and that I probably was a criminal. I still don't see it. I had never taken a handout from anyone, and it was insult to injury, as I was 29 and it was the first time I'd been accused of being a criminal just for being disabled. Before then it was just people avoiding me because they were afraid of getting cooties.  

Other jobs I've been expected to prove myself by working up to half of my hours off the clock. It's sort of a way of saying ""yes I'm a freak. I come in peace. I mean you no harm and I will not eat your children."" Advice people give about ""Not letting myself get taken advantage of"" falls flat when they themselves would never hire me, and the only time they've asked for art, architectural or other services from me is because they want it for free. As difficult as jobs are to get for most people, amplify by 5 or 10 for me, which means pounding the pavement that much harder, and when income is found, it comes with more abuse, far less pay, and I make do with what I've got while keeping up appearances of being less poor to avoid even more discrimination. 

I've never been able to commune with other disabled people because I'm outside of a certain cultural demographic. When I lurk communities, I see people talking incessantly about doctor's visits, personal assistants, rehab centers, prescritions, etc, etc. Their whole life revolves around the caring culture and profession that commodifies them, whereas I've learned make my own medicine from natural and grey market sources to stay alive.  I simply don't make enough money for healthcare in the US, and I was never grandfathered into the social security system (no matter, it's being stripped anyway, and disabled people by the thousands are ending up homeless or dead without meds while the public pretends it's all about mental illness and drugs). 

I felt lucky to find a marriage partner 28 years ago. An amputee. I'm no fool. I stayed within my league. I've never taken it for granted, but I spent the first 23 years working 2-3 jobs as my spouse was what you call ""disabled, but from a rich family"".  They could work, but shit jobs were beneath them. And because that was all that was available for people like us, I filled my entire life with shit jobs, no vacations, often 7 days a week for many years.

When I was literally unable to move one night my spouse came to help. When it meant food and shelter loss for them, they helped. So I've helped them gain income by riding on my work history as an assistant, now me being the assistant to them. I've been the one to foster and crutch them into working for a living.  

As they've come to terms with being poor, I've had to deal with their other issues over the years, the first being their stance that there's nothing wrong with pedophilia. We were, like the majority of people disabled since childhood, both sexually abused as children. They, after two years of dealing with the trauma personally, concluded it caused no harm.  The latter issue complements it. In their worldview, people who aren't white are inferior. I'm mixed, so I'm now getting calling the ""N"" word when they're angry (I'm mestizo, not mulatto). it's not in the cute, ironic way. I guess in a sense it's just the thing that happens with aging. I was raised conservative, but mellowed out as I got older. They were uber upper middle class (do what you want without consequences) liberal. In our married years, they've migrated from Scientology, to  Satanism, to Libertarianism, to full on Fascism, which is really not surprising for a life long gamer. In those years they've also completely lost their sense of humor and are a chore to be around. 

Being fascist is expedient, like any cult. You're better than those outside the circle without having to qualify. But what do you get out of it if you're a cripple?  You have no voice. It doesn't serve you. You will be killed, eventually. However, in the past year they've gone full tilt fash I've noticed I actually help others more, behind my spouse's back. It's kind of a way of washing this 28 year failure off my skin. People tend to shit on you when you help them, but if it's a stranger on the side road who needs gas money, or someone who need a bus pass, socks, a snack, I don't get the punishment for merely showing altruism.  It feels good to help a member of the species out without class expectations. I feel a lot like the ending of ""Serial Experiments: Lain"", coming to terms with the fact that you will never be human, and no one will ever know you, or want to, but the few you get to know short term over the years is good enough. 

I knew where society was heading when I was 25, but I honestly never thought I'd live to see 50. I notice a lot of people expressing their despondency at how things are. Is it because you don't like how outsiders are being treated? Or is it because you're afraid of becoming the next outsider?  

I fully understand that I'm dogshit.  Everyone thinks people like me have an easy life, so it's okay to shit on me a little to blow off their own steam. I know that writing stuff like this is foolish, and seeking understanding in the ether of humanity is like asking a rapist for mercy.

It’s inevitable. I would consider 4 people in my life to be my close friends, my best friends. At least that’s how I should think right? It feels...different now.

To explain my circumstances, two of them live in different states, one of them lives in the same city but we don’t really talk anymore, and the last one I regularly hang out with. All unrelated to one another. I understand that they’re off doing their own thing and I’m glad that they’ve discovered many different experiences and are leading their lives. Sometimes I reminisce about the fond memories we’ve had and I’m sure some of you have to with your friends. It makes me wonder what about me attracted them. Platonically of course. Not trying to downgrade myself but it’s a curiosity.

1103,meckager,1563078528,2,"Hi Reddit. I've been struggling with some personal problems recently, and I haven't had anyone to talk to openly about them. Now, due to the anonymity of the platform, I decided I feel comfortable talking about my problems with you all and I need some advice if you have any for me. 

I'm currently in high school, going into my junior year. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for the last few years if my life, in addition to suppressed social skills as a result of family problems in my earlier childhood.

Last winter, I met a girl named Nel in my science class. We hung out a lot that semester, during lunch and free periods. When I was around her I felt happy, and not lonely; it was amazing.

After some hiccups around the holidays, in mid February we decided to start dating. Everything went great for about a month. Then, completely as a surprise to me, she broke up with me one morning in late march. She offered no explanation besides that I was ""clingy,"" and would not explain what that meant to her. I was devastated by this. I was back to being by myself again, and the loneliness set in quickly. It felt even worse to be alone, and my depression was the worst that it had ever been. I tried to ask a few people what had actually happened, but none of them had anything substantial to say to me about it.

A few weeks later, Nel tells our mutual friend, Bill, that she ""only meant the break-up to be temporary, until we're both older."" She then told me this as well, very emotional at the time, crying. Now, the other day I asked her if she meant that still, and she said no, very quickly. I asked her why, to which she simply stated, ""no."" That kind of reopened that wound that had been dealing over. Do you guys know what's going on at all? Maybe you have a similar experience? None of this makes any sense to me. I can't keep beating myself up over it, but I don't know how, or how I can feel less lonely and depressed without her.",lonely,I need advice...,2019-07-14 14:28:48
1104,TootyPirate,1563078184,2,"I attach to people too much because I have no one. I've always been the person that people text or call to vent or talk about their relationship woes, which really makes me think that I'm needed or wanted by people, but then when the time comes whenever I start feeling lonely and try to talk to them, well, I get ""okay""'s and ""Yeah I'll look at my schedule to see when we can hang out"". 


Days, weeks go by with nothing, hell I even decided to just cut contact with everyone and no one noticed. I hate that I'm craving attention, but please just show me an ounce of anything, so that something about me is redeemable. I have to change my contact names in my phone to phrases like ""You never cared"" or ""Never listens"" and turn off notifications because otherwise I'll keep running in circles chasing something I can't get.


It's hopeless and I just want my mind to stop thinking about these people that wouldn't care if I just dropped dead, but I can't.

Like, I don't want a girlfriend for sexual satisfaction, I just want to feel that warmth of someone holding me as I feel the love slowly envelop me. I'm tired of playing online games and talking with random strangers that are probably about 1000 miles away. I want to meet with people in the flesh. I want to fall in love. I want to be held. I just want to stop feeling so isolated from everything. I've walked and biked around my neighborhood that I can recognize where I am by the cracks in the ground. There are almost no kids my age nearby, or at least, they don't leave the house often. School won't start up for another month, but as if that will matter. High school is crazy already. I'm in all AP classes so I have mounds of homework daily and everyone expects me to be smart. I'm tired of living up to expectations I have no control over.

1109,lonely_axolotl,1563073566,12,"I'm not exactly the most proficient at this sort of stuff but I found that the following tips have kind of helped me to build more surface-level relationships (acquaintances). This advice is mostly for small talk. Its a compilation of stuff I've picked up over the years and a book I read.

1. Use the environment/things that the person has when you don't know what to say. Please don't mention the weather. So far this has worked pretty well for me?
E.g. (IRL) 
Me: Is that your favourite character? You seem to  have a lot of merch for it. What is it?
Classmate: How did you know I like him? (It was a mascot btw). Like you know BTS? Its the mascot about one of the members. *Proceeds to talk more about the member represented by the mascot*
So I didn't have to talk much:D 

2. When asking questions, try to make sure that they are open-ended and not yes/no questions so that the other person can elaborate. 

3. Be open about your feelings. Showing them makes it look like you trust them and it helps a lot:)) 
For example, if you are both anticipating something like exam results and you are sitting next to each other you can talk about how nervous you feel. Bonus points if the other person feels exactly the same as you. 

4. Ask them to help you look after your belongings/food when you go to the restroom. It makes them feel trusted so they'll like you more:)

5. Ask them for advice. This one has worked 100% of the time for me. Doing this shows that you trust the person and validates their expertise.  Most people are not arrogant and will not laugh at you for asking for help (mostly unless you are really asking them a dumb question e.g. how to flush the toilet)

6. Do not mention controversial topics if you only have a casual relationship with a person. If they have strong views about something and you kind of oppose them, it probably won't end very well. 

I know this list is not exhaustive at all but I hope it helps :P

Do share any tips if you are willing to I'll be more than happy to hear them and so will a lot of others on here I'm sure.

Sorry if the grammar and/or prose is bad in this, I haven’t proof read it as reading back through my desperate and pointless rants just makes me feel even more pathetic and worthless.

Hey. I am a 19 years old guy, and I feel like I am completely wasting my life away. I have never been in a relationship (despite trying my best with my appearance and personality), I have no friends, I’ve barely been to any parties, I’ve been clubbing about twice, I have no memorable social experiences whatsoever. While other people are having young love, having memorable times with friends staying up and getting drunk and talking the night away I am just sitting here in my room miserable wanting to scream and cry because I want to die so badly but nothing ever comes out. 

I just don’t know what to do, and I can’t take living like this much longer. I really tried my best to make friends, but nobody likes me as I have a repugnant personality that I don’t know how to change. I have tried hard to attract people, but I am immensely ugly and, again, I have a very poor personality. I’ve tried to improve myself a lot: I style my hair, I wax my eyebrows, I take care of my skin, I go to the gym, I practice good hygiene…but none of it works. I’m skinny as shit because mental health ruins one’s appetite, I have a disastrous face, I have a bunch of minor bodily deformities which while not completely malignant on their own add up to an overall unattractive picture when combined with the other characteristics I’ve mentioned. I could go on for thousands of words on every little bit of my appearance that I hate, though it’s not like anyone here cares so I won’t waste either my or your time. I have tried therapy-I’ve probably spent over £4000 on about 5 long-term therapists over the last 3 or 4 years-and it’s not helped in the slightest. They tried to teach me mindfulness, but it didn’t work, they tried to teach me CBT but it didn’t work, they did talk therapy and it didn’t work. I’ve tried 8 different medications and none of them have helped in the slightest. Every single day I get more and more miserable, bitter, angry, and cynical. I want to die so badly, I yearn for it, I need it, god the only way I can get to sleep at night is by comforting myself through imagining killing myself in as vivid and graphic a way as possible. It’s better than the reality I’m in now.

I just look at other people and all the cool stuff they’re doing: having dates, going to the movies, going to parties, going clubbing, going on tinder, having social events with friends (idk what people even do…), and I want it so bad but I cannot get it no matter how hard I try. I am a worthless piece of shit with no good qualities, no skills, and in fact nothing appealing whatsoever. Why would anyone want to be friends with me, let alone date me? I don’t blame other people for not liking or wanting me, I just blame myself for having no good qualities, and to an extent I blame my parents for being selfish enough to birth me. Why did they bring me into this world? I didn’t ask for it, yet now I am morally and legally obliged to trudge through this dire existence which has no happiness and in which I am alone. I want someone to hold me, to hug me, to rub their hand through my hair, and to tell me I am good enough. I want someone to eat dinner with, who I can trust, who I can talk to about random bullshit through the night, hell it’s not even about sex (though that’s not irrelevant to it I guess) it’s more just about the emotional intimacy. I want to be loved, to be able to believe that I have anything good about me to make living worth it. What is the point of it? How can I ever love myself if nobody else does? No-one has ever been attracted to me because I am a miserable, ugly, self-absorbed narcissist who is in constant chaotic flux between superiority and inferiority (IDK what I’m even superior about considering I have no good qualities, I guess just because I perceive my own reality in so much more detail and so much more “in reality” that the experiences I Have within my life are elevate to a greater level of truth or importance. People say oh just have confidence, but what is there to be confident about? People say just be yourself, but I’ve been myself my whole life and it doesn’t bloody work because I am an UGLY AUTISTIC PRICK and my personality is abhorrent to most people. People say, “don’t compare yourself to others”, but these are always the people who are good looking or are in good universities or have good relationships and social environments. It is easy for them to say that as they actually have a reason to have self-worth and so don’t need to seek the validation of others, which I do since I don’t get any from myself (and for good reason). I think my mental health issues are a completely rational response to the situation of my life: having no-one that loves me, having no friends, having no good qualities, having no good prospects, and so on. I know at times I am only going tangentially to /r/lonely on this vent post but it’s all interlinked. 

I want to be held, god I want a hug, I want someone to look me in the eyes and kiss me gently and tell me that I have value, but because I am so worthless I will never get it. I will never find love, I will never be someone’s dream guy, nobody will ever look at me and think damn he’s hot or damn I love that man. Nobody will ever envy me, ever lust for me, ever look at me and have their heart flutter, never be filled with pride, never want to be friends with me, simply because I have no attractive qualities whether that be in the context of romance or friendship. I want to die so badly, I yearn for it, I need it! I can’t shoot myself as I live in the UK, I can’t jump in front of a train as that’d give the driver trauma, I can’t OD because I’m scared of screwing it up and becoming a vegetable, I can’t hang myself as again I’m so so so scared of messing it up. God I want to leave this conscience so badly, I want to go to bed and never have to wake up again, never have to have this deep pit of entropy in my heart with nobody and nothing to fill it. I never want to have to sit on my own staring into the ceiling at night unable to think about anything other than how much I wish I had someone laying next to me who loved me and cared about me and appreciated me. I wish so much that I had friends who thought I was funny or charismatic or clever and who actually wanted to spend time with me and didn’t just feel uncomfortable around me (because I can’t hold a conversation) or pitiful (as I am a pathetic person whose entire life is based around my mental health issues as I have never known any other reality and at this point I am so far into the abyss that my mental health has completely rotted my person into nothing. I am nothing but a messy patchwork of mental illnesses fighting for the top place on my suicide note, a battered husk pulled along the inevitable passage of time with nothing but fear and guilt pushing me forward. My parents were good to me, they really tried their best, but I still resent them for having me and bringing someone so doomed and hopeless as myself into this dire place. 

When I started writing this, I hoped I would get some closure and that I would feel a bit better. I don’t. I still have that pit in my chest, I still feel a constant lump of anguish balled up inside me, I still feel just as manically miserable. I want to get a hammer and smash my flared ribs in and then mash my vile ugly face into shards of bone. I want to slam my head into a wall until this useless thing that one may mistake for a human life is finally set free from this pain and suffering. God, I want to die so badly, I’m so scared though, and I don’t want to do that to my family. I want to be happy and loved and dead and I don’t know what to do I have tried everything I can and none of it has worked! I am doomed not because I have some insane irrational mental illness, but my lack of qualities and of good experiences are so clearly pronounced that the circumstances of my existence are just shit to be in. Other people my age (19) are having the time of their lives, finding love, having sex, partying, doing drugs, and I am just here trying to look up ways to kill myself on “suicide-friendly” websites that I know I’m too much of a coward to ever go through with. I want all these things, I want to be good enough, I’m really trying my best and it’s just getting worse every day every week every month, god I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m sorry, I want it to be over, why must I suffer through this? I’m sorry, this is a stupid post that won’t help me get a solution and that nobody will ever even read. I have made countless posts on /r/depression and /r/suicidewatch but they all get no upvotes, no comments, and nobody cares. I delete them the next day when I see nobody gives two shits about me. I’m trying here instead I don’t even know why, I just want somebody to know my struggle and my pain, I don’t even know why, I am sorry for wasting your time and mine in writing this worthless shit. I want to be hot, charismatic, to be taller, more intelligent, but since that’s impossible all I want is to be dead.",lonely,"I am wasting my life away; bitter, alone, and miserable",2019-07-14 11:34:56

1120,Hellblade999,1563064512,26,"I have fully accepted the fact that I am utterly repulsive to all women and I will die completely and utterly alone, mediocre at everything I do, will never leave a mark on the world, all of that. Life has refused to throw me a bone despite all of the effort I have put it and I utterly refuse to partake in this utter shitheap we call society. I will isolate myself from everyone and everything, cut off all prospects of finding a girlfriend and will give up on trying to find a career in my field because of how much of a waste of time it is. I will take a shitty minimum wage job and slave away for the rest of my days, a befitting existence for how nature has chosen to designate me to inferiority, and will never know true success, love, fulfilment, or the like. 

Life is too damn long and painful and is a piece of shit for some people. People want to brush individuals like me under the rug and tell me about how great life is and how I need to try. Guess what, it isn’t rainbows for everyone. For some people it is harsh, unrelenting, punishing, and all those people who say otherwise have had it fucking good. When you’re a failure of a human being, so hideously repulsive that no one takes you seriously or EVER wants to date you, life fucking sucks and you’re cursed to be alone. 

Here’s to accepting a bleak existence for the rest of my days. This post is to hold me accountable so I actually give up instead of lying to myself about how things might get better. THEY FUCKING WON’T!!!!!!! Hoo boy if life wasn’t to be taken seriously this would be funny, but it is serious and instead it hurts like nothing else.

Since I started loving myself, I began loving my life and began to keep an eye over little things.

Focusing, moving forward and not letting negative energy hit me.

First of all you are never alone, second start loving yourself and the way you are.

So I've always been a shy kid, still am today, but I used to have some friends in my childhood. Some of them I kept, but we only see each other when I'm back home, which is rare, but yeah, not that close of a friendship. I didn’t really make any friends during high school because I was very depressed and got such severe social anxiety that i couldn’t go out anymore, so I had to stay home for a while and basically had to bail on any chance of making any new friends.

I don’t find it hard to make new acquaintances in general, just keeping them as friends is insanely hard for me.

All the friends I considered close all left me, for no reason, some day they would just stop showing up when we decided to hang out, or stop answering texts. Some were just not there for me when I needed them, or too toxic, so I decided to cut ties off. So here I am today, on vacation with literally no one to hang out with. 
""Friends"" I made this college year won't reply to my texts, or are too busy. We used to hang out a lot during the school year but I guess that was just temporary. 

Everyone I know has close friends, people they can count on, hang out with whenever, just normal buddies. I realize I have never been able to maintain a normal, long lasting friendship. I often blame myself and my illness for it, but I consider myself a pretty outgoing, open minded and kind person with nothing but good intentions, somehow no one sticks around for long.

Do you have close friends? Where did you make these friendships? Is there still time for me to make long lasting friendships?

1139,anonymous24132413,1563047863,4,"I wuss out and then I wonder why I’m lonely. I have friends thankfully, though. A few close ones. We bicker at times over small things, but when any of us are going through a bad time, we’re always there for one another. But this is something I can’t bring up in front of them. Not out of fear of judgement, just because I always keep this kind of stuff to myself. I don’t know why. 
I’m ok with being alone, but this is getting out of hand. This is gonna sound bad, but I’ve pretty much never faced rejection. The reason for this is because I’ve only asked one girl out, and we dated for a few weeks and then she broke it off. Ever since then I’ve been scared to ask anyone to be with me. It’s been 2 years and I just want to be loved or watch a movie with someone or cuddle on the couch or some shit like that. Sorry for sounding corny. 
I’m a sophomore in high school. 
I really just can’t take it anymore. I’m not suicidal at all, and I like my life. It’s just so boring. I don’t live in a big city I live in a town in the middle of nowhere. And pretty much all the girls at my school are dating some douche. I’m on the track team, but that doesn’t make me a chick magnet. I just want someone that shares my interests. 
Anyways getting back to the original point, I don’t know what to do. I have some problem talking to girls, but only when they’re around their friends. I saw this one girl. She was really nice and pretty. We exchanged glances and smiles, and I convinced myself that I would find her after this event was over. I never did. And I wonder if I could’ve gotten her number, but I’ll never know because I’m a tard. Is there some secret between guys that lets us just stroll over to girls and ask them for their number/ ask them out? If so please tell me because I’m tired of all these missed opportunities. I’m tired of all these long lonely nights. I’m tired of all this sadness. 
If anyone could tell me any confidence tips, that would be greatly appreciated.",lonely,Why can’t I work up the courage to ask anyone out or anything?,2019-07-14 05:57:43

Hope you appreciate the nickname. Also, English is not my first language. (Trigger warning: includes a classmate who is/was suicidal)

After debating with myself, if I should make this post or not, I've come to the conclusion that if I'm going to bitch about the whole world being shit, I might as well do it once and to the point. Instead of calling it something along the lines of self-pity.
Hold onto your hats, because it's a long one. TL;DR at the bottom.

First, some background. I'm almost 18 years old, I live with my family: my supportive and cool mom, kinda twists stuff sometimes, my racist and homophobic dad, who is somewhat oblivious and/or doesn't give a single crap about most of things happening around him and my brother who has anger issues. I'm still in high school and I've got one year to go. I attend International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, that's really important to my stupid story. If you don't know what that is, bless your fucking soul, I wish I didn't know too. Also, my parents own a grocery store, which will become relevant later on.

So start things off properly, I should mention this earlier, whatever. I'm here because I'm lonely as shit, shocker, I know. Just to show what degree of lonely I'm talking about: my last real friendship (I'm talking the type of friendship when you spend a lot of time with someone beside classes, and actually have stuff to talk about - and talk a lot) ended around 5 or 6 years ago. I have never had trouble with other people, I have never had any enemies. I guess I was just neutral, I could attach myself to any group around me but never was a part of one, even though I tried. Everyone told me that they like me and that I have friends, but the moment I stepped outside of school, it was all gone. My first and only one real friendship I mentioned, ended with the other person telling me ""But we were never friends"". It hit me hard, and even though they came back and said that they were wrong, it was never the same.
I was happy to leave my pre-highschool school, since everything I had were video games and my hobby.

When I started my first school term in a completely new place and with new people, I hoped it would all change, maybe there was something better meant for me. Oh boy, how wrong I was. Remember how I mentioned that diploma programme with a very difficult long words in it? Yeah, I landed in a place where I am the only one who isn't obsessed with good grades. It was probably the worst choice of my life. I'm not saying that caring about good grades is bad, I'm saying that these poor people are pressured by their parents, or themselves to study for long hours, after spending 10 hours at school and sleeping 3. Groups of friends formed asap, lo and behold, I didn't fit into any of them from the start.

Everyone I got along the most, left looking for another school within the first year. It sucked. I got along with Betty, though. First year of high school ended. After 2 months of holidays, with no contact with anyone from school whatsoever, I came back to a whole different place. Betty chose completely different subjects than me, we had no classes together, so whatever we had just fell apart.

Skip forward to around 3 months before the end of the school year. One of my classmates, who I attend psychology classes with, tried committing suicide. So somehow, I got along with her, we played games together and I had a lot of fun. I genuinely liked her, she knew that I think of her as a real friend, after she has shared her issues with me, and so did I. Later on, I learnt that her former friend ratted her out to her mom, about being suicidal. I will call her Lily, not real name of course. So that was why it was a FORMER friend. So she had me now, and I was happy to offer her any kind of support she needed. During Easter, I opened Facebook for the first time in months, and saw a picture of Lily with her former friend. All happy enjoying time together, my initial reaction was ""wow, that's great, they made up!"". I didn't expect what was going along with the fact that they made up.

Next thing I know, Lily isn't talking to me as much as she used to, when I approach her she's all quiet and I feel like I'm bothering her. She spent all her breaks with her now again-friend. So I thought that I would give Lily space, if she doesn't want to talk to me. No problem. Over the weekend, I'm overthinking stuff like I usually don't, because I had a feeling that I was just a disposable friend put in the place of again-friend. After the weekend, I asked Lily to help me with cleaning some stuff in the classroom. She said no, then left. I didn't mind it, she doesn't have to tell me why. Then I saw her standing next to the entrance door to school, so I approached her.

Me: Hey, are you waiting for somebody? (Hoped it was me)
Lily: Yeah.
Me: Who?
Lily: Again-friend, I'm going to hang out with her after she finishes some stuff.

I died inside, just a little bit. Every time she was going to spend time with other people, she always told me about it beforehand. It was just so different from what it used to be. I was really sad, it just confirmed that I was there for her as long as she had no one better. Lily didn't realise that something was wrong until a week later, confronted me about it and said sorry. But it wasn't the same.

A month later, a big project is coming up. Lily didn't get assigned to any group because she has missed a lot of classes. I ended up suggesting her joining mine. Lily was happy and joined. There were 4 other people: Rachel, Betty, Stacy and Kevin (not real names). Lily didn't do jack shit for the project and lied to me about being on every meeting we had regarding this project. Rachel was the most invested in the project from all of us. Betty was lazy and refused to do most of the things, she was there for the fun part. Stacy was eager to do stuff, but she was more down to spend time with Betty. I considered Stacy a really nice gal, really into sports and a big closeted gay. We got along well, I'm bi so she was usually really open while talking to me. Kevin didn't do much but was ready to help with anything, and I appreciated it a lot.

This project has shined a lot of light about my situation. Betty set me up to do all the work when I wasn't at school, just to avoid doing anything. We had a massive falling out, almost argued about it. Short, anything we had died right there. I was left alone with organizing all the data and everything I needed for the presentation. Rachel couldn't be there, since she was gone on an important trip related to her french classes. When the day of presenting the project came, I ended up doing it ALONE, standing alone in front of around 100 other students. I was there alone because Stacy refused to come there with me. Upon giving her a choice, she decided to stay behind with Betty. When I finished the presentation, I was so stressed I had to go to the restroom and cry a little. Stacy didn't talk to me, she just sent a shitty gif on our group chat and tagged me. It all just hurt, some people asked me why was I alone, etc.

So the holidays started, I broke up with my boyfriend who I started to have a lot of issues with. He started blaming me for everything, til the point I actually realised that this is ruining my self-esteem. We had a big fallout when I was brought down to a sex object. No, I couldn't stand that.

I have no one to talk to except my family. I know some people don't and that I should be happy about it. But it doesn't do it for me, it isn't enough. My parents won't talk to me about everything. I can't be myself around my brother, because his violent outbursts are scary. I'm sad almost all the time and just generally feel useless.

Today, I was talking to my mom at their store. I was talking to her how fucking pathetic I am, again, that I don't have friends and that I'm lonely. I'm thankful for the fact that she has gone from ""It must be your fault"" to ""This is how life is"", ""Everyone experiences it"". At least. While talking I accidentally knocked off a quite big bottle of vodka. I felt so stupid tbh. And she said to me ""See, you shouldn't complain about not having friends."". And I wasn't sure how to react to that. Should I stop? Is this all just in my head? I don't know anymore.

Maybe I'm just a very sensitive little bitch, and I'm totally cool with it, if that's what your opinion is. I doubt that anyone has time to read something so pathetic, but here it is. Thank you anyway. Hope it will be a little therapeutic for me.

TL;DR: After few unpleasant experiences I'm left alone with no one to talk to. Had a little accident while talking about this to my mom. She told me that I shouldn't be complaining about this.",lonely,"Should I stop ""complaining""?",2019-07-14 04:09:55

1157,hamartiated,1563012595,4,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Slept around town. Riding the cock carousel. My number is above 70 up to this date. I have been self sabotaging myself, issues about self love and even considering myself a sex addict. Thank heavens, I never contracted any infectious diseases (recently got HiV test screening and is negative). A big part of why I have been doing what i've been doing, is because I grew up hating myself. I've been constantly bullied for almost my entire life, that I end up disliking myself as well, and it turned to actually loathing myself. So, I resorted to alcohol to feel good and sleeping around to just feel being desired. But as I grew older, met good people, and developed real friendship, who made me realise my own value, I somehow started to like myself. In turn, I recently (for almost a year now) stopped sleeping around and focused my energy towards self improvement and my work. Somehow when I am alone at night and I am on my bed, deep thinking about things and worrying about my future, loneliness would always creep in. I feel so dirty and used. I know it was all my fault. I don't feel I deserve to be loved at all. This conflicting feelings of wanting to have another person in my life versus not letting anyone in because i don't deserve any of it, is constantly tormenting me. Should I just resign to the idea of being alone forever? Would there be someone who will accept me as I am? The problem is, I don't want to just settle for anyone who would first offer their love or something. I am trying to be like a normal woman, with a basic standard.

After a while, I opened up with her about my depression and I told her things it had taken me three years to tell my best friend - for some weird reason, I trusted her completely and I was extremely fond of her. After a while, something major in my life and I feared that she was starting to draft apart. I have had bouts of paranoia for a while (and in fact, I haven't mentioned that to her), and my bouts of paranoia started getting worse with that and often she was on the spolight. I regreted having trusted her, and thought that she only continued talking to me because of her consciousness. I ended up posting a text on r/depression where I talked about many things, among them how I was feeling humiliated because of that. She saw it, and she said to me that I was wrong, and that she tried to be part of my life even with her own difficulties. I felt much guilt - to the point of trembling- for some days.

Now, I don't quite know why, I just know I'm extremely fond of her and I'm extremely fearful of her drafting apart from me, and many of my bouts of paranoia focus on that. After our ""fight"" (I don't really know if that was a fight, but whatever), I apologized, and recently I sent her a poem and a little text for her birthday. Yesterday, she said she thought I was pedantic and that I liked to boast ""about how much"" I knew. I don't quite know, but I was offended and desperate - what should I do?

It is weird, I'm not quite sure why this happens.",lonely,"Paranoia, I met this girl and I fear her leaving me",2019-07-13 06:44:35

Currently i work about 6 days a week and my days off are usually in the middle of the week. All my friends are usually out doing other things such as work or school. Granted I'm about 26 so this is adult life right? Working and being bored seem to be the norm. 

I do have hobbies but even them lately feel like they are going no where and i actually feel they are just pointless. Sometimes I feel like all I do is sit around playing pointless video games waiting for the day something happens, or maybe one of my old guilds, clans or friends becomes active again and we start playing again. I dunno maybe its depression or something but anyways.

These past few months have been the loneliest of my life. I would consider myself a pretty happy go lucky and social person and have previously caught up with multiple people within a week and would normally see my friends at school. But I graduated last year (aus) and now all my friends have settled into uni and work and made new friends. Don’t get me wrong, I love the people I work with and catch up with them outside of work as well but I miss my close friends. Half of my friends are in different states and I haven’t seen them in months and the ones that have stayed within our home state are busy when I’m free and vice versa. My boyfriend (2yrs older) tells me it’s just the way it is and more or less tells me to get over it cause it’s the way it’s gonna be now. He means well and doesn’t mean to be blunt it’s just the way he is, but I can’t help that i miss them so much and it hurts so bad. Even my boyfriend is so tired after work (he works full time in a demanding job) that he doesn’t really want to hang out and makes it seem like it’s an effort to hang out.

For about 6 years now ive been pretty depressed and suicidal ( ill be 21 in November ), ive gotten close to ""leaving"" in the past couple years. The one thing that has always pulled me back is my parents, they dont know anything about my depression but they are in an extremely bad debt problem, they owe over $600k in house loans which is the only reason stopping me. My mother has a small business and earns maybe $100 a week if she's lucky, my father works as a laborer and hates it, been doing it for the past 15 years and i can see him slowly breaking down through these last couple of years. I live in a very hot place the weather is a constant 32 degrees Celsius + everyday with really bad humidity and works from 5am to 4pm. I can see that they wont ever earn enough money to pay their debt off. They chose to leave our home country when my older brother was born which was their first child, it was cheaper and there were better opportunities then whats in our home country at the time (they both didnt graduate highschool so a ""proper"" job is out of question). As the years go on they keep telling me that they want to move back home but with the insane debt they've accumulated its pretty much impossible. So at the start of the year i started to think up ideas on how to help them out, not to be a good son but so i can actually ""leave"".  I ended up applying to join the army in my home country, the pay is about $50k a year and gets better after every promotion. I didnt think id get accepted but i did. Ive been working out pretty much everyday and gotten pretty fit in the process, i wouldnt say its enjoyable but i am pushing myself through it quite roughly. ive kinda rambled on for quite awhile but heres what im trying to ask. Is it okay to save up a enough money to help them pay off the debt and move back to my home country so they can live the rest of their lives happily, and once thats done id be able to actually ""leave"" without feeling guilty? I personally dont see a future for me, i dont want kids, ive had terrible relationships and have been cheated on multiple times, i dont really like to socialize, i have a few friends but no one i can really be my true self around. I hated school and barely graduated so i dont see myself being successful, im probably thinking about the future to much but ive always thought to myself that living isnt for everyone.

I loved her more than any other girl I ever dated before her and I’ve never dated anyone since her. I left for the military about 2 and a half years ago and we kinda broke it off shortly before then. It was kind of a bad ending. After basic and even during basic we still ended up talking, she sent me letters and I called her when I got the chance and all that.

1229,IamBadWithNicknames,1562911041,2,"Sorry it's a long post, if you don't want to read it it's fine. If you do: well, thank you. 

I was bullied from second to 9th grade and was accepted in my class the first time in 11th grade. I was super shy - I'd get an adrenaline rushing if some stranger just talked to me. This was to me what others probably experienced back in Vietnam no joke. I was playing video games sometimes for days with only some breaks for food and sleep because it was the only place I received validation from people and I felt I could accomplish something. People always told me I couldn't do things, e.g. study or do fighting sports. At some point I even thought about suicide. Not intense - just like if I would jump out the window it would be all over. I am glad I didn't do it and if you are thinking about it remember we will all die soon enough, no need to go there early. Even if there will be only one more happy moment somewhen in your life, no reason to miss it and there will be most likely more of them. 

Over the course of years I managed to gain confidence. Now I turned from the guy having social anxiety and being scared to be asked something in class to someone who can present in front of a group really well. I did fighting sports for some years and even turned out I am quite smart. I graduated as the best in my class, I am currently enrolled in a really good master program. Even took an IQ test and turns out I got admission to Mensa, a high IQ society.

Also, I stopped trying to do, think or like things to fit in. I really became the person who I want to be. I am content with what I am and how my life itself is going, there is no major thing I want to change. 

However, I just can't find friends. While in the past it was because me being shy, having social anxiety, no personality and a video game addiction, it now is because most people seem to me either dull and empty. I actually turn down some people or don't make the effort. I can't help it but I just don't care talking about meaningless things like football. Also I have opinions about politics and values which are often seen as 'not okay' (right wing libertarian). Generally either people never thought about this and don't wish to or are aggressive leftwingers that treat you like you are murdering puppies for joy. To make things worse I really like 'boring' stuff (e.g. chess, abstract discussions about the meaning of life, values or whatever) and dislike 'fun' stuff (e.g. clubbing, getting wasted, promiscuity).

I just wish there were people I could connect with and talk about whatever I think in an open manner. No need to agree with me or share all my interests. But for the most part it seems impossible. My mother even excuses herself to me while I was visiting for a week to me that she just doesn't have anything to talk about with me. I love her, but most she does in her free time is read thriller books and watch TV.

There were like three people that really meant something to me in my life. Two just stopped having contact with me and one died. To make things worse I found what I search for. There is a girl that I meet by so many random events I can't help it but think it was meant to be (e.g. a wrong visa, a wrong application for a dormitory, me showing up early for theater class and her being at home at the exactly right time). I spent so much time with her, we have many things in common and I talked with her so many times for hours and hours - I never had such meaningful and deep conversations before. But her goal is apparently to have no serious relationships besides her family and since I told her it means a lot to me she seems to seek distance. 

It's just so crushing. So few people out there I can connect with and the one I could so much seems not to feel the same way. Worst, I just don't know what to do about it, I changed about myself what bothered me.

And then I also don’t feel as close to my friends anymore. Some of the ones that I’m not that close with will go and hang with my ex, and I’m kinda just like “alright fuck you guys”. I haven’t said anything though. I guess some of them don’t know the full situation. But I just feel like I only have a few close friends and those are the only kids I want to hang with cuz I feel like I can’t trust anyone else. I feel like I can’t trust anyone. 

I feel like I need someone to replace my ex because she’s not all that great I’m just hurting. But I’m not having luck. And I feel terrible. I feel like I need to be with someone but I know I don’t.

And on paper I’m killing it, can’t get into detail because I don’t want to be identifiable. But I’m killing it, but also barely getting everything done because I feel like shit.

1236,hamartiated,1562897433,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

1251,adamant91,1562874132,3,"I'm 28 years old. I shouldn't be feeling like this. My life is empty, hallow, meaningless.

I'm 28 years old and I'm having a mid-life crisis.

I grew up sweet, kind, loving, naive, and full of optimism. Now I am the complete opposite.  I've  been treated so poorly for so long that, over time, slowly, I have become a monster. All I wanted, growing up, was a friend. Someone I could share with and grow with. No matter how hard I tried, I was always treated like shit, picked on, bullied. I felt my good qualities start to dimish slowly after high school. Up until I met some people on college, friends. At first I was happy, and then I started to realize, I was just being used. I had a couple of relationships in this time period but nothing really lasted. 

Then I met her. I was 20 she was 18. Life was perfect between us. Or so I thought. Love is blind you see. It all came flooding back to me. The joy, sweetness, kindness, and naive optimism. I was a fool. We dated for 4 years. In that time. I heard whispers but payed them no mind. Insecurities started to build for me, but I pushed them all away and put my heart and soul into her. She was my everything. 

We got engaged in 2015. I was going to marry the love of my life. The most beautiful woman in the world. I was so infatuated with her, I couldn't even imagine to look if another woman might be looking my way. We got married in 2016 and got pregnant with our first child the year after.

After months of cyber cheating, drinking, treating me like trash, and emotionally abusing me in ways my heart cant handle, she confessed she slept with someone else just months before we got married. 

Whenever she got upset or mad at me, I was always the asshole. She never listen to a word I had to say to her, and wonder why I stopped talking to her as much. And why we didnt have talks the way we used to together. During early reconciliation she pushed the idea of having another baby. Apparently she never really understood me either. She is now 6 months pregnant. I was so blind to everything horrible in this world. I can't leave her because I love her. I can't stay with her because I hate her.

Being the nice guy turns you into a monster. I have been called an asshole so much, that now. Slowly and subconsciously my mind figured, ""I might as well earn the title"". 

I need help but I'm too ashamed to admit it. I need a psychiatrist but I'm to proud to go. No one knows who I am or how I feel because sharing my emotions makes me week and vulnerable.  I'm so afraid of letting people know or see who I really am because that person has always been treated like shit. Im afraid that someone will use it all against me. 

I'm paranoid, angry, sad, upset, lost and hopeless. I'm 28 years old, and I feel like my life has already ended with how much time I've wasted. 

No one cares enough for me. To push, pry, fight, and shove their way into my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

You have no idea how fucking lonely I am... Seriously, I feel as if my life is spiraling downhill because of that creeping feeling of loneliness, alienation and depression. Every single day I put 12-14 hours of work because I have nothing else to do and need to somehow fill the black hole of loneliness and sorrow eating me from the inside. Every single evening I'm either drinking or smoking weed at home, and when I'm not doing this - I'm seriously scared I'm going to kill myself sooner or later, that feeling intensifies 10x being sober.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any friends, people to hang up with, let alone girlfriend: I don't have any social circle at all, except for two friends who both live 3 and 5 thousand kilometers from me and have their own lives to take care of. At this point I feel detached when looking at people making social interactions with each other, it looks and feels so surrealistic and so sad. Every time I see happy couples passing by, people having fun with each other, families having rest together, friends fooling around, I feel as if the whole universe of sadness and hopelessness is concentrated around my chest and my stomach, which is about to explode. Even watching porn brings me nothing but emptiness and severe anxiety - and hell, I do it extremely rarely, because of my libido being almost non-existent at this point...

&amp;#x200B;

I spend 3-4 days a week in the gym to somehow keep myself uplifted, which doesn't work **at all** for the last year or so. I have no idea how do people socialize, make new friends, not to mention intimate, loving relationships. I'm coming from an extremely poor family and always thought I'd become rich and things would be ok - it was such a fucking trap, you don't even know how fucked up and ironical that is... I swear I would give up all of this fancy luxury shit to simply live a life of joy, happiness and have at least someone in my shitty life who genuinely cares about me and is interested in me as a person, as a man, as a friend, as a soulmate, as a sexual partner - whatever the fuck it be. It may sound fake, far-fetched, irrational, illogical, but that's the way it is. All I really want is just some emotional and physical affection, some basic human intimacy, whether with the opposite gender or not, but sometimes I honestly think that is never going to happen: time is passing by at the speed of light, nothing changes despite all previous effort and attempts to somehow fix my miserable lonely existence.

Take last night for example, 127 stitches in hospital and no one batted an eyelid. No one even cared that I put myself in hospital again. No one even noticed that I'm in a hole deep enough to contain a city. No one see the blood, no one sees the pain and I'm sick of it. Every time I start spiralling all I get is moaned at cause I'm not there for other people and I can't do it anymore

Sorry for ranting but I needed to do it.

1274,FinnFish79,1562828112,9,Honestly one thought that constantly keeps running through my mind recently every day is why do I even have thoughts or the ability to speak or why do I even spend money on a phone that never rings. My whole life I have tried so hard to be a good listener and to show empathy so that people would want to talk to me but unfortunately  what ended up happening was I just attract self-centered people who only want to talk and be understood but don't ever want to be the one to listen or understand. I honestly can't remember a time when someone asked me for my opinion or my thoughts or literally anything about me. My own family raised me to understand that I only can speak when spoken to and I can only share what has been asked which as you can imagine didn't happen very often. I'm so tired of being pathetically alone it's so sad and embarrassing and I'm so sick of it. At least if I didn't have the ability to talk I would have a different reason why no one wants to hear me rather than I am just so miserable and unwanted that no one cares.

1288,hamartiated,1562811190,0,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

When I began school, I was a very intelligent student. I always looked for approval in my teachers. I hoped my classmates would be impressed by my intelligence, and want to be friends with me. I was sadly mistaken, all throughout elementary school. All the other students could see was this ""weird kid"" who was way too obsessed with various things, who spoke and acted differently, and made this kid the odd one out. I'm sure that sounds familiar to some of you.

The bullying began almost immediately. Kids can be so cruel.

For 14 years, I've struggled with self-image.

I thought as I grew older, I'd find it easier to make friends, especially with the ever-growing rise of social media. I was wrong again. We all graduated, we all moved, suddenly someone I had talked to daily for 12 years and considered my best friend never even wished me a happy birthday. 

Every time I'd make a new friend, they'd go as quick as they came.

I'm a hopeless romantic. I love the idea of dating and marriage, and I'm childfree. But I don't know if anyone will stick around enough to love me that long.

I feel as if no one has the patience to deal with me long enough to get to know me. I promise, I'm kind, I listen, I try to do everything right and it gets me nowhere. 

I'm autistic. I never asked to be me. Sometimes it's a blessing, others, it's not. I'm here making lists of call signs of television stations in the United States and trying so hard to mend my own broken heart.

Does some great deep web stuff if many of you ever wanted to try that or didn't know how. He also geeks out over conspiracies and tech stuff. 

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdoPCztTOW7BJUPk2h5ttXA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdoPCztTOW7BJUPk2h5ttXA) \- CallMeKevin is a gaming channel but hes a evil genius and loves torturing his Sims and game characters. Hes also really creative in how he makes you laugh. 

[https://www.youtube.com/user/HarshlyCritical](https://www.youtube.com/user/HarshlyCritical) \--  If you love horror and a dude that doesn't get phased by it and instead does father-like jokes and reactions to a killer chasing him. John is your man. 

[https://www.youtube.com/user/OmarGoshTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/OmarGoshTV) \-- if you're into like exploring and a guy who has a good heart, this is your channel. He does the spookies. I enjoy him the most sometimes. He gives advice and stuff on life. Especially moments of feeling depressed and such. 

Lastly if you want to know what John Wick would've looked like 400yrs ago and if he never became a gun-fu pro. this is your channel.

I won’t ghost and I hope you won’t either. (If you don’t feel like talking just say so, it won’t hurt my feelings it’s the internet. )

A little more about me. 26m asian on the east coast who spends wayyyy too much time indoors and due to my busy schedule am unable to go out to make new friends. I’m pretty open and straightforward and would like to eventually switch to voice or video chat.(discord)

Strictly looking for friends. Man got to really stress this one. 

But yeah message me! Don’t be shy.

Fun fact: I use to be extremely introverted and shy, to the point where ordering take out would be impossible so usually I just imagine myself eating it and make food instead. Haha",lonely,Hello Anyone Want To Chat it Up?!,2019-07-10 23:57:47

(Names are fake for anonymity) 

I was told when I was little...over, and over that I needed help for my hypochondira. My sister insisted I talk to someone or my mom take me to someone okay? My mom was too embarassed to do so cause it was a small town and everyone knew her, and she didn't want her reputation spoiled. So my mom instilled that I deal with it myself cause thats what being a grown up means. My mom and dad were heavy alcoholics and were gone at the bar after work 6 days a week so it was practically me and my sister bouncing off of each other with pizza hut for a long point until she moved out (she's 8 years older). My dad always was a severely disabled man whos legs swelled up, heart failure, COPD, etc so if not at bar, at hospital for routine checkups and I was there too. My hypochondria started at 5 years old. I thought I had AIDS. No reason, just did. I also had vertigo spells. No reason. My mom and dad insisted I get checked for my fathers heart condition (IHSS) eventually which is a sudden death heart condition that is hereditary. The proceedures to take place are pretty intense, and the doctors wanted to wait until I was older to do that examination. Especially since the disease doesn't formulate till your 30s or so. At 23 years old, this dude reached out to me on FB. He said he was a friend of the family. He then sent me a letter with all these cut out photos of me and family members...and my mother looked...sad? The letter said that this man, was my biological father. My mom reluctantly agreed this was the case. I mean, this guy looked just like me and was left handed too. 

My health anxiety was a on and off battle. Cancer, AIDS, ALS, CJD,Tumors, Melanoma, Parasites, Wet Gangrene, Pencreatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, COPD, Popcorn Lung...you name it, I probably worried about it at some point. Usualy it is some symptom I have and when I Google it, its like..not helpful. So I have a mental breakdown. This was abated for a long..long period of time even through when I met my now husband, John. 

When me and him first met..it was amazing. Sparks everywhere. For months after, we texted, etc. Realize he had a GF at the time, but it was 'short term' as he called it. Like a placeholdership for convenience. He also made sure she agreed to his need for an open relationship so he felt 'free'. Like the first question he asked me was what I thought of polygamy. I had no idea how to answer that, and given we were just friends at the time..i said Im not sure but I wouldn't say no (?). His relationship history, for which he explained in detail. Was..kinda crazy. He had a 5 year relationship with a man in high school who had a high sex drive. John, at the time...was Jen.. a woman, she had no interest in sex so said her BF could sleep around and had no issue with that, until her BF got someone else pregnant, then she knew her BF would have a life responsibility, so she broke up with him. A few years later, Jen married Jason...the flower girl at THEIR wedding was her ex BF's daughter. That marriage lasted 4 years, around the 2 year mark, Jason decided he wanted to become a woman. Jen took on the idea and decided to become a man for convenience (since she was always a tomboy anyway and did not have any emotional attachment to her female aspects/nor wanted kids). So essentially, they got married as husband and wife, and broke up having both switched genders. Jen (now John) decided to break up cause the spouse was, and I quote ""clinically insane"" and he couldnt deal anymore. At this point, John found solace and divorce help through a W.o.W penpal named Lacy. He developed a fixation with this woman and, because he had to move out, had nothing, no friends really..he asked her if she would want a relationship and he was willing to move half a country away to be with her, she declined, and he said that, when she friendzoned him, he lost his trust in her. Couldn't trust her again, but he still talks to this person. He was very emotional talking about how this woman hurt his feelings. After that, he moved in with his brother, got a hardware job, and got in a new relationship which he bailed after 6 months cause she was too emotional and going on and on about how her ex husband doesnt let her see her kids. After that he got in another relationship, for 2 years. He bailed on that when she wanted to take the relationship to the next step. A month after her, he got into a different relationship with a girl who has severe self esteem issues and extreme depression. That's when I met him. 

So after our extremely amazing meet up and getting to know each other, he would text me how he has a crush on me, never felt like this for anyone (except Lacy) before, etc..and that he has plans to leave his current GF cause he isnt happy with her. His idea was to wait until after they went to CA to visit her family, cause he already had a plane ticket so…may as well get something out of it (?) I told him not to string her along, and he agreed. About 1 month later, I came to see him as a visit for a week. The first thing I saw in his room was a ton of friends photos all over his walls, including me, and Lacy, whos photo was in his old Swarovski wedding frame by his bed. Not creepy at all. He also showed me this book of transcripts, poems, etc between them and a ‘what I look for in a partner’ page that was, for the most part, created due to the aspects of Lacy that make him want her. His GF was there almost the entire time and they were so affectionate and lovey dovey. If I had not known what I knew, I would think they were madly in love. I felt weird and had a hard time understanding how he could be so affectionate to someone he want. It was just a whole lot of feeling uncomfortable for me cause when she was around, which was often, nothing else in the world existed but them. I just kinda say there like.. a guest that was being ignored. When I confronted him about it, he said it was solely cause she insisted on being there, and to make sure she felt good. Some days later, we (me, him, his gf and his ex gf) all went to the gay club and he was interested in sleeping with this …gay cowboy guy. He bragged about it to me and his GF like ""I bet he’d be fun to play with ;)” kinda thing. am I? Your ‘gurlfriend’? He said it would be just ‘for fun’ and he isn’t like… attracted to this guy. I found myself, smoking so many damn cigarettes during my visit I couldn’t believe it. I don’t smoke unless I am stressed. When his GF was gone, he wanted to cuddle and be with me in bed, when his gf was there, I slept on an air mattress in the living room listening to them talk and giggle in his bedroom with the door closed. He was so…clueless. Maybe cause he was into poly? Maybe cause he is just naturally oblivious? Maybe cause he assumed this ‘free love’ thing was okay. I realized quickly that his poly proposition before was just…not going to happen the more I felt for him lol. About 2 days later, I got a call from my mom saying my dad died… so I had to go home and deal with that..
Months came and went, me and him visited off and on, and it was a heck of a lot less stressful than that one time. He had been pushing away the subject of a ‘relationship’ with me… probably cause at this point, I did want something monogamous and long term. Hell, he wanted something long term with me, wanted me..but it was like “can’t we be just FWB for now?” or “I need ‘free love’ thing but I really really like you a lot and have never felt this way about anyone before” thing. You know, I once told him I love him, and his response was “I love you too!”, “you do?”,”of course! I love all my friends!” (facepalm). Eventually, later after he broke up with this gf, we decided to move in together, specifically me moving down to his state. He even went so far as to buy his (first) house to make this happen. That’s how like..serious we were about each other. I think the day before the move, he told me that we would have roommates. 1: His old ex gf (the one who had the custody issue) 2: That gay cowboy from the damn bar! I hung up on his and he called me back wondering why I was mad. Really. I said absolutely not..and he convinced me that his ex gf was more like a sister to him, and the gay cowboy.. nothing will happen he just needed a place to stay and John needed the rent $$ so it was a win-win. I went with it, but for those first few weeks, I was so attentive to that cowboy, especially since the cowboy told me that in the months before, John and him were..lets say..getting intimate. Back massages and . John told this guy he was trans (no penis) and that kinda ended that ‘toy’ idea real quick. 

The cowboy didn’t last long at our residence. He never paid rent and he was so insanely dramatic.. so often, that John literally could not even deal. He hated him within.. weeks. So at this point, it was me, his ex, and him (and her bf after a while)…and it was like that for 3 years. His ex gf…she’s…there was just nothing going on there, like…LOL. He talked to her like you would talk to your sister. And he hated hanging out with her, even when I suggested it cause she was down or something, he was like…dragging his feet like ‘fiiiine’ sorta thing. I think it was 6 months in. Me and him are in a very serious, monogamous, happy relationship. He assured me that he had no desire to find anyone else, that I was enough.. that he wants.. ‘me’. His friends, family, etc noted how they had never seen him like this..with anyone before. One day, I went on his laptop cause my computer was not working for days, I went on my FB and he was still logged in. I saw that little blerp on the bottom right side? From Lacy. Needless to say, I couldn’t help but look. They had been talking flirty, etc and he was talking with her about how good she was “with her fingers.;)” (they physically met only 1 time) Yuk. This was all relatively recent stuff. Not only that, but she was proposing to take just him to HAWAII (while I lived with him)as a repayment for him hotwiring her 3000$ from his dead uncles inheritance. I flipped. I just lost my god damn mind. His lame ass excuse to the Hawaii thing was "" no we wouldn't spend any time together I lost trust in her it's just a way for me to get a free vacation out of her”…right. “Why don’t you believe me when I say I don’t have feelings for her anymore?”. A little later I kind of snapped. I didn't want him to 'like' her anymore. I didn't want him emotionally cheating on me so I made a rash decision and created a fake account in her name spiting myself, and then I showed John and he blasted off on the REAL her. She had no idea what was going on and then he defriended her. After it happened, I regretted it x10. I was so disappointed in myself cause, why did I do that? What am I? I don’t do this to people.. why did I do this? So I told him I did it, I told him the whole thing and prepared myself for whatever consequences I deserved, and he's just like... ""…Its okay, I didn't want to talk to her anyway""…?? Well okay then? He's always told me since that he doesn't even think about her, he doesn't even want to talk to her, doesn't care about her, she's just old news. And it was, Lacy was such old news. I hadn’t thought about her in ages.
John asked me to marry him, which, for some commitment phobic person, is truly unexpected. Around this time, I felt as though my heath anxiety was rising. I told him even before I ever …ever had an issue that I had hypochondria issues and he was more than understanding. My health anxiety came &amp; went. ALS, CJD, Cancer, Fatal insomnias, Tumors, etc. John was my #1 go-to for health questions. After a while of it he's like ""talk to ANYONE else about it, why are u putting this all on me?"" or ""have u talked to a psychologist yet? I told u once u go and they tell me how to help u best, I'm not answering ur Q's."" He tried to get me outside, do things with me, things I liked to and sometimes, I would be on WebMd on my phone, just closed to the outside world....and that pissed him off. J:""Look at the mountains hun"" Me:""What? Oh yeah, cool"" J:""Are u looking at medical stuff? Put it away"", etc. His problems weren't getting addressed too cause of it. He pushed me many times to go to a psychologist, and I'd put it off, try to get better on my own, fail, repeat. I was just scared. Scared and 100% convinced that my symptoms needed to be addressed by a cardiologist or neurologist cause, if I am dying, that it more important than getting my anxiety under control right? And that is how I was..just convinced I needed to get a CT Scan or a blood test or something over anxiety help. I couldn’t understand that anxiety was causing my symptoms. I tried so hard to suppress it around him, He's my husband, not a crutch. Through the infrequent on/off bouts..our lives were good. We both worked together. John would wake me up with a kiss on the cheek, a snuggle, drive to work, go to a restaurant after, try and beat each other in Cribbage, Netflix, cuddle, laugh, sex, sleep. 5 nights a week for 2 yrs.

We had a solid routine for so long and really enjoyed spending time with each other. I think it was around Nov 2018 that it started to get rough. His parents proposed that we move with them to Idaho (cross country) since they were to retire, and wanted some family near. They offered a leg up until we get back on our feet even. So we sold the house, I had to sell my car cause his parents had 3, he had 1 and there was only room for 4 at the new place. We quite our jobs, and hightailed it to Idaho. The sudden loss of the routine and change really bothered me. A lot. My health anxiety was at an all-time high, and then, about a week after moving in, there was a cataclysmic family emergency. His mother vomited and collapsed on the kitchen floor from a burst brain aneurysm. We all went to the hospital, terrified. We sat in the waiting room wondering what happened. When the doctor told us of her chances, I started crying…a lot. I just kept apologizing to John and his dad, who were both…staring at the wall in sort of shock. His dad put his hand on mine saying “sometimes, these things happen”. The good news was, the aneurysm clotted so she was going to make it, but it would be a hell of a recovery period. It was about 1 month of everyone taking turns watching her, sleeping overnight, being fussy with each other. It was just high tension. John was the overnighter, I was the afternoon shift, and his dad was the morning shift. His brother and HIS wife (Johns ex gf who he was with while friends with me….yeah) came as well. Everyone was in a bad way, John was short with everyone and very attentive to his mom.. that was the only thing that existed, and I was worried about him. She was on the mend, about 3 weeks in..and sometimes I would lay in bed at night and miss my husband, when I told him he scolded me for thinking about that, as if, I don’t think about his mother. Or if I came to visit him at the hospital at night cause I wanted to see him and …4 hands were better than 2 since she was active at night, he scolded me saying I wasn’t there ‘for her’ and how ashamed, rude, and terrible I was. I don’t even understand. I put on compression socks for her, called nurses I don’t even know how many times, helped her to the bathroom, tried to force her to drink electrolytes, tried to talk to her and note progress. I was there for her.. despite anything I felt, she was the most important thing..and it seemed everyone else who was around us knew that, except John. He thought I didn’t care. 
After this accident? And her returning home..it had been getting really bad. Everyone had to watch her, lock things from her, hide the keys, and tell her 100 times a day that her dogs are dead and she doesn’t live in New York anymore. These short term memory deficits were going to go away with time, the doctor said. At one point, actually 1 day…she forgot that her and John reconciled all those years ago (they had a severe falling out due to him switching genders and he lost trust in her) so she was still mad at him for it. He has held that against her for months ever since. Just keeping on going back to the fact that she forgot they reconciled and how hurt he is. I am like…head, she had an aneurysm, and it was ONE TIME. She remembered just fine after that day. 
I would say March was bad. He was like…absolutely just not going to listen to any health anxiety. Not that I tried, but if say, we were to go somewhere, and I even vaguely in any way shape or form mentioned it at all..he would turn around and drop me off back home and then resume whatever it is we were going to do. If say, I did not say anything at all..chances are he would have his around around my waist, kissing the nape of my neck telling me how much he loves me. So very…very easy to flip. He started saying things in normal conversation which really pissed me off..like “if you don’t fix this, then I will just do everything without you and leave you behind” and this to him, was opening up to me. His expectation, was for me to understand and take it constructively, however I would get upset that he would say these things, confuse me, and make me feel as though things are shaky between us…and I would just talk and talk. 

April 1st I noticed he seemed down and I asked him what was up, he said it was nothing..he was just relaxing. I made sure nothing was up between us and he said we were fine and great . On April 2nd We went to eat, cracked jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go to the movies and he was all for it. I gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting his best friend and I saw a bit of it and the text looked like it'd be something bad about me. When I asked, he lied to me saying it was about something else. I could tell he was lying and asked why and he said, ""cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie"". I got angry, not cause he was talking to her about me..which is what he is still convinced I was upset about, but him lying to me ABOUT me. I blew up. He went to the movie alone, and then he said this..
""U've never believed how I felt about u. I'm going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with u anymore, I don't want to do things with u anymore, u're not the person I want to be with. I gave u many chances to get help, I'm done and I'd like u to go""
I read that and lost my mind in sadness. I made such an ass out of myself bawling and he just looked at me like…get a hold of yourself. I told him I would go to therapy, do what I need to do, that I was sorry…just, really pathetic. 
Me: ""Please, i'm sorry...""
J: ""it's too late""
Me: ""do u really want me to leave?""
J:""YES""
Me:""for good?""
J""for now""
Me:""I'll get help I will!""
J:""What, u think going to a therapist will make me suddenly have feelings for u again?""
Me:""u don't love m---??""
J:""Ugh I'm going to bed""
Me:""but..""
J:""BED. I have to be up at 6"" (shuts door).
I spent the next few days desperately looking for a therapist, trying to get myself together, etc. At this point, the fear of a therapist was less than the fear of losing my husband. I went to an appt. I talked all about my past, childhood, fears, all of it. I picked my fingers till they bled I was so nervous, and the lady looked concerned. She mentioned PTSD/Somatoform Disorder. When I got home, John started talking to me seeing as I got help and I took that as a green light. He was glad I went..but wary. He wanted to see how things continued to go with the shrink and if I change..otherwise he is happier alone. He then told me then that he started talking to Lacy again. Normally, I'd flip, but I was composed (but dying inside). He literally handed me his phone as if to provoke me and said i can look at the msgs. I wasn't ready. I read the texts and I didn't know what to think. From what I 100% remember, this was said..
L: Y the request now?
J:Ii wanted to apologize for the loss of it. Long story


J: Sarah was worried I had feelings for u, and what she saw on our FB chat was confirmation enough for her. She snooped through all my chats/texts. She wanted to 'test' me to prove I wouldnt leave her so she made a fake email… which was ridiculous. I knew how u felt about a relationship, she didn't. It was too much for her that we be friends. I had convos with her which she provoked me claiming u sent her these msgs. That pissed me off and she got the response she wanted. That I dont speak to u again. I didn't want to start conflict so I agreed not to contact u, which she was monitoring. It wasnt till before the wedding that I saw the email acct she made. I thought, do I call this crazy thing off even though we put money into it or live with it? And that's the decision I made, obviously it wasnt a good one.
L: So why tell me after all this time? Are u still married to her? Someone who would lie and hurt someone like that?
J: I'm sorry, I told her we're done. I wanted to apologize sooner but I didnt want her to see. IDC what she sees now.
L: I actually feel sick. That chick is bag full of crazy! 
J: Yeah, it made me sick to find out she played me like that and what I said as a result. I don't want her in my life anymore.
L: I almost didnt take u'r friend req. cause I thought it might be her
J: Like I said, I don't know what I said to u cause I was talking to her. I just never knew it it was really u or not so i didn't.
The first thing I thought when I read this. I turned myself into him YEARS ago over this! He absolved me saying he didn’t care! Why is he resurfacing it like its new and the reason he wants out? Wha….why? And that BS about ‘snooping’ I guess he failed to mention that he was 100% open with his phone to me, not through me asking. He ENCOURAGED it to ‘build my trust for him’ or prove he ‘doesn’t do things behind my back’. I hadn’t actually looked at his phone…for like …2 years. 
Anyway,I just swallowed that load and had a decent convo with him then..
Me:""that was painful""
Him: ""yeah, I knew it would be tough for u to hear""
Me: ""Do u like her?""
Him: ""No, I messaged her to apologize. I don’t have any desire to talk to her really. If we were going to break up, the biggest regret that would have come out of our marriage was not apologizing for the nasty things I said to her..which YOU should be apologizing for”
Me: ""u told her u contemplated marrying me then?""
Him: ""Yeah, that was such a big lie u did""
Me: ""it was, and I told u flat out I did it and was prepared W/E and u let it go..""
Him: ""well thats cause I already knew. I actually found it on ur computer before u told me.""
Me: "" U didn't tell me that""
Me: Was it true about why u continued with the wedding?""
Him: ""I did it cause I love u""
Me: ""U said the money down was a factor in u'r indecisiveness""
Him: ""Stop. Why do u do that? U always jump to conclusions and not listen to me! I love u and thats why I did it.""
Me: ""Do u really want a divorce?""
Him: ""I thought about it the other day yeah.""
Me: ""Why? You said 'for now' the other day”
Him: ""Well, if it was over, you’d likely have to move back to MN since u don't have anything here or a job yet..so that is a divorce..?""
Me: ""But, doesnt that even bother u?""
Him: ""U dont get to ask about my emotions anymore. You have to earn that trust back""
Me: ""okay..I just don't understand. We love each other.""
Him: ""Lots of divorced people are still in love...""
Him: ""I want to be with YOU. I love YOU. I never wanted it to get to this point! To contemplate divorce. I don't want to live my life like this (cry)! You are going to kill me!
I then told him I was and will continue with my therapy, I really was.
After that, it was all gravy. So much cuddling and staring, no fights.. just love. So much closeness and great…GREAT sex. We were so…damn…good, and I went to therapy every week. Around June, He was having…cramps, without bleeding. Apparently, it is due to your ovaries essentially going “hey! I’m here!” and that stopping taking testosterone in order to have a period, was the solution. So he stopped taking it…after 10 YEARS of being on it. Around this time he seemed, short tempered. Like if we were grocery shopping and I grabbed tomatoes and he had already grabbed some..his reaction would be “whats in the basket, Sarah?”. I asked him about his attitude and he blamed it on being off of T cause he was “a mean ” when he was a woman..and T mellowed that out. Besides the occasional “what’s wrong? Is it me? Am I doing better?” and him insisting it wasn’t about me, he even got fussy cause I was apologizing ..so much “I don’t want ‘apologetic’ Sarah” he would say. Besides this, which was really infrequent.. there was no health anxiety, no real issues, and no fights. We were the best we had ever been. I mean we slept under the stars in the desert …cuddling, him kissing my forehead “I love you baby” and all that.. and more! The most affection I could have ever even. I spent thousands of dollars taking him on surprise vacations, horseback riding, caves, fancy restaurants.. all this. And we had a blast! And then this happened…
The other day we had a dispute that pertained to him saying he doesnt have remorse/regrets towards anything he has done or said. Even in regards to wanting divorce before. I got upset, and every time i questioned something, he kept saying painful things that were conflicting things he said/did before...that worried me..and I kept asking about it past his bedtime. July 4 he wrote down 4 questions in a book for me to answer.

1: Why are we in a relationship if there will never be trust between us?
2: If you want me to tell you what I want, why don't you listen to the answer?
3: We prolong the inevitable outcome trying to patch up our relationship. I thought you didn't want that to happen? Not lead you on like I did my other relationships?
4: I'm sorry we rushed into marriage. I thought it would help your anxieties
I starting crying. He was crying too. He said that the past 3 months have been just 'okay'. Like, he enjoyed going to new places.. but he didn't feel fulfilled., that he couldn't trust me enough to open up to me about how he feels about things. And that he was trying to ignore how he felt and just tried to pretend? That he would rather do adventures alone. That he would be unhappy without me, but unhappier with me cause he doesn't want to deal with anyone's stress other than his own atm. That he doesn't 'want' this, he feels he 'needs' it. That he isn't himself. I said ""I thought we were doing great the past 3 months ""for you the adventures were great, but I was not happy, it was not enough. I felt something missing. I haven't been happy for a while"". 

I told him that if I don't make him happy, then I'll accept his wishes. He started getting sad. And then he said... ""I want you to be happy too honey and you don't seem like you have been lately either"" I told him ""I dont understand..whenever you seemed upset I always asked what was wrong and you said it was work or something..and when I ask you if it was me, you got mad that i didn't believe you were happy with me. You always complain I don't believe you cause I need reassurance ...and that it hurts your feelings. Why are you proving me right?"" And "" if you are so unhappy the past couple weeks, why did you want to surprise me with a tattoo wedding band?"" he said ""it was your idea""...wow. I mentioned it as a joke 1 YEAR ago. I accidently found out the secret that he was going to do it and he got upset that I spoiled the surprise. My 'idea' my ass.
I asked him if he wanted a separation or a divorce. He said ""I want a divorce because it would be harder to be just separated and it wouldn't allow me to process and think if you’re still ‘attached’ in some way."" But then i asked if he wants it for 'now' or 'forever' and he said "" for now"" And then told me he loves me, reciprocated that we love each other more than anybody ever, cried, etc.

I asked him if he was just trying to soften the blow on me and he really wants to be without me forever.. and he shrugged, and said ""in the future, if you become more stable and happy ..then maybe we can talk about it"". And I said ""is that what you're hoping for?"". And he shook his head yes. And then I said ""..or do you just really want us to never see each other again"". His response was..""like i said, I don't know. I will have to be apart from you to have the answer to that""

I told him, I have nowhere to go right now and I would like to try and get an apartment but I don't want it to be awkward living here. And he said ""that's fine, and we can all like go do things as a family together but just know that we're NOT going to do things as a couple. This would be so there's no animosity in the house. The end goal is divorce so just to make that clear"". 

And after we had this somber divorce agreement.. he went out to Home Depot. I was at the time wrapping up our wedding photos and putting them away. Crying.. because I couldn't stand walking past them anymore. His mother came halfway upstairs feeling really bad for me, telling me I am always welcomed and loved and can stay as long as I want. That minute, he came back into the house, his mom turned around and asked him ""what you got?"" He went (and this is no exaggeration) ""I got an awesome foam topper for when we go caaamping!! Oo and I also got this and this, and it will be soo fun! ^_^"". He then came upstairs to put the foam topper on the bed but noticed i was wrapping our wedding photos up on it and he said ""Oh, I can see you are busy hehe. I will put this in the other room. "" . I was sick to my stomach with how jubilant he was.
I went out to talk to my friend. When i came back in the house, everyone...him, his parents..were doing that "" how you doing sweety? Lets go to fireworks tonight!"". And then he was like ""Oh, hey hey look at this Sarah! Look at this awesome Geode! It really polished up nice . Hey does hot dogs sound good for dinner?"". And then like, walking around laughing with his folks, BBQing. ""Hey mom! You want a hot dog with this salad? They are gluten freeeee"" and stuff like that. 

Anyways, my sister wrote to him a rather logical short message today about how marriage is hard and love is effort sometimes, how I was uprooted and that isnt fair, but she understands how my anxiety can be too much, but I have been trying and better than I have ever been. She told him I'll be fine either way, and to do with the message what he will, but just to know she sees both sides here. 

He apparently wrote her this:
""The primary issue is lack of trust. I'm not trying to lead her on. I told her I need a separation to even begin to see what I want. Was hoping to go from there and I'll help her get where she wants to be.""
You know, since all this, especially the last few days..he’s been exuberant around me. Even inviting me on expeditions or asking me how my day was, complimenting me on the food, laughing at my jokes. Normally anyone would assume, okay, he is trying to soften the blow…but this is the guy that literally said he needs to be completely disconnected from me, doesn’t even want to do things with me. He is acting totally lax and like..making an effort to talk to me. I also found a open box of tampons with some missing and I know those had to have been within the past few days, and they aint mine. 
My best friend messaged me all down cause she was going to wish him a Happy Birthday on FB and saw she was deleted. I confronted him like ""why would you delete her?"" he said ""I deleted over 100 ppl cause I talk via text or not at all"". I call BS...if that's the case, just delete your FB. His FB friend count went from like 200 to 68..deletion included all my family (like 20 ppl) except for me...he still has me on his friends list (probably only kept me for now till I am out so I don’t get pissed in person)
So, iono…how does this all seem? And more importantly, does it sound like he wants this permanent? Or that he needs that complete disconnect to ‘breathe’ and ‘think’ about me?????

At 30, I don't ever recall having felt that cloying, innate need for companionship that seems to define so many people. It seems to be the general consensus that humans are social creatures, but I'm unsure where that assumption leaves me. I've spent the vast majority my life in solitude, but I don't view that as a negative. I'm absolutely interested in people, but not the intimacy that goes hand in hand with companionship.  In this sense, the internet has fulfilled my voyeuristic needs, and I feel no ""void"" that so many here seem to have as a matter of course.

1325,Kikama,1562762255,5,"I posted this on another subreddit about a week ago before finding this one, hopefully I’ll get a somewhat better response here :)

Anyways, there’s a popular saying: “It’s better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.”  I gotta say I really disagree with it.

The necessary backstory is that I'm an engineering undergraduate with good grades that I work extremely hard for. I was a valedictorian in high school and that tradition of hard work and perseverance continued into college (even despite my high school English teacher telling me I wouldn't make it in college). I landed an internship at NASA this summer as well. I've always had a tall and lean body type, but ever since May I've been working out three (occasionally four) times a week as well to improve my physical body. I am admittedly a huge nerd and spend a lot of time playing video games and watching science fiction/fantasy movies (Star Wars, LotR, Marvel, etc). I've been told in the past I have a very witty sense of humor and love to keep the atmosphere light, even at work. Appearance-wise, I'm definitely no male supermodel but I'd like to think I'm at least average.

​

Now the reason for this post is that I really do feel invisible. I've dated only once before in my life, and that was two years ago now. When that relationship came to a close I joined several dating apps to help take my mind off of it and everything.

​

If anything the whole experience has just been a catastrophic failure and a massive self-esteem crusher. I'll fully admit that since I spend so much time doing homework/at work/gaming (always something different), I do not get out much. But even after years of routinely using dating services (perusing through profiles, reading responses, reaching out, etc), I've only had a handful of conversations that lasted longer than 2-3 messages, and none of them have led to anything remotely close to a date. That would naturally imply I'm just not a good conversationalist, but I genuinely read their entire bio before reaching out, and I always reach out with a relaxed conversation starter and am very respectful.

​

I'm not a big social media user which did definitely burn me as after high school graduation I fell off the radar pretty badly for sure. It's just been an extremely common theme for me to blame myself and constantly wondering what more I could possibly be doing to gain the favor of women that wouldn't involve me compromising my responsibilities/interests (AKA clubbing and whatnot; while I know that's obviously not a bad location to meet women, I'm not even sure the people I'd theoretically meet in that setting would be my type since I'm not into drugs at all and can't really see myself drinking much at all in the future either).

​

That leads me to the title question: What is it that women truly seek in a guy?  At this point I have no idea anymore.  All I know is I definitely do not have it :/",lonely,What is it that women want in a guy?,2019-07-10 22:37:35
1326,davo449,1562750363,2,"I'm 18 years old and currently a college student. My family has moved around a lot and has caused me not being able to maintain stable friendships. I've always attended the best schools and lived in really good areas but because of this, I've always been the only black kid. I've gotten bullied all my life because of my colour and I just feel isolated. I'm a friendly dude and on the outside looking in, it's always looked like I have heaps of friends but in reality I don't. I thought that when I went to college shit would change but it's gotten worse. All my school ""friends"" have girlfriends so I don't see them and at college I'm still the only black kid, stuck doing a degree where they're legit only guys.

When it comes to girls I've never had problems interacting with them or spitting game. The problem is being taken seriously. I treat women with respect like what my parents have taught me but it seemes like that keeps me in the friendzone. I've hooked up with a few girls but that's when I was really drunk and they're the ones that had  to initiate the first move. Every relationship I've had, has resulted in me being cheated on and it's fucked with my  mental. The worst part is that girls have always cheated with close ""friends"" of mine. When girls fuck with other dudes, the niggas can treat them like trash and still get some pussy instantly, but for me it's like they always expect  the best  and I get nothing. 
Not saying sex is the only thing I care about but it's become a burden. 

I'm still cool with my ex's so I've asked them why and they just say I'm too nice and they feel like they're comfortable enough to go slow,  wait and treat me like whatever. 

Ik what I need to do to change this but it is difficult for me. When I was younger, domestic violence between my parents was an issue. It's scared me to the point that I find it difficult to show any aggression towards girls.

But the Shadow Men cannot, and hate for they are able not, to

For they'll never be able to burn, and to burn quite as bright.
It is them that enable little light to shine that little bright,
because for all the darkness in the world,
no Shadow Man will be able to be drawn to justice and right.

I’ve felt pretty lonely my whole life. At a young age, I realized how much different I was from people and it deeply saddened me. I’m always pondering, always day dreaming. Because of this, I’ve been exceptional at meditation and since I’ve gotten older (23M, currently) I’ve actually enjoyed being lonely. I’ve always put myself in situations where I was always trying to be a hero to someone because I’m skilled in empathy to the point to where I would be taken advantage of which is why I’ve enjoyed being lonely as it keeps me safe from people trying to take advantage. Tending to so many damaged people, especially ones who seem to never heal on their own, puts a heavy strain on your heart because you feel like you’re not good enough. I’ve learned. I’ve learned that you can’t decide for people to get better for themselves and that it’s entirely up to them, even after you’ve exhausted your abilities to nurture them. 

All of my childhood, whenever asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, resulted in the same answer every time. I wanted to be a father, a husband, a lover. Instead, I’ve suffered from bad relationships that ended in train wrecks and miscarriages and stillborn births. Now, my friends wonder why I’m single, and they wonder why I have a low sex drive for such a young age. I tell them that I’m focused on personal growth and goals- which I’m happy with heading straight towards... but this feeling is coming back. 

Deep down, no one, but the readers of this post, will know that I still want to be a husband. I still want to be a father. I want it so fucking bad. God it feels so good to admit that. But it’s so hard for me to put myself out there, not because I feel that no woman is right for me, but that I just might not be meant to be a husband or a father. I’ve learned to be patient, but tomorrow is never promised, and so the ego-inflicted anxieties of desire and wanting immediate gratification take hold while I battle with peaceful loneliness. 

I stayed in an abusive relationship for over a year because I was afraid of being alone after building our empire of love for 5 years just to have it crumble down because of our miscarriage/stillborn and her cheating and abusing me. No one knows this, but sometimes I subconsciously think to myself that maybe I shouldn’t have left her those two years ago. It probably would have been better than being alone. But I tell myself that I’m better off now. On the surface, sure I am.

1347,sugarallie,1562726020,45,"I (28F) unfortunately have had this issue ever since my early teens. When it's really bad I can't even watch movies or shows or heck even see ads about couples, without getting intensely irritated. And, of course, seeing couples IRL is upsetting. I have had one relationship when I was 20 that lasted 10 months, and two times where I thought I found someone who loved me but in the end they were just leading me on (and as I'm terribly lonely I immediately latch on to the slightest affectionate gesture, so that doesn't help). But outside of those times I'm pretty full to the brim with extreme bitterness towards happy couples. Even with close friends or family. My best friend of 16 years recently got engaged and the news just made me feel dejected and put me in a bad mood. I don't ever show it; but inside I am seething and jealous, and reminded how I've barely had any romantic love in my life and see no hope of finding it again. Reminded about how I have no-one who wants me and how I have no-one to hold me at night, cuddle me, love me, enjoy sex with, enjoy life together -- how I am missing out on one of the purest, most blissful of human experiences. I have had Major Depression since early adolescence, so of course that makes things worse. But I hate the bitterness I feel towards couples. It makes me feel like a bad person. I wish I could feel happy like most people at news of an engagement or wedding, but all I think to myself is, ""great, more people getting what you aren't. More people experiencing love while you're left behind. Just reminding you that no-one will ever love you that way!""

1362,BronzMellow_,1562704831,8,"  

I’m 18 now, 5 years ago when I was 13 I met this girl, it was a kind of a long distance thing and it’s lasted until I was 17, it was going well, then one day she vanished, just out of nowhere and up until that point I was stupid and blind, I felt maybe I’d be able to just be with her forever, then again after months she came back, told me some story about why she was gone. And again I was stupid and blind, I believed her, then inevitably she left again without a trace. Mid conversation, I’ve devoted almost all of my time to this girl and it’s really starting to show now, at that point In time I only had 3 old friends from 6th grade, and a few online friends who would inevitably leave as well, I became socially awkward, it was very hard for me to connect and make friends, i spent most of my time indoors in my room, suppressing my feelings and feeling so hurt and betrayed because I’d never really loved anyone like that, and I was forced into believing a false reality of living this fantastic life with this person, then I’ve met my best friend, online of course but this person has been by my side and been so amazing to me, and very helpful and supportive, I tried dating again, with a really lovely person, she was really good to me, but I was a little distant, as I didn’t want to believe another false reality, but she did want time to herself for the most part because of school, a lot was getting into my head and I guess I said some pretty dodgy things about wanting to kill my self and not being enough for anyone and being a burden, and school wasn’t going well, at this time I was still 17, and I do have access to guns, it scared her and she called in a wellness check where I was held overnight in the hospital, a few weeks after that she disappeared, I was sad all over again, I was tired of being hurt, at that point I did have a job, working at a coffee shop, since I had a little income I built a pc, and joined a gym, and tried to better myself without depending on anyone, my best friend was there for me of course, being my rock and supporting me, then a few months later, I got a text from the second girls friend.. the news was horrible, the reason why she didn’t message me was because she had passed. And I guess all of that anger I felt that I used to turn into determination just turned to sadness, I turned to everyone I knew. My mom my dad my best friend and my 3 old middle school friends, of course the only true comfort I got was from my parents and my best friend, that was the second time someone close to me outside of family had died. I just didn’t know what to do with myself, then the original girl came back, out of the blue with some story again, I again let her back in, I was in a very vulnerable state and I just, idk I needed someone else in my life, that was a mistake as she inevitably left again, I’m 18 at this point, sad and lonely only going out once every 3 weeks or so to visit one of my friends, after a long time of being alone and sad I met this girl online, but that didn’t last too long as she didn’t want anything serious and I found it difficult to relate to her and connect but, I did like the attention and giving attention, making her laugh and stuff it was fun, but I wasn’t happy, and inevitably she left, after even promising to still be my friend, throughout this long ride I have tried to make friends and relate to people but I’ve felt broken, with somewhat small bursts of happiness because of my best friend, these bursts can last for days at a time, but she’s a bit older then me and has a boyfriend, I’d never even attempt to cross that line, she’s really amazing, I don’t wish to meet tons of women and sleep around, I just want one person who I can be with and genuinely be happy with, to live out my life with.. but every day it just feels like I fall deeper and deeper into this hole and one day I’ll just have to realize that it’ll never happen.

1370,hibiscus38,1562695307,1,"The typical American family would have a mother, father and 2-3 kids. In modern families, the parents get divorced so it's just the mother and 2 kids. The mom would go to work and not see her kids until 6pm - while the kids would go to school and come home at 4pm. At school, there are all types of nasty dynamics and exclusions going on, no idea why. I don't believe humans are naturally like this - I think the kids are learning to follow these dynamics through television and stereotypes. If you are shy then nobody is going to know your name or come speak to you. If you're rejected you will not only be isolated but also harassed. And you are doomed for loneliness. After school is over, you will move away for a job or you are expected to 'move out' from your family. You will rarely see your parents or siblings again. Many people ask ""How do you make friends after college?"" or ""How do adults make friends"" , the answer is usually that they don't. Even if you establish connections with people, these connections usually die after a while. I remember when my best friend from kindergarten moved schools in 1st grade, I cried a lot because I missed her. My parents told me that ""friends don't last forever - only family does"" .. family doesn't even last forever. Your relationships will all die down and after college you won't be able to establish any new ones. So to combat this you pump out babies who are 30 years younger than you, and pre-occupy yourself with taking care of them to avoid the void of your loneliness.

Don't know how or if i contributed to my predicament but as a lonely person you start to assume and accept it probably is self inflicted.

Outta x amount of years people consider a dating age to start I've had two long term girlfriends. But despite the great connections they fail because they resent my parents and myself because my parents are ridiculous strict catholic and won't accept someone outside of religion, different values, particular country of background (prejudicial nonsense/hate them for it)

The double down on awful is that they expect a certain standard of woman, which are not attracted to me because, I am mediocre, im not ugly but not good looking, i work hard but do not have a lot of money etc.

So I am between either too high unattainable standard of woman or too low and parents won't accept to the point where they resent and end it.

1381,hamartiated,1562678282,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I go through phases where I just feel depro and lonely, then I am fine.

One album that really gets to me is Deadmau5's Wheres the Drop album, its and orchestral variant of some of his music, I like listening to this album when I play Elite Dangerous, which is a space simulation/sci-fi game, and just going out to sightseeing makes it even more emotional, I love space, the vastness of it the colors, shapes, nothing else could ever beat it.

1391,Isaac_J_99,1562659658,4,"So, on August last year, I was extremely bored and lonely. I was desperate to get out of this situation, as you, the reader, might be. I'd spend my day mostly lying around, and talking to people on r/lonely. Thank you all of you who helped me out. &lt;3

I figgured out a way to end or greatly diminish my loneliness, especially tips 1 and 2, so here it goes:

TIP 1. Find something to do with people face to face. The more you can connect with these people, the better (e.g. if you are 25, you may not connect with 70-year-olds), but any non-toxic group of people will do. In terms of choosing an activity, anything that you don't actively dislike doing should do (e.g. don't join a soccer team if you hate soccer). If you just kind of like it or better, that is great. You also don't need to be good at it (it really does not matter).
To summarize, it should be ""connectable"" and at least kind of fun. No need to be good at it. Given that, anything except work will do. (I never tried working to beat loneliness, but I'm guessing it won't do).

TIP 2: Doing the tip above will take several weeks, AND several tries, until loneliness begins to dissapear. It's a slow process, so it will take several (took me like 9) months of slowly getting less and less lonely, until you feel almost none, or no loneliness at all.

TIP 3: If you can, only bring up the subject of loneliness to people you really trust. Those who talk a lot about how bad their situation is bring other people down, and attract people who do the same, creating a situation that is bad for both. On the other hand, not talking about it with people doesn't make them feel down, so it is less likely they will repell you

TIP 4: I'm not a pshchologist. If you need one, talk to a psychologist. Most of them will help quite a bit, so I suggest you take their advice. These people usually know their shit, I' m just speaking out of personal experience.

If there is anything that is unclear, please PM or leave a comment.

P.S. Thank you all again for your help back then. &lt;3

1393,CSloserthrowaway,1562658759,6,"Hey, people. I'm 24. I just moved about a five hour drive away a week ago. I don't know a soul for hundreds of miles. Wow, it's almost fun to say that. It feels big and broad like there's something there, even though it's just the absence of something.

Anyway, that's no fun, but it's not really what's got me down tonight, even though I do feel pretty darn hopeless socially over here. Hell, the last town I lived in was friendlier and I still never made any friends there after an entire year. Enough tangents, though -- tonight I had the realization that I'm getting old. No, I'm not falling apart yet, but I'm too damn old to have never had a relationship, let alone ever come close. I can't even think of any women I know that are my age that I'm not related to. I've tried those awful online dating apps to no avail. Even if I did meet someone by some miracle, and by another miracle managed to convince them that I was worth the effort, I feel so doubtful that we would even be compatible. I'm too alien. I guess what I'm trying to say is that my situation in that regard is pretty damn bleak. And now I have absolutely zero social circle. No idea how I'd meet people. Everyone at my new job seems pretty cold.

My phone and my car stereo are broken, so today when I was driving around today I was left with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company at those red lights. I remember seeing so, so many couples. No really, it wasn't even my perception, this city seems to be packed with couples. And as I looked at a few of them walking around, a voice bubbled out of me, ""Well, that's something I'll never have."" I knew it came out of my own mouth, but hearing the words made my soul buckle a little under the weight of my predicament.

And now I'm here, alone in my apartment, knowing the cycle is about to continue. An island for another year. Two? Three? I'm not sure how long I'll last if it's already getting to me. Even trying to make myself hopeful makes me hate myself. I can't even handle unexpected human touch without almost freaking out because it's so foreign. I can't talk to people; I only ever think about things that people can't relate to or don't understand. And other young people? Forget it.

I feel barely any emotions, since depression and anxiety ate all of them away throughout the decade of my life. There can be no conversation unless there is an actual reason, otherwise my head won't create any. My intuition in social interactions is near non-existent. I am rude and unpleasant and can not talk or shut up about anything except what hurts everyone who hears it. I literally can not compliment or say anything nice to others and when I do, it sounds very forced. If I'm not screwing things up, it is just blandness, complete robot-talk. Nobody wants to listen to that.

Hobbies: tried that. Failed. I just don't care about any of those and people I met there were very boring to me - nothing to talk about. Even after trying they just ran afterwards.

1399,KCL1999,1562652280,3,"This post will most likely be very scattered so just a heads up. I’m 19 years old and have Asperger’s. I have very few friends but the ones I do have I hold near and dear to my heart. I’d do anything for them. They went out of their way to give me a chance and welcome me into their lives with open arms so I’ll always do anything I can to make sure they know how much I appreciate them. Lately though I’ve ran into some trouble. I find myself feeling down over things that I feel like I shouldn’t be even though some are normal. 

1) I’m always scared that my friends are hiding things or will find someone better. 

I’ve heard that this is a normal fear but I feel so selfish for the things I think sometimes. What if the reason they don’t answer my texts quickly are because they found someone other than me? What if the reason they don’t want to hang out is because they did find someone better but they don’t want to tell me so they lie instead? I think these things constantly. I know they’re selfish thoughts but I don’t know how to shake them. I know my friends genuinely love and care for me but what if it’s not as much as I thought it was in my head?

2) I feel like I have to be everyone’s absolute best friend. 

I hate the idea of just having acquaintances. I’ve never understood how people are ok with having people of little to no benefit around in their life. To me having acquaintances feels very shallow and doesn’t make any sense. Why would you want someone around who never prioritizes you in any way? It might partly be that I absolutely hate small talk but I’m not entirely sure. I don’t want to waste time with pointless conversation. If I’m interested in someone whether it be platonic or romantically, I want to jump straight into meaningful conversation but to others it can come across as aggressive and scare them away. 

3) I don’t do well with reading personal boundaries 

I’m an open book but also very private. If you don’t ask me something then I won’t tell, but if you want to know something then ask away and I’ll tell you anything. I have a hard time grasping why not everyone is like this or ok with me being this way. I don’t understand why some people are so private or defensive about certain things. I hear people all the time talk about how they wish they could just talk to someone about everything in life. Well why can’t you? Sometimes I’ll ask a friend a question such as “what did you do today” and they take it as me being nosy. I don’t understand why. 

—

These are just three major points of many that I’ve come to recognize in myself. Lately I’ve been living in constant fear and paranoia that all the people I love are doing it for show or just because they feel bad for me. I have genuine connections with these people I deeply love and care for, but lately something has always had me wary. I know it’s just me. In turn it makes me feel even worse when I realize I’m potentially sabotaging perfectly fine relationships without realizing it in the moment.

I'm lucky if anyone even says anything to me.

I'm a slightly socially awkward individual just looking for somebody to chat with. Recently got out of a young long term relationship with a messy breakup and unfortunately I didn't branch out a whole lot while with her so now that she's gone I've just been feeling pretty lonely the past few months. 

Just recently turned 20 within the last few months. Currently serving in the us military as a musician and I live in an area that there's really not a whole lot going on. 

Spent most of my time watching the office and parks and rec on Netflix. Aside from that I play my instrument or my roommate and I go on a ride on our motorcycles. 

I'm secretly really really good at guitar hero, it's probably my favorite game of all time. 

I have a hard time going out to try and meet somebody as I find myself having a really bad case of cold feet whenever I go out... Well that and it just doesn't seem very easy to find somebody out here that I'd like to just hangout with.

I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety/trauma since I’ve known what it was but the past year has been the lowest I’ve ever felt. 

Background: Had a shitty childhood. My dad did drugs, was physically and emotionally abusive to my mother, never me, but I grew up watching it. I mostly dissociated through it but ya know... it is what it is. My mother got remarried to a wonderful man who I now look as my Dad but I definitely had problems the first 6 or so years they were married (my teens.) 
I was in a relationship with a boy for 4.5 years and then he cheated on me (did NOT see it coming) and ever since then I feel like I’ve lost myself. 

I’m currently in therapy and have been on medications for yeeeears and honestly don’t feel like my situation is that bad because mom is my best friends, I have my own place, nice car, great job and have my shit together. 

In the past few years it seems like all my friends are getting married and having babies and honestly haven’t connected with anyone since my ex. Not even in a romantic way but I’m a best friend kind of way. (Btw he has a fiancé and a baby and I’m just here like uhhhhh)

I just feel so alone. It could be the fact I live alone or that everyone else is busy with their own lives and I don’t blame them but I’m just like... so exhausted. I would say I’m a normal 24 year old girl and I have people to talk to or hang out with occasionally but I just feel so dark and low on the inside. I haven’t had sex in two years (I’m self conscious but also have high standards lol) and it’s so past the physical part! I just crave closeness. Someone I can count on all the time.

There’s really no main point to this post and it’s the first time I’m writing anything on here but lately it’s just like alcohol is my only real friend. I’m so numb these days and if someone where to come in my life I don’t even know how I would accept it. I’m sad. I’m lonely. I’m weak.

I feel very sad. Very sad. Sometimes i start to cry. That is what I feel when I look at the mirror.

I dont understand why am I so lonely.

I see a very cute fellow.. handsome indeed. I see a honest person, a person that likes his work. A friend of my friends. Im a person that understands his surroundings... from the small ant.. to the big planet. I like to play guitar... photography.. cinema, tv shows, and I am an occasional traveler. I like to run and play videogames.

But I am alone. Cant find someone to travel with me.... to talk about that planet.. to listen to me while i play a song ... and criticize my photos.

Sure, I am depressed coming to that conclusion but I feel it’s something I’ve been denying about myself for a long time. Been at this thru my 20s and now that I am in my 30s, I have given up. Sure, I do have friends and family but they can only do so much. And the friends that are around are so busy with their families that they don't have time for me. I thought to myself that I deserve happiness. I want that feeling that I want to love someone and they love me back. I know its not right to look for happiness thru another person but I have so much love to give and not giving it to someone dealt a heavy blow to my ego. I’ve developed this disgust towards myself because I couldn’t blame other people for what they are looking for. I’d call myself a hypocrite since I do have a specific standard I am looking for or maybe I am putting too much high of a standard… I have been all of the popular dating apps, repeatedly rewriting profiles to “look” a certain way, change my appearance, and among many others things. I just can’t seem to catch a hint of attraction at all. I feel I have this repellant from other women that I am not datable and I am not blaming women for that. I think I am more of a friend than a lover to all. I need to re-invent myself again so I can move on from this.

Each boss constantly wants me available but nither of them are offering me the wages and time to be able to do that. The job I went to school for is only part time minimum wage. I cant rely on that paycheck. I spend a lot of time by myself in the office. I dont feel like I'm getting along well there because I'm so young and most of the people I work with are 10-30 years(I think) older than me.

 When I was in my 20's I fell in love for the second and last time.
We were together for 14 years.

 YES, I made my share of mistakes and often took for granted that she would always be there for me (us).

Until one morning as we were getting ready for work she told me that she was leaving me and moving out. 
This devastated my soul.

 And while I have dated since then, I just haven't found anyone to spend my life with.
Someone to share the good along with the hardships that are just a normal part of life.
 
 I am college educated and hold degrees in engineering along with long time studies in psychology.
 
 As the weather turned warm, I watched people as they went about their day, hand in hand.
 Maybe I shouldn't admit this but it brings a tear to my eyes.

1468,hamartiated,1562561136,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

1469,IntrovertedFaith,1562560608,3,"Do you ever feel out of place? Like anywhere? Or is it something you do? I always feel out of place and awkward, for literally no reason. For example, some days I could be sad, other days it's just neutral; some days make me want to go under the sheets and cry my heart out, y'know? There are other times where you just feel anxious for no reason, and can't really control it? We all have these feelings and sometimes I just wish that our folks could understand us and not say things like, ""Stop crying, you're being such a baby!"" or ""Man up!"" or something else; whatever the action might be, because they don't understand. They don't understand what's like to go through pain every day and you're lonely and tired and want to change yourself, but feel unmotivated and by the time you are, it's too late to even start. You feel you should seek help, but you don't want to because a) You don't feel as if you might have an actual disorder, considering you only have like 1 or 2 symptoms, but have them frequently, b) You get shut down so much you don't really know anymore, or c) You think that the therapist won't actually help you because how can a stranger solve your problems, you can't trust anyone nowadays? The only reason I'm writing this is because I don't feel okay. Nothing in this world makes sense. I wish people would understand me. My parents say to stop acting like a baby and why I'm crying so much. ""I don't know; maybe I'm depressed, you would know that if you actually understood me!"" but I'm just here in the dark. I'd go to my friends, but they are not really my friends. I mean, they are, but we aren't that close, and they wouldn't understand. Plus, I haven't really talked with anyone since I got home from Jamaica a few days ago. There's so much I want to do, but it all feels hopeless. I imagine the future and what life will be like, but I am having so many envisions. I'm just worried; I'm going to be in my last year of middle school and then going to high school, and I'm definitely worried for that. I honestly wish life was so simple and people weren't so judgemental. I can usually handle it, to a certain extent. I usually ignore it; do something else like a hobby. Now, I don't know what to do. I'm so tired like I don't have the energy to do these things. So I just go on YouTube and Reddit or listen to music. July will be over soon and then I'll hate myself for not accomplishing anything over the summer. I swear, if I had any siblings or pets, I would tell them this, probably.

Something that really bugs me is people. People walk down the street and see a homeless person and don't do anything. Why do people do that? Tbh, depends on what the person was doing and their action, but still, can't people donate a little money? A few years back, I came out of Sam's Club with my mom and we saw a homeless lady with her dog and we passed them. I wanted to look back, but didn't, in fear of what my mom would say. I asked her why she didn't donate any money and she said that she didn't have any spare cash on her. I knew that was a lie. Why do people not donate? I always wanted to help people; it was a secret dream I never told anyone. Now I'm not saying this is all people though. I wish I could help. But being 12, almost 13, and being very socially anxious, awkward, introverted, and lonely, I can't do much. All I can do is express my feelings on Reddit. So yeah.

1482,realktalk1234,1562550427,6,"Lets break this down.

I'm 26 years old and in a place in my life with a TON of free time even though I'm trying to keep myself as busy as possible.

Lets list all my horrific problems shall we?

1) I'm religious (Which isn't a ""problem"" per say). I truly believe it but have a difficult time living it out. I live far away from the closest group to me that shares my faith and I have to travel quite a bit to get there. I overall feel like I complete failure in this part of my life which is ironic cause even the people who know my faults who are part of my faith group do not judge me or make me to feel bad. I'm much harder on myself than basically anyone Ive ever met.

2)I have all kinds of emotional issues. I'm hypersensitive though I typically do an ok job hiding it. I'm insecure, I think no one wants to be around me. Which is obviously not true cause its very common for me to hangout with friends 5+ times a week. If they didn't like me they wouldn't keep inviting me back. I'm a funny guy, i get people to laugh more than I use to (finally developed a sense of humor). But once I get back home its just all gone. All I'm left with is this empty feeling.

3) I want to have a close intimate relationship with a woman. Ive only ever had one girlfriend and it was a long distance relationship (We meet initially online, spent several years as friends, but then decided to be a couple and met in person). So I never really had a lot of physical contact. Its not even about sex for me, its the desire to feel known and loved, to have physical (and emotional) affection. Last time I got a hug was around 6 months ago.

4)I'm an addict. I have an addiction to what I'm going to call ""Lust"", but in a nutshell. When I feel tired and lonely I seek out porn and cybersex to make myself feel better. I just want to feel a connection with someone and so I seek it out. Its become compulsive and destroying my life to be honest. I'll stay up until 4am some nights trying to find someone only to collapse asleep when I can't and then try again the next day. Eventually I'll get through my binging, and try to stop the behavior but then its not to long till I'm back again. I hate myself even while I'm seeking it out. I just don't know how to stop because its the ONLY connection I really feel to other people. I feel like a woman is never going to want me (which objectively is false, thats an issue i'm working through in therapy). At least if I'm voice chatting with a woman online I feel something with someone. At least thats what i tell myself. I'm currently in a 12 step group for it.

5) I'm in a 12 step group, its an over an hour away from where I live, which is exhausting (living in the middle of nowhere sucks especially when you can't move for a few more years). I struggle to call my sponsor , i struggle to call other people and talk about my feelings and emotions. My whole life I was always told that my feelings were wrong, and truth be told many of them (Like the insecurities) ARE wrong. But constantly being told that and living with someone deeply manipulative fucked me up really good. The internet with it anonymity is the only place i feel safe to express myself in any way.

6) I'll never find what I want online. I straight up won't. What do I want? well thats easy. I want to find a woman around my age I can talk to with COMPLETE transparency (while still retaining anonymity). Someone I can explore the sexual stuff with who won't try to make me feel guilty but also won't try to keep me from feeling guilty either. Someone I can talk to and share stuff with right out of the gate without the bullshit and the games. Who has clear boundaries and clearly respects my boundaries. Someone who I can just be, completely emotionally naked with, as well as talk about sexual stuff casually with where she is just as comfortable talking to me about emotions as she is talking to me about a porn video I enjoyed.

Yeah, I'm fucked up. I""m crazy I guess. I feel insane and alone. Ive been in therapy, but its not really helping. I don't know what to do anymore.",lonely,I[M26] feel like a completely broken human being. when I'm out and about i'm social and keep the act up but at home I just feel like I'm broken,2019-07-08 11:47:07

Then my ex said ""You're just like my ex husband."" Then she blocked me on Facebook Messenger and unfriended me. Then she apologized, added me back and unblocked me. But this time after she left me, I told her to block and unfriended me because I can't do it to her because I love her so much, but she didn't. 

TL;DR Why would she hug me, kiss me, look me in my eyes and say she loved me, then break up with me via Facebook Messenger 3 hours later? And also, the other times we argued, she blocked and unfriended me on Facebook, but she didn't this time. Any thoughts on why?",lonely,"Heartbroken, lonely and confused",2019-07-08 08:41:12

1494,taterfume,1562535768,3,"So let me preface this by saying that i really dislike being touched. I'm not a germaphobe or anything like that. It's just that i don't like being hugged,  kissed, massaged, rubbed...etc - not by friends, not by anybody. I treat people kindly and i do shake their hands but thats as far as i'll go. I've been like this for as long as i can remember. And its mainly for this reason that i prefer to be alone. I've never been in an intimate relationship in my life and i do feel lonely sometimes but i just treat it like any other bad feeling that eventually passes.

However, the other night, i had this dream where i was in a large dark hall with rows of empty chairs in the center. I was sitting there alone for a while and nothing felt particularly out of the ordinary. A little bit later,though, a woman walked in. She seemed about my age, my height and, somehow, i vaguely knew her. In this giant hall full of empty chairs, she chose to sit in the one directly to my left. I nervously adjusted my posture as she sat down but she didn't seem bothered. A moment later, she slowly moved over towards me to where our shoulders were touching. She kept moving closer until her right cheek was pressed against my left cheek and her back softly rested against my chest. The feeling of her face against mine was something new to me. I could feel her warmth. It started to feel euphoric; like the weight of the world was slowly being lifted off my chest. Waves upon waves of good feelings that i never knew i could experience kept washing over me  to the point that had me crying (i never cry) and i couldn't get enough. I never wanted to leave that hall or that chair. I never wanted to leave her (whoever she was). 

Then i woke up... 
It was like waking up from a soul shattering nightmare. I felt terrible. I still feel terrible. I've been barely functioning for the last few days and it's really showing at work and with friends. I don't feel like my old self anymore. I've felt sad and a little depressed before but nothing like this.
I wish i were still asleep.

But after high school we stopped being close we managed to talk from time to time  . I wasn't sad as i realised we are different now and can't be close friends . Then i realised that many of them got engaged and invited all of old friends even who are not close to the group . It made me feel bad but i didn't say anything as i told my self i should have self worth and i don't want to seem pitiful and it was obious that they don't think about my feelings . Then another two got engaged and did the same . As i was no thing ! Once , two of the group massaged me that they miss me and then after two days i saw their pictures together and having fun so if you really miss me why don't you want to hang out with me , i even told one of them who she always said that i am her best friend to spend sometimes together on her holiday but she didn't and saw her picture out with the group . I know they are not my friends but i just always feel left out maybe bc i have no friends and no love in my life , so do you think i should  delete their number and unfollow them so i don't see their stories!

1529,skyrunner1227,1562473136,5,"Hello all! so I had posted this on another subreddit a while back, but I wanted to see what you guys think of this whole situation.

\*please keep in mind that I am a GIRL, not a guy, when reading this!\*

&amp;#x200B;

About a while back, (about 12th grade) I started to talk to this girl I had met through running high school track and cross country... I would see her face all the time in our local newspaper for one of her many track achievements, and soon enough I had developed a huge crush on her, so much so, that my teammates began teasing me about her each time we were at a track meet and they would see her.

I thought we had developed a rapport with each other, and we eventually exchanged our phone numbers/Snapchat usernames and we kept in touch quite often, even after we both graduated and she went to California to go to college while I stayed back home on the East Coast.

Back in January of this year, at around New Years, I finally confessed to her via Snapchat (after nearly 2 and a half years of silently pining over her and being too shy to say anything to her) that I had romantic feelings for her and that I may have been also attracted to girls in general. She replied about a day later, and to my suprise she took it pretty well, saying that she was flattered but she ""didn't swing that way"" and when I thanked her for her kindness and support, she stated that I should ""never be afraid to be who you are"" and other kind words of support.

I thought by then that she and I, while not being in a romantic relationship, could continue our casual acquaintanceship and hopefully develop it into a close friendship, based on her kind and warming words to me. She was the first person I came out to, and her kindness had lifted the weight of the crushing depression and anxiety I was feeling due to hiding in the closet for so long.

A few weeks later, I found that she had requested to follow me on her Instagram page, and I was jumping for joy! I had tried to follow her in the longest time but she never noticed it and immediately I followed her back. That event had temporarily lifted me out of my depression and I couldn't stop smiling for hours. Little did I know that I would eventually screw all that up.

 About several weeks ago, she posted some pictures on her Instagram page, and I had noticed that she had spelled “dessert” wrong (spelling it as desert) in her caption. Being the joker that I am, I decided to tease her a little, (because I had mistakenly thought we were good friends by now) so I had commented “goes to (one of the most academically elite universities in the US, for privacy purposes I’m not saying which one) and forgets that there are two s’s in dessert 😂” I thought it was a harmless, innocuous joke and I had posted it, thinking no harm had been done.

Boy, was I wrong...

About an hour and a half later, I go onto my phone to check my social media and try to go on her Instagram page and I find that I had been blocked by her (because I couldn’t find her in the search bar). Another creeping instinct also told me to go onto Snapchat, and sure enough, I had gotten blocked on there too. I immediately try to send her an iMessage to try to try to apologize for my comment, (by then I knew this was about the comment) but I never got a reply. By this point, I was really confused about why she had blocked me, because my immediate thought was that  I didn’t really say anything that offensive to her, and up until that day, we were pretty cool with each other and we stayed in touch quite often. 

My last resort was to reach out to a mutual friend of ours to see if she could try to pass on my apology and make sense of all this. A few days later, I got a DM from our friend and she had passed on the apology, and had stated the vibe she got from the conversation she had with my friend (the girl that blocked me) was that she wanted to be left alone and possibly needed some space. 

And I did take that advice, and for several weeks, I patiently waited to see if she would unblock me and try to sort this misunderstanding out, but she never did. I was thinking about maybe leaving a message on her Facebook (the one application she has not blocked me on) and see if she wanted to talk this out, but I realize she would probably block me on there too.

I was telling an acquaintance of mine about this the other day, and she had said that A:  She (my friend) believed that I hadn't been that offensive and that she (the girl that blocked me) was being an oversensitive petty drama queen and B: she didn't seem to value me or care for me, in general, all that much, based upon the fact that I would sometimes complain to her that she would often read and ignore my text messages, (she had read receipts on) and every time I suggested we meet up and hang out, she would say ""maybe"" or ""we'll see"" ( when she did this, however, I usually chalked it up to her being busy with school and track). 



But I feel this sense of guilt and sorrow, as though I was being rude and demeaning, and I feel like a total asshole for cracking a joke like that. I just thought that she would find some humor in it and that it would make her laugh a little, in a self-depreciative manner. I now do realize that some things aren't funny (and just plain rude) to people, and since I don't have many relationships with people, (and being on the autism spectrum) I guess I misconstrued this. I really want to connect with her again and resolve this conflict to see if we could at least be on good terms with each other, and I know you guys are probably thinking ""but she IGNORES you and doesn't even try to connect with you, why would you want to talk to her again?"" I feel as though I had built this special connection with her when I had first come out, something that I had never really felt before in my life, and it provided me with a sense of relief and hope that there was someone out there that really cared about me, and for the first time actually connect with them on a deep level.


At this point, I don't know whether to try to reach out to her again and apologize again or cut my losses and move on. I just can't seem to get her out of my mind, but sometimes things are just best left broken in the closet, and that's as close as they are to getting fixed, I suppose.",lonely,I’m worried I might have driven away a person that I cared about...,2019-07-07 14:18:56

I used to have a lot of friends but over the years and when growing up you realize that nobody actually cares about you and friends or other people will always prioritize themselves first. Literally all my friends have focused on their studies or girlfriends and half of them actually got their girlfriends through me, cause i was the one initially chatting with the girl(s) in question (over the years).

  
I just can't see making friends the same as before because it always ends up the same way. The moment they get a better deal they just leave. That's why the only thing that might be relevant in life is an actual relationship because at least then you need each other and are a part of each other's lives. I'm sure there are exceptions and good friendships exist just the same as bad relationships where they don't care about each other exist but i also believe i'm more or less grown enough (at least mentally, not physically or socially) to not let this happen, i've been through a lot of bad stuff and you tend to grow from it.

A few years ago i told to myself if i haven't found a girlfriend or some other reason to live for by the time i'm 30 that i'll end it all but in that time i realized suicide is pointless (i already have a few half-assed attempts that landed me in hospital) because we'll all die anyway so might as well just wait it out, how much worse can it get than it is now? I'll die? (and that's the irony). I have much harder time being suicidal now (like i was before) but the feeling of emptiness doesn't go away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not fat and while i'm not the best looking person, i'm probably not the worst looking person either. I've been praised for my looks more than once but on any sort of dating sites i absolutely never get anyone talking to me (Except once but uhh.. we were not even remotely on the same page). Around reddit i see girls saying they get 30+, 200, pms (including all sorts of dick pics) when they merely mention they're a female (without even showing how they look like) while as a guy you don't get any attention from the opposite sex at all, it's pretty discouraging.

&amp;#x200B;

So what can a guy that's painfully shy ,and completely demotivated, do in life to get an actual partner?  The way i see it, the only option i have is to meet online and then transition it to real life but how can i meet anyone online as a guy? My only turn off is obesity. I'd say i'm extremely accepting when it comes to appearance so its not me having high standards or anything either.

1578,sarnad31,1562406420,2,"My husband wants to leave me. After 4 years. He wanted to leave me 3 mths ago cause we had a fight over me having anxiety, getting angry sometimes and being too scared/procrastinating getting help for it despite him encouraging me constantly to go get help (i was later diagnosed with complex PTSD). I tried to save my marriage after that fight by finally getting mental help. The day I went to get help, he was willing to try again and see if I really change. The past 3 mths have been adventurous and loving. Sleeping under the stars, kissing my shoulders EVERY morning to wake me up, cuddles, etc. We hadnt had a fight in months, which is huge. The other day we had a dispute that pertained to him saying he doesnt have remorse/regrets towards anything he has done or said. Even in regards to wanting divorce before. I got upset, and every time i questioned something, he kept saying painful things that were conflicting things he said/did before...that worried me..and I kept asking about it past his bedtime. Yesterday he wrote down 4 questions in a book for me to answer. 

 1: Why are we in a relationship if there will never be trust between us?

2: If you want me to tell you what I want, why don't you listen to the answer?

3: We prolong the inevitable outcome trying to patch up our relationship. I thought you didn't want that to happen? Not lead you on like I did my other relationships?

4: I'm sorry we rushed into marriage. I thought it would help your anxieties

 I was starting crying. He was calm and collected so he wasn't being a jerk at all. In fact, he was crying too.  He said that the past 3 months have been just 'okay'. Like, he enjoyed going to new places.. but he didn't feel fulfilled, because he felt like he couldn't trust me enough to open up to me about how he feels about things, cause I react so he hides it and feels unfulfilled as a result. And that he was trying to ignore how he felt and just tried to pretend? That he would rather do adventures alone. That he would be unhappy without me, but unhappier with me cause he doesn't want to deal with anyone's stress other than his own atm. That he doesn't 'want' this, he feels he 'needs' it. That he isn't himself. I said ""I thought we were doing great the past 3 months"". I spent a lot of money doing everything he loves. Him taking selfies everywhere with me, and I controlled my anxiety so much better. He would kiss me every morning so sweetly.. and he told me ""for you the adventures were great, but I was not happy, it was not enough. I felt something missing. I haven't been happy for a while"". 

 I told him that if I don't make him happy, then I'll accept his wishes. He started getting sad. And then he said... ""I want you to be happy too honey and you don't seem like you have been lately either""  I told him ""I dont understand..whenever you seemed upset I always asked what was wrong and you said it was work or something..and when I ask you if it was me,  you got mad that i didn't believe you were happy with me. You always complain I don't believe you cause I need reassurance ...and that it hurts your feelings. Why are you proving me right?"" And "" if you are so unhappy the past couple weeks, why did you want to surprise me with a tattoo wedding band?"" he said ""it was your idea""...wow. I mentioned it as a joke 1 YEAR ago. I accidently found out the secret that he was going to do it and he got upset that I spoiled the surprise. My 'idea' my ass. 
I asked him if he wanted a separation or a divorce. He said ""I  want a divorce because it would be harder to be just separated and it wouldn't allow me to fully let you go cause you'd still be...'here' in a way."" But then i asked if he wants it for 'now' or 'forever' and he said "" for now"" And then told me he loves me, reciprocated that we love each other more than anybody ever, cried, etc.

I asked him if he was just trying to soften the blow on me and he really wants to be without me forever.. and he shrugged, and said ""in the future, if you become more stable and happy ..then maybe we can talk about it"". And I said ""is that what you're hoping for?"". And he shook his head yes. And then I said ""..or do you just really want us to never see each other again"". His response was..""like i said, I don't know. I will have to be apart from you to have the answer to that""

I told him, I have nowhere to go right now (he uprooted me across country with his parents. I know no one here and haven't been in this state long enough to have a job yet) and I would like to try and get an apartment but I don't want it to be awkward living here. And he said ""that's fine, and we can all like go do things as a family together but just know that we're NOT going to do things as a couple. This would be so there's no animosity in the house. The end goal is divorce so just to make that clear"". 

And after we had this somber divorce agreement.. he went out to Home Depot. I was at the time wrapping up our wedding photos and putting them away. Crying.. because I couldn't stand walking past them anymore. His mother came halfway upstairs feeling really bad for me, telling me I am always welcomed and loved and can stay as long as I want. That minute, he came back into the house, his mom turned around and asked him ""what you got?"" He went (and this is no exaggeration) ""I got an awesome foam topper for when we go caaamping!! Oo and I also got this and this, and it will be soo fun! ^_^"". He then came upstairs to put the foam topper on the bed but noticed i was wrapping our wedding photos up on it and he said ""Oh, I can see you are busy hehe. I will put this in the other room. ;)""  . I was sick to my stomach with how jubilant he was. 

I went out to talk to my friend. When i came back in the house, everyone...him, his parents..were doing that "" how you doing sweety? Lets go to fireworks tonight!"". And then he was like ""Oh, hey hey look at this Sarah! Look at this awesome Geode! It really polished up nice :). Hey does hot dogs sound good for dinner?"". And then like, walking around laughing with his folks, BBQing. ""Hey mom! You want a hot dog with this salad? They are gluten freeeee""  and shit like that. 

  Why is he saying he needs a divorce 'for now', but not a seperation cause if there are still ties, he can't move on and have the opportunity to possibly miss me/want me back? While bawling. It doesn't make sense. Even when I asked him to make sure he wasn't fluffing my tail with bullshit, he straight up said we either will or won't, but he hopes I get myself straightened out and happy and then 'we' can continue from there. He keeps saying he cant talk to me about how he feels. Like, he doesnt trust me enough to open up to me for some reason, even if I ask..cause I guess I cant handle it? If he opened up about how he feels about his mom, or work, or anything.. I was always there for him. It was only when he had feelings about us that he was sad over that I would respond with ""why would you think that?"" instead of ""I understand""..therefore he lost trust in opening up. I feel like such shit for it. I feel like,  I used him for an emotional tampon and he felt cornered and burdened and wanted out when he couldn't deal anymore. I think anyone would leave that.

Today, I was going for a walk outside and when I got back, I saw he was loading his truck with camping stuff for a 2 day solo-camping trip. I asked him briefly if he wanted help loading, he said ""nah, im good"" and I told him ""well, have a good time""...his response was an unenthusiastic ""yeah..we'll see I guess"" (???) Which is a 180 of how he acted yesterday. He left and his parents and I did some house painting/reno and went out to eat. I then got some messages from his brother, who incidently found out about things and wanted to talk. A verbatim summary of what he said ( responses to my texts) was ..

"" I am sorry. It's not you. You're truly a warm and caring person. I'm sorry Ken cant reciprocate the emotional commitment a relationship should have. Communication and trust are really everything. You arent alone in having anxiety/depression. Unfortunately, you also aren't alone in Ken distancing himself whenever he was needed either. No, I don't think you were an emotional tampon. I'd buy that maybe if you were dating..but 2 things: 1) Your inner voice is your worst critic. 2) You aren't dating. YOU'RE MARRIED. He knew damn well going in how your anxiety was. And you aren't the first person he's dated with anxiety/depression...and you arent the first he has left cause of it either, you are like.. the fifth.  Vicky, Jen, Jess (ex spouse), Angie, and now you. He left ALL of them cause they needed emotional support. In every relationship I've seen with Ken, he's been great when the relationship is on rails and everyone is happy, but as time goes on and his partner becomes more ""needy"" (forgive the term), he distances himself and when the other partner continues to ask for support, he leaves. Ken doesn't like being leaned on. He enjoys the good, and then bails when it becomes more than superficial. Even if things magically get better now, he's just going to do the same thing whenever your relationship inconveniences him. That's not right. He manipulated you into his idea of a convenient relationship. Meek, and easy.  He's a sociopath. You gave up A LOT to be with him. Your home, friends, and vehicle when he suggested. Ken picks really great people, not going to lie...then he chews them and spits them out. He bails on everyone when things get complicated and inconvenient. Do you remember what I sat you down, and told you when you two first got together? About his history of breaking hearts? He doesn't want to fix partners, but he definitely prefers less confident partners. I don't know why. And he doesnt want to expend the energy needed. Can't tell you how he feels cause he knows how you will react? Thats bullshit, cause everything honest he says is..rather terrifying. I honestly in good faith do not think I could attend another wedding of his, if he has one. I really just want to be like "" dude, get a Tinder acct or swingers club. You need to tell people relationships with you dont end well"" lol. Just realize that I am here for you, Angie is too..and especially my parents. They really really like you and want you to stay, help you out, hang out. Screw Ken, HE can leave. Get alimony."" 

So its like. Okay. Yes. But everyone noted how in love he was with me. He even told me once that ""my older relationships were short term and temporary. Just waiting for the one. You are the only person I have ever had a crush on and want to be with long term"". Plus, realize we both did a lot for each other. Especially extravagant gifts to make the other surprised. He did a lot of that for me, and I know he endured a lot of my continuous anxiety shit and tried to get me help and I was a coward so what else is he supposed to do? I can't help but feel..it was 'real' and I ...'I' fucked it up. This is what I get.  But at the same time, Im not sure if I can apply what his brother said..since I felt it was more? But I also can't ignore what he said.

As I get older I notice that all of my friends who I used to be extremely close to are slowly becoming distant because of marriages, kids, jobs, etc. This is to be expected. But just as they grow apart from me, I notice they go on to make new friends and build new bonds with other people. This is also a great thing. But it makes me feel twice as lonely because for some reason I can't seem to find friends in adulthood. I moved to another state two years ago for school and became very close to my roommates (who were also new to the area). We all still live together but sometimes I will look up and notice that they have all gone out to hang with other new friends they've made since moving here, while I am at home scrolling my phone book full of people that I just don't connect with in that way. Even with mutual acquaintances that my roommates and I have met, it seems they hit it off and continue to see each other, but it just isn't there with me I guess.

I'm stuck feeling lonely and sorry for myself because it seems so easy for people to float into new friend groups and leave me, but I cannot seem to do the same. When I was younger it seemed I had countless friends to spend time with. Granted they were all different and I had to hang with them separately, but I had a unique bond with them all. As you get older they seem to drop like flies, yet no new friends seem to stick. I have heard people say that you have to go out and do things you like to meet people similar to you, and I have, but I am also not the type to walk up to people and start talking? Lol. I am a woman, and it is always much easier to strike up casual/funny conversation with men. However, many of them begin to like me in a romantic way or try to sleep with me, and I don't look at them in the same light so it just gets weird. Women are hard to connect with.

What’s even worse is having to conceal my anxiety because if I do try to confide in someone, I’m always told the generic “just don’t think about it” or “it’s fine you’re overreacting” or “it’s not that bad”.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I'm so overwhelmed with everything, I just want my extended family and my one friend to acknowledge that she's not okay and help me more.

1603,atari1993,1562384556,2,"They say you only get one shot. What happens if you hesitate for so long, so anxious about wasting it, that when you finally pull trigger: nothing happens?

Your chance was invalid before you even began. The deck stacked against you. The gambit was in play before you even realized that there was no way out. You cherished the notion that at the right time and place, you could suddenly fulfill yourself! You would feel purposeful, intent on completing what you set out to do. And yet, you aimed at what you wanted, and now you’re overwhelmed without a single point of salvation available.

There’s no escape rope, no teleport, there’s no quick exit, no wings to spread and fly. It’s just you and the crushing darkness of what you tried to run from all catching up to you.

I’m 25, and soon I’ll be 26. I don’t see myself making it long past 30. Every year after I graduated college, I told myself that *this* would be the year. I’d figure my path out, I’d find what I was looking for. I’d finally be able to relax. Maybe you’re younger, and you feel the same. Hell, this misery know no stranger, and there are those older who probably suffer, too! Just the same, my mind wanders to thoughts of how things could have been different.

I missed all of my chances. Any opening I had at my dreams has long passed me by. I’ve put the gun to my head and pulled the trigger but even then it didn’t fire. The powder was wet, the bullet tarnished, the mechanism rusty from disuse; moreso, the thing doesn’t even look like it was built to fire in the first place. 

I was born faulty. I was not made properly. Who here can say they were? But many of us have the troublesome mental afflictions that make the game seem rigged from the start. When you fear existence itself, are you meant to keep existing? Maybe your family thinks so, or you could be unlucky and have them wish you would stop being a bother. Maybe you don’t know, or perhaps you feel they’re lying to your face. You can say “No worries,” but do you mean it? 

I’m on the Spectrum. The blasted Spectrum. I’m quite alright with it, but you’d be hard pressed to find someone who is willing and able to deal with a stranger who is afflicted. I’m a handful, even on the best of days. My usefulness is limited, my personality grating, my appearance shabby, and my interests absurd. But I’m still human. *Right?* I hope I am, but it’s not easy to feel that way sometimes.

The rest of my family are wonderfully average. *Dare I say above average?* My father is an engineer, as is my uncle. My mother, a nurse, my aunt an experienced legal assistant. My sister is a physicians assistant, my cousins both wonderful people trying to start their careers as they finish out college. My sister is older than I am, and I got to watch as she quit a 6 year relationship and found someone better, with whom she is quite happily living her life. Their relationship is enviable. My younger cousin has found a boyfriend who has quickly bonded with her and is moving to engagement, much to the delight of my family. My other cousin is recovering from a motorcycle accident and will finish school soon. And I... well...

I’ve discovered that I burnt my chances out long ago. As an Aspie, I struggled to fit in during middle and high school. I was bullied. I was used. I was neglected. And I ended up becoming very scared of people due to this experience. I found myself retreating to the edges and the corners, relating with teachers and adults to avoid the unforgiving others my age. I exited school with no friends, other than a small group of three people I found in an online forum before I discovered that the bullying and abuse existed on the internet, too. I stopped exploring and being excited about the Web once I got berated for simply enjoying a game I liked. *Nobody cares,* indeed.

I went to college and never found my place there. I kept presenting myself for usage, because it’s all I knew about interacting with others. I could do project work, I could find things online easily, I was knowledgeable in certain areas, and when it came to games, I had a lot of cool things to offer. But I rarely got taken up on any of that, and despite hating how I felt being used for what I could do and nothing else, it was a lonely time. Even the campus’ religious groups largely ignored me if I visited. I struggled to make it through, and got depressed and suicidal. I got pulled through it by medicine and awkward discussions with doctors who didn’t know what to do. And for a time, I felt my greatest achievement was getting my degree. The other option was death. I couldn’t fail... it wasn’t an option.

I quickly realized that death would have been better. My degree wasn’t in Science, but in Arts... a business degree in a field that didn’t care for business. I found myself locked out of jobs due to lack of experience, lack of clearance, lack of education, lack of certification. I took the first job I could find and then quickly looked for friends. There were none. My coworkers were kept distant by management and I felt alone.

My online friend group broke up and vanished. I traveled across the country to try and meet with one, and she liked me enough to call me her boyfriend... until neither of us could keep up our emotions and I left to get some space. She rebounded quickly with a lesbian relationship. I cut my losses and moved back home. 

I found another online friend in an unlikely place. She gave me hope that things could be better. Until she also revealed she was a lesbian. She’s still my closest confidant, but we’re not really friends. How can you be friends with someone a thousand miles away, whose voice you’ve never heard, and who is frightfully busy with her own life, including a girlfriend of her own? 

I can’t find a new job. I can’t move away, I can’t afford to. I can’t find friends, they’re nowhere to be found. And I keep getting reminded how many times I could have pulled trigger and gotten myself on track. But now, I aim towards whatever comes my way, only to hear a sad, dull *click*.",lonely,I’ve missed my shot,2019-07-06 13:42:36

And then there's another guy. A group of us played a game or FMK while drunk, and all the girls chose that same guy for the F or M. He's the focus of everyone's attention. He's at every hangout.

1613,Comrade_Danielle,1562374784,49,"It's a long thing. and it's really affecting my mental health. Like REALLY. So I'll start. 

Okay... I'm 15, going to tenth grade. I am an orthodox jew, straight, and currently work 5 days a week as a counselor at a summer religious day camp from 8:30 to 4:00. I have been to private school all my life, not religious or jewish, but private school. Just giving background info. I'm probably depressed, I self harm, see a therapist (who does nothing, by the way), have been emotionally and probably physically abused (don't know what constitutes physical abuse but ive been slapped hard on the face, kicked down the stairs, and hit against the wall multiple times). I've been called a piece of shit, piece of trash, waste of oxygen, bitch, fucking bitch, stupid kid, idiot, as well as numerous other names... but don't worry about it please... this isn't the point of this post. 

I have bad social anxiety, so much that I run out of classrooms when i have to present, and start shaking and sweating when i am called on. I never raise my hand but a couple times i was called on and i started violently shaking, looked down, and mumbled *i dont know* even if i did know, im too stressed out to answer. I don't work well in big groups of people, crowds terrify me, but 10 or less people I can deal with and be normal with. 

I also have maladaptive daydreaming. I won't get into it now because it will be important later. It's a type of dissociation and coping mechanism thingy, but it's a bad coping mechanism. Hence the word maladaptive, which means: 

&gt;not providing adequate or appropriate adjustment to the environment or situation.  
&gt;  
&gt;*""maladaptive coping strategies such as increasing consumption of alcohol""*

It is where i create a world in my head that doesn't exist, I have imaginary friends, an imaginary self, and i live in a perfet utopia where i have all that I want. It's like a subconscious yearning i have for that reality, for friends and for a better me, and just a better life, and there's so many things stopping me from getting it in reality so that I daydream about it. the dreaming is about 60% of my waking life, it involves pacing nonstop in circles, talking to myself, and making facial expressions. To other people I look like a psycho but in my head I'm pretending im other people having conversations. Occasionally i burst out laughing in public out of nowhere and people are like what's so funny, but what happened is that I daydreamed someone said or did something funny in my head. I try to not show it in public but sometimes i zone out and can't control it. My dreams are mainly me having fun with friends. It's a complex world only I can understand, and it'll only give *me* the pleasure it gives me while doing it because i am deprived of and have different wants than most other people my age, if that makes any sense.

\---

Enough background info. But it was important. So, like, if you skipped over it, go back and read it. 

So I try hard to make friends. I am extremely eager and i have a really immature, goofy personality but not an annoying one. I stop when people tell me to. I like doing pranks, i take things easily, i dont get angry or sad or dramatic. and if someone needs help ill gladly run to help them with anything. I always go up to people. I have to interrupt them even sometimes so that they'll notice me.   
I text them but I've never recieved a text message from anyone. I have never in my life of 15 years been invited to the beach, mall, or any kind of casual outing by anyone ever. Last week I texted 10 people i thought were my friends even though they have lots of other friends. I invited them to the mall and i planned everything out. There was a movie theater, bowling alley, and roller skating rink. A movie i wanted to see started at 11 so i started the outing at 11, in case we wanted to watch a movie. I figured we'd have lunch so i looked up all the restaurants. I gave everyone the directions, things to do, and I felt this awesome feeling. I never get out of my house. NEVER. I NEVER talk to people. NEVER NEVER EVER. 

About 5 people said they could come. I was really excited. 

One cancelled a couple of days before saying they actually couldn't make it. 

The rest of the people i texted everyday from that day reminding them and talking about how excited i was. 

The day of the trip I got up extremely early and fixed my hair and spent like hours choosing an outfit. I ate a really good wholesome breakfast and i was feeling really good, like as if even for 3 hours i could pretend to be normal and live the life like the way i do when im in my head talking to myself. With friends, but like real ones. 

So then I got into the car. 

All of them said they were so sorry they couldn't make it. Except one. 

I felt extremely down but i texted the last friend, the one i was hoping would come the most out of all of them. I even changed the date to the day he said he could make it on. It was like 20 mins til it started. I texted him 'are you excited?? have you started driving??""  
He texted: ""wait what r we doing again?""

and so i got confused and sent him all the details again. I had been bothering him for days about it since i planned it. He said:

""Oh sorry, im going to the beach with \_\_, and \_\_\_, and \_\_. I'm so sorry i hope you have fun.""

But.... he had told me he had nothing planned on that day. So then I just asked my mom to drive to my dad's office where i go sometimes. there's a mattress and a pillow in one of the empty office rooms. I like to sleep there and daydream. It's a depressing room though. later that day he posted a photo on instagram, and a few videos. he was with all the kids hiking in LA by the hollywood sign ( we live close to LA) and then they were in this gorgeous beach by the sunset that I'd only see in my dreams. And they were on top of this mountain and the view and everyone looked like they were having fun and he captioned it 'i had so much fun today, you guys are the best most amazing and funny friends ever!!'

Guys im done with making friends. 

Yesterday I invited my other 'friend' that never talks to me unless i talk to her and i was super eager and like do you want to go to the amusement park and we can go on the roller coasters and stuff?? Obviously she said no. I was so excited. 

Then i go on instagram and see everyone in other countries and everyone having fun and shopping and eating out and going to amusement parks and im here with a bunch of crying third graders all day in the hot sun only to get home to 'you piece of shit get to your room right now but first clean all the dishes'. 

and then I'm up until 2 o clock in the morning pacing in circles in my room imagining everything about me and my 'friends' and my life was completely different. I haven't left the house for a fun outing with friends since 6th grade, almost 4 years ago. And even that time i had to invite myself. 

I wish someone would invite me somewhere. And put thought into the planning, and what well do and how excited they are to see me. I'm always so excited to meet people and i always tell them how much i miss them but no one ever responds and no one ever tells me they enjoy being with me. 

I wish i had even just one person to be goofy with and go out, maybe we could do the things i spend my life dreaming about, 8 hrs a day, just dreaming... maybe we could just like laugh and go to the beach and go eat out and maybe we could go roller skating or get ice cream sundaes or go hiking or just like take a walk in town and go to the library or something... or we could go shopping in santa monica, a really lively nice city in the evening, there's street jazz bands and ice skating... I've only been there once as a child but occasionally dream about it in my dreams. ANd then we could go to the coffee shop and get something to drink and sit outside and just chat.   
I WANT SOMEONE to look into my eyes when they talk to me, not ignore me, not pull out their phone, not walk away, I want them to look in my eyes and pay attention to what i say and i want them to have fun being with me cause i have fun with everyone but no one has fun with me, everyone thinks im boring. And i want someone lively, not depressed like everyone else my age. And someone that will just send me random text messages, i wish someone would send me hi. I wish someone would tell me hi and then send like a smiley face emoji. I wish someone would facetime me. I haven't facetimed in years and i have never received a facetime call from anyone. 

I wish i could escape my home with someone and just go somewhere simple, like just take a walk, and i want to be comfortable with them and just be me, not mentally ill, not abused, not depressed, not covered in scars, not wearing long dresses and long sleeves and shirts that cover my collarbone (because of religion, im extremely religious tho i dont want to be) just i want to be normal and do normal things like a normal kid my age and forget everything that's going on just for 3 hours of my life. With someone who actually enjoys my presence and isnt looking away or responding 'oh' or 'yeah' to something i say. I don't party, never kissed or hooked up, never vaped or smoked, im not a social media addict, i dont bring my phone or look at it when i talk to people, im not a slutty hoe-girl, idk......... i just want to have easygoing, sweet, responsible empathetic friends. or just one. 

Next year im going to public school. A new school. I dont know a single soul there. I have a chance to change things, change my personality, make new friends. 

I need help so i dont ruin everything on the first day. Again, I DON""T do well in crowds.

 TLDR i want friends. Help, im going mentally insane. I already am actually.

1619,realktalk1234,1562372710,1,"Lets break this down.

I'm 26 years old and in a place in my life with a TON of free time even though I'm trying to keep myself as busy as possible.

Lets list all my horrific problems shall we?

1) I'm religious (Which isn't a ""problem"" per say). I truly believe it but have a difficult time living it out. I live far away from the closest group to me that shares my faith and I have to travel quite a bit to get there. I overall feel like I complete failure in this part of my life which is ironic cause even the people who know my faults who are part of my faith group do not judge me or make me to feel bad. I'm much harder on myself than basically anyone Ive ever met.

2)I have all kinds of emotional issues. I'm hypersensitive though I typically do an ok job hiding it. I'm insecure, I think no one wants to be around me. Which is obviously not true cause its very common for me to hangout with friends 5+ times a week. If they didn't like me they wouldn't keep inviting me back. I'm a funny guy, i get people to laugh more than I use to (finally developed a sense of humor). But once I get back home its just all gone. All I'm left with is this empty feeling.

3) I want to have a close intimate relationship with a woman. Ive only ever had one girlfriend and it was a long distance relationship (We meet initially online, spent several years as friends, but then decided to be a couple and met in person). So I never really had a lot of physical contact. Its not even about sex for me, its the desire to feel known and loved, to have physical (and emotional) affection. Last time I got a hug was around 6 months ago.

4)I'm an addict. I have an addiction to what I'm going to call ""Lust"", but in a nutshell. When I feel tired and lonely I seek out porn and cybersex to make myself feel better. I just want to feel a connection with someone and so I seek it out. Its become compulsive and destroying my life to be honest. I'll stay up until 4am some nights trying to find someone only to collapse asleep when I can't and then try again the next day. Eventually I'll get through my binging, and try to stop the behavior but then its not to long till I'm back again. I hate myself even while I'm seeking it out. I just don't know how to stop because its the ONLY connection I really feel to other people. I feel like a woman is never going to want me (which objectively is false, thats an issue i'm working through in therapy). At least if I'm voice chatting with a woman online I feel something with someone. At least thats what i tell myself. I'm currently in a 12 step group for it.

5) I'm in a 12 step group, its an over an hour away from where I live, which is exhausting (living in the middle of nowhere sucks especially when you can't move for a few more years). I struggle to call my sponsor , i struggle to call other people and talk about my feelings and emotions. My whole life I was always told that my feelings were wrong, and truth be told many of them (Like the insecurities) ARE wrong. But constantly being told that and living with someone deeply manipulative fucked me up really good. The internet with it anonymity is the only place i feel safe to express myself in any way.

6) I'll never find what I want online. I straight up won't. What do I want? well thats easy. I want to find a woman around my age I can talk to with COMPLETE transparency (while still retaining anonymity). Someone I can explore the sexual stuff with who won't try to make me feel guilty but also won't try to keep me from feeling guilty either. Someone I can talk to and share stuff with right out of the gate without the bullshit and the games. Who has clear boundaries and clearly respects my boundaries. Someone who I can just be, completely emotionally naked with, as well as talk about sexual stuff casually with where she is just as comfortable talking to me about emotions as she is talking to me about a porn video I enjoyed.

1620,SN82536,1562371877,2,"It’s supposed to be some of the happiest months of my life. I tried to talk to my fiancé about it. How I understand mental illness, but my dad knows how our grandmothers suicide affected us but he says things like “don’t worry if I get a motorcycle and I wreck, I’ll be going fast enough to die” or “I don’t even want to be here anymore.” One of my best friends stopped taking her meds and has been sober for 18 months, been in and out of mental institutions for the past 3 years and she’s on a great combo of meds. She decided she didn’t want to take them anymore.... so she could drink. Drinking leads her to suicidal thoughts. My best friend in the entire world thinks life is constantly out to get her, she thinks that if I moved away she couldn’t manage her own life in any way. My sister is suicidal always, on drugs, and has a son that my aforementioned father and mother take care of (it’s worth mentioning I have two other younger siblings that still live with them as well). I tried telling my fiancé all of this and then, obviously I’m still upset from saying all of that, I let him know that all of gagged is the reason I get so upset when he gets so angry with life. Because if you just take a drive you can find the beauty in the smallest things without even looking for it. He seems miserable all the time. I can’t get him to go get help either. But he blew up at me. Told me to quit directing it all at him, and when I said I wasn’t doing that at all he got mad. So I just stopped talking about it, and turned the radio up.

1623,its_andi_with_an_i,1562368433,0,"Hey everyone! I just wanted somewhere to rant to that isn't my immediate only two/three people I talk to. I am kinda in a weird situation where I had to leave school for a year and a half, it's really expensive and I'm paying for it myself so I took off to pay off my tuition from last year and save up to go back. A lot has happened since then, I've gotten awesome jobs that pay very well for someone who doesn't have a degree and is just a college kid trying to pay for everything. I'm finally content at my jobs, I've worked some shitty barely minimum wage ones, and I'm happy to say after a year and a half of struggling, I'm better off now.

Now, my personality has always been bubbly and I've always loved people. Its why I work in retail and with people- because even for those 99/100 times where someone is just an asshole (who's entitled and is so frustrated with their own life that they have to harass the hard working people at their local stores and malls to feel better) there is always that 1/100 who remind me why I'm glad humans are social creatures. It reminds me why I'm a med/STEM degree, why I keep bothering with waking up in the morning, and why I can't wait until I graduate so I can help people in an even bigger way then just helping them find clothes, or tools, or serving them food. If I can get you that discount, if I can find a way to make it cheaper for you because you're kind to me and have a special occasion, I will.

But I'm so so lonely.

I'm engaged to the greatest man I've ever met, my sister, brother and I get along, my fiance's best friend treats me like a little sister, and I have a roommate I consider a brother. But aside from these people, there is no one else. And I try! I try to talk to the girls my age from work, I've even made plans with them and been out with them once, but then those promises of ""we should do this again"" they never happen. Aside from that, most of my other coworkers are way way older than me and are very kind and caring towards me, but they understand that there is a mutual respect going on and they wouldn't wanna hang out with a college kid. They have grandkids my age, it'll be weird to them to consider befriending someone so vastly younger.

And today, I've kinda just snapped and broke down into tears in the shower. Yesterday I decided to try and initiate some plans with the two girls I really liked from an old job that I quit, and they said they'll let me know! Well this morning I check their snaps and they just decided to hang out without me and I'm just devastated.

I just want someone to talk to and hang out with that isn't a male, my family is far away since I decided to go to college far away and I feel so lonely. It's like everyone forgets about me, if I run into you on the street I get hugs and kisses and everyone is so ecstatic to see me! But it's the keeping up the constant contact, or even just reaching out to me no one does. Even when I run into people who claim they miss me beyond words and all that, as soon as I text them hey let's do something! I get left on read or they never get back to me.

Am I cursed? Why doesn't anyone want to be my friend, I feel like I am boring my fiance and family with these complaints, and I don't want to be a nuisance. I started working out to pass the time, I've been suffering from an injury though so its hard but I'm determined to start running again. I loved running. I go to therapy to talk about all my bad experiences so I try to keep any emotional outbursts to a minimum, but holy fuck dude it's hard to keep going when it's this fucking lonely. My fiance is out of the country, his best friend/my (nonblood) brother is out of the state, my siblings are on the opposite side of the country, and my roommate/(nonblood) brother is here obviously but I can't keep just hanging out with him and crying about the same problems. I don't know what to do and I keep crying and I feel so awful about my existence.

I feel like life is in a loop of work, eat, sleep, and it feels so empty sometimes. I just wish I had other people I had a deep connection to where I can make plans, celebrate my birthday with them, a surprise party maybe- I dunno! I turned 21 this year and no one wished me a happy birthday aside from the few mentioned here. And even then, no one wanted to see me anyway.",lonely,I'm so lonely and I just wanna know why (21F),2019-07-06 09:13:53
1624,youarenothing,1562367462,8,"I’m 29M. I’m a full time shift worker so my sleep/wake cycle is completely fucked and I’m almost never, ever free on weekends or evenings because of the nature of my job. Because of this, I’m usually only free during random weekday mornings, and most people my age have regular day jobs so I don’t really have people to hang out with. I’ve never had many friends to begin with. During my years at university I made maybe 5 friends at most, and unfortunately none of the friendships were close. I’ve also never had a romantic relationship of any kind. I tried to remain in contact with some of my uni friends on and off for a few years but all those connections gradually faded. I’m not friends with anyone at work. We’re ‘friendly’, as professional acquaintances should be, but there’s not a single person I could describe as a friend. On top of this, the kind of job I have involves working by yourself without needing to spend much time interacting with anyone (that’s part of the appeal of the job for me due to my social anxiety and social awkwardness, to be honest). Basically I’m in a situation where I’m in my late 20s, depressed, very lonely, and don’t have very many opportunities to meet and connect with other people. Besides, most people around my age or older are married, have kids, etc., so I don’t come across a lot of people with free time just to hang out with some socially awkward loner who’s almost 30. The whole socially awkward thing I’ve got going on is downright off-putting at my age, where it might have been somewhat cute and endearing in my teens when I actually had a decent circle of friends. I always thought I’d grow out of it, but I didn’t. There are so many things that happen in my life where I find myself just wishing I had someone to talk to about it, or some friends to share experiences with. Unfortunately I feel like that ship as officially sailed. I can’t even imagine a plausible scenario in which I’m ever going to have a close friend again. What bizarre sequence of events would have to happen for someone to end up developing a close connection with *me*? I’m not interesting, I’m not funny, I’m not attractive. It’s almost laughable to think about someone ever being like “u/youarenothing is my best friend” in this lifetime. Forget romantic relationships— I’ve officially given up on that. If I can’t even make a friend, what are the odds that anyone could ever push past that and actually fall in love with me? Virtually impossible. That’s why I’m now just focused on the lack of friends. That’s what keeps me up at night. It can’t be normal for a person to have literally no friends at all... Conventional wisdom says *everyone* has friends, right? Guess that’s concrete evidence my life is a monumental failure. 

Anyway, just wanted to vent. Don’t have anyone to talk to about this, so thanks for taking the time to read this! I hope you’re having a good day over there, wherever in the world you are :)",lonely,It’s officially gotten to the point where I LITERALLY have zero friends.,2019-07-06 08:57:42

A week or so ago, I was depressed, and miserable, I'd never felt so alone in my life. Recent events had left me rather socially isolated, but not anti social. So, using my alt I recently posted on a sub designed to find friends and relationships a self-deprecating and what I thought at least, a humorous post asking for some friends. I was really hoping to find someone to share a few laughs with, nothing more. I had a few responses, shared a few messages, but nothing really came of it on the first day.

The next day, I was sitting down, busy doing nothing when the fabled red envelope lit up on the browser, a message had arrived from a beautiful girl, obviously - and purely for science - I checked her posts, and she was so far out of my league it's scary, but hell what's the harm in chatting? So she and I spoke for a few hours, which seemed to pass in 10 minutes. It was the first real conversation I've had in 5 years. I pretty quickly realised she's not only beautiful, she's sassy, intelligent, caring, thoughtful,kind, and we kinda got each others sense of humour.

Since then we've spoken daily, she rings from work just to tell me she's missing me and to hear my voice, this shit has never happened to me before. We share the minutiae of each others lives, I've told her things I have carried for much longer than I should have, and she's done the same. It feels I've known her for decades and not days, and to top it all off she's the sexiest woman I've ever met. I cannot begin to explain the difference this person has already made to my life, but it's fair to say she's completed me. She just popped up on Skype to say she's on her way soon from work and we can chat. 

I'm a 51 year old guy whose been round the block. I've been lonelier over the last 5 years than I have ever been. Last week I've met someone who puts colour into my life. So there's hope people, please don't just sit here and tell each other how lonely we all are. Make an effort, do it today, to go and post on a sub for friends/ relationships /r/r4r /r/needafriend and I'm sure there's dozens more.

So I should start off by explaining that I'm a freak. I only have one proper friend, not from lack of trying but I guess that's how it turned out. I'm antisocial, I don't go out much, usually cause I'm either ignored and left alone anyways, or from lack of interest. Throughout my life I've stuck to reading, studying music alone, writing stories and building up these worlds, literally anything to keep me occupied. I'm into a lot of geek and nerd stuff, and I really really go into depth on them, but I've always found it hard to keep a conversation going with people who don't share similar interests

A lot of stuff has been going on with my life recently, including school trouble, girlfriend makes me feel like a nobody to her most of the time, lots of fighting in the family as well as sickness, working a hard job that barely pays, and a bunch more. I'm only 18 and I've gotten used to keeping these sort of things bottled up, it's not normal for me to go out and vent on others cause that's not me, but lately, I've just had no drive at all. I've been losing interest in the stuff I liked doing, I'm tired all the time, and I've been losing my head knowing I've got no one to love and no one who loves me back. I've been feeling like this since as far as when I was still 13, the feeling just comes and goes but it hit really hard and I just wanted to vent a bit.

Long story short, but she was being really nice to me and stuff, so a while back I asked her out, and that went surprisingly well all things considered. I sorta did not know how to continue, (I have asperges or something, so I really suck at this kind of thing) but I eventually got back into it and asked her to the prom. She refused, because she was already with a friend, but said that “she otherwise would have loved to go.” 

Eventually, I confessed my feelings to her, but it came out wrong, and probably made her feel uncomfortable, she also said she did not feel the same way. Obviously I was a little upset and did not talk with her for a while, but eventually, I accepted it, and I tried reaching out, just to be friendly, because I do enjoy her company, and am quite lonely. This takes me to yesterday, where we went to Starbucks and hung out for a bit. I say it went pretty well, and I did have fun, but it was rather short, and when I followed up with a text she never responded. I honestly understand why and am not mad, but I do feel upset. I thought I was being friendly and to feel completely abandoned is not a nice feeling.  

I am currently desperately lonely, I have hobbies, I am going to uni in a few months but I really have no friends. One of my aqunetnces at school reached out and asked me if I wanted to play D&amp;D, which is really nice, as it is something I have always wanted to do, but never had any friends to do so, but I don’t know when, if ever that is happening, so it is really not enough. I am desperate to send a message to the girl I was with, saying i’m sorry and I just want to be friends but I know that is just guilt tripping, and that I really shouldn’t.   

What should I do? Keep focusing on hobbies? I feel like I should get a job, but it is quite inconvenient right now, and I really don’t have much inspiration to do so. I desperately want to get some friends but I have zero idea how, everyone from school I know, has ‘abandoned’ me as usual. I have tried making online friends, but it is not enough. Is Meetup any good? People say friendships last forever, but I have not had one last longer than a year, for as long as I can remember. I know I need to fix this now.

1656,XSkynettX,1562337715,1,"Soo, despite the fact that I hate to start off with this I kinda have to, my wife and I of eight years just divorced a little over a month ago. We were never perfect and making the relationship work was a huge strain on both of us for very different reasons. The months leading up to our Separation were hard for me, first we spoke of polygamy and I did my best to support her by guiding her through her new crushes and offering what advice I could to help her make things work, all while trying to process and just kinda slowly dying on the inside. Next she started reconnecting with a friend from her hometown and not technically lying to me or being dishonest but also not telling me she had really started liking him and planned to move in with him as soon as we were over. Either way, we mutually decided that neither one of us despite absolutely loving each other could try to fix our shambled broken marriage any longer.

Now.. my ex wife for all her flaws is an amazing and fantastic woman who has changed my life in so many positive ways that I will forever be grateful. As much as it kills me to know she’s with someone else I am so proud of her for making advances in her life that she needed. I still love that woman, a bit differently now that all this pain has happened but if this new boyfriend treats her right then I have nothing but love for that man as well. We’re still friends and talk a few times a week. ( I’m kinda low key coaching her through her new relationship because she’s just as much a mess but couldn’t find it in herself to stay single and work on herself like I’m struggling to do. )All I’ve ever wanted and fought for was her happiness. So please do not speak ill of my ex wife if it can be avoided. She doesn’t deserve it, I would let you know if she did.

Now to my dilemma. I’m alone, in a different state than her and I haven’t been single in over 10 years.  I do a pretty good job of working through my emotions (for a man. Lol jkjk ) the usual random bouts of crying at everything that even remotely touches my soul on a personal level, scrolling tinder, thinking I know what I want even though I can’t muster enough actual energy to being the dating process right now, .... you get the idea.

I’m so lost on a day to day basis, I’ve started new hobbies and have reconnected to as many old friends and new friends as possible. I’m going to be getting a manageable pet (Bearded Dragon) so I can give something what little actual love I can muster right now, and hopefully have myself a little buddy to help me feel better, maybe even talk to, idfk. 

I just feel hollow, there’s this woman I’ve been talking to and I’m super into her but I’m questioning wether or not it’s real or if I’m just trying to fill this void as quickly as possible with the first thing that comes along. I’m obviously more into her than she is me and am gonna speak to her about it Sunday when we both have time to figure out what she’s looking for. 

I guess I’m just looking for a friend, or a few friends, or someone to talk to about life shit so I can get all this out of me, or 50k people to talk to who all know exactly where I am because they’re either there or they have been before.

If you’ve made it this far thank you for reading this long ass rant/cry for help. Would love to hear from some of you and maybe start chatting regularly.  I’m curious if anyone has any real good coping mechanism they can share for being lonely as fuck that have helped them get through rough times.

I keep to myself and never engage in anything i don't have feel as if i need to. I prefer to be alone but that comes with its own issues as i am human and do need to socialise on some way. Even if that's only a few times every so often, but I'm not prepared to make friends irl or go out anywhere. So i use reddit to fill that void as best i can.

All I'm looking for is someone to talk with, you don't even have to mean anything you say at all its just enough for me that you talk about anything at all. Just to hear someone else's thoughts other than my own is refreshing sometimes.

There are reasons to the way i live of course there are, i have my own issues and problems that come up everyday. I just accept them, sometimes it doesn't make it any easier though. I don't leave my home unless I'm going  somewhere on schedule that i do every other week, month or year. I don't go to the movies or to party's or anywhere remotely similar. I do go for long walks in secluded places, forests, quite fields etc, I find places like that comforting and friendly   

I may come off weird or quirky maybe even awkward and if that's a problem for you that's okay many people just ghost me after that i accept it and move on. Sometimes i might not respond for a while but i will at some point and i won't ghost you its not my way. So if this is all something you can deal with or are like this yourself i would appreciate your help.

When it comes to long term conversations I'm not so sure on all that, I've never done them. I'm never asked for one or the other has stopped talking to me. So i have no experience there.

1676,ItMakesMeWonder4,1562295677,1,"I've been wanting to say this for years, and to be totally honest with myself. Self reflection is hard. 

I've always been a shy introvert from my earliest memories. Even while having people around me I often feel lonely. Some of my problems are self inflicted because I can be stubborn and shut down, but I've been working on that. For a long time I was very immature because I was never allowed to do anything and lacked social skills or even picking up social cues. 

Growing up I always had friends, but it seemed like I had to put in all the effort to be with them. This was the same for elementary, middle, and high school. My mother was remarried in middle School, but by this time I decided I was going to be my own man because I was tired of being let down. My father never really wanted anything to do with us, and my mom dated some pretty shitty human beings that left a bad impression on me. We moved to a new area in high school, but I decided I was tired of moving and made four years of hell for myself because I acted out and didn't really make an effort to make friends. I was angry. The funny thing is that I regret not allowing my step Father in my life when I was younger because he treats and loves me as if I was his biological son. I'm grateful for him now and even apologized, and I now realize how rare this type of love and acceptance is from a step parent. 

I didn't start dating until college, and it was very hard for me to meet people. I've been told that I'm decent looking, always smell good, and have a good sense of humor. I was the guy that once he had a girlfriend, you wouldn't see me until we were fighting or broke up. So, I missed many things with my friends and they seemed to have moved on. I was eventually engaged, but that fell apart, which devasted me for over two years. 

I eventually was married, but we had problems from the start, most of which were because I tried to hide the fact that I'm a shy introvert. I pretended to be someone that I was not. I do not like confrontation and will try to avoid it at any cost  I usually make a joke about the situation and hoped it will go away. We moved to her hometown for work and to work on our marriage. The promise of working on our marriage is the only reason I agreed to move.  And because things fell apart; I hate living in this area, even though it is beautiful and has many historical aspects. I have children and am a divorced father with custody, but I am very lonely. I work for a religious organization that is very conservative. If i date or met somebody, my job is in jeopardy because I have a morality clause in my work contract. I would still like to meet someone, even if were just for conversation. 

I've been through counseling to work through these problems and have made great progress. I even realized that it wasn't just my faults that caused the marriage to break down. I also dealt with childhood incidents that still bothered me. I even went on anti depressents for a few years, but they only worked so well. I refuse to take them now because I believe they do more bad than good. 

I have a bad have of telling inappropriate jokes or stories at the wrong time. This has always bothered me because I'm not sure why I do it. I finally realized the reason I did this was because I was lonely or depressed and just wanted to be heard. I told my friends this and they were very understanding because they know I'm not really like that. 

I do realize that I have many good qualities. I've been described as a loyal friend, kind, generous, funny, and family oriented. But with all of this, I sit alone for the most part when my kids are gone. I'm lonely and desire friendship and more.",lonely,I've always felt lonely,2019-07-05 13:01:17

The loneliness gets stronger and stronger until its feels like someone has punched a whole in my chest. All the while in my normal day to day life I keep up the act. I'm sociable, I hangout, I crack jokes, people laugh, I get invited to more stuff. But when I come home the loneliness just crashes into me like a ton of bricks.

So I go online, and I get more desperate, even more overt. I make post where I pretty bluntly say ""I just want to feel something with someone"", though I still may be on the ""want to learn about sex"" post as well. Those post arn't a lie, i mean them when I post them. I really do want to have a friendship with a woman with a strong sexual component of her helping me to get comfortable. As the days go by I get more desperate as the lonely feelings grow stronger. I watch porn more and more each day. I don't really enjoy it at this point. I'll be joining discord servers that are sexual in nature, I'll be replying to post on r4r I'll be messaging basically anyone who will have a conversation with me.

Then one of 2 things will happen.

1)I find someone to be sexual with, do it once maybe twice, they of course generally feel used cause by the time I find something its like 3 or 4 am for me and the second I ""finish"" all the stimulation is gone and I'm about to crash (normally im in bed by like midnight). So I don't really get to know them cause they don't want to continue talking. who can blame them. Eventually I feel so ashamed of what I'm doing online with people that I delete all my accounts and try to stop the behavior.

2) I get off and feel horrible and alone and tell myself I'm never doing this again. I feel so ashamed of what I'm doing online with people that I delete all my accounts and try to stop the behavior.

I then at this point realize that devoid of the burning desire to get off, that I still believe the things I original believed about sex, and that I don't want to continue this behavior. I started going to a 12 step group for sexual addictions, got a sponsor, and try to attend (no meetings near me so its hard for me to get there). Also keep talking with my therapist about it. Eventually I feel so stressed and alone that I end up starting all of this behavior over again. The cycle might last 2-5 days, it might last 1-3 months. Never seem to know. All I know, is I feel really REALLY damn alone.",lonely,I'm so damn tired of the cycle of unhealthy behavior and self hate,2019-07-05 11:08:21

We made each other laugh a lot &amp; he’d talk a lot about his personal life &amp; all about his country, etc. He just always made sure there was never a dull moment between us. He would wait with me everyday after school for my dad to pick me up, he taught me how to play pool, he took me to parks he loved, &amp; he was about to take me on a cruise &amp; an arcade. We would always stare into each other’s eyes, &amp; it made me feel comfortable. I liked him &amp; I felt as if he liked me back. I have other friends, but none of them wanted to hangout with me as much as he wanted to, it made me feel so loved. He even told me that he wanted to see more of me when I was about to go home when we last hung out. Instant butterflies in my tummy.

On Monday, he texted me asking when I was available to hangout with him &amp; have coffee together. I told him either Thursday or Friday, &amp; he said it was okay. We talked a little bit after that. On Tuesday at 9 pm, he asked me how I was. I answered at 10 am on Wednesday though. From that moment on, I never heard from him again. He usually replies back very fast. Or if he takes long to reply, he’ll ensure me it was because he had work. 

He has never took so long to reply. It’s been like two days since I last heard from him &amp; I’m starting to get worried. Maybe he doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore? Maybe he needs space? Maybe he lost his phone &amp; can’t get in touch with me? Maybe he’s dead? Not gonna lie, I’ve been thinking about the last possibility last night, I even cried at the thought of him being dead... He usually hangs out with his friends late at night a lot. I’m scared if he got murdered or something. Fuck...

It doesn't have to be a good one and you don't need to do more than basic stuff. Sure, not all bands will be accepting someone with basic skills, not all are that friendly/nice, etc. But with some patience and practice if you can find one that is nice and meets more or less once a week it'll be pretty cool.

I've always been an introvert and I'm no music prodigy. But I've been doing this for a long time and regret nothing. Reaaaally slowly it has improved my confidence, music hability and the best of all, my social group. Some of the people I've known this way I consider friends or even close friends.

I've been using Whisper for over 5 years since I broke up with my first and last long term relationship, and luckily there are nice people on there to talk to if you're going through something but for the most part it's just horny men hounding after vulnerable women. 

I was born and raised in Worcester, MA and I never really had friends. I did have a circle in high school but some weird drama thing happened where we were all pitted up against each other and no one talked to each other since. I did have one friend but he always hung out with other people and put them before me. College was even worse. Only one guy talked to me and all he'd ever do was talk about his girlfriend. It's not that I didn't try to make friends but it was one of those Catholic/party colleges and I felt out of place since I wasn't into sports or church and there weren't any clubs or organizations I was interested in to join. Basically if you took everyone on Tinder and put them all in one place, that was my school. 

The last time I was happy was last month. I met a guy when I was on vacation in Sweden and we connected right away. He said he was alright with a long distance relationship but of course by the time I went back home, he just didn't have feelings for me anymore. Guess I can't blame him— if it's not there, it's not there. But still, never met anyone like him before and he just made me so goddamn happy... I've always wanted a real, non-toxic relationship but I guess it's just not in the cards for me. No one has ever been interested in me where I live and there's no where for me to go to meet people since I'm afraid to go out on my own. There's a lot of stabbings in Worcester.

My real life ""friends"" talk a lot behind my back. I just wanna know what's wrong with me so I could fix myself. They are often hanging out together but they never invite me. They say all those mean things with or without knowing they are hurting me.

I was bullied in elementary school and sometimes in the middle school too but I didn't care. I prentended I wasn't hurt but cried myself to sleep.

I've hurt too many people, I just wanna cut and feel their pain. It would be better if I wasn't alive. I wish I could learn how to be a good person. No matter what I try to do, it will never be enough, I will never be enough.

I realised I've never had anyone who I could talk about anything and would be there for me. I've never had anyone I could truly be myself with. My ""friends"" say I'm too negative and cold. And yeah, it's true.

Maybe i'm just seeking for attention because my life isn't that bad. I know a girl who cuts and told my mum about her. She knows her family and said that she's only seeking for attention because her life is going great.

That's why I must be seeking for attention too. I should be happy with my life and I think I am but the thing is I really hate myself; the way I look, the way I act... everything. I hate my personality. There's no single thing I'm good at.

1728,SimilarYogurtcloset,1562226088,4,"Just thought I'd write this down somewhere because I've been trying to sleep for the past few hours but this is all I can think about. I figured this is a good subreddit to vent to. I just need to get this out to someone. 


I never had a lot of friends. The only friends I have are coworkers. I have two coworkers I'm really close with. These two are best friends, and I know they both consider me a really good friend as well. They are the only people I know that feel I could ask to hang out with. 

Some backstory
2 weeks ago I decided to reach out and ask if they wanted to do something with me after work. They both agreed and both seemed excited. This was the first time I ever actually hung out with someone. We ended up getting ice cream, but it was really awkward for me. I felt like I was the 3rd wheel. I was just sitting there eating ice cream and occasionally adding comments in. I tried to include myself, but it was difficult since they were talking about girl stuff, and I'm a guy so I can't really relate. It wasn't that I was being awkward or anything. I just didn't know how I can include myself in the conversation. Afterwards, I sent both of them a message saying I had a good time (just to be nice) and said I would like to do something again sometime. I honestly want to give another chance. 

Well, it seems like neither one of them wants to do something with me. When I ask if they are interested, they would reply with ""okay"" or ""of course"" or some general response. I can never get a solid answer from either of the two because it seems like they are avoiding an answer. 

What has been upsetting me now is the 4th of July. About a week ago, I asked one of them if they were interested in seeing the fireworks with me. She said she was busy with work (she has a second job) and won't be able to. Fair enough. I believed her. 
Well, I just found out that the two of them are hanging out after work on the 4th. When I asked her what her plans were, she said that they are going to get food and then she's not sure what else they will do. I honestly think they are going to see the fireworks. She is intentionally not telling me about them because I asked before. I am also assuming that they are going with some other coworkers as well since they are part of a group that hangs out all the time. 

This has made me feel horrible about myself because I am being excluded from this. These two people are the only people in my life that I feel are close enough to want to do things with me, and I lost that. I have no one. I just don't know what to think anymore. I value the friendship I have with these two so much, and this upsets me that they don't want to hangout with me. I just want someone I can spend time with.

And it's not that they don't like me. They talk with me all the time at work. They intentionally want to go on breaks with me. It just seems like they don't want to do things outside of work with me anymore. I just feel like I have no one in my life that wants to spend time with me.",lonely,I feel like no one wants to hang out with me,2019-07-04 17:41:28
1729,pillboxhat,1562224888,1,"Over and over, this subreddit talks about how hard it is to be lonely. Ok I get it, some of you all have no friends, some of you all get absolutely no attention from your preferred sex, and I know that sucks- but what about the other side?

Imagine the only thing going for you is men wanting to use you as a cum dumpster. Being sweet to you at first, telling you all you want to hear just to lay with you. Now imagine this happening 10x. You build this relationship up, sleep with them then vamoos! Ghost! Houdini! Then they reappear over and over and because you're so lonely you succumb to their wants and wishes and believe it will be different this time. It's not. It's the same. You're fucked and used, disposed of like trash. You didn't even orgasm but you did this just to be close to another person but you soon realize no one will ever love you or want to love you because all you are is human trash. Where is our support?

I'm mentally ill and yeah I'm bangable but I'm not lovable. No one wants me and all my life, even by family I've just been tossed to the side like trash. Everyday is a constant battle of if I'll kill myself today or tomorrow. Who knows? 

I'm sad. We're all sad. Just because your loneliness is different than mine doesn't mean people like myself don't feel alone.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I’m a really extroverted person, I’m comfortable small talking and telling funny anecdotes to strangers in any social or business situation and will directly approach people in bars or at conferences etc.  But, I have no real friends and internally I’m really lonely. 
I’m 46 and when younger it was easy as everyone was shallow. Now I have kids and grown up, I realise didn’t really form any deep connections with anyone other than two very close buddies, one who ran off with my wife and one who moved away (3hrs journey). 
I am happily married again, but my wife also has very few friends.  Her closest friend also moved away, another fell out with her, and her sister emigrated. 
We are really struggling with loneliness as a family. We have loads of causal acquaintances other mums and dads neighbors colleagues etc but they all have good existing friendships.  We volunteer in community projects and I have lost count the amount of times we’ve been turned down when trying to get people to come over or go out for the weekend or go to a bar.  We get play dates for the kids but it’s drop &amp; run for the parents.   
We both work full time so miss out on the afterschool mums thing too.

when i was young, all my neighborhood friends hung out with each other and excluded me even though they included my sister... so when i started elementary school i thought i would have a fresh start, but it was the same way... then i tried again in middle school, had the same result... same with high school! i can safely say that i have no friends besides my older sister.

i always thought it was me... my appearance, ethnicity, being too skinny or too fat, my personality, my energy... i really can’t pinpoint anything! every time i ask my older sister... she says that i am better than most people she’s met but also feels that i am different with her than i am with other people, i just don’t know what it is! i went to a therapist and after 2 sessions i stopped bc i felt like i was just venting to her and not leading anything! i will admit that i have a bit of social anxiety but still consider myself an extrovert! i have had friends here and there, but they don’t last... longest i had friends was 6 months. 

now that i am going to be in college... i really want things to work out, even small things like being invited to a party (which i never have been) to going out on a date (again never have done), to ultimately finding a “group”.

Most of the other interns here quickly cliqued up and I never found my place. So now I spend every evening in my apartment alone wondering why I care so much and feeling isolated and rejected.
I know that this is not an uncommon experience 
I haven’t felt like this since High school. All I really want is one person that I feel like I can trust and really be myself with. I haven’t found that here. 
I’ve been waiting years for this day. Counting down the minute until I could finally go out wherever I want and have the time of my life. It’s here now, and the few friends I care about are 800 miles away and can’t afford to come visit me.
So tomorrow I’m going to get mimosas in the morning alone. I’m getting a mani pedi alone. Probably going to dinner alone. And then going out alone. 
I’ve been casually seeing this guy. I can’t find friends but there’s always Tinder I guess. Just another warm body to make me feel a little less empty inside, at least for the moment. But he knew we weren’t going to fuck tonight and he ignored my texts. I just wanted somebody to share a bed with.  
The guy I wish I could be with just got on a plane today back home to England. I always want what I can’t have. The only guys I ever met that I truly connected with live 1250 and 3000 miles away from me. It’s torture. 
My life is weird. On paper and officially my life is great. I get to travel a lot, I excel in school, I’m getting all the opportunities I could hope for.... but I’m not happy. I’m depressed. Most days I’m either working or laying in bed. It’s the only place I feel safe.
I keep waiting for the day that everything falls into place. I’ll meet an amazing group of girlfriends so accept me and hype me up. Girls who want me around and make sure I know it. And a guy who truly values me. But idk if that’s realistic anymore. 
I’m trying to love myself and be happy with just me. But I don’t know how. I look for happiness and acceptance in other people. I wear my heart in my sleeve and rarely hide how I feel. It’s crushing to tell someone that you feel alone, and for them to not seem to care at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally worked up the courage to tell the person what gift I made for her. Because Spotify playlists are really long (and long links just so happen to be a pet peeve of mine), I shortened it on [bit.ly](https://bit.ly). Also, it worked out well because I could just tell her what to write over the phone and the link also had a sweet message. I don't want to suck my own dick or anything but I thought my gift idea was a sweet thing to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she would be out with family so she wouldn't get a gift from her friends and I've done this playlist idea for someone I had a crush on but before I could show them (my plan was that we would go out on a date and if it went well, I would give her a CD. It's cheesy as fuck but she was into that kind of things)  things went pretty sour and I wasn't able to tell her about it. 

  
Well, during the phone call, she kinda seemed...not as happy as I expected. I don't know how to word this properly but I can't help but feel she didn't really appreciate it at all. This isn't the first time I really tried hard to think of something sweet to do for a gift and it didn't go exactly how I would like. Maybe she just has a monotone voice, maybe she just tired, but when she finally typed up that link and saw what it was, she told me, ""oh, this seems cool. I'll like it so I can listen to it later"". It's not the worst response, but it's just messing with me how...not interested she sounded.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. Maybe she actually really loves it. Maybe I sound like an /r/niceguys for expecting more for something she didn't even ask for. It just made it feel so down and not even try to meet new people. If someone made this type of gift for me, Jesus, I'd owe my life to them. It proved to me something I always thought about myself. If I try to give 110% into being nice and cool, other people can give 10% and still have more success than me and it's such a frustrating feeling to go through. Maybe I should've seen this coming, just today before I gave her the playlist, she wanted my opinion on someone she thought was thought was attractive so even before anything so I already didn't have a good feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just disappointed in myself mostly. She never asked to have this gift and never acted like she needed anything. I'm disappointed in myself because I knew this was coming to me from my last post.",lonely,Update For My Gift To a Friend,2019-07-03 15:07:48

1799,Oscar454star,1562121385,2,"For anyone who’s struggling with depression, low self esteem, /suicidal thoughts (myself included) often knows what it feels like when comparing yourself to other people’s misfortunes. Yes while it is true that most people do have to worse or better than someone else and they feel like they should be ashamed for feeling depressed based off of their current situations right???

FUCK THAT SHIT!!! 

Depression isn’t some on and off switch someone can just mindlessly control. It doesn’t matter how your life is going, rich or poor it will always screw you over regardless of how your situations are. Yes people will always have shittier lives than you, BUT that doesn’t you should compare yourself to someone else’s struggles, All you can do is empathize and be kind to others. *IT’S NOT A GODDAMN RACE TO SEE WHO SUFFERED THE MOST* *EVERYONE* struggles with some kind of pain be it emotional, mental, or physical we all go through our own hardships in life whether if we like it or not. Your struggles are *NOT* something to brag about to others or to put down people who aren’t in the same exact position as you. You can have a lot of friends, have tons of money, a car and a family but you still suffer from depression. Materials don’t make people happy. Don’t let someone else’s misfortunes be apart of your suffering as well. All we can do is push each other forward step by step and hopefully get the help we need to survive and thrive. And just remember you are *NOT* personally responsible for anyone’s happiness if they are using their traumatic experiences just to bring you and yours down.

1801,hamartiated,1562117576,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

One time we were on a bus on our way back from a school trip and all the lights were turned off because people were trying to sleep and it was 11 at night. She put her head on my shoulder and turned her head and whispered in my ear “promise me you won’t freak out”. I was really confused but I said yeah. She moved her hand down my arm to my hand kept going until she met my pants.

I’ll spare you the details, but I got a Blow job from her. We never talked about it and just kept quiet about it. We still talked normally like we always would, until I got a girlfriend (now ex). When she saw me holding her hand she gave me this almost disappointed look. After I walked my gf to class I went to find her. She said while trying not to cry even though I saw a tear roll down her cheek “really? After everything, you pick her? Really?” And then walked away and she hasn’t talked to me since…

I didn’t know, I thought it was a stupid decision she made because she was horny or something. I didn’t know…trust me, all she had to do was say the words and I would gladly taken her in my arms but then again I probably should have asked…

We (my best friend, my second eldest brother, my eldest brother, and myself) were playing Uno and having fun, and my eldest brother (who is about eight or so years my junior) kept calling me school shooter throughout the game. I ignored it initially, not easily, but I did. But he just kept calling me it. It got to the point where I was already frustrated with the game and sick of getting called school shooter, so I just said ""Stop calling me that. It seriously isn't funny."" So, what would any good older brother do in this situation? He called me it again. So I said ""Dude, it's not even funny."" Then my second eldest brother chimed in and mumbled ""School shooter"".

At first my best friend and I thought it was this really creepy stalker we knew and we thought we was back and somehow snuck inside his place while we were hanging out. So immediately got worked up think something real bad was about to happen. My best friend told me he was shaking and didn't feel comfortable in his own home (this was before he realized it was ketchup and I was still left in the dark on most of what was going on). So later on I messaged the two other friends and I explained why I was upset and how he reacted and all of that and that they should be more considerate and know exactly what they are doing to who. I was being nice and I wasn't yelling or anything but apparently that made ""spiteful and pathetic"".  No one bothered telling me much of anything other at the beginning so I didn't really know what was going on and I was thinking the worst. So I had to apologize for showing concern for my best friend.  This is really bothering me more than it should but I can't help it. I don't want to lose any friends but after their response I feel like I don't matter much to them.  So I don’t know....I guess I ended doing harm without meaning to do so.  If either of you two read this don't talk to me please. Just go away and leave me alone and you won't ever have to deal with me again I promise.   I'm posting this cause I have no one I feel like I can talk too and I just need to vent.

However I still have very few friends and whenever I do try to make friends with others such as classmates or coworkers , I really struggle. I always try to keep a smile on my face through everything and say what’s up to people I know when I see them, ask them how it’s going etc. But very rarely do my peers engage in conversation with me first.. usually ignoring me if I don’t say something first.

Maybe this belongs in depression or anxiety board but I thought right now it's the loneliness that hurts me the most. After I got out of highschool I went to college but dropped out due to drug issues as my friends (or maybe me) aren't the best influences. After I went to rehab and decided to get sober I had to cast away all the friends I'd had. Since then I just feel like it's impossible to connect to people. The loneliness and inability to connect with others makes me feel worthless. I just want to talk to someone, to make a real friend again. Idk if this post will change anything is better than feeling this way.

Seems like all the women I’m attractive to either have a boyfriend or just aren’t attracted to me at all. Never had a girlfriend either. I don’t think I’m unattractive, not super attractive but I’m at least a 6 or 7. I’m getting over it. It’s stupid that I want a girlfriend so bad, but I’ve never had one and seeing literally all of my “friends” in a relationship makes me feel like I absolutely need one. I know that is a silly thought, but even if I don’t end up liking having one at least I know and won’t want another one so bad. Oh ye and I’m still a virgin and I’m 21.

1841,The_Lone_Musician,1562037830,2,"At this point, it isn't even the depression that is ruining me; it's the loneliness. I feel lonely 24/7, and I feel as though I'll always be that way. I feel like I'm too ugly and simply not good enough for somebody to love me. I feel like nothing I can do will make me appealing to girls or guys or anybody. I feel trapped in my isolation and loneliness, as well as a prisoner of my own mind. It's a mentally taxing and miserable existence. It's hard to enjoy things when there's nobody there to enjoy then with. The best way to describe loneliness, which I got from somewhere, is being the thirdwheel in a relationship, but there's no relationship or two other people. That's the best I've ever heard it described. I wish I had somebody to go on dates with, somebody to spoil rotten, somebody to kiss and give all my loving to, somebody to share my deep thoughts with, somebody to take late-night walks with when our anxiety gets the best of us, etc. However, I never had and may never will have that. And let me tell you, it fucking hurts. But I'm sure you guys and gals know what I'm talking about. It's ironic; we are all together in being lonely.

1848,hamartiated,1562030644,4,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

&amp;#x200B;

Some months ago, I felt lonely and made an online friend (F17). Although we aren't great friends, we still talk every so often and sometimes it's about deep issues we have. Her birthday is coming up and I thought it would be a good idea to gift a playlist (since I can't physically gift her anything). I have done something like to for someone else I had a crush on but some personal issues came up and I wasn't able to gift them.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is now that I've been feeling so lonely and she's been so active with other people, I feel as if it wouldn't be enough to make her happy. I know she will say she appreciates it but I'm still scared that deep down, maybe she won't listen to it as much as I hope.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this story isn't about me being lonely since I have a friend to talk to, but then why is it I still feel so lonely? I have to call her later today to tell her about it but my anxiety has been going through the roof. I'm sure what I feel isn't anything special, but I'm so worried that maybe I'm not as attractive enough or social enough and I literally feel unworthy of making her happy, if that makes sense. I know that sounds really ""incel"" of me, but my feelings don't come from hatred like those people, but instead I won't make a person as happy as I could've and I'll feel disappointed in myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe my feeling of loneliness doesn't come from a place of actually being lonely (although I do feel like I have no one to talk to sometimes) but instead, my feelings of being lonely come from a place where I'm not able to make someone as happy as they make me.

I think if you couldn't make any friends in your teenage years or early 20s then you're fucked. The older you get the harder it is to make new friends because most people already have their own friend groups. 

And there's also this stigma against not having friends and being lonely so you also feel ashamed of your situation and try to avoid people. It's a never ending cycle.

Having ""fake"" or bad friends is still better than having nobody at all because at least then you can get to know other people with or through them and you also don't have the problem of not having friends so it's easier to interact and socialise with new and better people. You later can drop these fake friends when you find your people.

I have a couple of people I consider friends but they're dealing with their own issues and it is just not fair to expect them to care about me and my stupid problems.
I also know expecting company to be the magical cure to all of my issues is downright stupid, but sometimes I just wish I had someone to cook to, someone to be with and to feel loved and supported.
I feel drained, both mentally and phisically.

I think it’s important to learn from failure, but I’m having trouble learning from failure for improving in the social area of my life. For context, here’s my background and what my situation looks like in no particular order. I apologize for the length of my post in advance.


Family


My family and I don’t talk to each other. My mother was the black sheep in a physically and emotionally abusive family, and I am her literal bastard son (people generally find me amicable). I mention this because I feel like I inherited my mother’s lack of familial support. My mother raised me by herself on social assistance. She was very strict with me growing up. While we would occasionally go to family gatherings for Christmas, it was always very clear that I wasn’t a part of the family. I can say with reasonable certainty that I felt loved by my mother, even if I didn’t always feel like I liked her. Her family, on the other hand, was another story. Her and my father had an arrangement in which he would not pay child support in exchange for paying for my education should I ever decide to pursue one. So, while we lived in poverty, I would at least have the opportunity to escape it later in life, according to the arrangement.

My mother was not a lazy person. After failing to try to start her own businesses and escape poverty, she decided to get her GED (high school equivalent) and go to university. She got her GED while working full time. I barely ever saw her, but thanks to a combination of hard work and food banks, we had food. She decided it would be better to move somewhere with more opportunity and where I could better hone my French language skills, so she applied to McGill and got in. The plan was that she would leave me with her best friend and their family for the first 6 or so months while she established a home for us in Montreal. She wanted to make sure everything was stable before I moved out to join her. So, she went to Montreal and worked full time while attending university full time. Things were beginning to coalesce. 

Meanwhile, my mother’s family was in contact with my mother’s friend (my current guardian). They were talking about trying to win custody of me in order to take my dad to court for child support. For them, it was a potential payday because my dad’s family is moderately wealthy. The machination was simple, my mother’s family would keep custody of me and pay my mother’s friend and her family for supporting their case to demonstrate my mother was unfit as a parent. My mother’s family were farmers and always put me to work when I was there, so I’m assuming the idea was to essentially use me as labour until the child support ended. 

That situation would have been slightly more preferable to living with my mother’s friend to me at the time. I was a bit of a handful back then, and they responded to me with an iron fist. I would regularly be disciplined with objects such as belts and anything else a person can use to inflict pain. I would be sent to my room without food because I was a fussy eater. I recall trying to eat one of my macaroni art pieces I made in school because I was so hungry once. My friend’s family were strict and unreasonable. I have a fairly odd and specific food allergy to a common type of food. They didn’t believe me the first time we had it for supper and force fed me that food. I immediately lost consciousness. I apparently vomited it up shortly after, and I recall vomiting several times on my way to my room to which I was sent as punishment. They made me clean up my various piles of vomit as soon as I stopped feeling sick from my allergic reaction. It was a tough time for me, and I spent most of it in my room.

In an unlikely turn of fortune, one of my mother’s other friends (mutual friends with her best friend) called my mother and told her about the situation developing. My mother dropped out of university and immediately came home. She would never again have the opportunity to go to university. By this point, her best friend was fairly confident that their avarice-fueled scheme was going to succeed. They denied my mother access to me and informed her of their intentions. My mother agreed to their claim on me, but asked if she could at least take me out for ice cream. They begrudgingly agreed to her request. While out for ice cream my mother asked me about my perspective about living with them. I told her I hated it and didn’t want to go back. She responded that I never have to go back. My mother’s former best friend kept all of my clothes and toys out of spite, and it would be nearly 20 years before I would see any of them again. My mother represented herself and won in court, the. things got markedly better for me.

It was difficult for me growing up with my mother. She didn’t like me having friends over. It was okay on my birthday or on other rare occasions, but I mostly had to go over to my friends’ places to play. This would occasional result in me losing friends. I recall two friends not being allowed to be friends with me because they were not allowed by my mother to come over to my place very often. I guess their parents thought it was an unbalanced relationship, which I can see an argument for. I think it must have been a key time in my social development because it was extremely hard to make friends for me, and it still is hard despite some of the challenge now coming from just being older.

High school was challenging. My mother and I moved out to the country when she rekindled a romance with her former high school boyfriend. He was a nice man but easily dominated by my mother’s strong personality. She kept a strictly ruled house, much—I’m sure—to no one’s surprise. I would be constantly at odds with her. I think it can be difficult for people to communicate and navigate conflict in healthy ways when they come from an abusive family. My only friends in high school were all several years younger than me. We lived in a small town, so there wasn’t much choice, but I would have chosen them as friends anyways. While my classmates were getting drunk and partying, I was playing Nintendo 64 or building tree forts with my younger friends. I wouldn’t realize it until much later, but it was a golden renaissance for me in regard to my social life. However, it wasn’t without challenge. I still wasn’t allowed friends over unless it was a special occasion, and my mother was still quite strict with me. While at a group sleep over for which we’d stay up late playing golden eye and other great games, my mother called my friend’s mother. I accidentally dropped a sock when moving my laundry from the dryer to my room. I immediately had to go home and was not allowed to return to the sleep over. It was still early in day, so my friend’s came by my place to see what was happening. They found me outside cleaning up all of my laundry off the front lawn. My mother was disproportionately upset with me over the sock incident, so she decided to spread all my laundry over the front yard. I was embarrassed to be caught cleaning up my laundry by my friends. 

The final incident with my mother while I was young was just after I graduated high school. I was awoken one day at six in the morning by my step father. He told me that they’ve had enough of my lack of ambition and attitude so they are kicking me out. He told me I had 15 minutes to pack anything I could carry and there was no time for breakfast. There wasn’t much work for me in our small town, so I had almost no money. Not being sure what to pack, I packed what I felt was essential; I had clothes, my stuffed bear, and my piggy bank with nearly $20 safeguarded within its porcelain belly. My step father drove me to the city. It was a long, silent two hours. When we finally got to my maternal grandmother’s house, I was a bit surprised to find out that it was my first and thus far only intervention. I’m not sure what else to call it but a love intervention. My grandmother and step dad sat me down at a table and told me how my lack of ambition and attitude was negatively impacting them. My grandmother asked me if I knew that no one loved me. I did not know that. I asked to briefly excuse myself from the table because it was a long trip and I needed to use the washroom. After briefly breaking down in the washroom, I composed myself and returned to the intervention. They decided it was best for me to leave the family and be on my own. With less than a month since my high school graduation, I wasn’t sure how to best enter the world of homelessness. My mind kept racing trying to develop strategies. I knew that I couldn’t stay in my current city because the winters are so harsh. I decided that I would make my way out west. It was early enough in the summer that I could get there before it started getting cold at night. It wasn’t the best plan, but it was a plan.

To my surprise, my step dad and grandmother agreed to buy me a one-way ticket to anywhere in Canada that I wanted to go. My step grandfather came downstairs and decided he would drive me to the bus depot. While waiting in line at the depot to buy a ticket, my step grandfather got a call on his cell phone. My family reconsidered buying me the ticket and thought I should try to contact my father instead. I talked to my father, he agreed to let me stay with him instead of being homeless. So, I moved out west for a time. It would be about 4 years before I would return to the prairies. 

Fast forward to my adult life back in the prairies. My mother and I would spend more time together and become closer. It was easier for us to get along when we didn’t live together. I was doing okay financially, but I hated my job. I decided that I would go to university. By this point in my life I was moderately close with my mother and a bit distant with my father. Knowing the deal my mother and father had about my education, I approached my father to tell him about my plans for university. He discouraged me from going and welched on his agreement to pay for my education. I had enough money to mostly pay for it myself, but I would eventually lose my job trying to juggle university and work, a loss I have yet to fully recover from. 

It was about midway through my honors degree when life would present some more challenges. My mother, a person whom I would characterize as somewhat unstable, was struck by a bus while crossing the street at a set of lights. She already had an injury from a previous workplace accident, which affected her disposition. But, this bus accident was on a whole new level. She became noticeably more unstable and volatile. She would start shouting at people over the slightest of transgressions, fancied or actual. She would move every two months because she couldn’t maintain relationships with roommates, landlords, or neighbors. Eventually her and I would come into conflict again. 

It was before the fall term when I got her email. The email began with her stating that “they will know what to do with my car when they find it” Not being sure what kind of email I was reading, I paced myself as I continued on. It was mostly a jumbled mess of paranoid ramblings. She charged me with the task of paying for all her upkeep. Her upkeep was seemingly minor such as life insurance and the like, but I still didn’t think it was fair for me to take it on. Apparently, she was living in a storage locker before leaving the city, so she wanted me to sort through and store some of her possessions. By the time I reached the end of the email, it suddenly dawned on me that her and I had a joint account when I was younger. I immediately contacted the bank to try and get info about my account. They wouldn’t give me any, so I had to go down in person. My mother accumulated a considerable amount of debt. The only way I could remove myself from the joint account was to pay it off and close it. So, I withdrew all my tuition from my personal bank account and paid off the debt. I closed the account and got the bank manager’s word that I would no longer be responsible for the account and it could not be reopened. Satisfied that I was financially safe but sad that I would not be able to finish my degree, I left the bank.

Within a day I received a barrage of emails from my mother. She was livid and accusing me of trying to kill her. Using an exhaustive list of colorful insults, she demanded that I reopen the account. It was difficult to read those emails. I decided to eventually respond and express my perspective. I told her what her actions cost me and that my degree meant everything to me. For me, getting a degree was an opportunity to escape poverty. At the time I was doing okay financially, but my job was unstable and I hated working there. She responded to my email by telling me off. A couple of days went by and I hadn’t heard from her. I decided to follow up with the bank because my mother may have had impulse control issues, but she was still quite intelligent and cunning. My fears were confirmed, she somehow got the joint account reopened. I went down to the bank again, and demanded to speak to the manager. The conversation was brief and to the point. I told her that I’ve paid the debt and canceled the account. I reminded her that she gave me her word that the account couldn’t be reopened, and I told her I’ll be taking legal action should any further cost result from her misinformation. She promised to resolve the issue, and to the best of my knowledge it is resolved. I don’t habour any ill will towards my mother. I realize that she’s had a hard life and currently has some behavior regulation issues resulting from what I assume to be prefrontal cortex damage. That being said, I haven’t talked to my mother since that last email I sent her. 

My father is eccentric. He was adopted, grew up relatively poor, but then became moderately wealthy. His perspective on life is a composite of hedonism and delusion. Growing up, whenever I’d see him he would weave fantastical conspiracy stories and tales of his debaucherous existence. And to this day he pursues the same path with the same perspective. I find it challenging engaging with him because of how little he seems to care for others (such as his long term romantic partner). His image is important to him, so lying is a way of life. Sometimes it’s to help people, sometimes it’s to protect his image. I recently tried to reconnect with him and felt foolish for trying. He invited me out to brunch at an upscale restaurant, his treat. When he arrived to pick me up, him, one of his mistresses, and his girlfriend were in the car. I got into the back seat of the car and sat beside his girlfriend. It foreshadowed the next few hours. Conversation was awkward and forced, and the entire time it was obvious that his mistress was flirting with him. She’s a rich and eccentric older woman from Europe who is currently staying with my father and his girlfriend in their house. That was a really weird situation to sit in on, and I regret trying to reconnect with my father.

It’s challenging not having family to turn to for support. There have been several times in my life when I have been on the edge of disaster, and it’s been hard having no familial safety net in case I fall. While I can’t help but want to reach out and repair those relationships, I’m not sure how to at this point or if it’s a good idea. Is something better than nothing?


Friendships 

I’ve been lucky to have some solid friendships in life. But currently, I spend most of my time alone. I try to reach out to friends to spend time together, but everyone is often busy. I find it hard to strengthen friendships because of how busy everyone is with their own lives. I think I’m having difficulty forming or maintaining meaningful friendships for several reasons. The first is because of how I grew up. The second is because I’m an adult and forming friendships is hard as an adult. And the last is that I don’t already have a solid base of friends to work from. I feel a bit lost on how to approach creating friendships, and I also feel like there is a mismatch in expectations between what I think a friendship could be and what my friendships usually are. I would like to have friendships in which I can support them in tough times and celebrate with them in their successes (and I would like similar in return). I would like to have people in my life to enjoy activities with such as playing board games, hiking, going for drinks, and just chatting about life. I think I just want people in my life that I can share my life with and who they can share their lives with me. I can’t tell if I have fair expectations or if those kind of friendships don’t exist. I feel like as I get older friendships get pushed to the back burner and relationships take the forefront. But a challenge I’m having is that it’s hard to not have solid friendships because the other areas of my social life, such as family, are impoverished. I’ve also noticed that not having solid friendships or familial relationships is undesirable to romantic partners. I also think that social life is one of those rich get richer scenarios. If you have people in your life, it’s easier to get more people in your life. So what do you do? Do you keep reaching out and be satisfied with minimal contact with friends? Or do you try to build new friendships in the hopes of finding something solid?


Romantic relationships

I find romantic relationships challenging. There are some very obviously gaps in my life that can be off-putting to partners. My family situation is a bit difficult for partners to accept for long term relationships. My lack of friendships is also off-putting for partners. I feel conflicted about this because I can see my people’s point about wanting to date someone who has solid friendships and a family to spend time with. But, on the other hand, I feel like it’s something I can’t really control and that I shouldn’t be judged for it. I’ve been trying to repair my familial relationships and I’ve been trying to strengthen my friendships, but these things don’t just happen overnight. I’m not sure if it’s fair to date someone longterm because I can’t enrich their lives in the ways I would like to enrich them. I currently don’t have many social resources. I also currently don’t have many financial resources because I can’t find a permanent job. Despite having a bachelors degree, I can’t find a decent paying and permanent job. I make enough to get by on my own, but not enough to get a car or house. Despite these short comings, I do have a lot to offer in the sense that I’m a decent partner (intelligent, funny, creative, romantic, etc). But I can’t offer the basics that people need, specifically social wealth. 

My most recent relationship ended about three weeks ago. We were mostly happy and rarely fought or argued. We’d get into occasional disagreements, but we were always able to talk it out. We knew each other for about 7 years prior to dating m, and we dated for about 1.5 years. We decided to move in together, which was the first time I felt comfortable moving in with someone. I had all my stuff packed and good to go. She came over to help me move my stuff. When she got to my place, it took me a few moments to realize something was off. She said she couldn’t do it, and she wanted to take a break. Everything was fine for her up to two days before the move, but then it hit her that she couldn’t do it. We talked a couple of times after that day. She said she couldn’t see us working out longterm because we aren’t passionate about each other’s interests. She confessed to texting another guy before we broke up on moving day. She also said that the social resource thing was an issue too. She didn’t like the one friend of mine that she met, and wasn’t sure how she felt about dating someone without family relationships. I was devastated and felt powerless. Her and I both enjoy hiking, kayaking, and going out for drinks. We also have fairly similar approaches to life as well as goals and beliefs. But, I didn’t enjoy camping and hockey as much. I went with her camping whenever she wanted and I went to hockey games too. I don’t mind camping but I’m not big on watching hockey. She claims that our relationship was very good, but she just couldn’t do it. I asked her if it was worth throwing away everything because she wanted to date someone who liked camping and hockey, she said yes. 

We’ve recently met for coffee. We were getting along well and it was obvious we still cared for each other, but she said she still feels the same. I’ve decided to move on despite still wanting to try again with her. I’m currently casually dating but I’m running into problems. First, I’m not sure if it’s fair to date someone when I can’t offer them the basics like me having meaningful friendships or family relationships to share with them. Second, I feel like I become so dependent on partners because I don’t have those aforementioned social resources. I make sure to give partners a bit of space while dating so that they don’t feel I’m clingy, but it’s challenging because I usually don’t have anyone else to talk to in my life. I’m not sure if I should be pursuing another long term relationship because of my short comings and because of how devastating it is to lose a partner for me. As challenging as it is to have to go to a partner’s family events for holidays, it’s even more challenging when you lose that and spend holidays alone. I’m not sure I can lose that again despite feeling like I crave the connections I get in relationships to my partner, their friends, and their family. Is it worth trying to build longterm relationships and is it fair to try when I cannot offer certain relationship basics? 


Mental health resources


I’ve been taking advantage of several resources at my disposal. I have access to a counselor through university, but I am about to be cut off because I graduated. Unfortunately, I do not have enough financial resources to go to counseling on my own. My province has a free crisis line that I can call, but they have had to cut me off because I was calling too much. It’s been challenging after my breakup, so I was calling up to twice a day. I was struggling with the sudden loss of my relationship, feeling isolated, and not being able to find steady employment. I currently have exhausted the resources I have access to. I’ve been thinking about saving up for a night course at university so that I can resume therapy. This is another area I feel a bit lost in. What’s the best way you find to get help with limited resources? 


My approach 


One of my friends told me that I should learn to be okay being alone. I don’t know if I can do that, or, perhaps more disconcertingly, if I even have a choice. Lately, my focus has been on bettering myself. I’ve been studying for the GRE (a test to get get into grad school), exercising regularly, and meditating regularly. I’ve been trying to strengthen my friendships and reconnect with family. And I’ve been making financial plans for the future in case I ever get stable employment; I’ve priced out cars, been looking into investing, and have starting looking at owning a home. None of this has made me feel any better. I’m still not sleeping well, and I’ve honestly had to drag myself out to go to work, run errands, attend events (by myself). I manage to compose myself for work and dates so that I don’t come across like how I feel inside, but it seems a bit disingenuous to me. I think about the fake it ‘till you make it phrase, and I’m not sure if it’s effective. Do you think “living your best life” is actually helpful for feeling better or developing a social network? I feel like I’m struggling to find a viable solution to an unsolvable problem. 

In conclusion, I feel like I really don’t have a lot to complain about; I realize that despite some of the challenges I face, I’m still able to put my self out there and meet new people. However, I don’t know if it’s worth it or if I should put myself out there any more. I feel a bit nihilistic in the sense that life seems crazy and chaotic. I feel you either have enough luck to be born into a family with a passible level of functioning, and have people in your life who want to be close to you, or you don’t have enough luck and you just drift through life.

1874,Katlyn07,1562001346,2,"       last night’s dream was a blur of need and nostalgia. jarrett was the main focus, remember him? yes, elementary school jarrett, the one “boyfriend” of yours who didn’t really even count as one. it was sad but funny - we were grown but for some reason he’d bring up the past while looking like a kid (snaggle tooth and all) . he scolded me for never holding his hand, for never hugging him or talking to him like a girlfriend would in fourth grade. 
       i remember crying, feeling the need to get into a “submissive position” and even calling him master when i apologized. i don’t know why my mind turned to that - maybe i was trying to impress him or convince him i could be what he needed.
       i remember laying with him, feeling so small and turning around to face him. as he pulled me closer and i nuzzled into his neck he caressed me in such a comforting way i couldn’t help but cry then too. 

this made me wonder - if i hadn’t been so scared, would he have broken up with me himself, instead of getting his friend to do it one afternoon? would our younger relationship last past march?

if i had hugged him and held his hand would he have told me he was going to eventually move away? would i know where he went? would we keep in touch?

i wonder if he really liked me, if it was my shyness that made him not want me anymore. i wonder that if a friend never pushed him, would he ask me out in the first place? 

if he’d see me now, would he feel the same nostalgia? 

has he ever dreamt of me, like i have of him? even after all these years?

i wonder why my mind wanted to remind me of his presence - why it wanted me to feel even more lonely, even more unwanted.",lonely,"sad, lonely dreams from the past",2019-07-02 03:15:46

1883,robl0t,1561975126,5,"I have experienced one ""real friend"", for a limited time period of my life, and the way it seemed to form seems like basically pure luck. In highschool, freshman year, zero people to talk to, I just moved there, I ask a random person if they are interested in a videogame (tf2). No. Ask again. No. Ask again. No. Ask again, holy shit you like that game too!? Started naming off other shit, literally every single thing in common. The year flew by as I had someone to completely talk to, play games with, and relate to, the first time ever. We sort of drifted apart eventually as he proved to be more socially capable and made friends and was capable of talking to other people easily. He was capable of integrating with the main stream and popular culture, but I digress. It seems, looking back on it, that us ever becoming friends was nothing more than pure and utter luck, and since I no longer have the confidence normally to just straight up ask people if they like something, complete strangers, is there really any hope of ever meeting someone similar? And it didn't feel like it was just common interests that led to that instant friendship, it also had to be supporting personalities and general happenstance that all the stars aligned, and at that very moment of that very day we would both be open to the idea of meeting someone new in real life and playing games together. The chance seems so incredibly miniscule to happen again that it's unreal to even think it happened in the first place. You can always find people with similar interests on the internet, but it rarely works because personalities/other interests and in general a lot of factors.

I have depression and general/social anxiety. I’ve been seeing a therapist but I can never follow through on any of the advice he gives me.

I’ve tried finding a job, but nobody wants to hire me seeing as I don’t have a high-school diploma, and I’m not in education.

I feel so trapped in this house, but the idea of going out and meeting people scares me even more. So I do nothing. I meekly attempt hobbies and fill my days with nothing but escapism.

I feel so abandoned by my family. I’m the youngest of four, and it’s clear that my parents don’t care what happens to me. They pay for me to go to therapy. They see me awake at random hours of the day. They see me never leave the house. They see that I have no friends. But not ONCE have they asked if I was okay.

My mother can't keep a secret to save her life, and anything i tell my brother goes straight to my mother. My father is a drunk who has his moments, but he was never really involved in my life. Not to say he wasn't there. He went to events like sports games and stuff. Its just when we got home stayed in the basement and drank. So i guess i learned to slowly keep everything inside and deal with it on my own. I guess somewhere i just lost trust in everybody. I don't depend on anybody, and don't know it i ever can.

 In short i am lonely for a connection, but can't trust anyone that might give me what I'm looking for. However i believe I'm coming to terms with that myself. I've built up a castle that no one can see into, why should i tear all that down just for a connection?

1901,hamartiated,1561947284,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

3 years into college I was no longer in contact with anyone from my high school.

I made a new close group of friends my freshman/sophomore year of college. By my senior year, I had literally zero friends. Not exaggerating. I had an apartment on canous with 3 random women and most of my memories from my junior and Senior year in college are me locked in my bedroom watching Netflix and drinking wine by myself and holding my piss for as long as possible so I didn't have to confront my roommate and her friends who were always sitting and having fun in the living room to get to the bathroom. I lived in the party town so it was depressing hearing parties every weekend. 

I joined a professional dance team. I had another (not close, but in constant contact) group of friends from that. One of them became my BEST friend. I retired from the team. 3 years later and I am no longer in contact with them.

1912,Cactusssssssssssss,1561932064,5,"Philophobia is the fear of love or of becoming emotionally connected with another person. It shares many of the same traits as other specific phobias, particularly those that are social in nature. And it can significantly impact your life.

**Philophobia** isn't social **anxiety** disorder, although people with **philophobia** may also have social **anxiety** disorder. Social **anxiety** disorder causes extreme fear in social situations, but it's different from **philophobia** because it encompasses a number of social contexts.

how it happened,how it has affected me and how I deal with it (spoilers,I don’t),now I believe this phobia triggered after my first ever relationship ended,I was 14 years old,at first it didn’t really affect me that much,sure I was upset and depressed about it but I didn’t develop an instant phobia,at least I think,maybe the phobia gradually increased as the months went by…I got teased a lot by my classmates,telling me that its all my fault,saying that I was a bad boyfriend and she didn’t see me anything more than a timepass,and things like that…so I think that if the teasing wasn’t that started the phobia then that was certainly the catalyst to the growth of my phobia,and no I don’t hate them for doing what they did,we were all dumb young teenagers…sure they could have thought about how it might affect me, but most teens don’t really think that much when they have the sudden urge to say or do something ,especially when they are around their friends .So no, I don’t hate them or anything,Shit just happens,we just gotta move on…now after my phobia had taken control…which took a few months to happen I guess…my “love life” has become non-existent ,as well as my sexual life which is tied to my love life…is sexual life tied to love life? Idk ,anyway because of my phobia I legit cant even look at a girl let alone speak to one,and whenever that rare moment happens when I start catching some feeling for a girl,my anxiety starts throwing a party inside me,the feeling of liking someone and then trying your damn best to delete your feelings and forget about the existence of that someone...is horrible…and after i've done it,after I got defeated by philophobia like the 3 other times…I feel empty again,its so hard for me to even find someone to like and then having to instantly dislike that someone…it makes me feel…dead.Now as to how I cope with I..as I told you before..i don’t.i just cant,it has already consumed me.Now you could tell to go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist but..there are no professional psychologists in my country and the few psychiatrists that this country has...well you could compare them to the 1950’s psychiatrists that lived in the USA,because mental health is a very new concept in my country.  

The reason I wrote is because I wanted to let it out of my chest, so that you guys know that you are not the only ones suffering from this issue,and im surprised that this issue hasn’t ever been brought up before,not as much as im covering it right now anyway,and also so that other people who are not struggling with this issue know that people like us exist ,so if you know someone you care about who you think might have this issue then try talking to them about it,im not sure if they’ll open up but it’s a good starting point,they will at least know that you know about it and that you gave a shit,and knowing that will make their day much better,even if they don’t show it to you,trust me…..i’d know.

I'm in high school(actually it's technical collage in my case) and I don't understand people at my age. I don't really have any good friends at school. In free time most of my classmates get drunk. Like literally, to be an interesting person to them you just have to do embarresing shit after getting drunk and post video of it on social media. After you do that they will think that you're so cool. 

I have one friend (who used to be my classmate in elementary school and middle school) and we hang out regulary but he's also into stuff that my classmates do (getting drunk, vaping in school bathroom etc.). I asked him why does he do that and he said that he does it because most people do it. Then I asked him if he would do that if it wasn't popular and he said ""probably no"". I get it that people popular things, but what I don't understand is why are these kind of things popular and not something that is actually cool and interesting. 

It's sad that most people would get f*cked up and get in trouble instead if spending good time with friend and eventually drink ONE beer",lonely,I don't understand people at my age (I doubt anyone will read this),2019-07-01 06:23:47

1922,Big-Daddy-C,1561925100,29,"Sorry, I just want to rant

I really don't hang out with my friends that often. I've tried sometimes, but most of the time we only hangout in school and its summer right now.

There was a firework event near where I lived, so I asked a bunch of people if they were going to fireworks. Most of them said ""maybe idk"" which is fair. I took one of my friends there, and we were taking and they asked me what time the fire works are starting. I answered and they said ""because another friend from the group chat asked and no one knew so they just asked to ask me"".

I don't why this hurt me, I assumed maybe it was a group chat for like 3 people or something, but there were quite a few people from our friend group who were in it. I realized that I'm the only one from our friend group not in it. And this isnt like a random friend group, this is like the friend group I've known for years.

Apparently even though I havent hanged out with them almost all summer, they do regular hangouts and stuff. Idk I just feel stupid and I dont know why it bothers me. I just want to hang out and talk to someone",lonely,My group of friends have a group chat and have talked about it in front of me that I'm not in :(,2019-07-01 06:05:00
1923,ZerkerDX2,1561924445,4,"Hi. Over the past year, lots of things happened in my life, i won’t get into details but ill sum it up with this: i’ve lost every single person i used to trust.
My parents are either very distant or simply hating me(and i do mean hate, im not an edgy 13 years old boi)
My gf left me 
and my friends are already keeping me away from any activity they plan or do. i don’t know if it’s intentional but i hope not. 
all of this led to a lot of time thinking by myself, and i overthink a lot which only makes things worst.

i have been lower, but im still hurt from that period of time.



So reddit, with this basic context, please can you help me just get my shit together and go back on track?
i have no one to talk to anymore
they’ve all left

I’ve loved it so much but I’m 30 now and everyone here has paired off and had kids etc. I’m really happy for the people around me but waiting for my time to come has been the most painful experience of my life. And I’m just alone now. I don’t have a problem with my own company but I’m tired of doing things on my own. I don’t really have friends to hang out with anymore and I’m just so lonely. The loneliness is beginning to feel like physical pain and I’m sad all the time. Even when I’m happy I’m sad, does that even make sense?

I’m considering moving back to my hometown to be closer to my family. I have my siblings and nieces, nephews and people I could spend time with.

I have come through a lot in the previous years. Chronic homelessness, addiction, trauma, isolated in a rural area for a long time...etc.  Since moving back to my home state, I've put my all into improving myself and my life. I feel like the missing piece though is friendship. A relationship and love too. 


So when I come home after the week...I desperately just want to hug someone and tell them about my day. Like many other people around me. Instead I end up crying..hoping for that. It's the weirdest thing. It's as if i have no control over it...just automatic tears upon waking. 

Now when I see families, friends or couples.. I just feel confused. It's been years since I've even hugged someone. It all seems so foreign to me.",lonely,Every weekend I wake up crying,2019-07-01 02:08:50

It also seems much harder to find genuine, real people who just want to have a nice time together. Remember going to your friends house...just to see them? No motive or reason other than to enjoy their company? What even happened to that?

Also. Ive learned that as you reach this point in your life, most people are married with families or too busy with work. It becomes very lonely. Its not like you can just call your friend up and go sit at the park for a few hours. I feel starved of that.
