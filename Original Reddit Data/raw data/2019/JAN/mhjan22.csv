0,WhySoGrude,1548939527,1,"I’ve vented to people recently but, while they did respond and try to support me, I feel like they did it just to shut me up (this is one time I’m praying I’m overthinking it).  So, this is my last ditch effort to get my story out:

So, I’m on the spectrum (High functioning Asperger’s) and I was always the outcast/exploited (for intelligence, not trying to be cocky so I’m sorry if I come off that way) person in social groups and I developed social anxiety as a result.  Once middle school hit, I got consistently depressed and developed trichotillomania (like what the one woman had on “My Strange Addiction; hair pulling and consuming which has stuck with me but more so hair twisting and less eating).  My parents, not knowing any better, started punishing me for it thinking I was acting out until my barber of all people diagnosed me due to some reason I’m forgetting now.  As middle school marched on I was admitted to therapy for expressing me wanting to die (and what they didn’t know was I was writing suicide notes in Chinese either because: I meant it but I didn’t have the balls to go through with it or to vent stress and have nobody understand what I was writing).  High school came, Freshman year was me just being depressed all of the time and when Sophomore year came around, I met me (now ex) GF of 3.5 years.  We were in love but one night we got into an argument and she nearly ODd on her depression meds (then my therapist berated me and telling me how bad I was for arguing).  Junior and senior year were slightly better but I started using games, snakes and m*********** as coping strategies (censoring because I’m not sure if it’s allowed, but you can guess what that is).  Freshman year of my college career at SUNY ESF began and I was super depressed because I had separation anxiety and never overcame it until then, however I made some friends (who I lost because I was still clinging to my anti social ways).  Spring semester arrives and I was super depressed again (it’s been a cyclic pattern ever since I had it) and a friend asked if I wanted to hook up with her, and me being depressed and lonely (long distance didn’t sit well with me) said yes.  However I instantly regretted it and called my GF ago confess...needless to say it took forever to mount that hurdle.  Sophomore year came and all was well however depression and anxiety kept spiking and waning and it was physically draining, but still good since I got to nerd out over snakes.  Now come my Spring semester and I broke up with my GF because of her driving while high and making fun of it (she knows my stance on drugs and still did it) and I’ve relied on friends to vent to and they sort of articulated what they said to make it seem like they care while they probably don’t since whenever I try contacting them they open my message it and read it, but never respond (they’re probabky busy but I doubt it because their SC stories say otherwise).  Now I’m basically nothing but an exhausted introvert whose disorders are getting to a point almost comparable to that of when I was in middle school and I’m drained of the fighting I’ve done for 8 years and I kinda just want it to stop: the anxiety, depression, numbness, hair twisting, lack of friends.  I just want to finally rest and have days where I’m happy and go-lucky.  I don’t know what to do anymore...",mentalhealth,My Last Ditch Effort,2019-01-31 23:58:47

3,kachabelle,1548934242,1,"Hi guys.

I am wondering if I could get some help/advice on some herbal medication I am taking for anxiety and depression.

I am currently taking St Johns Wort, the standard bottle from Holland and Barrett (Maximum Strength) 284mg capsules, twice daily, so approximately 600mg daily.

It has helped me immensely with my anxiety and depression, and have been taking it for approximately 7 weeks now. But I feel as though I get quite anxious sometimes physically, and feel that maybe upping the dosage may help.

My question is this: I have read many studies online that say the standard dose for taking St Johns Wort is 900mg daily. I don't understand why all of the St Johns Wort products I have found in the UK are so low dosage compared to this? There are some 'One-a-day' tablets that are only half of that (450mg). So I'm hesitant to up the dosage to 900mg because the bottle says not to - is there a reason for this? Is it safe to take 900mg like all the studies suggest? Are they just covering their backs by greatly reducing the suggested dosage on the labels?

Any advice and help would really be appreciated.

Many thanks!",mentalhealth,Herbal medication - St Johns Wort dosage?,2019-01-31 22:30:42
4,AshleyAurora,1548933391,1,"Hello there! I’ve never posted here on this subreddit before so if I do anything wrong please inform me and I’ll correct myself. Its 3 in the morning and I guess I just needed to ask.

This is not something that’s happened until recently but sometimes when I hear specific names or usernames of people I begin to panic. 

For example, around 6 months ago an acquaintance of mine named Taylor began to separate me and this girl (his best friend) I was in somewhat of a relationship with (and my first relationship nonetheless) until finally he asked her out himself and they started dating which cut me out completely. Now whenever I hear/read the name Taylor I immediately grow tense. The back of my neck begins to tingle, I can feel myself sweat and there’s a sudden “thud” of heaviness in the center of my chest along with the urge of wanting to run away or barricade myself of some kind and can on occasion grow hateful. After several minutes it slowly goes away and is replaced by an overwhelming sadness or a hollow feeling depression/ lack of motivation or energy.

The same goes for a “cam girl” that I knew my ‘girlfriend’ was into. I remember her telling me that she had gotten off to her videos because the cam girl would just post videos of her mashing her boobs together and immediately I felt myself grow tense and emotional with the same symptoms. I actually only decided to post this because I had been scrolling through another subreddit only to find a post of hers with the same username and got to the point where I began to cry. 

I don’t mean to sound whiny or pathetic or anything like that, honestly I just want to know why this happens or if it’s even normal? Before 8 months ago I’ve never experienced anything similar to this that I can remember... if I did take up your time however I deeply apologize.

It’s only been this year that I’ve actively sought help.

Even though I’ve talked to my personal tutor about it and I’ve been going to counselling, I still feel like they don’t get it and that all the meeting are just part of some procedure they have to go though...they don’t really care.

6,NecroSheen,1548931946,1,"I feel like I am a really bad boyfriend/friend/person to a degree, which is why I don't seem to easily connect to people and not have friends at all, and people tend to generally have a dislike to being with me. 

In general, I am a rather negative person... I criticize a lot on other's habits and ways of living (those that stem from personal will and decisions). I tend to dislike a lot of people too, mainly based off the other point, and more often than not I think that my pressence is not wanted or desired, eventhough I don't necessarily make it known that I dislike someone by body/facial expressions, or telling them. 

In the past, I was physically and emotionally abused by my mom. Although she was highly protective and loving, I think that her desire to keep me safe and desire to make me be a better individual took her in the wrong direction and lead to her behaviour towards me, which I now seem to emulate. I curse just like she did, I am resentful just like she is towards other people, I am not good at social events just like she is, and I don't do any sort of drugs just like she insisted on me not doing. 

Now, enter my girlfriend... She is the true definition of a physicologically-stable person. She had a super normal childhood with a mom that took care of her all of her life, a good, hard-working dad, and although her family had their own issues, none of them were particularly bad. In general, she has trouble understanding how other people feel when going through problems (not necessarily me but her friends). For example, she has a few friends who complain about how sad they feel and whatnot, and she tends to feel a little bored of listening, and goes with the usual, but I 100% understand them and am emphatic towards them. 

Now, in our relation, her lack of true psychological problems has helped me be a good individual towards her. I respect her with all of my heart, help her with any other problem she might have, love her unconditionally, and overall she does the same with me and we both have built a strong and mature relationship over the course of our 4 and half years, with a few tiny discussions here and there that we have been able to talk and find solutions and possible commitments through. 

The thing is -and where the problem lies- that there are 2 parts inside of me that govern my head and thoughts. My rational thoughts, which is what has helped us get everything we have gotten so far at a personal level (trust, empathy, honesty, love, respect, learning from mistakes etc.), and this is the reason why she is with me and keeps her by my side everytime, since I am able to understand what goes wrong and fix it for a better future for us. 

And then, there's the ""evil and toxic"" side of me, which I believe may be the negative thoughts rooted in my head from my self. I try to not let take it over our relationship, but I can't prevent it from taking over me. Whenever she goes out with a specific group of her friends (which I don't really like), my evil side gets mad at her and sad? that she hangs out with them, and posts pictures of them on social media. However, my rational side knows its perfectly fine for her to hang out with whoever she likes as long as she's safe, so a struggle inside of me happens. Of course, rationally, I tell her to go and have fun and take pictures (the irony). But internally, I suffer since that dark part of me dislikes it and it makes me feel terrible and adds up to a depression I've been having about my relationship with people. 

We have enough trust for me to talked to her about this whole thing, and she does her best at trying to help me. However, she and I understand that she cannot stop seeing friends, or posting pictures she likes just because I don't. And rationally, I understand it, but irationally, I don't and that drives me nuts, and it frustrates me to not be able to complain about it, or see any changes. 

This struggle drains me mentally, and as I have said before it all adds up to my lack of social skills, and general inability to do a lot of things, and results in me feeling great sadness, frustration and many other feelings. 

How can I deal with this mental struggle? Thank you for any tips. ",mentalhealth,"Toxicity, not on the receiving end, but on the giving.",2019-01-31 21:52:26
7,BigFootsSaucyToes,1548931274,1,"I hate to self diagnose or assume what I may have, but im pretty sure at this point i have some type of anxiety disorder. Whatever im going through is ruining my relationships and preventing me from doing basic shit like returning calls, leaving my house, and talking to my family. I feel like im constantly nervously obsessing over one thing or another.  Im currently in online school because my anxiety got so bad in public school I would uncontrollably throw up and was constantly sick to my stomach. Once i left in 2017 i cut off all of my friends from my old school and my first girlfriend without any explanation because talking to them became so incredibly stressful and I still feel like a fucking awful person for it. (A big part of cutting them off is that im in the closet and if my family found out i had a girlfriend i dont know how they would react so i became paranoid theyd find out). Over the rest of the year I was unmotivated, numb and miserable and when i wasnt that i was overwhelmingly anxious so in October of 2017 i asked my dad if i could see a therapist again and a week after i asked I was dropped from medicaid. Since then he tried getting me insurance again and i no longer qualified for the options he could afford so he said he would pay out of pocket for the sessions. he tried making an appointment once and gave up when they never called him back. Since then i have repeatedly asked but he always says ""okay, well we'll see"" and then nothing happens. I continued to feel unhappy and miserable for the first half of 2018. around august i started to feel better and finally thought id be done with feeling like shit for good other than being anxious. Now im starting to fail online school because I havent returned my teachers calls in weeks. I begin to panic, hyperventilate, and feel like im choking when i even think about calling them back. Ive also stopped talking to most of the few friends i do have because even just keeping a conversation going and returning their text has become exhausting while the friends i do gather the energy to consistently talk too im paranoid ill loose. Over the past two/three months things have gotten worse and I feel just as miserable as i did back in the end of 2017. I feel as if im back where i started and things are just going to get even more worse again. I dont know what to do at this point. Ive tried talking to my dad about how ive been feeling and he agrees that he thinks i may have an anxiety disorder but still doesn't take me seriously or make much of an effort to get me any kind of help.

I find myself constantly thinking about these things and to make things worse, I have a family that doesn’t understand these things. They always leave their stuff lying around the house. I find random stuff in random places (where they dont belong), nobody wants to pick their stuff up and I have a really exhausting job.. so when I come home I constantly find myself cleaning up for them and arranging things, dusting etc. 
I get mentally exhausted and I get depressed because I’ve to do the same thing over and over again and no matter how many times I tell them, they don’t seem to understand.

(Note this beginning is going to sound strange so bear with me) About a year ago I made an observation that at any given point in time we experience THAT as the present. I thought about this a lot, as in like ""Woah I experienced last night as the present but now its already this morning."" I know that is strange but I found it interesting. At some point I began using it to get through difficult things, like if I knew something I would not enjoy was going to happen(lets say a presentation in class in front of a lot of people for example) I would realize that from my future self's perspective It was already over and I was at home comfortable etc. This was not something that was on my mind often, but it was there. This is where other parts of my personality began to conflict with that view. I am Christian, and although from my beliefs I  should not be afraid of death necessarily, it petrifies me.  Although I consider myself Christian, small doubts have made this fear worse as I question if I would just cease to exist.(Note I do not wish to convert from Christianity, nor do I wish to change my religious beliefs). This slowly spread to the fear of death from my mother and father, as they are rather old for my age, each with certain health issues, especially my father. Once I moved to college(In my second semester of freshman year currently) It got worse again. I would fear waking up one morning to get a call that my father or mother was dead. That stayed with me most nights for a while, and still does sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

This fear has started to warp how I experience life, since I start thinking how easy it is for me, my girlfriend, parents to just suddenly die in a freak accident. If I do not hear from any of those people via text for more than a couple hours my mind starts racing thinking how they are dead etc. Back to the initial statement, that thinking about how the future is the present in a way compounded with these fears, and now It terrorizes me that the day I'm at my mother, or fathers funeral is already here, or what scares me more is I am on my own death bed dying, or already dead. I get that the chances of me living a long life are pretty good, but with that warped view on experience/time its as if I am about to die any second. Most nights when I go to sleep I let my thoughts wander as I drift to sleep, but ever since I have been afflicted with this I spend nights thinking about these fears and emotions, scared, sometimes crying, and overall furthering this crisis.  A day does not go by that I do not think about myself or my loved ones dying and its started to impact me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am unsure how I am supposed to tackle this. The college only offers three free therapy sessions so even if those could help I would only be able to get limited help. The only person I discuss this with, even a little bit with is my girlfriend but I don't think there is anything she can do. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Another note, I don't have my license to drive. At first it was laziness and lack of a reason, but now its out of fear since I always remember how likely it is to die in an accident, or how easy it is to mess up driving, make one small mistake, and either kill me or my passengers.)",mentalhealth,"I cannot get my own, and my loved ones mortality out of thought for more than a day at a time, if that.",2019-01-31 19:17:12

For about a year now I’ve become more conscious about my weight. I looked at old photos of myself between 120-125lbs and I felt horrified. I thought I looked fat despite being at a healthy bmi (I’m 5’2”). I remember freaking out because my clothes started getting snug and I was scared to go above a size 6. It was awful enough being a size 6. I’ve started feeling a lot more sick and haven’t been able to eat very much. Because of my schedule (in college) on Monday and Wednesday I don’t have time for a meal until after 3 and I don’t really like or eat breakfast but have at least tried to eat a granola bar or donut in order to take my meds in the morning. Whenever I do eat it’s usually junk food. The dorm’s cafeteria food being just “okay” has made it worse for me to eat a full meal. Now when I try to eat I can’t finish, even when my portions were small. A lot of times I don’t want to eat because I feel sick. I’ve also gotten scared of gaining weight. Last time I weighed myself I was 104. (2-3 weeks ago) But now I look in the mirror and I can see my ribs more and I’m worried I’ve lost more weight. My mom keeps pointing it out ever since I started losing weight (I actually had gained weight during that time BECAUSE I was starving myself) and now I think my friends are starting to notice my eating habits. One in particular questioned me about having not eaten all day, and I unconsciously started saying “It’s fine, I’m used to it” but cut myself off too late. I ended up making it more obvious after I started stuttering and panicking because I realized what I had just implicated. It wasn’t the first time I’d told him I hadn’t eaten all day. He didn’t press further but I started realizing that it’s a lot worse than I thought. I’m not restricting because I want to punish myself, but because I just... dont want to eat as much anymore.

I don’t really think it’s anorexia. I’m eating, but it’s not a lot. I can’t eat much because I get nauseous easily. And I’ve been a lot more worried about my weight and my body overall. Sometimes I just feel averse to food and get sick even thinking about eating. But I force myself to. 

Im getting out of a depressive episode right now, and while life is honestly going really great I’m still struggling with my own health, especially physically. My lack of sleep and exercise partnered with my struggle to eat i think contributes to this cycle of constantly feeling sick and anxious. I want to break out of it but I just feel... sick and confused and scared. I don’t know. I just really needed to vent.

I have had pretty bad relations with my parents due to 3 divorces and a below average living arrangement. I am not some rebellious kid that is venting that my parents are dumb, but I know for a fact that they are average / below average intelligence and I don't resent them for it.  I am extremely ambitious and want to be successful so badly to the point where I think something is ""wrong"".   


When we argue (almost never now but when it happened in the past) we threw insults back and forth and got extremely angry to the point of yelling and one time even hitting me repeatedly and forcing me to go stay at a friends house for a few nights. Obviously this is partly due to my immaturity during that time and my lack of self awareness to know that the argument was pointless and I should have just listened.

Now, about 1.5 years later I feel like I lack emotion. Don't get me wrong I have friends and love to shop and travel, and with my job I have a lot of freedom to eat out more and get into fashion.  


When I argue with my parents now I don't feel anything like anger or the urge to cry like I used to, in fact I keep a level voice to the point where I sound cold. I ""love"" money, not obsessively but to the point where I without thought reject going out with friends almost 95% of the time in order to work.

I tell myself things like I won't help my parents even in the future because they didn't help me (in fact they are in debt and leverage money and are super cheap with things, for example not paying for small things that are necessities and telling me to ""see how it feels to pay for me"").

And I’ve been on medication and been to therapy for all of it but it’s really not cutting it for me. I feel so hopeless and so low and I really don’t want to do this anymore.

Both of my biggest escapes are gone.

Sleeping and video games. 

I can’t bring myself to sleep anymore since I’m plagued by nightmares every night and wake up extremely stressed and filled with dread and it’s such a pain to deal with.

And video games are becoming much harder for me to enjoy.

I’ve started having compulsions when I’m playing for the most meaningless things and I don’t know how to deal with it.

Half the time I can’t even play because I spend an hour turning my TV on and off because it doesn’t turn on how I want it to and if I try to play without turning it off and giving in I get extremely anxious, to the point where I feel physically sick.

Another thing I’ve been doing is in Sea of Thieves, you can pick your weapons from a weapon chest, and I’ve just been scrolling back and forth between the weapons for hours trying to make sure everything’s perfect. It makes no sense to explain but I just get extremely anxious and feel the worst emotions possible.

School is getting harder and harder as I start to lose trust in my friends since I’m getting more and more paranoid for no reason and I’m trying to end relationships with people I’m close with so nobody gets sad when I inevitably die because I’m super paranoid about that too.

I’m having a really hard time right now.

In Canada we have this BellLetsTalk thing going on and it just makes me feel ten times worse since everyone is posting about how you should always make sure everyone is happy and how mental health is so important but I’ve been silently suffering alone for so long and I can’t do it anymore.

I hate therapy, it’s really not for me, but I feel like even just a group of friends going through the same thing would be amazing. We could play games together and talk about our problems and stuff.

But sadly all of my friends just talk about their next session where they’re gonna just drunk and stoned as hell and I’m sitting here uninterested in messing with my brain anymore than it’s messed with me which in turn makes me feel more pathetic and weak and like I’m not meant to be here.

36,tea_amrita,1548901807,1,"Something I've been seeing an increase of lately, mostly on Facebook but a bit on reddit too, are statements generalizing *all* people with mental illness(es) and lumping them in one kind of box.

I struggle with multiple mental illnesses. I've volunteered my time to talk to others struggling as well. I've seen and heard a lot. Some interactions end up wonderful, while others not so much.

A mistake I see happening a bit is that people, mostly those not afflicted, assuming their experience with someone mentally ill is what everyone else's experience is.

And lately I've, unfortunately, gotten in a few internet arguments about generalization and use of words with people that aren't being receptive to understand or learn. It's a bit disheartening as some of these people have been in position of power or very popular.

It is true you can attribute certain traits to a mental illness. How else would you be able to diagnose? **However, the same MI doesn't affect everyone the same way.**

This is where words especially matter. You *could* say, for example, ""People with bipolar disorder shouldn't ___ because ___ will happen.""

What would be more emphatic and truthful to say is to word it like this instead: People with bipolar disorder **generally** shouldn't ____ because **it is possible** for ____ **to** happen.

I find wording things the first way can quickly cross the line into ableism and offensive accusations. For example, someone on Facebook said, ""It is terrifying being around someone with mental illness.""

These kinds of statements do nothing but further stigma towards mental illness. When I had pointed this out to said person, they spat swears at me and that she has a right to feel that way, because someone with a mental illness hit her when they were having a PTSD episode.

It would be fair to talk about this in the sense that her fear being valid because of her incident, but it is completely unfair to make blanket statements as she had done. I suggested that she find resources to help her understand mental illness better, but they refused to listen.

I'm sure many of us on this sub can relate to the feeling of being generalized or unfairly judged due to stigma, and I'm not trying to preach. I just needed to vent because it gets exhausting constantly having to see sweeping statements of things that are not true. People tend to get fixated on the notation that having an MI can cause something negative to happen, while neglecting to see that an average person without an MI can also do something at any time that could possibly lead to something negative occurring **too.** We're all people.

I’m just your average college student with a diagnosis of ADHD and I’m struggling a little bit with how Adderall effects me. Affects me? Effects me, I’m sticking with that one. Anyway.

I’m not sure what’s causing my agitated state, but I’m noticing I might be more prone to overstimulation and to having a hyperactive brain that I can’t shut up, but honestly, I had these problems before I started taking Adderall. I can’t tell if my problem is being exacerbated by Adderall or if Adderall is doing little to no help (and might help more with increased dosage/more time to get used to the current dosage) or if Adderall is doing literally nothing, and any symptoms malignant or benign occur purely from reading that these things can happen and effectively placebo-ing myself into feeling these symptoms. 

Also, I don’t know if this helps any of you figure what’s up with me, but I’m 18.
It’s hard for me to know if any of what I’ll read from you will help, seeing as you don’t know me, but I figured I’d give this a try. It’s at least giving my brain something to do instead of go wild flinching at and chasing down every little new idea.

When asked what to do with her hysteria, she advised:

Do not look at me when you are dissatisfied.

Do not raise a bad topics.

I just tend to think a lot. I think much more than i speak which i know is sometimes seen as a good thing but it backfires so much.

For example, I'll think about something I said to someone or how I said it to someone and worry over that. I know that's pretty common with most people but I can't help but wonder how they handle it. I also deal with a lot of paranoia due to possible having a hyperactive mind? I don't know. 

I haven't been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness and I've had plenty of chances to see a therapist as a kid but I was never willing to actually go to a session. 

The only kind of thyrapist I've been to was my old elementary school counselor but nothing serious was ever brought up or handled there.

But back to the subject, I do tend to worry a lot; over so many things, big and small. I've had many people tell me not to sweat the small things and everything like that and I know its good advice to follow but I just don't know how to follow it. Not exactly.

When I start to think, I think about it all in so much detail. I look into every positive and negative possibility. Of course more negative than positive. I've gotten horrible panic attacks from this. I hate it so much. I feel like it's a barrier to how I'm maturing and handling different experiences.

I guess, what im asking is, how do I shut up that small voice in my head that's always judging everything? That's always telling me not to speak to people that I like speaking to out of fear of saying the wrong thing or saying too little or too much? Or bringing up all the regretful things I've done over and over? I know all of this is extremely common too but it's hurting me way too much.

Should I go see a thyrapist as soon as I have the chance to or is there a more personal way of handling this successfully? 

I also ship off to the army for basic training on the 4th of February. I'm hoping that the mental breaking process will do more good than harm but I don't feel so sure about it as much.

43,gothboygucci,1548898597,1,"I'm just going through a very severe depression at age 24. I have so much anxiety and pain and I'm just downright miserable.

I talked to my therapist about my pot smoking. He said that smoking once a week is considered heavy smoking. Because of the heavy amount of THC in today's pot. And because it stays in your system. He said it interferes with my antidepressant medication and prevents me from getting better. The medicine is making me feel better, but the pot gets in the way of that. And according to him, getting high is more important than feeling better. I don't even have any pot right now and won't be getting any until maybe next week. It's not a big deal and I'm not freaking out that I don't have pot...

And he said that using it for long periods of time can lead to increased depression and anxiety. And that it takes away your motivation. Makes you irritable.

I''ve always felt bad about myself. And now I'm taking a medicine that is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm getting high which is preventing me from getting better? I guess I want to feel bad and perhaps pot is making me feel bad which is what I'm used to and don't want to change?

I used to get off on feeling bad. Feeling bad is how I deal with things.

I have a lot of mixed and confused feelings about this. My therapist said that if I was content and comfortable with myself, there wouldn't be any need to get high. And that with pot, a successful and content and responsible person would only use it once a month or one every six weeks.

He said it was no different than an alcoholic who drinks after work because he had a stressful day.

Do you ever feel a tingly sensation sometimes? I've been feeling a nervous sensation in my back...like an uneasiness or something...I think it's anxiety...it just kind of hurts or something? I just feel...uncomfortable. It's like an uncomfortable sensation on the back of my body...like my back area...

My therapist says I was at 1% better...and now I'm at 20%...I have a lot of work to do he says...

Do you think I have a lot of issues? I feel...miserable...uncomfortable.. I just...want to get better...and be...happy. I've never been happy...my mother just wants to see me happy and I can't do it....I'm very scared of the future...

Today was hard...just going to my therapist appointment was so...hard to realize all of my issues...I just feel like such a mess. I feel helpless and pathetic. I have such poor self-esteem

I'm only 20% better and it's scary how much work I have to do..I'm just so nervous and uncomfortable with myself and who I am...

Growing up my sister and I fought a lot. I had severe depression and anxiety. I had to take psych meds and go to therapy. Still on heavy medication and heavy therapy.

She hated me. She was embarrassed by me. I was such a mess in school and was constantly bullied and made fun of. I had no friends and was just miserable.

In college, we went to the same school, and I was just so pathetic and horrible she didn't want anything to do with me.

We never got along. Always fought and bickered. She constantly called me names and told me to kill myself.

She wasn't nice to me.

I never really called her names or anything. I was very submissive, weak, shy, and stupid. I barely passed high school but graduated from college. College was so much easier than middle and high school.

I have a lot of trauma. I'm just such a complete mess and depressed and miserable.

I'm miserable. And what's worse is my sister knows about my secrets and issues. She found things that I didn't want her to know. I used to touch women inappropriately in crowded hallways, and she saw me touching a girl. I quit doing that and haven't done it in years, but the pain is still there.

She moved far away to California and is successful and happy. While I'm stuck at home miserable, lonely, and working a shit job. I feel like a loser, a failure. I feel so unhappy and it's hard to change.

She came over for Thanksgiving and we sort of made up. I apologized for being so shitty and that I'm trying to change, and she said ""Thanks you can do it""

We are friends on facebook. I actually had her blocked for a while but readded her.

We don't talk. We never talked. I'm artsy and she is into science. We just never had anything in common and she hated me so much growing up.

Due to my severe depression and anxiety, I caused a ton of pain and stress in my family.

I have a lot of issues that I am working on in therapy.

I've been texting my sister pictures of her dogs and cat. I think she enjoys them, but never replies.

I asked for her address and sent her a package with some tshirts that I used to wear that no longer fit that I thought she would enjoy. It was supposed to arrive on Friday, and I don't know if she ever got it because she never texted me about it.

I just feel so horrible and unhappy about myself.

Should I text her again and apologize and say how I'm sorry how I failed as an older brother to her?

She never texts me or anything. She never asks how I'm doing or anything like that. She never asks how therapy is going or anything like that. It's like she doesn't care about me or love me...she says she loves me and she gave me a hug...but she doesn't talk to me at all or anything.

My dad also has trouble with his own sister and they fight all the time as well.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I failed as an older brother to my sister. I should have been there for her and took care of her, but I couldn't even take care of myself. I just fucked up so much and I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself. I'm just such a failure as an older brother.

I don’t know what happened, but today I just felt really fucking depressed. Just sad and disappointed in myself. I’m just so miserable and lonely and unhappy.

And it’s fucked up, but I was thinking about suicide again. And it makes me cry to think about and it really hurts and I know it’s not the answer. But I was thinking of buying a hand gun and killing myself. I know that’s horrible and not the answer. I don’t know why I keep thinking of it.

I’m just so unhappy. I feel so terrible. My therapist says I’m making progress, but it’s just so scary how much work I have to do. I just am overwhelmed. And my parents think NOTHING is wrong with me. My mother thinks that me being miserable is okay and that I don’t need the medication and it’s time to come off it. I’m just so miserable and unhappy and I feel like I’m in pain and I just don’t know what to do but keep talking about it.

He says I have all the tools to be happy but…I just can’t seem to figure this out. I just am having a hard time getting better and it hurts and it’s hard and I just feel so fucking confused and lost and scared..

I'm also a Cancer sign. A big cry baby. Do zodiacs mean anything?

I’m cleaning the basement right now, but these emotions are really draining. I just can’t seem to feel happy. I just can’t seem to feel okay with myself and that’s why I really want to buy a gun. I’ve been working and saving money and I could do it. But I’m not going to. It’s just a thought. I’ve had suicidal thoughts ever since I was a little kid.

I just hate myself. I’m just so unhappy and I don’t know how the hell I’m going to get through this. My life has just always been constant misery and sadness. I grew up sad. I’m always sad. Something is always wrong. Something is always bothering me. I’m always unhappy. People say I always look sad and ask what’s wrong and I just can’t figure it out. Why did I end up so fucked up? I just want to get better but I just feel so fucked up and it’s really hard sometimes. I feel like such a fucking freak. I just can’t even take care of myself. I feel so helpless and pathetic

I don’t know why today was so hard, but today is very difficult.

I'm just such a mess and don't know how the hell I am going to get better. It's overwhelming

My therapist says there is hope for everybody. And my last therapist says that everyone deserves happiness. I just don't understand why I keep crying and feeling so fucking bad about myself.

46,cassideluxe,1548897576,1,"Hi, everybody!

I’m going to try and make this as short and to the point as possible.

I’ve lived with depression and anxiety since I was 14 years old. At 21, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and, just recently, I was also diagnosed with OCD. I’ve been in and out of the mental health system, and luckily I’ve found an absolutely phenomenal psychiatrist, a great therapist, and medication that’s done wonders for me. I also have supportive friends and family. I am stupidly, ridiculously lucky and — I think — privileged. My reality is nowhere near the reality of millions of other people living with mental illness, and that absolutely kills me.

I sat on this idea I had for awhile, and in Spring of 2018 my younger brother began facing thoughts of suicide. That was when I began organizing my mental health project with two good friends. We have created an Instagram (@bloomingbrainproject) to be a mental health companion. We are still in the very early stages, but we’d like to progress into educational videos and begin advocating for what we REALLY need in the mental health system — more beds, shorter ER wait times, more accessible therapies. In the mean time, I need your help.

Currently, we’ve been asking our followers Q&amp;A’s regarding their mental health to create educational posts. We post their answers anonymously. If you would like to help us out, please reply and let me know. It would mean the world to me. If you have more questions first, I completely understand and I’d love to answer what I can.

This is a problem that's increasingly getting worse and is now affecting how productive I am during school. It's bad enough that I barely do work at home because I get easily distracted, now I can't work well at school either for the same reason.

If there's the slightest bit of noise happening, I can't focus. It's too much for me and I get anxious, frustrated, and overwhelmed. In classes, during tests especially, people shouldn't be talking anyway, so I get even more frustrated because it's super disrespectful. Even when I have ear plugs in and it's almost silent, I can't focus because my mind easily wanders.

I'm not diagnosed, but I'm 99% sure I have maladaptive daydreaming, and sometimes daydreams are all I can think about. If something is boring to me, I daydream. If I'm reading something that actually interests me, then I end up getting too into it and thinking about it for too long. My mind can never get to the point and stick to it for more than a couple of minutes.

It also mentally and emotionally tires me when I do focus. Today for example, I had 2 classes in a row with tests in them. By the end of the test in the 1st class I was feeling a little tired. Once I got to the next class, though, a giant wave of mental and emotional tiredness hit me. I didn't even get halfway through the test bc the tiredness mixed with my usual lack of focus made it impossible to work.

53,uraniumrage,1548894401,1,"[WARNING: This personal story references themes of suicide and potentially traumatic experiences, once I start talking about intrusive thoughts.]

You’re taking the train. Probably reading something on your phone, perhaps the news, social media, or school notes to prepare for your upcoming lecture. You happen to glance up and notice the guy sitting in the seat next to you, clearly struggling with something. He’s clutching his face, almost clawing at it, slowly rocking back and forth, panting in exhaustion from some ailment you can’t see. Worried, you lean over and ask if he’s okay. He lifts his face towards you, a distraught look in his eyes and says in a hushed, desperate voice:

“I can’t hear my eyes!”

How would you react to that situation? What do you think is going on with that person? He looks crazy but he is clearly suffering. This is in fact an experience that I could personally live, if someone were to notice my struggles in public transport and ask if I’m okay. I probably wouldn’t respond the same way, but that would be the only thought going through my mind.

I have Tourette’s syndrome. I too, before my diagnosis this summer, assumed it was the “swearing disease” just as you probably thought if you have heard about this disorder somewhere from the media. It is in fact a much deeper, more complex condition than most think. 

Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological disorder that causes me to have multiple tics, which are involuntary movements and sounds. I jerk my head and crane my neck. I hit my stomach, chest, neck and face multiple times a day. I cough and squeeze all the air out of my lungs as much as I can to the point of making my ribs sore. I let out high pitched squeaks when I know no one is around me, if I am successful at holding it in until I’m alone, that is.

And of course, the swearing. Involuntary obscene language is one of the odder, more complex tics that only about 10% of people diagnosed with Tourette’s exhibit, much less than what is portrayed in media. Being a part of this group, I’m lucky enough that I can almost always hide and suppress these exclamations in public, but the same cannot be said for the majority of those suffering from this socially isolating tic, which is categorized under a separate comorbid condition called coprolalia.

Since Tourette’s is a neurological disorder, I was born with. I had tics all my life, but they were milder and less frequent. I would sniffle and clear my throat often, or knock my knees together as I walked. Luckily, they practically disappeared in my late teens. It’s only over the summer that they progressively and quickly got worse. 

The important issue about Tourette’s that brings me back to my story is one that is mostly unknown even to those who know about the disorder. Tics are not always completely involuntary. Sometimes, they happen on their own without any warning and with no way to prevent it. Most of the time, they are actually compulsions, much like those found in OCD, where instead of completing rituals to get rid of mental anguish, intrusive thoughts or anxiety, tics are done to get rid of physical distress. In either case the mental or physical discomfort is caused without reason by the disorder.

An intense and sudden uncomfortable and irresistible urge appears at the location where the tic needs to happen, which can feel like a build-up of tension, pressure, or a really bad itch. Completing the precise physical or vocal tic required temporarily relieves this discomfort. Yet choosing not to tic worsens this feeling and becomes excruciating, just like what you would feel if you stopped blinking for as long as you can. Our bodies are riddled with eyes that need to be blinked in a specific way, at random times, all day, every day.

The worst thing that can happen with Tourette’s is being unable to complete a tic for whatever reason. You are being deprived of the option to relieve this quickly building distress and panic sets in. This is what occasionally happens to me as I ride public transportation.

You see, weirdly enough, I have a vocal tic with my eyes. You may in fact be able to replicate it yourself. There is a specific way that I learned to blink my eyes such that it produces an ever so soft clicking sound. I don’t know if it’s the humidity of my eye that’s sticking my eyelids together, making a sound similar to smacking lips when I open them again, or little bubbles of air that get popped. Either way, it is a sound that is very low and even I have difficulty picking it up sometimes.

The problem then arises when I’m on the train and my eye tic starts up. The low rumbling of the engine, the friction of the train tracks and the whooshing of the wind outside, even though these noises quickly get lost as quiet background noise, are sometimes enough to drown out the sound of my clicking. I find myself in the scary scenario where I desperately need to tic, but I cannot complete it, because I lack the necessary auditory component.

I try blinking my eyes harder. I cusp my hands around my eyes in desperation to attempt to amplify the sound. I hold my breath to get rid of any noise I can. If nothing works, the discomfort becomes maddening. I start sweating. I lose my breath. I clutch onto my seat, my face, praying for the next stop to come so that the noise can stop and I can finally hear my eyes.

If I’m lucky I can catch the clicking sound and get a bit of relief, but only in one eye. Now there is an unbalance, one eye produced a click, the other needs to click as well, and the struggle restarts.

This obsession with symmetry, the feeling of my body needing to be even on my left and right sides, is a symptom of OCD. When going through the diagnostic process for Tourette’s back in August,  my psychiatrist agreed with me that I exhibited a few symptoms of this similar condition, but as the meeting was focused on my Tourette’s, and that my symptoms did not appear severe enough to impact my life too much, a diagnosis for OCD wasn’t warranted at the time. It was left at being just a hunch.

But when you’re left lying on your bed fighting off intrusive suicidal thoughts instead of studying for your final exam in two days, it’s more than just a hunch.

During the finals period before summer break started, the build-up of anxiety for the upcoming exams triggered abnormally intense intrusive thoughts, something I hadn’t realized till then that I struggled with. Although I wasn’t and am still not in the least suicidal, they focused a lot on themes of suffering and death.

“You could die anytime, anywhere”

“It could be extremely painful, you could die in a fire”

“You don’t want that, should just guarantee yourself a painless death, take control”

“You should want to die, you’re always at risk of a painful death”

“You should want to die.”

So on and so on, when all I wanted was just to study for my math course. These thoughts scared me, it felt like my brain was trying to convince me to become suicidal, and I fought back. But resisting these thoughts only make them worse as I realized. Like a sinister parrot insisting on squawking in your ear that won’t be shooed away.

“What’s the chance of getting in a bad car accident? Your house burning down? You should just get it over with and end it all.”

Over and over, hours and hours. I had to defer my final exam because of this. It’s a pretty good hunch if you ask me.

The constant background brainstorm in my brain of random thoughts jumping from one to another, most likely caused by ADHD according to my therapist, probably doesn’t help much with these intrusive thoughts either.

Another very little known fact about Tourette’s is that the vast majority of those with the disorder also have OCD and/or ADHD, and are more likely than average to suffer from other issues as well, such as anxiety, depression, autism, and as mentioned before, coprolalia.

Although I knew since I was 6 that something was off, being aware of my tics and certain obsessions and compulsions, I had kept it all bottled in until I was 20, when the sudden increase in the intensity of both these issues pushed me to seek professional help. Until then I simply didn’t know what was going on with me, or who to talk to, or even how to describe the things I was going through.

Lack of awareness and discussion about mental health is an important and impactful problem for many who struggle in silence like I did for most of my life. In fact, most cases of Tourette’s go undiagnosed for many years, and many never get a diagnosis. Lack of awareness also leads to misunderstanding and mistreatment towards those with these conditions, and Tourette’s syndrome is definitely not excluded from that.

I managed to gather the courage to seek help by myself. I got my diagnosis for Tourette’s at my university’s psychiatric services. I now have all the necessary accommodations, for which I am very grateful, and I was taught great coping strategies for anxiety. I will continue my appointments with a psychiatrist here to pursue diagnoses for OCD and ADHD, if I do in fact have them.

Even though this is quite late in my life, I still managed to get the help I needed, and this in part thanks to becoming more aware of not only the very real issues of mental health in our society, but of the many options that are out there to provide help. Public presentations at college and online stories and testimonies were my main source of information.

I hope to be able to convey the same inspiration through my story to help any of you struggling. You can get help. You deserve to get help.

I have a large ego that drives everything I do, I’m overconfident, goal oriented and persistent. I have trouble with empathy if I think that the person isn’t acting in a way that I find rational and can blame on their own “incompetence”. I have trouble seeing my own flaws and have to have them pointed out most of the time, but can realize them once pointed out. I have have pretty high intellectual abilities and am always in other people’s heads trying to figure out their motivations and predict them. I have lost all “feelings” since the age of 18. I’m very extroverted and get pleasure from human interaction and conversation, and am constantly making moves to appear to others how I would like for them to see me, often changing based on the person and what I think they want. I need to be in control. And I don’t really like to be touched. I’ve maintained a steady girlfriend for 6 years and I love her, but it’s not a feeling it’s in my head, I KNOW I love her because of the qualities that she possesses. 

I’m just confused cause I hit all the marks, but I feel that I would never do someone harm for my gain like the stories you hear. I genuinely love people and animals alike. What am I? Is this a common thing to have? Or am I just being delusional and attributing a false personality to myself?

There was 2 groups of people I knew, the people I partied and did drugs with, and people I vaguely knew from school. There was no one I could go to with a problem, no one I could go to when I just needed someone to talk to, just people I went and got fucked with. 

Then, i stopped drugs and went into a dark hole of depression. This is when I met a girl. We got along great at the beginning, it was like I had known her my whole life. Then, after a little while, she started getting a bit distant. Whatever, i thought, it’s probably just because the honeymoon phase was over. 

But now i know it’s just she’s lost feelings. And she’s going to break up with me any day now. But whatever. I don’t deserve someone that loves me, I’ll only ever disappoint and be a failure.

I want to travel by myself but if I am too absentminded I might get lost, end up in unpleasant situations, lose some things etc

I am extremely careful about my belongings and I have never lost anything before when I travelled (I have never been outside out Europe though, I have seen a few places only).
I check things multiple times, I get anxious I might do something stupid in front of people etc

My parents tell me it's like I live in a bag because I might forget stupid stuff like not noticing the exit thing while trying to get of a public bathroom, not immediately finding the train seat etc

I never forget personal things like my phone, wallet etc

At school I embarassed myself several times because of this, I might panic and not notice stuff immediately etc and being absentminded in general.

72,redbeams0up,1548881922,1,"Good evening,

It has come to my attention, that I may be- mentally ill. I am not sure of how long or when I first started feeling 'not so well' but I do not recall a time in my life when I had felt in overall good shape. Perhaps in middle school- I can't remember. I'm also not sure as to how I should go about writing this. I struggle with my writing and I'm sorry if this is terrible but I am scared of going to a therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lived a relatively normal life. If someone has mistreated me in a substantially damaging way then I have probably forgotten about it but I can't think of an experience, relating to a specific individual, that may have lead me to feel the way I do about myself and about life. I mean, my life hasn't been perfect, yes I have gone through some Trials(tm)- but everyone does.

&amp;#x200B;

Occasionally I'd feel blue in my transition from middle school to high school as well as in my early years of high school, but it was never alarming- I was okay for the most of it. In my memory. I feel like what was most worrying was the anxiety that I started to develop in 9th or 8th grade. I had a lot of troubling insecurity, as do most young people, and may or may not have let my mind get the better of me in that time. I had begun to feel embarrassed and maybe even scared when it came to certain activities, mostly socially. Academically I was average, verging on below average, but it never bothered me when I was in my early years of high school. It first started out as me feeling really nervous upon meeting new people and thereafter manifested itself into me becoming extremely conscious of what I'm wanting to say, or what I'm supposed to be saying resulting in me feeling sick whenever I had to interact. With friends it was okay (my one close friend) but after a while I found it impossible for me to communicate with new people or even with people I was close with because of how worried I'd be about saying the wrong thing or saying something dumb or how I had nothing to say at all! For presentations my hands, legs and voice would shake and I would feel as though I needed to cry- I did actually once, after a presentation. Big sobs. Eventually I didn't really communicate with anyone outside of my very small group of friends after my best-friend had left the school. I don't remember much of how I felt in high school but I think I mostly sheltered myself as that was easy at the school I attended so I was doing okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am at University and fear that I may have developed something more than anxiety. Often I feel as though I want to die. I am not suicidal, but I often wish that I was nothing. Maybe this started in my final year of high school but I do not know. I feel now as though everything I do is wrong. I come from a very religious background so at first it was just religious guilt. I would feel so bad that I was going to Hell, lmao, that I would stay up at night unable to sleep thinking about how I am Undeserving(tm). Now I just feel bad about everything. I feel that University has FORCED me out of my shell socially and I am glad that I have developed better social skills where I am able to communicate and maybe even connect with people. I would and still do berate and beat myself up about not being able to communicate, not having anything to say, being unable to connect with people or feeling overall dumb and inadequate in a social, mental and physical sense. I feel as though I now consider myself unbelievably stupid and that even if I had anything to say it would be complete rubbish. I don't really excel at anything, I never know what I'm doing and I also don't have anything I can say I'm passionate about or maybe even that I'm GOOD at. I think that last year I may have been at my worst mentally. I was struggling with myself and as a result struggling with University. I didn't always feel terrible but when I did it felt a bit crippling. I'd spend portions of my day feeling unbelievably vacant and as though everything was pointless. When I'd come home- I wouldn't do anything. I'd tell myself I had things to do, study, exercise, read- maybe even do things I enjoy like play a video game or watch a movie but I never did anything. Just ate and stared at the ceiling. I was so stressed out all the time because of all the pressure I was putting myself under as a result of how unbelievably pathetic I was being. I was crying a lot in the beginning but eventually I wasn't able to cry as easily, just felt like dying. I still have the anxiety problem. Feels as though my brain is melting and like I might fall over any minute, I never do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am on break now and am trying to work on myself. My moods consist of really high 'highs' and really low 'lows'. I will be doing well but small things will throw me off and as soon as I feel I am doing something fractionally wrong I start spiraling. I fear the day that I may find it too difficult to pick myself back up and continue trying. I'm worried that I will make this 2nd academic year even harder for myself and am considering getting help. I don't really expect anyone to reply- just thought I should write about it and put it out into the virtual void! I'm sorry to anyone who has taken the time out to read this, bad writing aside.

I had a psychiatrist who has now abruptly left town, and you would think other psychiatrists would absorb this doctor's patients but that is not the case, I now have to wait up to a minimum of six months to see a new psychiatrist! I am currently waiting in the psych emerg again after two torturous nights to see a psychiatrist to discuss meds, treatments, only to be told I might not be able to see a doctor at all! There has been no group therapy, none currently being run other than a meditation group. I am growing more and more frustrated! My employer offers counseling, but only only 4 sessions at a time then you have to take a break. No ongoing. I have made an appointment with a psychologist and the earliest I can see them is April. Which is fine, I understand everything is so busy, but I am just soo frustrated that after almost 5 months I feel I have gotten nowhere. I am on the verge of being homeless. End rant

The following days it persisted but not as severe. I went to see a doctor about the palpitations but he said there is nothing wrong especially because Im young (20). The thing is just that I tend to stress out and think about things a lot especially at night. Now a week later I still feel a little uncomfortable sleeping and am always AWARE of my heart beat and its so annoying. It kinda makes me have shortness of breath as well.

88,TerribleWerewolf,1548869863,1,"It started at the beginning of the year when I had a mental break down that at the end of it, I was in my bed crying in the dark and with google opened asking why I felt like this. During the episode I was disgusted in myself and I wanted to run away, I wanted to get away from everything. I didn't act on it, I only thought out of how I am gonna travel but that was about it. During a girls night that my co-workers and I were doing, 2 nights afterwards. I told them about because I was still riding the aftermath and they did give me some advice. One of them offered that if I feel like this again I could go over to her house. 

I had another one a couple days ago but it wasn't as big, I felt like running away again. I felt like just clocking out and leaving. Because of this I started to slow down on my work which wasn't good, I lost my chipper attitude and somewhat became aggressive. I was putting myself down and almost started crying. When I got home and was going to bed, I started looking train tickets and the lowest price I was able to find was 84 bucks with 11 hours on the travel but the highest one was 140 (i think) and it was 9 hours. I planned out what I was gonna bring and how I would go to the train station from my work. The next day at work I was still a little aggressive and I was still slow at work but towards the end I kinda caught up. I almost broke down crying again.

I'm not happy with my life but yet I am. I got into college and the course I wanted, I'm finally done with high school after today. But I am not happy, I'm not happy where my life is going.

I’ll be real with you. I’ve been grieving for most of my adult life at this point. I lost my little brother to cancer when I was 19.. He was 16, and we lived together in a children’s hospital for a year while he had treatment before his cancer took over. I was his caretaker. 
4 years later, as soon as I thought I was on the healing-home-stretch, my dad was terminally diagnosed with cancer and we lost him 6 months later.  I was his caretaker too. 
It’s unforgiving and mind consuming some days. Grieving has created self destructive behaviours and poor eating habits, insomnia, uncontrollable rage and depression in me over the years, and has especially introduced me to anxiety attacks. 
This is a “temporary” state of mind but it’s a hard trench to dig yourself out of and it leaves some scars from the traumas. 
There isn’t any easy way to solve the emotions I deal with on the daily as I have no diagnosis. Only heavy symptoms that come and go as they please and intertwine as they will. My best chance of feeling better is to take control of my mental state. This takes a lot of practice, conscious will power, and patience with yourself. It’s hard to conjure up the strength to battle my mind most days, but I won’t give up on getting better. 

I’m thankful for my friends and family; for love, support, patience, and kindness. 
I’m thankful for my boyfriend who got thrown into my crazy life and hasn’t been scared away yet. 
I’m thankful for my brother and my dad, their humour and their protectiveness over me. Their equal love for food and Monty Python skits. I’m thankful for the memories. 
I’m thankful for my therapist.

90,bluemood16,1548867914,1,"This is long so bare with me. Also, first time poster so I apologize for any mistakes.

Backstory: I’ve been friends with this girl (lets name her Sara) for about 5 years now, we met my college freshman year, we were roommates for a year (best roommate I’ve ever had), she was my maid of honor at my wedding, so we been close ever since. 

Here’s the problem: She is always been a big drinker, she would drink several times a week every week, even alone. Now I dont mind her drinking but she has severe depression and anxiety, and has sleeping issues (she can sleep for over 20hrs nonstop and is always tired) and is prescribed everything and anything (xanax, aderall, anti psychotics, etc) its always worried me that she mixes alcohol and all these pills but its her life and the few times I brought it up she always told me she needed the pills and alcohol hasn’t affected her. I’ve also tried to convince her of seeing another psychiatrist but she refuses to this too, whenever she is on all those meds she acts so out of it, like she is not aware of her surroundings. 

Anyways, fast forward 5 years (Im 24, she is 25) and her tolerance for the medication is sky high, her mental health has not improved at all. She admitted to me and my husband to take from 4 to 11 tabs of xanax in a day or she just “doesnt feel it” and the drinking constantly (at least every weekend) continues, in addition to about 5-6 other meds she takes. I kept trying to talk to her about it but its pointless.

About a month ago my husband and I went over to her place to visit (she lives at home but parents were out of the country) she looked tired most of the time but thats not unusual. We left at around midnight but I forgot my glasses and had to go back, she opened the door and looked like I had woken her up from a 10hr nap. Anyways, I grab my glasses and Im ready to leave when she starts to lose balance, Im a bit confuse at this point and hold her for a second then suddenly she is completely out. I start screaming for my husband who is waiting for me in the car, he comes in running for his life, picks her up and we tried for a good 30 seconds to wake her up not knowing whats happening. Im ready to call 911 when she finally wakes up, she has no recollection of me coming back for my stuff, and looks very confuse and angry. After staying with her for an hour she insists that we go home, I insist I stay but she says no, and that she’ll call me if she needs me. 

I cried the entire way home. Im horrified and really worried about her, my family told me I need to have a serious conversation with her about rehab, but I know she will discard that option immediately. My husband insists that I talk to her parents about it but it feels like a violation of her trust, I know this is important but I have no idea how to deal with this and Im the only friend who knows whats truly happening here. 

Regardless of if what happened that night had anything to do with the pills and the drinking Im afraid for her life, and I feel really shitty for not doing anything about it... I dont wanna wait until its too late but I have no idea what I need to do.

Any advice on how to deal with this? she is genuinely one of the best humans I’ve had the pleasure of being friends with.",mentalhealth,My best friend is severely depressed and an addict... and wont come to terms with it,2019-01-31 04:05:14
91,TasmanischerTeufel,1548867906,1,"Hey guys, I need your advice and hope for some like-minded people or even better, advice from people who have already made it out of a derealization or the like.

I have been suffering for more than a month from the symptoms of a derealization which also caused sleep disorders and feel extremely helpless.

It was probably triggered by MDMA and / or cannabis.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I decided to take MDMA together and just have a good time. I have had only a few (very good) experiences with it so far. I used drugs always with respect and caution, I decided to start with a very small dose first. I was quite nervous and also noticed my quick beating heart after we drank it in the tea. That went on for over an hour. In the end she did not feel anything and I imagined feeling a bit of something, with which my nervousness disappeared. Because we hadn't much mdma left, we decided to smoke a joint.

My girlfriend was a little sick of it and felt uncomfortable. I took care of her and was very worried, my puls was high again.

After a few minutes everything was fine and we were able to go to sleep relatively quickly and easily.

&amp;#x200B;

The first hours of the next day were as if nothing had ever happened.

But then towards evening suddenly this feeling of a surreal perception came over me from . I did not know to assign it directly and got a little panic and got nervous. After a long walk, I went to sleep hoping that this feeling wouldn't come back afterward. But from then on, I was stuck in this dream world and it felt like I still had that high-feeling, which I imagined from the bit of MDMA, which we took the day before

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am now sitting a month later, eye edges to the chin and still with this disturbed perception, which still scares me a bit.

Every night I wake up prematurely and can not catch up at noon. As if my body would fight back against deep sleep. I know that the brain is probably just stressed out and now needs a lot of rest to leave this state, but this is only partially possible if my head does not let me sleep.

I do not know how to continue and I can not really explain how this happened. I had neither a panic attack or was depressed or something before. This nervousness / increased pulse should have been the trigger for a DP / DR? Maybe, I do not know.

I speculate that my brain may remain in the state where it expects the actually known serotonin release after taking MDMA and got stuck somewhere? I don't know. Maybe I'm just too scared.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm trying Tryptophan to find some more sleep and rest. And otherwise drink tea and persevere.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever had similar experience?

Would be glad if one or the other would contact me and have some advice. I'm relatively desperate. :)

92,Sea-Maxion,1548867903,1,"I think I need advice on how to move forward from here. When I first started high school, I had a busy schedule and an unrivaled (as my teachers called it) work ethic. I’d have school, a job, extracurricular commitments and home life that I constantly juggled. Even if I got 4-6 hours of sleep everyday, I woke up, drank water and was prepared for the new day. I had this even through middle school (before I had a job i’d always have some sort of internship or something) I always prided myself in my ability to work work work and it satisfied me. Being able to experience multiple things and get everything done so that I didn’t have to worry about it at a later time felt so satisfying and rewarding. Now lately, I don’t have that work ethic anymore nor do I enjoy doing the things I love(d) (theatre, my internship working with kids, school used to be so fun to me). Before it was just a random day here and there, but now It’s gotten to the point where for the past year (i’m a senior in high school now) I can’t even wake up every morning. Sometimes i’m stuck in bed and even if i’m awake and know I should move I would just lie here for 30 minutes and/or fall back asleep which makes me late for school or miss it entirely. I tell myself that I have to start my day and that if I stay home i’ll just beat myself up for missing school, but it’s like my body and mind are having a disconnect. Today (I should be in school right now, but i’m not because of this) I cried for half an hour because I couldn’t get up. When I force myself up I feel fatigue for the entire day and my body aches which makes me irritable and strains my friendships + relationship. When I try not to be irritable I just burst out crying and look crazy to everyone around me. If i’m not fatigued I feel stress and feel like I have a gray cloud over me for the entire day. I don’t want to be this way anymore, but I feel like there’s no way out of my consistent fatigue. It’s hurting my grades, my friendships and it’s making me just want to give up on everything. I talk to my parents about this, my mom thinks that I’m being hard on myself and that i’m fine (even though she comforts me about it). My dad just thinks that i’m being bullied at school and am running away from my problems.

94,PaesitoPaez,1548866682,1,"Hi guys! I have been thinking retrospectively about what media has had the biggest impact on my ""risky behavior"", and as a teenager I feel like being exposed to stuff like Skins (drug in taking as something casual), Twin Peaks (sexual promiscuity as a way to cope with sexual abuse) and more recently, Split (not considering self harm scars as something THAT stigmatized) has definitely had it's negative impact on me in the past. The most triggering things I've seen though have to be the 2003 movie Thirteen and the 2017 Netflix original, 13RW. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I saw Thirteen as a 14 year old who was going through a rough time and seeing self harm depicted as something similar to a drug made me want to try it, and I did. Just once. I immediately regretted it because someone saw and asked me about it and just made me feel ashamed. 

&amp;#x200B;

* 13RW was the worst for me however, at least season 1 was. I was extremely vulnerable when the show came out, so that was definetely my fault. A couple of unfortunate and traumatic events later and I became majorly depressed and actively suicidal. The day my dog died (the cherry on top) for example I cut myself with the hopes of dying, (definetely influenced by Hannah Baker's suicide)

Yeah, 13RW has been the most harmful for me, because I mean, the ending of the movie Thirteen atleast shows some bits of hope, and even though it is lesser known, it deals with mental health in a more in depth, accurate and nuanced way than the Hannah Baker storyline.

Share your experiences! What has been the most harmful for you? And how are you people?

Just for the record I am great right now. I'm about to turn 18, I have been clean from self harm and any type of suicidal behavior for five months or so and I feel this is my definite recovery.

96,GenericThrowaway9874,1548866194,1,"For Context:
I am a 17 year old male in the United States who is turning 18 within the next 2 months. I have been going to therapy for the past several months for depression and anxiety. My therapist has also said that I show symptoms of high functioning Autism and OCD. I live in a family that is very strict on certain things, very lax on others, but is largely arbitrary. My mother is the most controlling member of the family, and she rarely gives the excuse ""My House, My Rules"", but she pretty much always gives a generic excuse and gets upset with me if I come up with a counterargument.

Quite a while ago, when one of my half-siblings was about my age, (we'll call him Mark), he was having depression and anxiety issues too. They went to a mental health specialist, who royally messed everything up. From what my mother has said, it seems like the doctor/psychiatrist/therapist/etc. had horrible habits when it came to medicine; my brother went on the full dosage immediately upon starting the medication, and had horrible problems. He ended up in the hospital needing detox. Now my mother has decided that all mental health medication is evil, and she is refusing to listen to the advice of my therapist to at least consider medicine.

There is one exception however. My sister (Charlotte) has a litany of mental health issues: Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, PTSD (to name the ones I know she's diagnosed with.) She takes Buspar, and has for a significant amount of time. Because it's old, it must not have any unknown side effects! Because my sister has never had issues because of it, I never would too! Because Buspar is supposed to do poorly with people who are bipolar, and my sister takes it just fine, I must be able to take it with no issues too! Whenever I bring up the possibility of medication (which I don't necessarily want, but I do want the option of if things get worse or therapy stops working as well), my mother immediately defaults to Buspar or nothing. I know rationally that if we could talk to someone together and I could keep my mother in her seat long enough, she would be willing to listen (she's a champion of facts because she knows everything), but I can't imagine her pride would ever let her do this.

I am not going around my mother's back to get medication when I turn 18, because I believe that is reckless and irresponsible. I also don't have much incentive to take medication even with my mother's approval. Getting out of the house is not an option. I will still be on the family insurance plan and I will still not have a car or job when I turn 18, so I couldn't go around her back even if I wanted to.

i have a friend, and i am pretty sure she's depressed because she self harms and she just doesn't care most of the time. i understand her. i went through the same thing, except for the self harming part. what i don't understand is her care for a man who doesn't care about her. 

she said her depression started because of her family. but i don't think so. before she met the guy, she already knows there is something wrong with her family. she knows her parents doesn't talk anymore and only stayed together because of their children. she knows about her family problems and such. but she was fine then. she still cares. but ever since she met that guy, she truly lost it. i mean, i see that her family is one of the reason why she's like this but i don't think they started it. i think it was the guy. and i think she's only saying that it was her family who started it because she can't accept the fact that a guy, who doesn't care about her and is already breaking her heart, is also the reason of her depression. like she doesn't want to accept that this guy is the reason for her overall pain.

i just don't understand. we are always here for her. her friends. we never leave her even after her being stupid because of that guy. i'm annoyed every single damn time she talks about that guy. but i swear i never showed it. i listen to her still. i never complained and kept my feelings to myself and i just listen to her. because i know she just wants to let out of her feelings and i want to be that someone she needs. but still, her attention is to that guy. like she gives her entire energy being sad because of that guy. we want her to be with us. we don't care if she's gonna cry in front of us because of that shitty guy. we just want her to be with us. we want to be there for her. but she doesn't want it. instead she only cries about that guy. we invite her to hang out with us, just in a home, chilling out and do whatever the hell we/she wants. but she says no and instead i saw her in social media crying about that guy. wishing that shitty guy a well life even tho her life is not well because of him.

as i've said, i went through depression too. so i understand her. i would have understand her wanting to have some time alone for herself, i'll let her have that. but then spending that time crying because of a guy who doesn't care about her? she's supposed to spend that time for herself not for someone else. and that's what makes me somehow mad. the fact that she cares about a person who cares a little about her. because when i went through depression, all i want is for someone to give a little care for me. i know we went through different and we face this differently, but i just don't understand her way.

i know i sound selfish. but let it be selfish. because i don't want to think of her this way. i want to think of her as someone who's going through something and i don't want that something to be that shitty guy. i don't want to think that the reason of her self harming is that shitty guy. who doesn't care about her and is miles and miles away from her and is just causing her pain.",mentalhealth,i'm confused about my friend,2019-01-31 03:26:35

I've lost 3 people to suicide in the last 10 years.  In 8 of those 10 years we have been encouraging people through this initiative to talk more about mental health to reduce the stigma. While that's fine and dandy,  in my opinion, we have talked about mental health so much that I don't consider there to be that much of a stigma around the lack of discussion regarding mental health.   My concern is for those who desperately seek out mental health care, get turned away ,and then you wonder why they feel like they are a burden.  There ISN'T ENOUGH HELP.  Our healthcare system is broken.  


But if you throw someone with cancer in the mix,  they are helped right away.  There are tons of cancer awareness initiatives and fundraisers, and lots of corporate donations that pave the way for better healthcare when it comes to cancer treatment,  but when it comes to mental health,  it gets a backseat.

I know I’m going to transfer, but not until next fall, and even then I’m still terrified it will be even worse. Everything is stressing me out, from classes to dance team to my sorority. I have no friends, nobody who cares about me here and I can’t stop thinking about just ending it all because right now my life seems hopeless. In high school I would always tell myself that if life gets worse in college, I just need to end it... I don’t know what to do about it anymore...
Dance team is particularly stressful because I’m on their competition team, which competes every weekend until mid March, but I’m an alternate (aka I do everything except at competitions I just have to sit and watch the team, I don’t get to perform). We practice every morning and I waste every weekend at competition, and its driving me crazy because I’m doing all this work, but if the team were to win nationals I wouldn’t want a medal or anything... because I didn’t dance... it just all feels so pointless. The team would be better off without me. But I love dancing, so I don’t know what to do... Also my sorority is a joke, our meetings are at 10pm once a week and I don’t want to go to anything anymore, no one wants me there.
I try talking to my parents and they say my only options are 1. to stick it out until the end of the semester or 2. quit dance and my sorority and just focus on classes, but I would still have to stay in the dorms (which are excruciatingly lonely) and find a job to pay back the 2,000 dollars I’d lose from my dance scholarship. Neither options seem very good...

I just want to help my friend through whatever she is going through in the best way possible. We have been friends since yr 3 and she was a happy, cheerful person who liked socialising and trying out lots of extra-curricular activities. She never was stressed or was scared about acting, socialising, doing sport or doing public speaking. Her name is Sasha (not real name). Skip forward to yr 6 and we meet a new girl who shared similar interests to us. Her name is Lucy (again not real name). We grew quite close and it appeared that Lucy had had bipolar and depression. I asked if she got any professional help or went to a therapist and she told me that they wouldn’t understand her. I asked how she diagnosed herself and she said she took a online quiz/test that would she what mental illness you have. I told her if she truly felt that way she needed to get help and that I would always be there if she needed it. I then started getting messages till 5am in the morning from Lucy telling me that she was going to kill her self and that she was mentally unstable. This repeated for about 6 months and I started to get stressed. With a combination of other contributors to my stress, I started to break. I started pulling out my hair, picking scabs till they would scar, bitting nails and toenails and I started just crying in the middle of class. My parents knew about this but just assumed it was just my studies and I was ok. Lucy kept messaging me through all this still. It all ended when my Sasha told her to go kill herself if she was just going to repeat it over and over. Lucy did not kill herself and then blamed me for not being there for her and told me I should die. It went back to just me and Sasha being friends. Year 7, my mental health was still not in a good place and I had my panic attack according to my teacher and nurse while in class. I was also sent to the hospital for a violent isolated left hand tremor that had the most plausible cause being my high levels of anxiety and have had a psychiatrist diagnose me with anxiety, OCD and low spectrum autism. Year 8, Sasha started taking the self diagnose tests on mental illness. Her personality started to switch. She started making edgy jokes about how low her will to live is and how her life sucks. She started acting like she hated everyone in our class but when there was a social or a disco she would always force me to go, she started talking about how much hand sanitiser she needed to get rid of the germs when she spoke someone’s hand yet didn’t even use the hand sanitiser, started not participating in PE because she felt anxious going in the pool at school yet when we have a catch up at a friends house is okay to swim, started biting nails and then always made note to other people that she was biting her nails, has been for councillor but left because they asked if she wanted to go see a psychiatrist, often makes random conversations about death, she told me she was Poly and I said that it was great that she could tell me and be open about it then doesn’t know the difference between bisexual and poly. This was all observations from last year. I decided to move schools but still keep in contact. Today Sasha said that she had a panic attack during drama. I asked if she was ok because I had been through it before and it was not a nice feeling. She said that it wasn’t that bad and she just collapsed on the floor and was sent to the nurse. I don’t remember my panic attack being like that at all. My knees did give in, but I felt like I couldn’t breathe and really nauseous. I asked another friend and she said she just looked like she fell over and she didn’t look to stressed at all. I don’t know if I’m overthinking things or if I should try and reach out and persist on taking her to get some help

106,kcexactly,1548856357,1,"My childhood was rough. I was beat me a lot. There is no question in anyone's mind that I was abused if I would go into details. I have physical and mental scars from it. My psychologist said I learned to lie as a survival mechanism because I didn't want to get hurt.

I also have a very physical and emotional reaction to abandonment. This is from always seeking someone that would love me. It also stems from the fact that my parents sent me away to the state as a young child because they just didn't want me around anymore. My abandonment issue is stirred up by literally being abandoned by manipulations catching up with me.

I don't mean to cause others problems. I am just afraid of what I will lose. In my head it is like I want everyone to love me but I always think everyone has some vendetta against me. I have been blessed with good intelligence. I can usually size up someone well. I can sometimes make a strong guess at their motives or reactions to situations.

I have had a successful career for a long time. I can also say I am usually very good under extreme pressures. I have a high risk job. I have saved a lot of lives in my time. I have seen a lot of death. I have seen things that some others couldn't even imagine. It doesn't usually affect me much. The only time it bothers me is when it is kids.

Right now my marriage is a wreck. I don't know if it can be salvaged. It isn't something I can wave a magic wand to fix. I wish I could be the hero in this situation. It really has to do with the other person wanting to try. I don't know if they have it in them. I think I used that last manipulation up. I finally came clean. It hurt. But, since I did I have this very somber feeling in me. I was anxious before. All I could think was when is the time to blow my head off and get off this roller coaster that is my life.

If I feel like I have been wronged I get very anxious. I get scared. I panic. I lie to cope. I don't even mean to hurt with my lies. I just want the pain to stop. I always seek gratification or acceptance. I am just fucked up. Anyone have a good book to read about the problems I am describing. I am just shit full of this part of myself. I want to be a wholesome person. I want my spouse to be proud that they are with me. I don't want to lay awake at night for hours of dread. I just want it to stop.

I know it might not be easy. But, I am so damn sincere that I want this fixed. I want it fixed fast. I want to fix it right. I know why I do the things I do now. I want to know how to confidently know I won't do them anymore. I have no more lies to tell. No more bending the truth or manipulations. No more fear of what others think.

109,ahhokayegg,1548855122,1,"Hey! Here is a list of coping skills that have helped me personally with a lot of my symptoms ! Please comment your favorite coping skills below and we can make a nice list! 

1) self portraits!
When I am afraid of my reflection or don't recognize myself I draw what I think I look like. It's usually an ugly horrible picture but it helps me process the emotions and rationalize that I don't actually look the way I think. 

2) cry- list! 
As someone who deals with emotional numbness I often don't cry or feel anything at home, which leads to outbursts in school/ public. To help that I have a go-to list of movies, books, and songs that make me cry! (My favorite book to cry with is the little Prince, and my favorite song is ""I love you"" from the 25th annual Putnam county spelling bee musical!)

3) math/ numbers ! 
When I start to feel too overwhelmed with my surroundings I like to close my eyes, take deep breaths and go through basic addition and subtraction problems! Just simple stuff, or even counting in general. It takes the focus away from the situation and helps me calm down.

4) layers/ comfy clothes ! 
This is more of a preventative strategy but I learned the hard way that uncomfortable or too much clothing can be a huge factor for me when having sensory issues. I always make sure I have on a thin tee-shirt under any sweater or jacket so if I start to get too hot it can be taken off, and I always have a jacket or something with me in case of feeling too vulnerable. It sounds silly but it's really important that everything I wear is the correct texture / temperature/smell so I don't freak out! 

5) no bed box! 
I really struggle with not laying in my bed for entire days/ weeks at a time. So next to a chair in my room I have a box with a few activities in it like knitting, coloring, reading, ect. With a little list of things I can do in it. I have the mental agreement of ""you can get back in bed when you do (activity)"" and I usually can stay out of bed for a bit longer this way! I also try to keep my phone out of my bed (this is the hardest one) but it helps so much when I can push through it! 

Hope these help someone!

110,leannereddits,1548854453,1,"Kinda looking to just vent/any suggestions for getting back to feeling like me again I guess. Also on mobile so sorry for shit formatting! 

Been feeling quite...different as of late? Had a bad situation happen about 3 months ago and I’ve gotten over that but I just feel not myself at all. I’m not motivated to go to school at all (lmao it is week 3 and I’ve skipped 8 classes oops). Nothing specific has happened to make me not want to go I just don’t want to go. And then take a “personal day”. At the start of the school semester, I was going to take 6 courses rather than 5 as I’m technically going to be behind 1 credit currently. As the sem went on, I was not going to class and then decided 5 is fine and I’ll just take 2 in summer school. Well I fucked up and now I have to take 4 classes as I have been so unmotivated I just glanced at the outlines and in one course, first of all mandatory attendance and second of all, there was a mandatory assignment that if you don’t do you don’t pass the course due the first week that I didn’t know about or do. Fuck okay fine now I’m in 4 classes. I just feel so burnout with school I have fucking 0 desire to go at all or do the work. I have a year and a half to go but I don’t know I’m so burnout with school it’s not even funny. 

And like I feel different. My anxiety and stress has gone down significantly but it’s been replaced with just I guess a not caring instead? And instead of getting super frequent headaches- I still get them but not as much now- it’s been replaced with like nervous tummy I guess??

Work is a little bit better but I’ve noticed I’m not feeling it as much either. I really liked this job and my coworkers and I was always down to work a ton (example: I would volunteer to do double shifts during Christmas break just because why not! I wanted to work every shift and was down to go to different locations too! Boss had to cut me tho as she didn’t want me into OT which was fine with me) but now I’m just like...meh about it and if my work best friend leaves (she’s at the end of her patience with our workplace) I’m out too. 

Another thing I have noticed is that I’ve been sleeping way more. Which is great I love sleep and have been having fantastic deep sleeps. But it’s weird before I would be able to wake up the second the alarm went off and then stay awake. But now it’s like I don’t even hear the alarm or I’ll shut it off right away and then go back to sleep. 

The winter I think is making all this worse too as I hate being cold; especially wet and cold. 
Like I don’t want to say I’m getting worse or anything but I can FEEEL that I’m not myself here and I don’t know how to really get back to being me; because before idk I was a pretty rad person and now it’s like...I can see it in my eyes it’s not me.

So, I don't know how to start this but here we go anyways. Ever since I thought about death, I feel disconnected with the world. 
I really can't think. I feel like my reflexes are dying and just feel like weird. the experience has been really weird. it feels like its a flash and I can't think clearly. 
Idk if i have started to feel more aware or less. but I defenitly don't feel real.  my thoughts are puzzled. fuck, I can barely write here because I can't think clearly. but one of my major things i have noticed are:
-Colors dont feel right. 
-no sense of time.  
-always feel tired ( getting sleep of 8 hours) 
-cannot concentrate at lectures. 
-everything feels like flash (like you see in a movie you know when they have to show multiple scene at once)
-conversations feel weird. cant hear that nicely(feels like im going deaf as i will def miss a couple of sentences) 
I will be sitting and listening and suddenly I will either forget, or didnt even hear a part of the conversation i am at.
and my memory is going shit (how will it go to shit when i cant think?) anyways, I might have felt this before this thought of death, but i just feel more aware and I CAN'T break out of it. feels like im going fucking crazy (or was I always crazy?)

112,Ikari1212,1548852550,1,"Hello everyone. I posted this on the schizophrenia subreddit but I thought I might get some input here, too. 

If this post is wrong here I apologize. feel free to delete my post then.  


So. Long story short my sister got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I always knew she was accentuated in her character and that she didnt comply 100% with the general public - which is fine. Our parents are very difficult so I didnt think anything of it really. I myself am visiting a psychiatrist once a week for my own personal problems.

But back to my sister: Like I said, she had those accentuations and a strong personality (she basically tortured me my whole childhood. she is 4.5 years older than me). But 3 weeks ago she started full out hallucinating. hearing voices, seeing people, running around in the cold for the whole of 4-7 days (we are not sure since she cant remember) and not sleeping at home. We managed to get her into emergency mental care after not being able to find her for 4 days. She thought she was getting hexed by our mother and that she needed to flee the city since she thought she murdered someone. With her husband - she is single though.

&amp;#x200B;

She has also accumulated around 1k€ in dept - it wouldve been around 5 or 6 but my parents paid for her expenses so far. 

Now she is in the open psychiatric ward in our university clinic. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problems and worries right now are the following:

1. The doctors are not allowed to talk to us since they have a confidentiality clause and my sister doesnt want the doctors to talk to us. We think she is not honest with the doctors (she was allowed to spend 1 night at home again and started hearing the same voices/cracks/screeching in the walls as before. when I told her she should tell her psychiatrist she only responded very angrily ""THERE IS ONLY ONE SOLUTION! THE GUY NEEDS TO GET A NEW BED OR I NEED TO MOVE OUT"". for the record - again.) 
2. she is back to a very dangrous state which she already had in november. she received 1.7k€ from my parents to get her tooth fixed. she spent that money on god knows what. Then there came the bill for the tooth which my parents paid again - another 1.7k. Before that she went to the hair stylist about 4-5 times and got a new hair cut/coloring. another 1k€. because of that all her hair is broken. Now on her first day out (last friday) the first thing she does is go to the hair stylist again and spend another 700€ on hair extensions since her normal hair is so broken because of all of the stylist visists- even though me and my cousin (the person she normally confides in) told her to just PLEASE wait to let the hair grow out. in the clinic she shouldnt be too worried about her hair. Now after all that we dont know how she is gonna pay for rent since her account is maxed out. And she is spending money aimlessly all the time. I told my parents not to pay for anything since insurance should cover those costs if she is diagnosed. Right now she is on medical leave and the health insurance pays her 70 or 60% of her normal earnings.
3. We are worried since she was able to once again spend 700€ on a hair dresser appointment and the doctors dont want to talk to us. She gives us the impression that she is also lying to them so that she might be getting out of the clinic sooner. Her goal is - thats what she told me - that she wants to get out of there as quickly as possible without ANY medication. And according to her thats also what the doctors told her. in my opinion that HAS to be a lie. since:
4. She spent the day/night at home. but she didnt sleep in her bed. It looked exactly the same as we left it 3 weeks ago when we FINALLY managed to convince her to go to the psychiatric emergency room. (I was able to take a peek since she told me to bring her dirty laundry to her appartment so she could wash it the next weekend she gets home). 
5. The doctors told us to not make her angry. Thats why we complied with everything she asked of us so far. Getting her new clothes for 160€. rescheduling her doctors appointments she missed due to her state of mental ""impairment""(? sorry. I dont mean to offend noone. she just wasnt accountable for her action at that time) etc.
6. And also when she got home she went back to her old patterns. She went to the restraurant and apparently everyone looked at her weirdly because ""YOU KNOW WHY!"" (caps because she got angry at me asking as of why. I dont know why? she is good looking and young. ) There apparently are also cameras in the smoke alarm system and she wants to take them down (which will warrant a penalty by the home owner since they pre-installed them. I also told her that)

&amp;#x200B;

I am really sorry if this train of thoughts is kinda confusing. I am german so translating my excited thoughts into proper english is pretty hard. 

I probably forgot a lot of facts but basically what I am worried about is 

1: that she gets evicted out of her apparment since she is on medical leave and just buys stuff constantly. 

2: that she is lying to the doctors, gets out, gets off medication and starts hallucinating again and this time might kill herself

3: that she will not accept her diagnosis - ever.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I tried talking nice to her about the stuff she is worried about like: ""Hey. you are always saying that your neighbours are bothering you and are making scratching sounds in the walls and that they are wispering to you. have you told your therapist about it? I tell my therapist that kind of stuff always"". If I do that she gets angry and answers like I stated before that she needs to move out or the neighbours need to shut the f\*\*\* up.   
Do I stop this and actually start playing good cop bad cop with my cousin? the main ""care"" is provided by me and my cousin. So I am thinking I am the one talking to her real straight that she needs to focus and that these things are part of her diagnosis and that she NEEDS to start talking to her doctors about it. She also doesnt talk to our parents since they ""hex"" her and ""curse"" her. 

she calls them on the phone sometimes now though after a few weeks have passed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am really at an impasse here and I dont know how to approach her and what to do. everything I say and every sound advice I give she gets REAL mad and shouts at me. I fear that being nice and polite isnt the right approach anymore. but I am affraid to make her angry since the doctors told us not to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice and help is appreciated. 

Thank you everyone. cheers.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: We already contacted our local group for family members of schizophrenia patients. the meetings dont start until march though. me and my cousin fear if we wait that long she will be back to sleeping on the streets in the cold and that she might throw herself in front of a bus or something.

PPS: I hope this doesnt count as ""medical"" advice since I am merely asking how to approach her. ",mentalhealth,My sister got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia,2019-01-30 23:49:10

I went through something nearly a decade ago. Basically, my partner at the time nearly raped me. I say nearly because he touched me up while he was drunk and we were in bed half asleep, and wouldn't take no for an answer. Then tried to force my bottoms down with me trying to push him away. It wasn't until I started flailing my arms and legs about crying that he gave up and stopped. I pulled up my bottoms, and cried wrapped up in a blanket at the end of the sofa we were sleeping on. I couldn't stand to be near him. And couldn't stop crying. He seem to realise the extent of his actions and apolosiged but I wabted to just be away from him. But after that day, I pretended it never happened. We carried on dating for another half a year or so, I was still upset when we broke up, we never spoke of it after that night, and nothing like it ever happened again.

I went on with my life not telling anyone, and pretended it never happened. I was not the victim type, so I don't know whether I had somehow rationalized it or excused him in my mind, but I managed to go on in life as normal.

.... Come last night. I was watching a programme that had a rape scene in it. It isnt the first rape scene I have watched since the ordeal, and none of them have ever really 'triggered' me. But last night was different. It was like something in me snapped, and cake to terms with what had happened or almost happened. I felt sick, almost threw up, balled my eyes out and couldnt stop shaking. The memory just kept replaying over and over in my head. I told my now partner about it who is trying to be there for me as best as he can. He is the only one that knows. But I didnt think this was possible? Surely after 9 years of ignoring it and suppressing it and being ok, I can't suddenly be experiencing all the trauma now can I? I can't get it out of my head. My partner keeps trying to support me but the little touches now make me uncomfortable.

I don't want to exist. I hate myself etc. Yet the doctor says this is the symptom of depression. 

I was never abused, I'm loved by my parents etc. So I shouldn't be depressed. Yet here I am, not feeling right. Feeling hopeless. 

I know, depression can reach anyone, no matter what status they are in. But to me, I feel like I don't deserve to pity myself. I've never endured serious hardships yet, (Well I was bullied but that part isn't fully responsible for my depression, some of it can be but not full, that I can say). I've never been abused by anyone etc.

So I feel like I don't deserve it. I should be alright. 

Does this sound mean? I don't think it does but I'm not sure either. Maybe I'm not depressed but just... something. My mother makes it sound that way. I know she thinks it like ""Just man up"". But she doesn't say that, or at least wants it to be that way. And I too want to think that way.

126,throwyahandsintheair,1548830547,1,"Hi,

I’m sorry about the long read. 

I have a long history of treatment depression and was an inpatient previously in 2011 and 2013 where I had ECT twelve and ten times respectively. 

Since my discharge in 2013, I have mainly spent 2013-2018 barely coping with various medications that having slightly improved my depression and anxiety but have not been in remission or anywhere near it. 

Mid last year my doctor was at loss of how to treat me after I refused to go back as an inpatient to have ECT as I found it to be a traumatic experience that has affected me to this day, so he decided to ask a colleague for a second opinion. 

The second opinion came back and recommended two antidepressants, Bupropion and Nardil. 

I started Bupropion in October last year at a dose of 300mg and it didn’t help and I went downhill fast and started to get very depressed towards of the end of December / beginning of January. 

At the beginning of January it got to a point of where I wasn’t functioning and was not going able to go to work so I decided to go in as an inpatient to better manage my medication change over even though I was never keen on going back as an inpatient as I found the whole experience traumatising. 

I was admitted to hospital two weeks to this day and this is where it was recommended that I have ECT again. 

Being at rock bottom I just went along with this recommendation as I had nothing to lose and I thought that I could endure a course of about eight to ten ECT sessions. 

After four sessions I started to experience intense anxiety, panic and agitation and on Sunday night this week I was physically sick at the thought of ECT on Monday morning. 

I advised the nurses on Sunday night that there was no way I could go through ECT as I was about to jump out of my skin at the thought of going through the procedure again. 

ECT was cancelled on Monday and my doctor was contacted and I saw him yesterday. 

I was basically chastised by my doctor and I was told that I was being a difficult patient and that he was having difficulty treating me as I was always dictating my treatment regime. 

He also advised that if I didn’t agree to continue ECT that he would not be able to see me as a patient anymore as I was ‘boxing him in’ (whatever that means) and that he would not be prescribing the medication (Nardil) that we agreed that we would try. 

He basically said it’s my way or the high way, and that he’ll see me again tomorrow to find out what I want to do. In other words think about it but make sure you choose ECT. 

The day prior to my inpatient admission I also stopped Bupropion which I was chastised about for taking treatment into my own hands. I only stopped this medication as it was my view that I would be starting a new medication when I came into hospital and fully disclosed this to him. 

I feel like I’ve been given an ultimatum to go through a treatment that has caused me extreme distress. I also feel like I’m being blackmailed now in relation to my medication and whether I will be discharged as there’s no point staying here now. 

I’m also in the position where I’m un-medicated, extremely distressed I’m actually getting worse by being in hospital. 

I’m at loss of what to do and would appreciate some advice and support. 

Thank you. ",mentalhealth,I’ve been an inpatient for 2 weeks and I’m getting worse,2019-01-30 17:42:27
127,S-E-N-T-I-E-N-T,1548827512,1,"To start off, I was diagnosed with ADD as a toddler, but I don't see how this can relate to my current situation.

It all started in November. I was preparing for semester finals along with the ACT, madrigal feast (singing renaissance pieces in front of a dining audience), and 2 orchestral performances. I had *way* to much stress. I taking the ACT to see if I was applicable for a high school that I was interested in. I'd say I have mild stage fright. It's not enough for me to have an anxiety attack during a performance, but I stop what I'm doing sometimes because of anxiety. This anxiety isn't just limited to performing with an instrument or presenting a project. Anything that reveals your skill level of anything can cause distress of varying degrees. This could be playing a video game, competing in math competitions, competitive running, artistic abilities, sharing personal thoughts with others, driving, or talking about academics. Maybe this background information is useful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, all of this sparked curiosity about anxiety, so I started reading about anxiety online. I started learning about multiple anxiety disorders and originally felt like I related to the ""performance only"" of S.A.D (Social Anxiety Disorder). I felt relieved that there was an explanation for what I was feeling and asked my parents if I could be screened. I've been struggling with stage fright for all of my life, and have been surrounded with comments like ""everybody has it, you just need to get over it"" and ""you're just being overdramatic"". This relief also followed with skepticism. I watched videos and read articles about people's experiences with social anxiety and I was beginning to question the severity of my proclaimed symptoms. I decided to question my mom about her experiences with anxiety, and her responses only weakened my confidence. I eventually decided that I wasn't suffering from SAD. I was uncomfortable with this, as the security of knowing where this anxiety was coming from faded. I felt like what I was feeling wasn't *enough.* Maybe this is normal and I'm just oversensitive. For a brief time I started looking into GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) since the symptoms were described as weaker than any other anxiety-related disorder. It didn't take long for this transition to occur, and I realized this. I swore to myself to never think of these things again, but that proved to be extremely difficult. If I experienced anxiety then there would be a storm of unwanted thoughts connecting what I felt to possible illnesses. These thoughts are completely unintentional and intrusive, and it scares me. I don't want them anymore and I find myself in a constant state of self-pity. I'm always saddened during the night, guaranteed. I tried to stop these thoughts at one point with self-talk like ""You're not suffering from anything, you're just sensitive. Get over it."" This hasn't helped in the slightest. My mental health has weakened so much that I started cutting myself somewhere in the beginning of December. This makes it even worse because of the idea that I could be subconsciously doing that for attention. It gives a feeling of control over my thoughts, but for a brief time. What occurs next is a feeling of worthlessness and remorse. I'd cut at least once every day for the first 3 weeks, but after seeing the amount of scares forming on my thigh I decided to change, to resist those urges. I've been improving ever since, and I'm now on my first week blade-free. I was improving mentally as well until my girlfriend almost killed herself two days ago. She never said anything in regards to her motives, I was only told the day after. All of the invasive thoughts have come back, but changed intentions. They're no longer just about anxiety, but also depression. I just want them to go away. Most days I'm either on the brink of tears, discontent with the day, tired, or desensitized. I've also been eating less than usual, going consecutive days without eating breakfast and lunch. I don't want to get assistance because I don't like talking about this to others. It might seem like I'm trying to gain attention by intentionally hurting myself physically/mentally. I don't think I am, but my confidence about almost anything has completely vanished. I haven't thought about consulting forums until today, and feel much more comfortable with it because of the anonymity. I'm just extremely desperate and am looking for answers.",mentalhealth,Confused and Depressed (maybe?),2019-01-30 16:51:52

After I graduated college in 2011, I needed a job fast and applied for anything that peaked my interest.  I got hired on one of the largest police departments in the country (U.S.). I thoroughly enjoyed the first few years and got a lot out of helping people.  Although I had a very stressful job, I always handled it well. Fast-forward five years: I’m married and my wife is 8 months pregnant with our first child. 

I’m dispatched to a call involving an infant that’s not responding. I was very close to the call and arrived before EMS.  I was met by the parents running out of their house to me with their 3-day old baby.  I did everything I was trained to do until EMS arrived, then they took over.  The child didn’t make it. 

My supervisor could see I was affected and I met with  our departments Psych-services.  Three sessions over a course of about a week and I was told I was suffering from PTSD.  I was pretty straightforward with the Dr. that I didn’t agree. I felt like that was for soldiers who endured something horrendous while in a war zone. 

Three weeks later my daughter is born, I had banked a lot of time and took a 4 week FMLA.  One of the first nights we were back home from the hospital, my wife and I discussed me not going back to policing.  I could take a lump sum of my 5 years of paying into the pension and that would supplement about a years pay.   This would let me transition into a stay at home dad, take care of our daughter, and get my MBA online (something that was a goal of mine).

While at home, I was obsessive over my daughter’s well-being. Any indication that she was choking and it would create such an immense amount of stress that it would impact me for hours or days. 

Let February I went back to work after finishing my MBA.  I have a nice position, which when compared to my prior law enforcement, doesn’t have hardly any stress. However, I find myself struggling with anxiety and stress all the time. I constantly lose sleep at night because I can’t shut out the stress.  I began seeing a therapist before the holidays and she’s saying the same thing that I was told years ago: PTSD.

How do I tell her that it's also because I'm scared my hospital related PTSD will flare up and I'll have an anxiety attack in the middle of a strange hospital miles away from home when I'm on crutches and can't escape or run away from my problems? Fuck... I need a therapist lmao.

146,amiafflicted,1548812276,1,"I think im invincible to any type of emotional pain. As in i cant have my heart broken, i dont require constant companionship, i dont care if people lie to me, i dont care if they hate me or think im stupid or weird or whatever. i dont think im better or worse than anyone else and even if someone was better or worse i dont care. i dont hate anyone but sometimes ill distance myself from them if i dont prefer their company. i think im capable of being empathetic to others and i think im nice to other people. ill lie if it wont hurt them and i don’t think theyll find out. its more of a social lubrication to me, just makes convos flow more easily.  ive picked up this habit from upsetting people with the truth. 

ive fallen in love before and people have fallen in love with me. my longest relationship is 2 years ish. im in my early 20’s and im not particularly religious. in middle school/high school i was pretty shy and cared too much about what other people thought. then i kind of ‘bloomed’ and had a lot of friends and to be honest i didnt like having all those friends. it almost became a chore to maintain relationships with them and the drama was just obnoxious. i moved and while im still on good terms with a lot of my old buddies our relationship kind of died with the distance. i think im happier like this though. i used to hate being lonely but now i prefer my solitude. i dont want to get married or have kids but im the last of my bloodline and id hate to do that to my parents and stuff. my goal in life is to sort of be someones ‘rock.’ but for multiple people. i want to do it anonymously. Margaret Atwood summed it up pretty well - unnoticed and necessary. 

i think my mindset stems from my philosophy on love in that love is qualitative not quantitative as in you either love somethin or you dont - you cant love something/someone more than another. you either love it and maybe like the other thing a lot. i also think to truly love something you should love it unconditionally. even if it changes. and if something you love changes enough it becomes something else entirely. so following that logic in order to truly love something you have to love everything. i dont think you should be compelled to dote on every person you meet and i think its ok to love something from a distance. this way of thinking has led me to concern myself with why someones doing a certain thing, how they justify their actions because no one truly thinks they are an evil person so they rationalize it somehow. granted some delude themselves more than others but it is what it is. most people believe theyre a victim of something or someone and i cant help but sympathize for their situation, even if theyve only deluded themselves into believing that their ‘minor’ hardship is worse than what it actually is. while i do feel this way ive begun investing less in people themselves simply because theyre so unreliable. i dont fault them for it but i dont really trust anyone with anything i cant afford to lose or let anyone get too close to me. 

some people noticed how numb i am to peoples ‘abuse’ of me and my use of deception to make people feel better and they all think something is wrong with me. some call me a sociopath others say im ‘damaged goods’ and more say im just fucked up in the head. sometimes i think im fucked up in the head but even if i am, i’m pretty okay with it. it saves me a lot of pain and allows for less drama in my life leaving me to focus on things that matter more to me. getting upset over something that doesnt really effect me seems so childish and primitive. 

lately ive been catching myself referring to other people as humans and on the surface i feel like my whole mindset would make me seem arrogant but i dont think im arrogant in the slightest. at the same time im not sure if im the best judge for that either. the reason im posting this is i want someone to to tell me if this fits some type of mental disorder or if i should stop thinking this way. i dont really want to stop thinking this way but im starting to become alarmed at how ive alienated my self perceived identity from my idea of humanity along with other people telling me im fucked up in the head. 

its hard for me to explain everything that goes on in my head but this is the best i can do. sorry if it doesnt make sense. also if i come off as arrogant i dont mean to. like i said i dont think or care if humans are any better or worse than me. reading through it i think i sound like some teenager who thinks hes figured everything out which is humbling i suppose but not what i was going for:p

148,throwaway19x2,1548812063,1,"In therapy for six years now.   Mid 40’s male.    Crazy chaotic childhood that I’m apparently going to spend my whole adulthood recovering from. 

I had developed some coping strategies that got me through life before therapy.   Granted I had dysfunctional relationships and kind of lived in a fantasy world but it kinda worked.

Six years later, three therapists later, a misdiagnosis later, group therapy later... and I just feel terrible.

I’m in the best physical shape ever.   Developed good habits. I journal, meditate, work out. I don’t drink or do drugs. 

Dropped the “toxic” people from my life which is what everyone told me to do.    But now I’m just alone.   Except for my therapist and therapy group and close family (who live far away.) 

I miss my friends. I miss my “craziness.”   I was my LIFE.

I don’t know.... maybe I just haven’t gotten to the good part.   But I’m kinda sick of the inherent superiority that therapeutic professionals bring to all of this.   I’m tired of the jargon: projection, codependency, narcissism,  abuse, paranoia... etc etc etc.   there’s just something about all the labeling that just sucks all the joy... all the spontaneity from living.

I sometimes feel empty inside, like I am putting on an act. 

When I was dating my girlfriend, I dont know whether I cared about her or the idea of her. Whether I was insecurely infatuated and just wanted to physical affection and sex or genuinely in love. I feel like it is the former

At the same time, I both want to have friends, but I dont like talking (I like doing stuff with them like video games so I can drift off into my own mind but still be with them) except if I joking around with the group or talking about deep shit (mostly my own problems). I like to keep to myself doing my own things

I sometimes fear that I am BPD, HPD, or even a full blown sociopath. I can be melodramatic. I am anxious about how people see me or about if I am a good person but I don’t really care about the events in my life (like my college career or getting off campus housing) I just want to avoid conflict and keep to myself. Be a recluse. 

I am diagnosed OCD, but I feel as if there is more dysfuntion to my personality. 

On top of all that, even though I am aware of all these problems, I can’t bring myself (or I dont want to) change. I dont want to deprive myself of the pity and self pity I crave because I dont know how to live without it, but I know it is destroying me. 

Any advice?

150,SantaOMG,1548811049,1,"Ok so I've been feeling like this for years. I feel like my mind is stuck in the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first smartphone in 2012 when I was 18 years old. Ever since then I have been in group chats with friends and we text back and forth every single day. I also use youtube a lot. I don't think a day goes by without me getting on youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my MAIN life is in my phone. In those group texts, in youtube/facebook. And I feel my actual life in the real world is my SECONDARY life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even use IG, or SC. And I really don't use my phone that much anymore. I don't look at it during work hours and I only look at it maybe an hour or 2 a day at most. I don't even really compulsively think about things that are happening online, it's just like I'm relating everything that happens in my REAL life to my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm never alone. I feel like no matter when or where I am, people are looking at me or judging me. And I feel like I'm always with people because of the connectivity of the internet and the group texts that I'm in.

&amp;#x200B;

I have taken breaks from my phone here and there. Some for a week, some for 2 weeks, etc. It has helped me stop being totally addicted to my phone, but it hasn't helped my little issue. I can go a week without phone or internet no problem. Maybe I should do it again?

158,clinkclinkclink,1548806774,1,"Ever since I can remember I was sad. I had a rough childhood and awful teenage years. There was abuse and neglect and drugs and alcohol at a young age. 
I attempted suicide and nearly managed it three times, and minor attempts were made more times than I can count. For years I didn't look crossing the road because I was okay with a car hitting me.

I developed psychosis and needed 5 medications at once and a year of therapy.

Yesterday I went on a long walk through a beautiful place, with dogs and sunshine and a wooly hat.

Today I worked at a job I couldn't dream of as a teenager and I know I will go on to do better things in the very near future.

All my loved ones are safe, I never even thought that would be a possibility. 

I have a partner who is loving, who I respect and who respects me and makes me feel amazing every day. Our relationship is beyond functional and I didn't know people could love each other so well.

As a kid I slept in the living room with my whole family for a month because we couldn't afford to have a hole in our roof covered or go else where in the middle of winter. Two days ago I slept in a giant bed in a hotel in Paris, after visiting the Louvre and smiling almost all day.

Things get better. You get better. Just because you can't see how or the whole way, does not mean you will not and cannot get better. All you have to do is hold on. Hold on and wait out the parts that are unfair and don't make sense and aren't okay. Do it today and don't think about tomorrow if you can't bare to. Then do it all again. 

(This part works as a TLDR;)

Because things change and you change and the world will keep turning and turning you and things will change whether you like it or not.

And to you, and to little me, you are worthy and you are important and this is important. Bad things are not forever, they are beyond painful and nightmares might never stop and you will be working on yourself maybe forever but you are worth it and I love you. 
 
I can't believe my luck, because it is not luck. I held on and I got through because I am worth every drop of the pain and the waiting and I would do if again to know what I know now.

You are worthy and I know you're going to be alright so keep going, just a bit further. You're nearly at the good bit.

Youre maybe thinking, what about her friends? Family?

My mother will claim I am attention seeking, whether I have a stomach bug or Im drop dead exhausted (as I usually am after work) my mother doesn’t think my well being is as serious as my siblings, she will ask me to run errands such as cleaning or go to the shops for her and take it personal if I say I am not feeling very well, it puts me off wanting to talk to her about my suspected depression.

My siblings and I don’t talk about that kind of stuff. Period.  We just weren’t raised in that kind of household.

I could potentially talk to the guy I’m seeing but I don’t want to scare him off, I’ve tried talking to him about being stressed about school but he has told me to just , to put it bluntly,“suck it up”. I know he means well and is trying to toughen me up, I’m quite a sensitive person and his tough childhood has made him seemingly cold.

I actually have spoken to my friends in the past about feelings of depression, in the beginning the listened and tried to offer their advice but I just didn’t think anyone understood how deep my feelings of emptiness went; it was difficult to describe as I couldn’t put a finger on what was wrong specifically when they asked. Nowadays, when I say I’m sad they make a joke of it and ask when am I ever NOT sad.

I’ve tried to convince myself I only need myself and have tried to write in a diary but I feel as though I really need someone to just be neutral. This probably sounds like a therapist (something I should probably look into) but I’m under 18, and my parents (being African) don’t really take mental disorders seriously and wouldn’t allow it. Plus, how could I fit it into my busy life? Working two jobs and at full time education?

I know there is something seriously wrong with me and there’s no one to help me, i feel very alone and while depression is something that can be treated, i can’t help to feel like i am going to feel this way forever.

185,justathrowaway1450,1548787463,1,"I want to try to keep this short because I’m all over the place right now.

I dropped out of college two years ago and moved back to my hometown. I have worked for my mom for the past year. Between her small business and her new real estate ventures, she is very successful. I was told back when I was 16, I would one day inherit ownership of the store despite having an older brother that is just as capable as I am. So I admittedly got lazy in school because I knew that I would be alright in life despite my fuckups. Obviously, that was the wrong way to think and I should not have been that way and I take 100% ownership for the part of my life.

But since returning home, I’ve done everything I could to change that about myself. And I really did do so. I am without a doubt the best employee she has and do everything and anything that she has ever asked of me when it comes to work. I work my ass for her business and all of the properties she has purchased over the past year and ones that have become vacant that need renovations. So one day, after having a falling out with a roommate, my mother offered me her nicest house for face value and offered to do very nice renovations such as new hardwood floor, appliances etc. And it would be all completely paid for because I had a stock account worth a substantial amount and my grandma also pitched in a little because she has given every grandkid a bit of money in the early part of their adulthood to give them a little kickstart in life.

But this is where is starts to get shitty. My mom has by no means hid that fact that she is a complete control freak. And she has very obviously thought very little of me since I have dropped out of school despite going above and beyond her expectations. So I have lived in that house for about 3-4 months now and it is supposed to be 100% mine and completely paid for. Come to find out later, which I should have caught on to early but I’m young and dumb and thought I could trust my own mom, but she has never signed the house over to me. She still owns the house completely despite paying 5 figures for the house plus renovations. It has been a week long fight to where she finally caved and is getting her lawyer to sign the house over to me which is supposed to be done by Thursday, and I have verified that with the lawyer myself. 

But I broke the camels back when I told her that she has attempted to steal from me and that is something that will leave a permanent mark on our relationship. She flipped out and said that if I really think that then I could go find somewhere else to work and then called the police saying I wanted to kill myself which I would get taken away for since I have had to be committed a couple months ago (because of another fight over her control issues). She has slowly been convincing my family that I’m crazy since I was originally diagnosed with depression, and only depression, and constantly accuses me of not taking my medications whenever I become vocal about her control issues.

Since she called the police, I had to go hide at a friends house until tomorrow at the earliest and I am utterly lost. I’m mostly waiting for my friends mom to get off work so I could talk to her because she has always been helpful for me before. I have no job, she has taken every dime I had saved, and she is probably going to keep the house since the transfer was never finalized. I have completely nothing right now and I have no family to rely on. I don’t want to harm myself but fuck I don’t want to be alive anymore. It has been constant battles since moving back and literally the only things I hated about my life was her. Everything else was completely perfect outside of her choking grasp.

195,Evening_Throwaway,1548781908,1,"Disclaimer: This is long.

I had a really strange experience from 2016 to about mid 2017.

I was told it was ""anxiety"", but it was just so weird and intense, and anxiety is such a widely used term these days, I'm curious if anyone has more insight.

\~

For 23 years I had lived a pretty happy, care-free, and normal life.

Then one day in winter 2016 I noticed a patch of my skin near my left wrist had gone numb. I thought this was strange and probably should've gone to the doctor, but decided to wait out the symptom, and eventually the feeling in the area came back.

I felt better, however the thought of it still sat in the back of my mind.

Weeks went by, and a sensation started to manifest in my hands. It's very hard to explain the sensation itself, but almost like an intensity. It started very quietly at first, and as time went on the sensation became stronger.

Strange thoughts accompanied these feelings, thoughts about something being wrong with my hands, or wrong with the connection between my hands and brain.

I'd sit there clenching my hands, afraid that they we're going to stop working properly.

I've always been a bit of a worrier, so I chalked it up to worrying and imagining things.

\~

The sensations became more prominent, I began to feel and think about them more and more.

I'd have strange irrational thoughts. Like that I'd close my hand and my fingers would collapse into an impossibly mangled fist. Or that my hand might become stuck closed.

The thoughts slowly became more invasive in my everyday life, and I started developing paranoia.

This all started very subtly, and I must of never acted different because no one ever said anything.

\~

This went on for about half a year, slowly building until one weekend I was visiting New York City with my uncle.

We were browsing a clothing store and I felt pretty good in the moment. Then after a few minutes of browsing, I felt a light-headedness and sort of aura come over me. This was different than anything I had felt previously.

This is hard to describe but the aura grew stronger, and I started to feel less stable. It started to totally encapsulate me, and I'll never forget this feeling, I felt like every muscle was just waiting to burst out of my skin. I was afraid I was having a seizure. (Doctors later refuted this.)

I told my uncle we needed to go to the hotel because I felt really weird.

When I lied down, and WAVES and WAVES of sensation swam over me. I just felt really unstable, and really scared but it eventually faded away.

Later that day, I was in a pizza shop. And the aura came back. I felt like the room was going to break apart or collapse inward. It's almost indescribable. It was just fear...that came out of nowhere, with this accompanying aura. I went to the hotel room and cried because I felt so fucked up.

\~

The next day (back home) I scheduled a doctors appointment and went to immediate care. Immediate care told me it was an anxiety attack and to take it easy. Fuck...I thought I was already doing that!

I talked to like 5 doctors and that had no conclusion for me other than ""generalized anxiety"" and suggesting I find ways to relax, unless I wanted to take medication...which I didn't

\~

After this, my life imploded.

Everyday became scary.

I'd be somewhere, having a fine time, and the blanket of sensation and fear would come over me.

(Strangely, I'd always get a burning sensation in the back of my neck when this would happen.)

And the invasive thoughts of before (""what if my hand stops working..."") became relentless.

Endless thoughts that I'd die.

Of a heart attack or stroke or brain tumor.

Or die in my sleep. Afraid to close my eyes, imagining my parents finding my body in the morning.

Thoughts that life wasn't real life.

I'd be sitting somewhere, and think.

""What if I'm not really here right now? What if I'm dreaming right now? What if any moment I open my eyes? What if I wake up?""

Or completely irrational psycho thoughts.

I'd see a knife and think ""What if I take that knife and cut myself? What if I just pick it up and cut into my arm? Or cut though my hand? Or stab myself in the stomach? What if one day I lose control and stab someone else?

The thoughts were always about the IDEA of something happening. And we all think weird things.

But these thoughts always had an impending feeling attached to them. Like the ""what if I wake up?"" idea, felt like the moment was coming, the moment where I'd blink and be somewhere else. The moment where what I was experiencing would be proven false and reality would be broken.

\~

I started to isolate myself.

I felt alienated as fuck.

I felt disconnected from everyone and myself.

And I just sat in this weirdness and dwelled in it.

\~

This sent me on this exiled internal journey.

Consumed by these thoughts and just confused, I started to lose my grip on any life meaning. I saw no future anymore.

I realized I had no idea who I was and I got rid of everything I owned in hopes for an answer.

(Literally everything, this freaked the fuck out of my parents...understandably.)

I deleted my phone contacts.

Deleted all my social media.

And when I'd get home, I'd sit in my empty room hoping ""the real me"" would show up.

(Luckily I didn't turn to drugs or alcohol. But I was afraid that they were going to kill me.)

\~

So to make this all the more confusing to me.

I was neck deep in this turmoil and I shit you not.

One day I was there sitting in my empty room and I just snapped out of it.

Nothing provoked this.

I just realized how to feel better.

I decided from that moment to stop pushing everyone away.

To embrace reality.

To embrace life.

And to focus externally, less internally.

That's the only way the thoughts would die.

\~

After that I haven't had another episode and all that scary shit feels like a memory now.

I don't feel quite the same, remnants remain. And I'm much more fearful and worried and nihilistic than I was once was.

But I definitely feel free of the consumption I was involved in before.

(Like a clothing stain that is barely barely visible, you can get away with wearing the shirt, but you know it's there and in the right lighting you can find it.)

\~

I feel like a completely different person now.

And legitimately healthy. Socializing regularly, goals, techniques to control negative/intrusive thoughts.

But this all lingers in the back of my mind, especially from the abruptness in which it ended.

Things like that don't just end, it's completely nonsensical.

It gives me the idea it may happen again later in life.

\~

So curious on anyone's thoughts on this?

Just anxiety? I somehow learned to manage.

you've been going to therapy for your bipolar disorder for half a decade now, just getting through your first year on a mood stabilizer. maybe it's going ok. you're not sure. objectively... probably not.

you've had a few run ins with the law, mostly traffic violations from wreckless driving. close call with shoplifting, drugs. recently just acquired a DUI. technically the first time you've been arrested.

you dont have a lot of friends. in fact, you only have one best friend that you've seen maybe 6 times in the past 18 months. dont have anyone you talk to on a regular basis. you've dated but are currently single, at least not in anything serious. kind of afraid to get to know anyone because of your past and current situations.

you're still living at home because you have no money, and only make $3/hr that ends up being used to get to and from work. you spend your free time sleeping. or getting drunk. or maybe getting together with that guy you like and have been placing your happiness in.

you're not sure you're ever going to be fully functional on your own. partly independent seems like the best case scenario, but you know that you'll more likely just continue to be a burden to those having to take care of you.

201,prolim4,1548777432,1,"I'm a 20 years old male and I have been dealing with this issue for more than 6 years.

Throughout the day, I'll get these negative thoughts that refuse to leave my head. They usually fall under the categories of vast generalizations, jumping to conclusions or unreasonable comparisons. Seldomly, I'm fine with that. I have started to come to terms with the fact that my brain could be an asshole at times and that I can gather sometimes enough reason to not trust whatever it's telling me.

However, what bugs me the most is that, most of times, engaging with these negative thoughts could almost seem tempting. By choosing not think about the stuff that's spit out by mind in its dipshit mode, I get the feeling that I am missing out on something. Maybe I'm not taking into consideration this particular thing when thinking about whatever I'm doing with my life. Maybe I'm not working my mind enough etc... Basically, I'm left with guilt.

In hindsight, the conlusions that I come up to when giving up to the endless cycle of overanalyzing things turn out to be unreasonable most of the times. When I look back at some of the reasoning I made, it seems laughable and I cannot understand how I could allow it to leave me in an unpleasant state of mind. But still, I cannot bring myself to realize how unnecesary it is to engage with these negative thoughts each time they arise.

It's worth mentioning that, during these last two years, I've become more capable of suppressing them by keeping myself busy with work or my hobbies whenever I have spare time. However, this is, either not always the case and I end up giving up or I find myself emotionally/physically exhausted from pushing them away even when I haven't done much during the day.

I always stumble upon advices on how to deal with my issue. And while they seem helpful, a lot of the time they can make things worse. For examle: when I force myself to do my hobbies in my spare time, I end up hating them for a while and refuse to do them for weeks because they're not as spontaneous as I like them to be. Walking while listening to music, although helpful before, doesn't seem to be helping anymore as it only adds physical tiredness on top of my emotional one.

Also, I've also seen that going out with your friends is helpful. It's worth mentioning here that I'm an introvert. Not in the sense that I lack social skills; I think that I can relatively keep a conversation going. But in that I have a ""social battery"" that needs to be recharged with some time alone that I value a lot. So as a consequence, as my ""battery"" level drains, my capacity to resist the ""temptation"" slowly decreases until the social interaction becomes an unpleasant experience instead of a refuge from whatever I was running from.

What I'm getting at is that my methods can be helpful at a certain bearable level of negativity. However, at other levels, these methods can be a hindrance and not serve me any benefits. I feel that I've been locked into this cycle for a long time and that it has been in the way of doing pretty much anything. Maybe I'm locking myself into another mindset with how I'm analyzing it in this post which is why I'm really curious to know what you guys/girls think about it and maybe you could share your experiences. (I'm willing to give more details if asked)

**TL;DR:** My mind acts like an asshole most of the time. I'm constatnly in a fight to resist the temptation of the negative thoughts. Sometimes I win but end up feeling exhausted. Other times I lose and I'm left feeling like shit.",mentalhealth,How can I resist the temptation of my negative thoughts?,2019-01-30 02:57:12
202,Evening_Throwaway,1548777302,1,"Disclaimer: This is long.

I had a really strange experience from 2016 to about mid 2017.

I was told it was ""anxiety"", but it was just so weird and intense, and anxiety is such a generic and widely used term these days, that it wasn't a really satisfying answer.

I'm curious if anyone has more insight.

\~

For 23 years I had lived a pretty happy, care-free, and normal life.

Then one day in winter 2016 I noticed a patch of my skin near my left wrist had gone numb. I thought this was strange and probably should've gone to the doctor, but decided to wait out the symptom, and eventually the feeling came back.

I felt better, however the thought of it still sat in the back of my mind.

Weeks went by, and a sensation started to manifest in my hands. It's very hard to explain the sensation itself, but it started very quietly at first, and as time went on the sensation became stronger.

Strange thoughts accompanied these feelings, thoughts about something being wrong with my hands, or wrong with the connection between my hands and brain.

I'd sit there clenching my hands, afraid that they we're going to stop working properly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a bit of a worrier, so I chalked it up to worrying and imagining things.

\~

The sensations became prominent, I began to feel and think about them more and more.

And have strange irrational thoughts. Like that I'd close my hand and my fingers would collapse into an impossibly mangled fist.

The thoughts slowly became more invasive, and I developed a light paranoia.

I'd be afraid I was going to see something that wasn't there. Or be afraid I was going to say something strange. These things never happened, but it was a sort of paranoid, impending feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I must of never acted different, no one ever noticed anything. And this was all pretty contained, I never acted out, other than a few hand clenches in my car. 

I've never talked to anyone about this, and I don't think I realized how much this was wearing me out, because it just became an everyday thing. 

\~

This went on for about half a year, until it all imploded one weekend while I was visiting New York City with my uncle We were browsing a clothing store and I felt pretty good in the moment.

Then after a few minutes of browsing, I felt a light-headedness and sort of aura come over me. This was different than anything I had felt previously. 

This is hard to describe but the aura grew stronger, and I started to feel less stable. It started to totally encapsulate me, and I'll never forget this feeling, I felt like every muscle was just waiting to burst out of my skin. I was afraid I was having a seizure. (Doctors later refuted this.)

I told my uncle we needed to go to the hotel, because I felt really weird.

I lied down, and WAVES and WAVES of sensation swam over me. I just felt really unstable, and really scared.

It slowlyyy faded away, and after an hour I felt better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day, I was in a pizza shop. And the aura came back. I felt like the room was going to break apart or collapse inward. It's almost indescribable. It was just fear. And I went to the hotel room, and cried, because I felt so fucked up.

\~

The next day (back home) I scheduled a doctors appointment and went to immediate care. Immediate care told me it was an anxiety attack and to take it easy. Fuck...I thought I was already doing that! 

I talked to like 5 doctors and that had no conclusion for me other than ""general anxiety"" and suggesting I find ways to relax, unless I wanted to take medication...which I didn't

&amp;#x200B;

\~

After this, my life became fear.

I'd feel a LOT of weird feelings and auras like the episode in NYC. 

(Strangely, I'd ALWAYS get a burning sensation in the back of my neck.)

&amp;#x200B;

And relentless invasive thoughts.

Endless thoughts that I'd die.

Of a heart attack or stroke or brain tumor. Or die in my sleep. Afraid to close my eyes, imagining my parents finding my body in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be sitting somewhere, and think. 

""What if I'm not really here right now? What if I'm dreaming right now? What if any moment I open my eyes? What if I wake up?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Or completely irrational bad thoughts. 

I'd see a knife and think ""What if I take that knife and cut myself? What if I just pick it up and cut into my arm? Or cut though my hand? Or stab myself in the stomach? What if one day I lose control and stab someone else?

The thoughts were always about the IDEA of something happening. This impending sort of misfortune.

\~

I started to isolate myself.

I wasn't happy around anyone.

I just sat in this weirdness and dwelled in it.  


I felt confused.  
And disconnected.  
From friends.  
From family.  
From myself. 

This sent me on this exiled internal journey.

\~

Consumed by these thoughts and just confused, I started to lose any meaning in life. I saw no future anymore.

I realized I had no idea who I was and I got rid of everything I owned in hopes for an answer. (Literally everything, this freaked the fuck out of my parents...understandably.)

I deleted my phone contacts.

Deleted all my social media.

And when I'd get home, I'd sit in my empty room hoping ""the real me"" would show up.

(Luckily I didn't turn to drugs or alcohol. But I was afraid that they were going to kill me.)

\~

I shit you not. One day I was there in my empty room.

And I snapped out of it.

I simply snapped out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing provoked this.

I just had the answer on how to feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized I wasn't paying enough attention to the people in my life. 

And I should start.

&amp;#x200B;

\~

After that I didn't have another episode.

And all that scary shit feels like a memory now.

&amp;#x200B;

Remnants remain.

Like a clothing stain that is barely barely visible, but you know it's there and in the right lighting you can find it.

Since then my hands and feet twitch regularly. 

And I still have health related fears, like getting a heart attack....but they are controllable. And I can push them away.

\~

So curious on anyone's thoughts on this?

Just anxiety?

It just seemed so....extreme. 

And the way it just came and went leaves me a bit anxious to something like this happening again in the future

Since it began back in high school and I didn’t really know anything about how to cope with it, I didn’t use medication in the beginning. The first few years, I tried writing down my thoughts and struggles since nobody in my friend group had been through anything like SAD. I didn’t talk to our high school counselor because she was honestly a joke and ridiculed the kids at our school. I was living in a very small town so there wasn’t any additional resources for therapy. These circumstances resulted in me spending every November-March in my room. 
Since it started, it has been getting worse every year. My freshman year of college I tried taking vitamin D supplements and saw no improvement. My sophomore year of college I tried vitamin D and B12 supplements, yoga, and meditation. Still, none of these seemed to make things better. I was discouraged and felt defeated. 
This year I finally decided to see a doctor about getting on some kind of anti-depressant. I had done some research about which medications I didn’t want to take and which I would be interested in trying. The doc prescribed me 150ml of Wellbutrin and I opted for the same dosage of the generic (college student budget ya know) Bupropion XL. 
He warned me that this medication would take up to 4 weeks to fully take affect, but after 2 weeks of taking this medication I felt ZERO improvement. When we had our 2 week follow-up, he decided to go ahead and up my dosage to 300ml. I have been on that dosage since mid December. I felt some slight improvement through the holidays and early days of January, but I feel like I’m at square one. I’m not sure what I should do.

It may be important to note that I am in a fast-paced, ruthlessly unorganized internship at a large company. I have been working there for a year now. I work full days on MWF and go to class on TR. The reason I stick around is because they pay well and there is a likelihood that they will hire me on full-time when I graduate in December. It’s incredibly stressful and my boss is cool as a robot, but it’s in my desired field.

I have a wonderful relationship, family, and friends. Nothing to complain about in that aspect, but yet my depression seeps through anyway. Saturated, thick, and darker every year. 

Any advice is appreciated.

I have a problem with thoughts which are haunting me since I finally got together with my all time crush, woman of my dreams, living definition of beauty. As you can imagine wining her's heart was the biggest challenge of my life. For now, I would like to give you just a TLDR of what happened through my life, and what problem I am dealing with right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I had a PMO (porn and masturbation) problem since my teen ages. Big big problem. No socializing with girls during that time, but still I was a ""normal kid, teen, young adult"", had friends, but no romantic relationships at all, with few events of breaking my heart by small rejections. 

I went to University, there I met her - I totally fallen for her, never felt that way. I was very insecure those days. First year I hardly was able to talk to her, she was from another league to me. You know, she was like that most popular cheerleader girl. She had a boyfriend that time. Next year, I finally got brave enough to ask her out. I've done all my best. But she rejected me so badly. I got into depression for one year. But at my 4th year at my Uni, she came to me, asking if I still have feelings for her. 

This was the best day of my life, I couldn't lie, I still loved her. I stopped PMO right away. She admitted that, she was lost herself when I tried for the first time. She explained herself well. Long story short - year later I proposed to her. She's my fiancee now. We're getting married next December. We're having the time of our lives. 

BUT, sometimes I can't sleep, and I cry thinking about past, about that, she had a few boyfriends, about that, she started her sex-life in High School and I compare my life to hers. I was never into having sex oriented relationship (which she actually had). My problem with PMO learned me that sexual life is bereft of guilty feelings when it's shared with someone who you love, and you thinking of that person as it's THE ONE. My fiancee understands me, we're together trying to keep sexual life for our marriage time. And she supports my NoFap resolution. We are trying, I relapsed few times since I've been with her. **So what sometimes bothers me and doesn't let me sleep are thoughts of her, being with all that guys, being sex-oriented person, being cruel to me 2 years ago. I came to conclusion, that I'm morbidly jealous about her, about her past, all about her. I don't want that feeling. I've forgiven her for being rude to me. But how to come to therms with her past, how to accept the fact she was first (romantically and sexually) to me, but I wasn't first for her. I have to point out that she's very dedicated to me right now.**",mentalhealth,"How to stop tormenting thoughts, my story TLDR, help",2019-01-29 23:46:10

220,CrackRockSunrise,1548753059,1,"tl;dr   putting it first cuz i ramble.  suicidal thoughts suck, i’ve gone through it, and now i’m seeing friends go through it.  i have a suicide pact with my best friend so if he’s gone i’m gone which would be a hassle to explain in my note.  please just tell me it’s gonna be okay. even if maybe it isn’t. 



i am Bipolar with suicidal tendencies during my depressive episodes. i’ve been medicated for the last four years.  i started college this year and the transition was not ~~easy. my mental health issues weren’t recognized by my social circle until i was about a sophomore in high-school but by that time, my manic and depressed phases had been drawn out aggressively by alcohol and drugs that even tho i wanted to hide it soberly, they had heard me slur the words either “i am god” or “i want to die”. none of my other friends ever talked about their problems i guess or maybe some of them didn’t really have anything serious, coming from the the poster-child-town for straight white males no one really struggled day to day in regards to physical needs. 

we had 2 suicides in my town that were both HUGE sparks for mental health awareness in the month and a half that followed their deaths. sometimes people joke that our town is cursed, we’ve had 4 suicides, 2 deaths in car accidents and an OD in the last 4 years in a town that is literally a square mile. but hey, rich white people need something to be sad about right? maybe it’s a sick twisted joke like, some of us were just born to be sad because it shows whoever maybe cared about us that life is a fickle fickle thing and it can be gone in a flash 

i haven’t had thoughts of suicide in almost 3 months. i’ve gone through a few episodes during which i sent some suicide-esque memes to my friends but really nothing serious. 





in the last 2 days my best friend and another very close friend have told me they want to die. 

i remember going through episodes at the beginning before i understood it and the first time i ever even THOUGHT about suicide was my first attempt.  i was a naive and critically confused 13 year old but i know that when those first thoughts first creep in that that’s when they’re strongest.

226,olvish,1548744914,1,"Hey there, first time posting here. I just wanted to reach out to discuss something which has been plaguing me my entire life.

I’m 25 years old, but since I was a little kid, maybe 5 or 6, I’ve hated my name. Both first and last. I’ve always wanted to be called by something else. And throughout my years I’ve been informally known by variations of my first name, my middle name and even just other aliases.

I think my initial reasoning as a kid behind this was that I just dislike my first name both phonetically and visually*. It also has never appealed to me with its meaning, and it is very very common. I don’t mean this in a pretentious way at all, but I’ve always felt more individual or special than what my name has me down as. Both my first name and surname are two of the most common names, so I have a very generic name.

In primary school and in high school I had multiple girls with my name, and I even had one girl with the exact same first and last name as me. In university, there were five people with my exact name.

I just hate it, you know? That feeling. I’ve doubted myself all my life and have never felt like I have a real name identity.

Stupidly, I’ve let this set me back in various areas of my life before. Delaying passports or trips or applying for things like jobs and schools because I don’t want to be known by my name and I think “oh I need to change my name first”.

Obviously the key to solving this is to change my damn name. Which I have wanted to for all the years it has been bothering me. And I am committed to changing it.

The problem, and the thing that is so ridiculous and infuriating for me, is that I haven’t been able to CHOOSE a new name!
I have been making lists of names that I love for years but I never actually stick to them. Or I do for a few months and then I think “This name doesn’t suit me” or “I don’t like how it looks written down” or “People will judge me if I have that name”.

I have lost friends and relationships because of this - nobody wants to hang around someone who doesn’t even know who they want to be.

I’m settled in my personality and the person I am for the most part, it’s just the name. I’ve been overthinking this for years and years.

It’s only recently that I’ve realised that maybe all this ties in with my mental health, maybe it’s actually a deeper problem than even I realise?

I have bad OCD (mainly contamination, checking and “feels right” types, with occasional intrusive thought), anxiety and depression. I’ve had these and have struggled with them my whole life.

I wonder now if maybe this is related to my OCD.... Rumination maybe? Somehow?

This all probably sounds really stupid and trivial to most people here, and I’m really sorry. I’m just trying to find some insight or suggestions of maybe how I can move past all this? Like I said I am set on changing my name. I will change it. But how do I settle myself into one choice so that it’s not controlling me and so that I can move on?

I’d really appreciate any comments.

*It later turned into the reasoning as well, that I had my dads surname and he pretty much chose my first name and I never knew him in my life. He was an abusive alcoholic. He died in 2014.

227,ttliked,1548744503,1,"First time poster here.

The title is not 100% correct, but I didn't know how to put it into words better. Also not sure if it's disorder, but it's negatively impacting my life and I want to know if somebody else has this mentality too.

Problem: attitude that resting is losing time and I'm not active enough. I don't watch movies or TV in general because I feel uncomfortable ""wasting"" these 100 minutes, even if the movie is good, but I can play video games for 10+ hours straight without feeling bad, as then I am ""active"" and ""doing something"", as opposed to passive movie watching.

Also it's hard for me to go to sleep, I like sleeping but I don't like going to sleep and deciding that it's been enough of being awake. I'd rather scroll reddit or facebook 3 more minutes knowing I will find something funny/interesting, than have 3 more minutes of sleep. Of course, these 3 minutes become few hours, and even if I have to wake up early next day, I will still delay my sleep.

I googled a bit and found ""efficiency disorder"" or something like that, but it's not it, I am not being extremely productive and hardest worker/student out there. It's just that I don't like to rest because I feel like I'l losing time, I don't like watching movies because I'm not being active enough, I don't like long calls, even with the person I love the most, because I'm not doing anything in that time.

I don't think it's internet addiction because if I hadn't access to internet, I would prefer reading books over going to sleep.

228,no_username_seems_ok,1548744282,1,"when I was 15 I had most likely an eating disorder (not trying to self diagnose but it was very apparent) I dropped to 94 lbs and would starve/exercise/purge and had all the little rituals of an eating disorder. I had recently started going to a high school after being homeschooled since 5th grade. I don’t know when it started but by winter of 2016 I was pretty narcissistic I think and thought everyone was jealous of my body and how skinny I was and how much control I had. I did not get along with my teachers and thought I was way smarter than them. I also thought I was smarter than the students. I would talk about how much I hated the teachers and the fake control they thought they had over their students and suddenly this emo girl who NEVER talked let alone shouted snapped at me saying “well what do you want us to do?” 


I was honestly shocked and speechless at someone challenging what I said and it was only then that I realized I was totally pissing everyone off. I didn’t really stop though and before midterms I was fed up with the teachers, the students and the school and dropped out and began homeschooling again. After dropping out all my rituals around food began falling apart because I was home with the kitchen all day and despite my increasingly frantic efforts I began to gain weight. 

By June I was 116 lbs and I was off to a 10 week summer program at Georgetown University where I would live in a dorm without my parents.  My roommate was this girl who was apparently OCD and had panic attacks which is only relevant bc she wasn’t gonna do anything about it if I was acting crazy. She had her own stuff to deal with and we pretty much ignored each other after a while. She would also hoard food in the dorm and this did not help my food issues. During this time I was super anxious I think but also wanted to hang out with everyone and do everything and have fun and do well in class (and I ATE EVERYTHING).


I went to all the organized events that the program held. I tried hanging out with the other students when I could. I would dedicate my days to hanging out and socializing and taking long walks around DC. I would dedicate my nights to doing homework. I am not sure how much I slept, but I know I dedicated my nights to homework bc I constantly thought of it and prided myself on it. I thought it was ingenious and was delighted to know that sleep wasn’t nearly as important as I had thought. I pulled several all nighters and if I couldn’t make it all night I would set my alarm for 2 or 4 hours of sleep. One day I slept 13.5 hours, but that was unusual. I also drank 10 cups of black coffee a day and ate an average of 3500 calories/ day to fuel this. 


I was constantly eating. Other students would swipe me and my roommate into the dining hall (I didn’t have a meal plan) and me and her would bring bags to fill with cookies or icecream which we would eat back at the dorm (within a day or two for me). I also would buy food wherever I went on campus no matter how expensive. I never went on a shopping spree for non food items, but I think this is because I was too disgusted with my body to think I deserve that.  


I would also say really insensitive things sometimes bc I was always in my own head and SUPER impulsive and did not think about others. 

During this time I was kinda self hating and narcissistic?!? Like I can’t quite remember but I know there were instances of both. I really hated myself for gaining all that weight and completely having no control. I was always coming up with schemes to lose it again but I was too impulsive to follow through.

By the end of the summer program in August I had gained a significant amount of weight. Right after finishing the program my parents, sister and I went on a vacation to see the solar eclipse. I still felt bad about my body but tbh I can’t remember much about how I felt during the trip or what I did. I wanted to go shopping bc none of my clothes fit, but didn’t feel like I deserved clothes. 

By the end of the trip, September 1st, I was 141.3 lbs. I had just moved to a new house in NC. with dieting and fasting and exercising I was 124lbs by November 2017.  During that fall and winter I had crazy mood swings. I could go out on a 3 mile walk feeling elated and on top of the world, and coming back wanting to feel what it was like to exist on the brink of death. I felt I had an energy running through me which would alternate between feeling amazing to feeling self destructive. I often went night without being able to sleep, although this could have been from hunger and malnutrition. I made myself a rule that if I couldn’t get to sleep until 6 am then I could watch a movie. 

When I was feeling good, i felt “high”. I have never been high, but that’s what I would imagine it being like. I told my friend that I felt energized and “my thoughts felt dizzy”. I had quit coffee but by now I was nearing my 10 cups a day again. I would definitely talk and talk and talk. 

When I was feeling depressed, I still had energy, what I called the self destructive energy. At one point I wrote a big post about wanting to exist on the very brink of death, to feel my body decay, and so on. Mostly I just felt like a failure and a terrible person and that everyone must hate me or I am a bad influence and so on. When I had these thoughts is when I started to cut myself as punishment for my misdeeds. One of these misdeeds was that my friend sent me screenshots of texts my (then) boyfriend had sent her and made me promise not to tell him. I promised but soon after I got into an argument with my bf and got super angry and sent him the screenshots. My friend got upset that I broke my promise and the argument with my bf was still happening. I got really upset and cut myself to punish myself for being a terrible friend and person. 

In another instance I tried to tell the same friend a joke that accidentally came off as racist. I felt terrible and later burned my arm bc of it (leaving several bad scars). The things that triggered me seem trivial now. 

By June I had moved to a new house again. I was happy and energetic and was pulling all nighters and not sleeping much. I had all sorts of plans of what to do with the new house. I also really really wanted to dye my hair pink. After a lot of convincing I got my mom to agree to help me dye my hair. However by then we were moving again. My mom told me that before I could bleach my hair I had to get some things from the backyard. Walking through the backyard I saw a tent that me and my sister had set up and stayed up all night in eating Oreos and watching Shane Dawson videos. It suddenly hit me that I was leaving this wonderful house with its lake and forest. I was leaving any opportunity to stay in that tent again. I suddenly felt devastated when Before I hadn’t cared. I immediately started sobbing and when I came inside my mom saw me and tried to cheer me up but eventually we decided to dye my hair anyway. I liked my dyed hair but pretty much felt depressed from June 23rd (that day) until just a few days ago (it’s January 27th 2019). I have done some stuff between then and now, and have even felt good for moments or a day at a time. But mostly I have felt depressed, and much much more so at night. Sometimes I wouldn’t sleep because I could face the thought I had while trying to sleep and would stay up and work on homework. I don’t like doing anything when depressed. I don’t like shows or Music. However, liked watching the same episodes of Buzzfeed unsolved over and over and over again. 

Sometimes I overreact emotionally. Once I found a picture of Kurt Cobain taken in Singapore. I am not the biggest Kurt Cobain fan but I used to live in Singapore. I got so excited about the fact that Kurt visited Singapore and I was like shaking and pretty much jumping up and down. I told everyone about this. Then, and hour or two later, I got super depressed bc nobody seemed to care, and my friends don’t care about Singapore either. I don’t know why I had this reaction


Over the last couple of days I have felt way better. I finished my blanket I’ve been knitting forever. I want to get more done and study more. I want to make plans and hang out. I enjoy things now. And this has literally happened over the last couple of days. I told my mom I felt depressed and she told me to take 2 sam E 1 magnesium and 1 vitamin b supplement/day. I also took 2 HTP-5 100mg for two days and no pills today. I have stopped the HTP-5 and and trying to stop caffeine. Today I had 2 cups of tea and a soda. I have always had anxiety when it comes to going out in public and talking to people so I am trying to cut down on that. 


I am also trying to get a better sleep schedule but I have been typing for hours and it’s 1:40 am rn so that’s not working out to well lol. But I still am gonna try harder in the future.

I’m medicated, I go to therapy and I self medicate with cigarettes (yes I know it’s awful). I’ve been raising our daughter alone for the past 6 months because my husband is overseas. I spent my entire pregnancy alone as he was gone overseas shortly after we found out. I take care of 6 rescue dogs and a cat as well.

Today: So Today I went to one of those rich people parties. A Muslim family had flew their private jet and rented a local art museum for a wedding celebration. It was like so rich people they even had those little finger food. It was an actual piece of fish with just a herb on it. Anyway, there was this part where a band they’d flew in came. Everyone was dancing and having fun with the music. I just, didn’t. There was just nothing interesting about the music or anything there. It just felt sorta boring, like, well, everything. Even know things aren’t very interesting. It’s all just a consistent state of dullness. I laugh a bit and this and that but I’ve never actually danced or anything. I can even remember when I was younger just wanting to sit out when my family was having fun. And my mom would have to pull me in or something. 

Friends: I don’t actually have any good friends. I moved to a new town and met some guys I sit at lunch with. We laugh a bit but they don’t care that much. It’s like. We have open campus and everyone’s going out the get food and shit. I can’t drive (I’m in high school but SD driving laws are different), and they just leave without me. I’d like to think they simply forgot about me. But they’d seen me, knew where I was, and most certainly knew I carry around cash. So I don’t think that’s the case. I barley even know anything about them except their names. One girl went on a little speech about her life issues and shit but that’s bout it. I just can’t really talk to people that much anymore. I know what I want to say, I just can’t or it always comes out the wrong way. I always pronounce it wrong or something and sorta justs wants to make me stay silent. I even just don’t care when people gets hurt sometimes. My brother had thought I’d stolen his Playstation controller and attacked me. I hit him in the throat, and he couldn’t go to school cause of the swelling. I knew I should have felt bad. But I just didn’t. 

Anger Issues?: I sometimes get mad at things that other people find weird. My best example was when before I moved and was with one of my school friends, Tyler. I was reading this book I’d just got and he messed up the front cover. One of those annoying bends that you can’t get out. I’d got mad and started yelling for my mom to drop him back at home. It was a small thing, but I’d gotten really mad over it. I finished organizing my room once. Which was new since a lot of people call me unorganized (I don’t agree). But, then my dad came in to clean and put things out of place. I got extremely mad and said he might as well keep the room if he was going to mess things up (he just moved stuff around). I can understand it was ridiculous looking back (that’s the beauty of retrospect). But it seemed completely reasonable at the time. 

Weird thoughts: Sometimes, when something is going on, I just think about what thing I could do that person. Like a kid was playing with a big pack of water bottles out in the snow. And I kept thinking about grabbing one and pouring one on him or throwing it at him or something. I remember a while ago when a girl was being annoying. And I just pulled a pin out a poster on the wall thinking about what I could. I stopped and put it back and didn’t do anything. But, it’s just weird thinking about it now. 

Situation: I live up in the Mountains in South Dakota. Since my mom had to move for her new job. It’s good. She’s got a lot of stock in a company that could blow up. But definitely not right now. We’re living out an apartment on lease for a year. She claims we’ll go back home after the lease is up. But I don’t think we’re going to. I don’t have much freedom. I’m just at home, school, fencing, or some store. I can’t just ask to go outside. Not only because they won’t let me but also because of the perpetual hell-like amount of snow and cold wind. I could get my drivers license. But any spots aren’t open till the summer. So, If I needed help or anything I’d have to go to them. 

Help?: People have recommended that I see a professional or something. But, I don’t know if I really need to. Even if I do, I just don’t know how. I’ve wanted to tell them. But there’s nothing worth they suspecting I need serious help. And if my mom thinks I’m hiding something from her and don’t trust her to talk to her about it. It may just really hurt her feelings.

I as well don’t really feel any empathy for others, I mean sometimes. But for the most part, I genuinely don’t care. Even though I wish I did.
As well, if I’m in a relationship, I tend to go from loving my partner, to hating them. And basically convince them to hate me, and convince them to say things. So they can hurt me. So I’ll have a reason to get mad. 
I as well from time to time go manic, I will freak out. Usually every 4 months. The last time I had, I had squeezed my eyeballs almost out of my eye sockets, hit my head against walls, screamed, punch myself till I was bruised. Anyways, should I see my psychiatrist? 
And overall, I wish I could be like others. And actually be happy, and not feel these emotions and ways:(
Here are a list of BPD traits, that I have).

Having an unstable or dysfunctional self-image or a distorted sense of self (how one feels about one’s self)
Feelings of isolation, boredom and emptiness
Difficulty feeling empathy for others
A history of unstable relationships that can change drastically from intense love and idealization to intense hate
A persistent fear of abandonment and rejection, including extreme emotional reactions to real and even perceived abandonment
Intense, highly changeable moods that can last for several days or for just a few hours
Strong feelings of anxiety, worry and depression
Impulsive, risky, self-destructive and dangerous behaviors, including reckless driving, drug or alcohol abuse and having unsafe sex
Hostility
Unstable career plans, goals and aspirations

238,LilliaCu,1548736329,1,"I know I have some issues. Actually a lot. I could talk about that forever. But I can't cry anymore. When I think about it.  There was an incident and after that I couldn't cry. I was really angry in a session with my old therapist but I couldn't cry and felt no release at all. Nothing really let's me let go even for a little while. Socializing and hobbies and things like that may help some people but they just tire me. I will do them and feign interest but it doesn't do much of anything. 

I have a lot of problems but it mostly comes down to that I feel like nobody gets me. Cringey I know but it's true. I feel alone in my head. I come up with ideas about just about everything but how I explain them doesnt make sense to anyone I know. People think I'm crazy or gifted and I dont believe either. In my opinion both words mean ""I dont understand you."" Everything I say gets thrown in either catagory. When I explain stuff it doesnt get interpreted the way I mean, with my peers, adults and therapists. So I've pretty much given up on the therapist idea since they dont get what I mean. I'll talk for 5 minutes about something and then they're like ""So... you mean.... this???"" Which is never close. I end up saying never mind. 

They just end up saying that everyone's different and that rhetoric. I know there's no one identical to me but I dont fit in any groups at school and most people can really be understood by someone like their best friend or something. If I were normal there would be people like me. And I'm not antisocial I've met a lot of people. 

It's no better with my peers. Well I've skipped a grade recently so they're all older than me. But I have never had a close friendship. I can make acquaintances just fine but when it comes to real bonds I dont and never had any.  I just find I work on a different wavelength than other people and I cant really connect with anyone. Well I could pretend but that's pointless. I do have lots of friends just not really close ones.

I have known a lot of people and I have had 7 situations where I've been socially reset. I've had 8 school counsellors therapists and doctors over 4 years and I'm honestly done with that. I've been told pretty much nothing. Maybe I just got really unlucky or something but I'm done with that. 

My mom is a good person but she doesnt know how to support me she'll just send me to another therapist. My dad is always at work and I think he looks down on my mom because she has bipolar and cant work. He has said to me that I have to make sure not to say anything that would stress her out. 

I pretended to be fine to get out of therapy. I have no support system. I dont see a solution. They never diagnosed me with anything but they thought I had anxiety and maybe depression. They thought that because I said my family would be better off without me and just with my brother who's cheery and charismatic and normal. And that I just stress everyone out. I'm not suicidal but if I wouldn't hurt anyone by killing myself I probably would at some point.

Anyways to summarize I have repressed issues and I cant cry about it even when I think about it I need advice pls.

239,KaienPanzermast,1548735877,1,"Thanks to this subreddit, I found out that what I’m afflicted with is Intrusive Thought OCD, and I need some tips to cope with it and calm my anxiety when it flares up. It tends to be worse at night after I’ve taken my sleep medicine, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to calm me when I get there. My intrusive thoughts often are things like “maybe I don’t actually love my partner”, even though I am 100% certain that I do. That turns into an impulse control issue, where I fear talking to them and calling them because I am afraid that I’m going to let lose the words “I don’t love you anymore” because my impulse control is so poor that the compulsion feels overpowering. My partner understands this, but I don’t ever want to say it to them. I know 100% that I love them, and that I’m as in love with them as I always was.. The intrusive Thought comes along and I can’t throw it away. I’ll obsess over the thought for hours, going on days and weeks and I’ll be crippled by it and unable to talk to them because of the anxiety caused by this thought and the compulsion to say something. It isn’t always the same intrusive thought, it ranges from that one to intrusive thoughts about other things as well. Telling people things that I never wanted to tell them, and the only way to calm it being by just doing it.

I feel like this Intrusive Thought OCD is taking control of me and close to ruining my relationship. I try to reassure myself that I love them, because if I didn’t, these thoughts wouldn’t be so distressing. I get upset over the prospect of not loving them and of telling them that, and that’s how I know I still love them.

But the reassurances never work, and I always end up being anxious. Are there any tips to help control this sort of thing? I just want to be able to spend time with my partner without always having those intrusive thoughts and compulsions. ",mentalhealth,Help coping with Intrusive Thought OCD?,2019-01-29 15:24:37

I still love you. I still have hope and belief in you. 

I know your pain. Your hurt. The deep, deep scars. Only I can truly understand. Because they live with me too. 

I know you’ve tried. You’ve sought help. You really have. You are in such a deep hole. Sure, therapy and such sent a rope down to save you. But the climb up is so hard. Some days you have so much strength to climb out. But then you lose your footing. You just barely hang on to the rope, with every last ounce of strength you have. You hope tomorrow the strength to keep climbing will return. 

Yes, part of the reason you are in this hole is because you didn’t have a good map to help navigate the walk of life. And you could have been more cautious, maybe searched for a different path to avoid this hole, but there will always be ‘what I should have done’ that unfortunately won’t save you today. 

So, baby (because I know how much you love to be called baby), keep hanging on. The days you have the strength to climb, keep climbing. The days you don’t, please be kind to yourself. You’re doing your best. I know you’re working and you are trying. And when you reach the opening, I’ll be here. Even if it’s just a party of one to hug you and celebrate your journey. I’ll be here.

241,kllisp123,1548734084,1,"So I have a very long story to tell first of all. So if your going to read through it, let me just start off by saying thank you. But anyway, some background information-  and a freshman in high school. I’m going to start from the beginning. During my eighth grade year from October of 2017 to around March of 2018 I had reached my lowest point. I am really into fitness and was keeping up with it which was what makes me happy, but nothing could make me happy during those months. It was horrible, I woke up and really wish I could just sleep all day and not have to deal with anything or anyone. Kids my age claim to be depressed all the time but really don’t know what they are saying in most cases. They think a week of sadness is depression, when for me it was months and I can’t even explain how terrible it was. I vividly remember all of those months. But any way after March everything got better. It was the end of my eighth grade year, I was hanging out with friends a lot and was the best few months of my life. Summer was great, but when high school started everything went downhill. My best friend stopped hanging out with me and every time I would ask him to hang out with me he would just kind of put it aside. That really got to me, and all of the others I knew from middle school found their other “clique” I guess you could say, except for me. That made me an extremely angry person towards everyone constantly and I still am now. But then in December of freshman year I did shrooms (yes I know I am very young, but was not new to this) and shit went downhill. Most of the trip was okay, except for about 15 minutes of it which still fucks me up today. I constantly think about what the point of life is, and thinking life is just an endless circle of a bunch of random shit happening. You really can’t explain the thoughts I have, and it may sound easy to flush out those thoughts but it’s impossible. I feel like I am way to grown up for people my age, I feel like I know too much and know so much shit I shouldn’t know. I’ve lost all my friends now and moved to a different school starting the second semester, (went from a big school to a small one), thinking it would help. But if anything, it was way worse. I’m still an extremely angry person and don’t even know who I am anymore. I feel like I have a matured mind in a teenage body I can’t explain it.

I started going to a recovery college (peer based support for mental health recovery - classes and groups to teach coping skills etc)...I don't think it's for me. 

Everyone else has more typical mental health issues, like depression that keeps them from getting out of bed in the morning - thus classes teach coping skills, mindfulness, behavioural techniques, etc. 

Things includes encouraging people to do a task they struggle with due to depression then rewarding themselves. Mindfulness meditation sitting focusing on tensing then relaxing different body parts, or tapping different parts of your body and repeating affirmations about loving yourself.

I can cope with my mental health problems okay for the most part, I don't think the techniques they're teaching are beneficial to me.  A big reason for being referred to the recovery college was social interaction. 

Some methods are infantile, and it feels like most students have no understanding of themselves or mental health - it's like mental health 101, while I very much understand myself and my mental health.

Some techniques are fluffy nonsense IMO...I know they do help some people and that's great for them, but they don't help me and if anything it makes me worse by making me uncomfortable. I don't like being made to do things when I see no benefit, I don't want to look like an idiot waving my arms around like a tree etc.

The teacher who leads one of my classes was watching me not participate in one activity, then started explaining to the class that these exercises are 'clinically proven' and it felt aimed at me. I don't like feeling as if I'm seen as being seen as unwilling to participate, but I know what's going to be useful for me and this isn't it. 

I don't know if I should keep going to this one class in particular - I'm two weeks in, there may be some useful points - I don't want to do these ridiculous mindfulness techniques, I also don't see much use to keeping mood journals when I'm already understanding of my mental health...but that means I'm not participating with half the class, it's not especially fair to other students or the teacher. 

I just feel if I continue I'm going to get progressively stressed out by being pressured into participating in this nonsense, but if I drop out I'm only doing one class (which isn't much better but the social interaction is still beneficial). So it'll be another thing that hasn't helped and I'll be back to having nothing to do.

247,poormansnigella,1548728269,1,"Today I handed my notice in to a job I worked very hard to get.

A few years ago I (31f) decided to go back to university with the open university, completely changing careers and doing a part time degree (I won’t say what in to avoid people recognising me) while working a full time job in a bar. 

I was doing really well, despite being a world class procrastinator, with grades in the 80-95% area.

Last summer I got a job in my desired field, entry level but with opportunity to move up the ladder. I was ecstatic, it was lower pay but I was confident in my abilities that I would move up positions swiftly.

As it turned out, the people are difficult to work with, I find the commute hard and they are stalling me learning more of the more technical stuff that was agreed upon when I accepted the position and instead giving menial tasks (I believe in an attempt to not have to give me a raise). My grades have slipped and I don’t have the energy to work harder.

I have always struggled with anxiety but I have had my systems in place to not let it affect me too much anymore. This job has undone YEARS of hard work - I can’t get to sleep, making exercise difficult and I have put weight on, I’m miserable and snapping at my partner constantly. I’ve had to take a lot of sick days as being so run down has affected my physical health and I am no longer the employee I want to be.

So I decided to make a change, some people might view it as a step backwards but I see it as a positive change to focus on what is important. Jobs, money, possessions all that bullshit...is ultimately inconsequential.
All that matters is love, and the relationships you have that fill your life with joy.

It might take me another 4 years to get an opportunity like this again, but that’s ok, I have love in my life.

I'm 30 years old, have my masters and undergraduate degree in History, and have little job prospects in the area that my wife and I want to live in. I've been hunting for a job in my field that pays more than 10 or 11 dollars an hour, and unfortunately I have run into the wall that most in my field run into - an abundance of history degrees and due to the state of humanities support today, few job prospects.

I know a lot of people will say ""You should have got a science degree, you should have got a more marketable degree."" I thought about this stuff too late. I was happy to be out of a terrible home environment in my late teens and by the time I finished my degree, I was very optimistic about finding something.

I married my wife in 2015, we had our first (and only for the time being) daughter in 2018, and I finished my masters program in History - thinking that with more education I would be more marketable as an employee. I've had to take jobs unrelated to my field because that's what I had to do to provide for my family. We aren't hauling ourselves over to the west coast for more opportunity, as her family is here and I want to be sensitive to her needs as well - she's much closer to her family than I am mine, and I want to respect that.

Now, I'm 30. Pushing 31, working a part time position at a community college teaching one to two students a night in the continuing ed program. I work in retail during the day, so I'm at around 60 hours a week to provide for my wife and daughter. We're thinking of trying to move to Raleigh in the next year to look for better jobs. My wife stays at home to avoid daycare costs.

I have a lot of debt. My family was poor, and I was financially irresponsible mostly because I thought it would pay off with having a good career at the end of it. Somewhere in the realm of $100,000 of debt along with my wifes.

I don't want my life to be working in a menial job for the next ten years while I just keep searching for a job that may turn up. I don't really know what else to do, though, as I don't have time (or money) to go back to school, and I don't even know what I would go back to school for. For a time I thought computer science or systems, but I just don't know how I would manage it.

I don't really know what I'm asking - is this normal? I don't want to talk to my wife about it because we've talked about it in one way or another before. She's already stressed with our daughter and I don't want to add to that.

Either way, I feel like I might have a mental breakdown at any point. I just want to take some steps in the right direction - I feel like starting over at this point is basically wasting the past ten years.

After a fiasco in July, We had moved out of our house, and I lost a lot, my friends, my amazing room, and the whole area which I had loved so much, and had given me the BEST year of my life. I would go into detail but thats around 3 paragraphs full. The previous year had its ups and downs, losing loved ones, pets, and amazing people.

sometimes I just snap. Where anger over the years + anger that day, just overcomes me. I flip out, get angry, throw shit, afterwards I feel like I had just blacked out, not intensely but I just can't remember what went through my mind. Afterwards I just bawl my eyes out and reflect, it's been a weird 3-day weekend due to the end of sem, everything should seem fine. but for some reason, little things do tick me off, I'm very insecure as well, so I usually blame a lot of my flaws or just the way some things work on people, its just unlucky. I absolutely hate myself, the way I look, and sometimes I may even go to where I hate my family, except my mom, but I don't get to see my mom often as I would like. At school I may seem nice, and energetic, but I feel like I'm just suffering quietly. I feel I have some sort of bipolar disorder because at any moment, I would seem okay, but then any little thing that goes wrong makes me wanna just, even kill somebody. I fear I may snap when I have actual power when I'm older and kill someone, its a blind rage that I go through and want to stop. It's a lot of stress and anger, especially today, I got very angry and threw shit, started yelling and crying, I felt legitimately crazy.

I was regarded as a shy child,well-mannered and a good student. I was blessed however with great athletic skills so I made some friends because of this. I didn't understand what was happening. I had no time to think I suppose. I worried about being the center of attention or messing up in some way. As I got older my anxiety increased..Middle School and High School:( I was an all-regional baseball catcher in High School...I had pro scouts looking at my development. I was a good student but I had a terrible time concentrating in class around all the other kids. I became an accomplished musician and composer. But my peers knew I was weird. I was teased a bit and probably would have been bullied if I wasn't a big guy. I made friends with shy students and the athlete friends left. I was never able to go partying,hang out or even have a girlfriend. I began my Freshman year at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania. I was terrified. Even so I was the starting walk on baseball catcher. However,my condition destroyed my baseball career. Then after I turned down a pretty girl's invite to a party I realized something was wrong with me. I then began counseling at the school. Then I saw a therapist who changed my life. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. I was introduced to Albert Ellis and Rational Emotive Therapy. I learned to think differently not just in anxiety situations but in every aspect of my life. By my Junior Year I was a different person. I was who I was supposed to be. I then dedicated my life to helping others. I went to Grad School to earn my professional Counseling Degree and have been helping kids,teens,adults,etc since 1997 with their problems. I'm not saying it was easy to beat my terrible anxiety. It took a lot of work but I did it. As a therapist I guide my patients,give them a lot of homework assignments and work at helping them change how they think,feel,react and think again in a rational healthy manner.

Basically, the majority of my relatives have some sort of disorder that is genetically associated with anxiety or mood disorders. But one thing I've discovered being in a family with a history of mental illness is that there are advantages. I've heard that certain anxiety and mood disorders are associated with greater ability to learn. And if you look at the accomplishments some of the individuals in my family, it's really something.

267,gaynintendobitch,1548713903,1,"Tomorrow I write my grade eleven university functions exam and I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but I've been in my own head about my conscience. I have done anything glaringly wrong mind you, but I pride myself on being an empathetic and kind person to others. My goal is always to make people laugh using my natural instinct for comedy, and I didn't learn that about myself until me and my friends cut ties mutually. Now I'm in my head about being the supposed ""bad guy"" even though binaries like that don't exist. One of the ""friends"" I left hated me immediately from the moment I met her. She once non-jokingly dedicated a song called ""You're a Shit Head"" or something to me as my other friends laughed it off, and a lot of things like this happened, so I'm sure she wasn't exactly fond toward me. Back when I initially met these people I was an anxious wreck to the point at which I couldn't go out in particularly public places, so I was never really the happy go lucky friend and I often begged them to go back whenever I was dragged out to events like that. Obviously, I was a bit of nuisance back then.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where my head comes in. One of the friends who me and my family really resent seems to be doing fine in spite of how horrid she treats other people, like her own personal assistants. No matter what she does she seems to get acclaim from her teachers and  friends. It seems unlikely, and that's why I'm skeptical about myself. In order to not be delusional the way such strong emotions can make you, I'm beginning to question whether or not my own bitterness towards her (she treated me really poorly, but I can't describe it all in this text post) is distorting my vision of her and whether or not I really am guilty of the things she accused me of in a subconscious way. She accused me of writing a letter to her about she's at fault for my depression- which I didn't, I checked my texts and documents over and over, but I could have insinuated it in passing conversation. She's a very insecure person so she tends to really blow things out of proportion, even using violence when her self esteem is threatened, but that doesn't necessarily make her bad. I don't know if I'm the real ""bad guy"" of this story or to put it more realistically the person who's most at fault. I just feel like I'm unable to really see my own faults aside from superficial ones. On the other hand, my head might be just messing with me, but regardless all I know definitively in this moment is that I'm unhappy and unfocused. By the way, the reason I'm so hung up on this girl is because she was my best friend for over ten years, so it was kind of like getting a friendship divorce. 

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to school, because I don't value my grades as much as I used to, my marks have inevitably declined as I don't dedicate my entire being to school anymore. It should be a good thing, but I'm not used to get anything less than a ninety (I know how shallow that makes me sound, but it was my own personal standard). In most subjects, I end up with high or low eighties, however in grade eleven functions this is different as math then takes a big jump in regards to difficulty. Right now I'm at sixty, and I was absolutely crushed at the beginning of the year, so it was hard to muster the motivation to do my homework consistently and thus improve. It can be crushing to see my peers get high nineties and hundreds in what I find to be extremely difficult subjects.

271,AvrieyinKyrgrimm,1548709801,1,"I apologize for length and I am also on mobile. Awesome if you read through the entire thing. 

There are a couple or buzzwords going around lately in the r/mentalhealth subreddit and relationship advice subs. You'll almost be guaranteed to see someone use the words, ""toxic,"" ""gaslighting,"" ""projecting,"" ""abusive"", etc., in any post involving a person that is having some kind of major or minor disagreement with the OP. 

A lot of these comments are pretty derogatory in nature towards the individuals in question, and whether or not they warrant it is not the topic of discussion here, rather, I would like to share my first-hand experience of truly being the epitome of the abuser that you guys all might be imagining when you read those posts, and I will be discussing how and why I changed my ways. I am writing this in hopes that I will inspire some hope and self-awareness into readers who might be experiencing these behaviors, themselves, so that they may learn to change them and attract positivity and joy into their life. 


I will give a brief backstory because it is important when discussing the root of the problem. I am a 24 year old female. I was heavily abused and neglected as a child by my alcoholic mother. When I was a teenager, her boyfriend punched me in the face, broke my cheekbone, and it caused me permanent nerve damage and my full time job at the time. I was re-victimized by the criminal justice system when I was forced to testify as a witness in court and forced to see the pictures and deal with the event all over again. 

My trauma as a child had caused me to develop specific behaviors because some of my needs were not being met, and I needed to manipulate others in order to compensate for that. As a child and as a teenager, my entire purpose for these behaviors was to achieve the social and emotional needs that I was missing from my life. I was not thriving, just surviving. Sometimes, these behaviors would be rewarded because they worked exactly as I had calculated them, and other times I was not presented with the reaction that I wanted. When this happened, my behaviors would evolve and manifest in other ways, but they always seemed so immature because they were rooted in more simple behaviors that I had learned from a very young age. 

I feel that I should mention that I was completely unaware of what I was doing, or the fact that other people didn't do this, also. I thought everyone manipulated their loved ones in order to maintain peace or in order to guide situations to be what they wanted them to be. As I started getting into relationships, my behaviors immediately adapted to the new setting, and the affections from my partners were the positive reinforcement that I needed in order to fulfill my deep rooted need for companionship and compassion. The void that was left by my family was filled with the affections of a stranger. And, I couldn't get enough of this new experience. 

Now, the symptoms in my relationship varied. I was the person that would throw tantrums when things didn't go as I expected them to go. Minor inconveniences were major problems and I will self-sabotage by cancelling entire plans if it didn't go exactly as I expected it to go. My boyfriends were on the receiving end of constant suicide threats if they implied breaking up, and also of threats of me leaving them because they, ""would be happier without me."" I was the girl who would text cryptic messages such as, ""we are never going to talk again after this"" after long-winded messages complaining about basically nothing. It wouldn't be too long before I would get anxiety that the other person was truly not going to talk to me again, and I would text them extensive apologies. I would cast the bait, hope they would bite, and reel them back in when they got too far out of my control. I would take criticisms very heavily and become extremely defensive. I would try to turn those situations around on my partner to make it seem like my actions were a result of something that they were doing. I thought that it was okay to slap and pound on my partner when they had me frustrated beyond belief. I would get frustrated when they didn't want to engage in sex and guilt trip them by accusing them of hating me or the way I looked. I constantly accused them of lying and cheating. 

There was an array of other things, but a lot of these actions are unjustifiable, even in the claim of mental illness. At first, I kept wondering why I was attracting these shitty men and women to be in relationships with. Then, I kept wondering why they continued to lose interest in me over time. The breakups were always long, drawn-out, and horrible. I would go through major depressions after each of them until someone else filled the void. 

It wasn't until I dated one particular man that I snapped back into reality. At that point, I had already taken an interest in the field of psychology and humanities, but I never really considered that I might be one of the people I had to learn about in all those textbooks and discussions. Even if someone explained me to myself without saying it was me, I wouldn't have recognized. All I knew is that I had a deep passion to help people because of my own experience with abuse in the home. He sat me down one day and told me, ""this is what you're doing, and this is how it makes me feel. This is why it is wrong. This is why you have to change."" He was very point blank. Just laid it all out on the table. He said it in words I could understand and made sure that I could relate the connections between my behaviors and his responses. It was that moment of clarity and self-awareness that pulled the level and changed my course of direction away from the impending train wreck that was about to happen. Now that I was aware of my actions, I would always think back to that conversation when I had the urge to act out, and I was slowly learning not to identify with them. 

My college career was put on hold so that I could attend an outpatient mental health rehab program that offered dialectical behavioral therapy for trauma survivors. I attended for 7 months, five days a week, for about 6 hours a day in group classes. Together with my care coordinator, we learned the root cause of my behaviors, how to finally come to terms with my trauma, how to forgive, and how to move on. I learned amazing mental wellness exercises that taught me how to live and behave in a manner that would attract joy and positivity (the law of attraction). I learned essential coping skills for stress. And most importantly, I learned about boundaries and goal setting in relationships. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD, borderline, and bipolar. I successfully participated in, and completed, my treatment plan. Today, I continue to address my mental health issues as they arise, and my BPD symptoms have almost completely subsided. I have better personal relationships. I have been in a loving, committed, and understanding relationship for going on six years. 

Also, I am well on my way through my criminal justice degree for a specialty in forensic psychology. I'll be helping victims and abusers overcome their traumas and behaviors while navigating the mental health and criminal justice system. 

I could no longer fathom treating anyone the way that I used to treat them before. What got me through it was simple self-awareness and a desire to change. Understanding how to achieve mental wellness is also very important because most of us are trained in therapy to suppress and address symptoms rather than learning how to actually be happy. We don't learn these skills in school, and it honestly makes a worlds difference on your view of yourself and the world around you. 

Next time, don't ask them how to deal with the anger or sadness, ask your therapist, ""what can I learn to become more happy?""",mentalhealth,How I transitioned from being toxic and abusive to being empathetic and understanding.,2019-01-29 08:10:01

&amp;#x200B;

  My dad hasn't been a very stable person his entire life but the ever since I was born it seems that from my mom that he has had some manic episodes more frequently, but it has never been of the spiritual nature like it is now. It's always been stuff like baseball, history, video games, and for the past 3 years he has dropped everything for a conspiracy 4chan board. He is finally realizing that the board might not be all what it says it is, and he seems to be really affected by it. He liked the 4chan board so much because it made him feel extremely important, and now that that's gone, he now has gone to being the most important person in the entire universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are his current symptoms - 

&amp;#x200B;

Sleep deprivation, not slept for 4 days

Believes he is god, the first consciousness to ever realize it is alive

Trapping us in conversations that go on for hours

Seeing signs in everything, everything has meaning now

He believes that our dog is also a god, that me and my mother are gods

He has taken our dog off leash and walked 10 miles to another city, knocking on peoples doors, walking in traffic, standing still in traffic, putting dog poop on his hands and into his pockets, touching dog urine, lots of other irrational behaviors {doing all of this with our just one year old puppy, when he told us he got a sign that he needed to get 3 bagels at 6 am, and me and my mom trusted him to not do anything too crazy}

While trying to distract him from media he believed had signs in them, he started looking at me and my mother and believed that we were in on the creation of these videos and movies and shows that catered to him

He has been very hostile with us disagreeing with any and everything he says

He has begun to give away things to neighbors like our potted plants

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot more but I think that this sums up a lot of it. We are going to keep a very close eye on him, his truck is still at the bagel shop and my mom has hidden the keys to her car. 

I have never experienced this with a person in my life before. I don't know how to react to it and it has been hurting me a lot. I can't stand to be near him. He doesn't understand why I have cried when he begins talking about signs and that I have coordinated all this stuff to wake him up to the truth and that I'm acting and things.

&amp;#x200B;

  I know we cannot call the police because he will not comply and they'll just kill him. I know he will not voluntarily go to a hospital, or a psychiatrist, because when we found him in this neighborhood, he told me and my mother in the car that he heard voices that told him to not listen to us and keep walking and not to stop. He was very angry and wanted to get 3 lottery tickets because they are signs and we need to do things in 3s. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Does anyone have experience with this or anyone with mania and delusions and how to help him and calm him down? He is very short tempered right now and hasn't slept in 4 days now and refuses to sleep, just keeps drinking coffee. I am home schooled for health reasons and do not drive. My mother works and my father stays at home. She has taken off to make sure he doesn't do anything else and will keep staying home until it seems safe. If anyone can please talk about experiences they've had or have any advice in the slightest? Thank you

290,lillidubh,1548691392,1,"by: MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF for NPR Morning Edition (edited for clarity and content)

Examine and name your anger and it might be easier to let it go. Over the past three years, I've had one major goal in my personal life: To stop being so angry.

Anger has been my emotional currency. I grew up in an angry home. Door slamming and phone throwing were basic means of communication.

I brought these skills to my 20-year marriage. ""Why are you yelling?"" my husband would say.

""I'm not,"" I'd retort. Oh wait. On second thought: ""You're right. I am yelling.""

Then three years ago, an earthquake hit our home: We had a baby girl. And all I wanted was the opposite. I wanted her to grow up in a peaceful environment — to learn other ways of handling uncomfortable situations.

So I went to therapy. I kept cognitive behavioral therapy worksheets. I took deep breaths, counted to ten and walked out of rooms. And I even meditated at night.


These strategies helped me manage the anger, but they never really decreased it. It was like keeping a feral horse in a barn. I was contained, but not really domesticated.

Then, six months ago, I was talking with Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University. Right at the end of the hour-long interview, she tossed out this suggestion: ""You could increase your emotional granularity.""

My emotional what?

""Go learn more emotion words and emotion concepts from your culture and other cultures,"" she added.

Over the past 30 years, Feldman Barrett has found evidence that anger isn't one emotion but rather a whole family of emotions. And learning to identify different members of the family is a powerful tool for regulating your anger, studies have shown.

Or better yet, as I found, go and make up your own anger categories and start using them.

What is anger?

There's a common theory about anger. You'll find it in text books, scientific papers, news reports — even here at NPR. And some scientists support the theory, says Feldman Barrett.

The idea is that anger is one of several ""basic emotions"" that are universal, Feldman Barrett says. It's almost like a reflex — hard-wired in the brain. When something unjust or unfair happens to you, ""your blood pressure often goes up. Your heart rate will go up. Maybe you'll breathe heavily or you'll have a reddening of your skin,"" she says. ""Then you'll have an urge ... to punch or yell at someone. That's the stereotype of what anger is,"" Feldman Barrett says.

But it's not the full story.

What you feel when you're angry depends on the situation, what your past experiences are and how your culture has taught you to respond, she says.

As a result, there is actually enormous variation in the types of anger in the U.S., like exuberant anger when you're getting pumped up to compete in sports, or sad anger when your spouse or boss doesn't appreciate you.

When you look at other cultures, the variation explodes.

Germans have a word that roughly means ""a face in need of a slap,""or backpfeifengesicht. ""It's like you're so furious with someone that you look at their face, and it's as if their face is urging you to punch them,"" Feldman Barrett says. ""It's a great emotion.""

Ancient Greeks differentiated between a short-term anger that doesn't stick around (ὀργή or orge ) with a long-lasting anger that's permanent (μῆνις or menin).

Mandarin Chinese has a specific word for anger directed toward yourself, 悔恨 or huǐhèn. It's literally a combination of regret and hate, says linguist Yao Yao at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. ""You regret something you did so much, that you're angry at yourself,"" she says.

Thais have, at least, seven degrees of anger, says linguist Yuphaphann Hoonchamlong at the University of Hawaii. ""We don't walk around saying 'I'm angry.' That's too broad,"" she says. ""We may start with 'I'm displeased' and 'I'm dissatisfied' and then increase the intensity,"" she says.

And India is a treasure trove of angers.

""There's a common form of anger which means like 'when eggplant hits the hot oil,' "" says Abhijeet Paul, who teaches South Asian literature at Middlebury College.

""You suddenly become, like, really angry at hearing something shocking or learning something that you really, really dislike,"" Paul says.

Indians also differentiate between political anger, which you have for the ruling class or ""boss man,"" and personal angers, which you have for a friend, family or neighbor. You would never mix the two and express political anger in a personal relationship, Paul says.

""There's also a very interesting anger that is a loving anger,"" Paul says. You express this emotion toward a spouse when your spouse has angered you but you can't help them, only love them, he says. ""It's a mixed bag of love, grief, sorrow and anger.""

Personalize anger to help regulate it

So in many ways, anger is like wine. There are these major varieties — such as Chardonnay and Pinot Noir — but each vintage has its own unique combination of aromas, flavors and potency. The more practice you have at detecting — and naming — these nuances, the better you understand wine.

And if you learn to detect all the various flavors and nuances of anger and label them, you can start to handle your anger better, says psychologist Maria Gendron at Yale University.

""There's definitely emerging evidence that just the act of putting a label on your feelings is a really powerful tool for regulation,"" Gendron says. It can keep the anger from overwhelming you. It can offer clues about what to do in response to the anger. And sometimes, it can make the anger go away.

The idea is to take a statement that's broad and general, such as, ""I'm so angry,"" and make it more precise. Take the Thai: ""I'm displeased,"" or the German ""Backpfeifengesicht!""

Psychologists call this strategy emotional granularity. Studies show that the more emotional granularity a person has, the less likely they are to shout or hit someone who has hurt them. They are also less like to binge drink when stressed. On the other hand, people diagnosed with major depressive disorder are more likely to have low emotional granularity compared to healthy adults.

""There's a whole arm of research showing how functional it is to have finely tuned categories for our experiences,"" Gendron says.

Emotional granularity is like watching HDTV versus regular TV. It lets you see your anger with higher resolution, Gendron says. ""It gives you more information about what that anger means, whether you value that experience and choices about what to do next,"" she says.

This last part is key: Being granular with you anger helps you figure out what's the best way to handle the situation — or whether you should do anything at all.
For instance, if you are feeling a quick burst of anger, which you know will fade rapidly, then maybe doing nothing is the best strategy.

And you don't have to limit yourself to the labels that already exist, Gendron says. Be creative. Analyze what's causing your various angers, give them specific names and start using the terms with family and coworkers.

""If you're making a practice in your family of coming up with words and then using them together, that actually can regulate physiology,"" she says. ""That can resolve the kind of ambiguity about the situation.""

Personally, I found this strategy the most helpful. I started paying attention to what typically triggers my anger at work and at home. And I found three major types, which I named.

Illogical anger: This emotions happens when somebody at work makes a decision that seems completely illogical. Once I labeled this anger and started tracking what happens afterwards, I quickly realized that trying to convince an illogical person of logic is often futile – and a waste of time.

Hurry up anger: This is the anger I feel when someone else is not doing something fast enough — yes, I'm talking about the driver of the gray Prius at the stoplight this morning or the 3-year-old who will not put her shoes on fast enough. Once I labeled it, I realized that cars, people and toddlers eventually move. Huffing and puffing doesn't make it faster.

Disonophous anger: This is my favorite anger. And has the biggest impact on my life.

I wanted to figure out how to decrease yelling at our house. So I started paying attention to what often occurred right before the screaming began. It was super obvious: The dog was barking and the toddler was screaming. Basically two loud sounds simultaneously.

So my husband and I made up disonophous anger from the Latin for ""two sounds.""

Now when my husband says, ""I have disonophous anger, Michaeleen ..."" we know exactly what to do: Put the dog on the porch and pick up the baby.

And I know he's not angry at me. He just wants some peace and quiet.",mentalhealth,Anger: Find Your Granularity,2019-01-29 03:03:12

299,pricklypear_bear,1548682086,1,"I have been going through a lot. I recently moved out of my dads abusive ex. But now we’re homeless and living in our car, using our friends gym to shower and go to the toilet. 

Things started happening when I was very young though. So way before any of the ex girlfriend bs. I’m schizophrenic and have depression and it’s getting too much. I have tried to kill myself in the past but failed, just like almost everything I have tried in my life. 

I stayed at home today because I knew that if I went out then I would end up killing myself or at least hurting myself. I don’t technically want to do that but Edwood, in my head, he won’t stop about it. 

I’m not going to do anything too irrational during today, however I can’t make any promises about tonight... I really wish that I could. I can’t go out because every single time I have tried I have a major panic attack or ‘episode’ where I think everyone is trying to hurt me or their following me. It’s been horrible. But staying in makes me stress because I didn’t get anything done, so then I’m a failure and I have to see my family and face them not understanding. 

I asked my dad to help me check into a hospital today because I can’t do this anymore. But he said no, he won’t let me go because ‘I won’t like it there’ I’m not supposed to ‘like it’ I’m supposed to not kill myself. If I’m there then they can protect me. From myself and from the others. 

I saw a giant ass squirrel today. Only now did I realise it wasn’t fucking real. It was like human sized and I was scared out of my mind. I know it sounds stupid, it’s because it is. But oh well I’ll keep trying for now. But I don’t know how much I have left in me.

300,a03393,1548679947,1,"I live in a conservative, muslim-majority country. Most of my issues involve my fear of being abandoned and hated by my family and friends because of who I am: I'm gay and an ex-muslim. The majority of my life is centred around this fear for so long, that I've contemplated on committing suicide. I was also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and I have tried reaching for treatment, but I don't think the therapist is equipped to handle such issues. 

I do feel that they're not taking my problems seriously, I'm assuming it's because the problem isn't external, but mainly internal. It's a little sad, that I'll only be taken seriously once something physicaly happens to me. 

I've met 2 therapists, and they were both muslims. My current one tried to comfort me, saying God would help me power through my struggle or whatever. I was enraged, even when I told them prior I didn't believe in such things. The intent didn't matter, I was already sick and tired of people using the God card on me. 

I have no one to open up about my thoughts, I truly believe that my family and friends won't accept me. Even my therapist warned me that I should be careful with who I open up to, they said that someone might use it against me if I'm not careful. So, I'm thinking of quitting therapy all-together. The therapist has exhibited intolerance towards people like me, so I'm a bit scared to open up any longer. 

So, right now I feel bummed out. I have no one to reach out to in my life that I can fully trust. In my country, you'll be ostracized if you publicly come out as gay/ex-muslim. It's unfair, it's not like I chose to be gay. Heck, I was born into a muslim family, I never wanted this. Hiding myself makes me feel so worn out, especially considering how my friends and family publicly oppose people like me. I wish I could just run away to another place where my existence won't be denied. Talking badly about the people I love, it makes me feel bad because they've done so much for me. But the thought that the only reason they're tolerating me is because I've decided to hide parts of myself from them pains me so much. It makes me feel like a fraud and a liar, I feel guilty for being born the way I am. 

I'm not sure what's the point of this post, maybe a point to some direction would be nice. I feel completely lost in this situation, so any kind of word of guidance would be tremendous. Thanks for reading this lengthy post. :)

I'm very bothered about people trusting me because it's essential for any friendship or relationship and without that I'll be bored. I've found out I need friends to stop me from being bored. 

I still lack empathy, manipulate people (not really in a bad way, just for entertainment or need) and all the other text book symptoms.

303,Inspaceflying44,1548676327,1,"You don't have to read this if you're feeling bad already.. I wouldn't want to make anyone feel worse, but sometimes it's inevitable. I just don't know.. There are so many thoughts in my head.. memories, images, imagining things, hopes, negative remarks about nearly everything, etc. I just don't know what to do with myself. I feel like it all just repeats itself.. I feel unworthy with this brain. I feel like I cannot and in a way don't even deserve to be and speak and reach out.. But if I think that, then it's the end for me. So I tell myself other things, I compare myself with other people, in similar positions.. What is a person with Alzheimer.. isn't he worth exactly the same as a normal person?? Yes, but.. he can't do the same things. We define people based on what they do. They're good if they do ""good"" things or bad if they do ""bad"". Or they're useful if they do a lot of the good things, but what if they just can't? 
I don't have Alzheimer. I have ADD and depression and possibly bpd. But I don't perfectly find myself in any of those disorders. I'm just a person who doesn't know who he is, ended up being born and can't use his head like others can. I just feel useless because I can't do all those good things. I can't motivate myself like others or persevere, I forget everything, I don't even know anything about my relatives or my past. I try to smile, but too often I'm hiding myself. Out of shame. Of this empty head, slow processing speed, me not being able to help you. I hide myself too much and people notice. Recently I imagined myself without all these sympthoms.. who I would probably be.. It was a beautiful person. She talked to people freely, without thinking hard about it for minutes and then missing her chance and giving up. She knew and greeted about half the people in her class, and not no one or just the girl that sat next to her..She raised her hand in class immediately, and not nearly never, spoke in a normal volume and not way too silently, so that the others had to often ask what she had said. She woke up and needed only 20 minutes before leaving swiftly for her bus, and not an hour and still leaving too late and was there in time, about 7 minutes before it came.
She knew people and greeted them and chatted and laughed... And didn't avoid eye contact with everyone and hid herself in the corner..She went home and after eating she did her homework, she was finished in about an hour and didn't start at 10:30 pm even tho she had tried numerous times to start earlier and then need more than 3 hours to finish. And if she had a test, she would not have to think so hard about the concepts and invent bizzare memory hooks and ways in which to desperately remember the basic points, just to forget them the next day and have to only repeat it in her head and not be able to listen to anything else around her. She would talk with a group of her friends, about 2, she still slighly shy in bigger groups, but never to that extend of not saying anything, because the reason for that really was her not having understood and everything happening way too fast. She would remember random things about her friends from conversations and not be afraid of mentioning sth from a minute before because she's already forgot half of it. 
And so on and so on and so on.
I like that girl, she's a sweetie. She is the person I feel I am under everything, but I can never reach her because I am not her. I have ADD, depression and possibly bpd. I have this brain. I can only do this much. Which compared to others is nothing. But I live in this world. And people see this girl who looks normal on the surface, but is way too shy and hides herself and is just weird. Sometimes I ask myself if I'm not just a failed project of evolution.. something which cannot adapt.. and so it dies.. Currently I even stay at home, doing nothing the whole day again. I can't say I'm not trying. But if you looked at what I do, you'd probably say I'm not. You'd never see that other girl. I'm afraid I will never see her as well. So if I'm not her who can do those good things, who am I..

First I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and second I have Gastroparesis (a stomach disorder in which your food digests from your stomach way too slowly). I was in the ER 6 times in 2018, which almost all had to do with abdominal pain. Found out I had gallstones and had to have my gallbladder removed, btw I am only 22, and then my stomach issues began. More ER and doctors visits until after 6 months of pain I finally got diagnosed with Gastroparesis in September. 

Fast forward to today and I have not had to visit the ER for months. This is great news, but in the back of my mind I want a reason to. I get anxious and scared that my abdominal pain is not just a flair up of Gastroparesis, but appendicitis or something else. Then I feel crazy and stupid that I even thought it was something really serious as it goes away. I want to be right about something wrong with my body. I feel like I am going insane because of the desire to be in the ER or hospitalized, and idk why I can't shake it off. Maybe it's because that was a part of my life for almost a whole year and now I am doing better with medication. I just don't know, and it really brings me down.

Sorry if this is really long and sounds ridiculous. I just can't tell anyone this, and I have no idea what to do.

I just have nasty intrusive thoughts about violence.

So then I remembered my old acquaintance had a suicide attempt, thankfully he survived and is doing well now, but that was just scary as shit.

And so I ask if my behaviors are ‘normal’.

* When I get angry sometimes, I have intrusive thoughts of violence towards someone. Usually this doesn’t happen in real life, but I don’t know why, I watch videos of injustice and karma, and the commenters seem to express they have the ‘I wanna punch this guy for stealing from a blind man’ type of vibes, which I know isn’t normal... is it? So I try to consciously stop myself from thinking things like that.

* I masturbate too much. I admittedly can be a horny guy but I basically do it every day.

* I have a huge fear of psychosis. I heard that people undergoing prolonged psychiatric illnesses untreated like depression and anxiety can become psychotic... which I’ll have intrusive thoughts like: “what if this really means I’m going psychotic?”

* I don’t value much besides my health, safety, morals, my friends’ safety and wellbeing, and my hobbies.

I could probably list mods but am I ‘normal’? I know my feelings are valid and I want to be happy and healthy but I’m mentally ill.

I’m aware I’m autistic and dyslexic, I don’t know if that’s all the problem or there’s more to it. Maybe my brain just works different? I’m chemistry I had the highest grade in the school, but I can’t do anything past basic multiplication in math.

So I’m not completely sure if this qualifies as a intellectual disability or what. I was wondering what some good resources would be to read up on or look into, or if anyone has experience or knowledge in this area? I’m also quite self sufficient, but not fully able to live on my own. I’m sure this is all confusing because I’m not good at communication, so feel free to ask any questions.

I used to have a very active sex drive.  I did when I first started dating my husband.  I have since changed medications a lot and now I have almost zero sex drive. 

My husband and I have only been married a year and our sex lives were much happier when we were dating because of my medication change.  I feel like I’m a shitty wife and I definitely want to make him happy.  Sometimes I force myself to have sex with him just to make him happy but it always makes me feel dirty and uncomfortable.  I went through a couple traumatic things sexually in my past and usually that wouldn’t matter much, but combined with my lack of sex drive it’s really hard.

He is super gracious with me thankfully, but I want a happy, healthy sex life with him. It’s super frustrating for both of us.

My solution I have found has been getting high.  I’m fairly straight edge but Michigan just legalized marijuana so I have tried it a couple times and I have found it helps me feel comfortable and it makes me horny again.  Downside is, I hate smoking it because I can’t breath and I feel out of control while in the peak of the high.

Has anyone dealt with anything similar?  Does anyone have any solutions that might work for me? ",mentalhealth,I am afraid of having sex with my husband because of past trauma and medication.,2019-01-28 17:31:58

I’ve been at least depressed for awhile now, since middle school. I have anxiety, but this isn’t the anxiety all high school kids get. This is constant take over your mind and absorb it anxiety. I have a boyfriend, whom I love so much. I’m terrified of loosing him. I’ll get so worried almost worried sick when he goes out etc., but lately I’ve been doing so good because we’ve communicated about this. I only text him a few times and maybe call if I feel like something happened. 

But if he doesn’t tell me he had gone out (not in an obsessive way. I like when he gets out of the house and does his interests and hobbies. It makes me happy and happy for him!!!) I will start crying and freaking out. I lost my mom when I was seven which didn’t do much because I was so young, I didn’t know and I wasn’t extremely close from what I remember. Then, my two dogs that have been there since I began to breath died within a year and had to be put down due to tumors, and my beagle was my best friend and I got him on my birthday. I still remember when I got him. I still miss him and it’s been a year. I’m terrified of my loved ones and friends and family dying. I know everyone dies at some point but I can’t help it. 

I will pray constantly. Every single second of the day until my head starts to feel full. Unless I am occupied go the point I am focused completely on something there will go no moment where I haven’t prayed for my loved ones to be alive safe and happy within two minutes. It’s comforting yet tiring, and it’s such a habit I can’t not do it. It’s like I have OCD or something. It’s scary and sucks. I don’t want to loose my boyfriend, he means the world to me. 

I feel sad all of the time. I feel like it gets on peoples nerves. But I’ve gained weight again, and I just can’t help but feel I’m ugly. I know I’m average, but I just try so hard to eat and stay as healthy as money is available for my dad to use for it. My dad is great, however makes me feel worthless. I feel unloved but as if he feels if he just has to love me because. He is so nice until one thing sets him off and when he’s stressed it’s worse. He calls me a moron, idiot, stupid, bitch, and tells me to shut the fuck up a lot and cusses and is so scary when he yells. Today I was doing homework, and he found out our puppy had a small accident, and when he asked me to clean it up I said super calm “I have lots of homework and I’m doing it, can you “, and he started to yell at me and called me a fucking moron. It makes me feel like I’m not loved and it’s been much worse that that. He does it all of the time. I have at least 14 overdue assignments because I had been gone for personal and school trip reasons, and I was finally able to start working on it. The minute that happens I just feel like sleeping and for as long as possible and crying. I felt too stupid to do them. 

My anxiety prevents me from doing the things I love to, and my hobbies which is what the advice I usually get is to do. I’ll write two words and get bored.

336,fromnorfolkwithlove,1548646861,1,"Through recent introspection and in retrospect, I’ve realized I think I may have fucked everything up.  Here’s why;

Since I was a kid I was feeling like I’m in the shadows even though I had moments of fun and being a child, I don’t ever remember feeling healthy or balanced.  There was violence and abuse in the family when I was a kid and then we became a very religious family going into my preteens until I was 19/20.  I hid the fact that I was gay from everyone, even trying to tell myself that it was just a phase.  I tried to date girls but I was never attracted to them in that way.  While I was in middle school I became obsessed with a man that was one of the school’s art teachers.  The more and more I happened to see him or his name the more I became interested in him.  Then suddenly one day I was obsessed with him.  I thought he was very handsome, masculine and cool.  He has beautiful eyes that I enjoyed to see too.  And it seemed like the students that had him liked him which made him more attractive to me.  Now, I didn’t think he was gay at all but I just wanted him to give me attention.  I wanted him to notice me and to be around him more, but yet I was sexually attracted to him too(I started watching porn before I was 10 I think and haven’t stopped since even though I’ve had dry periods).  But I didn’t want to get him in trouble even if he was gay and attracted to underage boys.  I knew about sex in middle school and by now I was masturbating, watching porn and fantasizing about older men.  When I said I became obsessed, it started small and became toxic.  I would try to be around his classroom sometimes or just walk a little more if he seemed he was going in the same direction as me. After a little bit, I would try to strike conversation with him if we happened to be in close enough physical contact.  Then I wanted to know more about him because it seemed like he wasn’t paying me much attention at all really but I would hear and see him with other students which I concluded “he liked them more than me.”   After some searching, I found his phone number and started calling him.  I remember now that when I did get his number I contemplated if I should call him or not because I was excited and just wanted to hear his voice.  So I knew that this wasn’t very healthy I think subconsciously.  I called him and hearing his voice felt good but I didn’t want him to know it was me calling because he didn’t get my number!  So I would just hang up.  Unfortunately I didn’t stop after the first time and he actually traced the caller ID somehow and called back to my surprise.  I’m not sure who answered the phone when he called but he told my parents and they sat me down.  I don’t remember what was said, how we got pass that, or much at all after that really.  But then when I finally saw his hands, I was turned off because his nails were very stubby.  So I just went on with school after. 

Then after that there was high school.  I developed another obsession in high school with another teacher that happened to be one of my teachers this time unlike the middle school crush.  This guy was handsome and cool to me but he was also pretty comical too.  His sense of humor to me was nice.  It started small and became big again.  I was able to function around him and do work at first.  This guy would have the class feeling fun and I really enjoyed that about him.  He would give nickname to his favorites (even though he wouldn’t admit that he had favorites I observed that he did).  One day he gave e a nickname and I felt like the shit!  I knew he wasn’t gay either as even if he was, “why would he be attracted to underage boys or me?”  But I felt like I just couldn’t help myself.  It started again. I actually freaking developed a crush on this guy.  So I tried to be around him more by doing more work and even joining he tennis team that he coached.  I would look him up on whatever I could think of at the time after finding out his first name.  And then, it hit hard.  I actually did ANOTHER thing.  Being so distraught about the fact that we could never be together at all and that i wasn’t one of his top favorites, one day I started crying in the classroom discreetly.  But he noticed how down I was and tried to see what was going on.  I lied about what it was, but now him and the whole class is wondering what’s up.  This went on for more than one class I remember.  I got over him somehow eventually and that whole thing didn’t bring us closer.  

Then I did actually start trying to date gay men after graduating high school without coming out still.  I ended up losing my virginity to some guy I met online.  Then I ended up in a toxic relationship with an older man afterwards even though I pursued him in the beginning.  

The first time I actually was in a relationship with a man it ended up toxic as fuck.  This guy(let’s call him M) didn’t even try to pursue a relationship with me at first but I did with him even though he wasn’t even really “my type.”  At this point I am only 18/19 I believe and this would be the second man that I consented to being sexual with.  But once we started dating, I think about a month in, it went to shit.  We brought out the worst in each other without even trying.  He was a paranoid guy when it came to dating and verbally abusive.  I was very sensitive but also trying like crazy to be with him for whatever reason(s).  We would break up and get back together several times and all while I was trying to still appear to be “straight” to everyone else in the world.  Eventually we broke up for good when I left for the final time because it started becoming physically unsafe on top of the emotional turmoils.  We had some good times but none of them were THAT good, yet we kept going back and forth bringing the worst out of each other even over very trivial things(we would even argue about arguing).  

But there was also a guy I met that was more around my age(let’s call him B) whom I was interested in after he displayed interest in me. But I chose to stay with the toxic relationship mess I was in so I thought that I ruined the relationship and added tremendously to the toxicity after M found out and also a chance with the guy that was interested in me.  But I became obsessive over both M and B.

While with M, he would block me and do all kinds of things to push me away but I kept trying to be with him over and over.  I would call him from different phones or just email him if he blocked me through texts and calls.  It was like I finally woke up from all of it and decided that our separation was long over did because nothing was getting better and did in fact become worse.  I stopped all together. 

I now go to B unfortunately because I now think that B was the guy I was suppose to be with and not M.  But not only did I push B away by being a total bitch to him to stay with M, B was now also dating someone.  He disclosed this to me after I tried to go back to him so to speak.  And obsession round 4 starts.  I’m going through social media and anything else I can looking him up and searching more info on him.  I’m literally trying to cyber stalk him and feeling so guilty, ashamed and low that I become depressed.  I become depressed with the belief that him and I should’ve been together instead of M and i and I chose the wrong guy.  The kicker is, this goes on for months.  After all the drama with M, now I’m going through more drama but with myself only now.  B moved on.  And “I was so shitty for how I talked to him and ending things with him.” 

Somehow I managed to keep going (with a smile) and still going from job to job, still trying to make ends meet and move up with life.  One day B and I start talking again surprisingly and I am really happy about that.  Then we actually hang out and we just did more sexual things than anything without going all of the way.  Then shortly after, maybe a couple of days or so, he switched up how he was acting towards me.  Come to find out, he and the guy he was dating got back together and B just cut me off pretty much.  Then it happened again; another depressed episode that I remember lasting for about a week.  But even though I bounced back from that I did not snap out of obsessive behaviors with B.  I would still check on his social media and do searches for him even though over time I did that less and less. But one day we started talking again because I found his number on his FB.  I sent him a text and he responded and we started talking like nothing ever happened. 

We started dating again and it was going well.  We really had fun times together.  But I started questioning myself, overthinking and over reacting mostly.  He didn’t do anything that was a “red flag” but I just would get triggered with him every other week.  I remember getting on his case about him not texting me back while he was at work, because in my mind if he could text me back sometimes then i shouldn’t have to wait hours for him to respond when I know he has his phone with him. I remember getting on him about going out with some friends one night because he told me he was going to let me know when he got to his friend’s place but he didn’t.  I remember it seemed like it was me getting on his case mostly and it started becoming almost frequent.  It got to the point where I’m getting on him about even more stuff that I thought normally wouldn’t even bother me.  I was getting on him over and over. I thought it was just because I was working three jobs at one time.  I thought it was because I was stressing over rent and bills. Until the next guy.

Needless to say B breaks up with me and shortly after he got a job offer elsewhere.  It was a job he wanted and he relocated.  I went into it again; the depression episode.  This time, I couldn’t work without crying or anyone noticing my demeanor. This time it’s worst because I have three jobs, living without my parents and feeling like I’m failing at everything.  Feeling like I drove him away again.  I’m checked into the hospital by a co worker and friend that takes me to the hospital.  From there I’m checked into the mental institution hospital.  

So fast forward some months, I’m over B and feel like I have a new, better and healthier outlook.  I started becoming spiritual and feeling like I was changing perspectives.  I moved back in with my immediate family and transitioned to work only 1 job.  I really enjoyed this job too! I was a server at a restaurant and the longer I worked there the better I got at it and felt about everything.  I would pray more, meditate, take myself on dates, go out, stay in, do things with the family and etc.  I was on a roll and even when faced with challenges, I still pushed through for about a year.  Within that year, I was promoted to be a manager of the restaurant, attended the wedding of my best friends who I also work with, went to Miami on top of everything else I changed for the better.  B and I even chatted again and I felt like I was really over him!! Life was so good, I really changed up and felt like I was living my best life!! 

So then in June of 2018 I quit the restaurant suddenly after a fallout with the owner who is also my friend who’s wedding I attended.  It was me over reacting about a comment he made about some of the workers that I didn’t agree with.  We didn’t see eye to eye and I definitely didn’t listen to him.  I quit that day and walked about just before my shift.  Even though I got another job less than a week after that, I still realized that I messed up.  We apologized to each other after I called him up and he hadn’t treated me different at all.  Now I’m working at another restaurant but I quit that one too after only about a month of being there.  Some of the employees started fighting in the kitchen and there were other things going on too so I just decided to leave.  I then got another job about a week or so after that. 

While working at this new place, the coffee shop, I meet another guy.  Let’s call him Z. But I didn’t meet him at work.  I met him after going to visit some family that lived out of state and we happened to meet.  The night we met I found out was on a full moon in August of 2018.  When we saw each other it was like fireworks.  I saw his face light up and I felt warm on the inside.  We had some good sex that night and spent idk how long talking with each other. It felt so right, like it was home or familiar.  We already trusted each other and knew things about each other intuitively.  We also had common interests and goals too.  

Of course I leave because I have to go back to my hometown.  I thought it was too good to be true and that we wouldn’t continue because we lived in different states.  But about a week or so after Z starts messaging me again asking me mostly when would I come back? I remember thinking “holy crap he really likes me and I like him!”  We were determined to see each other again!  We would y’all when we could until I started tripping.  A couple of weeks into our talking phase, I didn’t know what to make of it because we never said we were officially dating even though he stated we were both single yet he wanted me all to himself.  So I was confused about that and starting the overthinking process, but instead of flat out asking him what’s up I just tried to go with the flow.

One day I notice he doesn’t text me back.  But I’m determined to not be upset about it. But that 1 day turned into 2 and I was starting to become a little anxious because the last text I sent him was a really sweet one that came from my heart.  “It’s ok, you don’t need to freak out. You aren’t needy. You take days sometimes to respond to people too sometimes,” I kept telling myself.  But I caved and sent him a text again.  Then he said he couldn’t talk at that moment so I replied back asking if he would like phone calls better.

That night he called me and he started talking about his day.  I told him I wish I was there to rub him down and he made a joke that made my heart jump.  He said “don’t go falling in love,” jokingly but for whatever reason I instantly felt discomfort inside of me.  I played it off and tried to joke back like I wasn’t triggered at all.  He made another joke that I was triggered about right after. Talk about double wammy.  He said he was saying the sweet things and all “just to get the puss*” jokingly and I played it off.  We said goodnight but I was bothered. “Was I right about him? Is this why I’ve been feeling like I’ve been getting mixed signals? Oh no I really like this, I thought we were vibing pretty well naturally.”  

The next morning I texted him saying how “I would rather be dating a guy that I’m having sex with and that if you just want sex that’s ok but it’s difficult for me to do that.  If I’m having sex with a guy it’s because I like him on more than one level.”  He said he thinks we should talk more and when we finally get the time we talk.  But it’s more of me rambling through texts than anything else. He states that “if you wanted to date you could’ve just said that and he would be willing to date” but by this time I’m already rambling through texts sending him message after message.  He then calls me and states how it was turning him off and he was just joking. 

After the phone call we didn’t talk for a little bit, maybe about a week or so.  For whatever reason I started looking through tarot card readings on YouTube and the readings I watched striked me because of what the readings were saying that I kept watching.  Several different videos seem to be describing him and I!! I was shook, they said we would get married and have a great relationship amongst many other qualities and characteristics that we both have.  I couldn’t believe it, it was like they were saying that this was bound to happen;Z and I meeting.  The readings kept describing us, the living situations and more so accurately! And that we’re soulmates!! 


So now after this I’m distraught because these readings are so accurate it seems yet I messed it up because I already have been pushing him away.  I texted him more saying how I’m sorry and that I liked him.  He was trying to tell me just let it go but I didn’t. I felt bad and was struggling with my emotions again in secret.  I started already going back in forth in my head about him and then after the tarot cards I just wanted to go back to the way it was before.  I just wanted to move forward but I didn’t know how because I felt blinded.  I felt like I was losing it.  He told me we couldn’t date after me trying to bring up the phone call for the 3rd time.  I still tried to play it off and said “you’re right. Could I give you something as a toke of my appreciation?”  

I was thinking that my gift be a massage for him. That is what he would like because he told me he would like that before.  He told me he would like for me to come to him even though I didn’t tell him what the gift was.  But the day before, he seemed to have forgot because I text him a reminder and he didn’t even know what I was talking about until I sent a screen shot to him. 

So in October I travel out of state, go see him and everything goes down hill.  It seemed like that whole day before going to see him I was rushing and scattered.  He gets home from work and I go see him.   He opens the door and I instantly felt the energy was different than the last time I was in his arms.  We have a little bit of small talk and then I take his arm and he follows me into the bedroom.  As soon as we get to the bed he starts getting ready for sex and I tell him “that’s not why I brought you here, I want to give you a massage.”  He seemed so excited the first time we talked about it before we had the phone call.  But he just says”yeah each, after this.” And proceeds to undress.  I’m attracted to him and I believe him and think “maybe everything is ok.”  So we have sex but it’s not the same for me, I’m not as relaxed or into it as I was the first time.  I still had things on my mind and did feel like something was wrong slightly.  After the sex he asks me a series of questions and compliments me before giving me a kiss as I’m getting my clothes on after showering.  

I literally remember thinking “he’s kissing me goodbye,” when he kissed me.  I acted like nothing was wrong though and left.  So the next day I text him and nothing.  Then I sent him another text the day after that and nothing.  So about a week after that I sent another and nothing.  I’m thinking “ok, don’t freak out he’s just busy.”  I call and nothing and then I realize that he really isn’t saying anything at all back.  I figured “I’ll just keep sending him messages that I feel like would be good for him.”  I didn’t text him every day, but about a week apart from each other. 

One day, I notice that he blocked me.  I have become all too familiar with how to know you have been blocked from being with M.  That’s when I start freaking out.  But I lied and said that I got a new phone after messaging him on Instagram. He still didn’t respond from Instagram either and then that’s when it really sunk in that he just didn’t care about me at all anymore.  “What did I do that was so wrong that he couldn’t even tell me that? Why did he not even respond to not one thing? I wasn’t sending him messages about us dating either I was sending friendly stuff, so why did he just ghost me:(“ 

I lost it when I realized he really was ignoring me and I didn’t know why.  “I know that I overthought and caused some disconnect. But the last one we were together I didn’t know he really didn’t even want to speak to me at all. I couldn’t even get a thanks for this or that I upset him? Why does he hate me now?!! He just used me for some sex??!” All of these thoughts were racing once I realized this but I just messaged him “I didn’t realize you were ignoring me but thank you for everything.”

And here we go again; depression episode 5.  At first I thought I would be fine, after all I did start overthinking and putting strain on us. But it literally hit harder and harder each day until by the end of November I was feeling down.  I kept thinking about the tarot cards and how that was suppose to be Z and I. Those tarot card readings I listened to seemed to accurate for me to believe that it was ok that we didn’t work out.  “That was the life I’ve been wanting and working for,” I thought to myself and “I screwed it up.”  Then I began being observed and checking his social media and becoming darker and darker. “OMG HE REALLY IS A GREAT GUY” the more and more I searched him.  “I just messed up this thing that could’ve been wonderful with the man of my dreams.”

One night while working I start crying feeing like I have lost control.  Since that night it would
Get worse to the point where I am in the sunken place again.  It’s worse now because “I thought I knew better.”  I’m contemplating suicide because I feel so stupid and hopeless for the life that I’ve wanted.  I feel like a fake too because I was so positive before all of this.  The “single” me doesn’t get depressed, “I was doing good man.” 

Further and further down the hole I go.  I am questioning myself because I thought I knew better yet still became like my old toxic self.  “Everyone knows me as a positive and fun person and I have been doing so good. Praying,eating better and etc. what happened?!! Why did I get so triggered? Why didn’t I ramble like that? Why didn’t I stop myself with the new hobbies,skills and abilities I know I have now?! Why did I tell Z that I don’t think I can give him what he wants?! Why did I start criminalizing and and questioning him like that only to see he really is the guy I’ve been praying for to be with?!!”

Then that’s turned into “let’s get him to talk to me somehow. I want to hear his voice. Why did he ghost me like that, I’ll make him pay.”

Starting this out I've had issues with anxiety and depression my whole life. General Anxiety disorder, depression and borderline personality disorder are my diagnosi. 
I've been on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication. A few different ones to start. Now been on daily medications since March of 2015. The meds I've been on have been the same for about the last two years with no changes other than not taking any in the morning due to the drowsiness side effects making it hard to function and only taking meds at night. I see my doctors every 3 months to refill prescriptions and to check in. At the last check mid December '18 they said I was doing well and wanted to keep me on meds as I was stable at the check up and they assured me there was no addictive properties in my medication. I believed that until I accidentally missed a dose of my meds the night before Christmas eve. Then I barely slept that night, woke up extremely tired and anxious, and then sent my sister to get my meds for me to take that night. Well by about dinner time I had shakes and chills and felt like complete shit, I didn't realise it felt like withdrawls until I went and smoked a joint and came back in and was still not well. Ended up taking my meds and going to bed early that night while the rest of my family had the Christmas party. 
I know if I get off medication it's not a cold Turkey thing like if I missed a dose. But how long is too long to be on such things?
I've heard of people being on medication for many years at a time but I've also been told that it's a crutch and not to be dependent on it and it's just a bandaid to assist during therapy/counseling. Idk I guess I'm looking for opinions since I work full time and haven't been in therapy/counseling in about a year and a half at this point. Maybe this is a vent post.

Hi everyone. I'm a semi-functioning 32f with clinical depression and borderline personality disorder. I have a ft job that I love, and they are very accommodating to my mental health. I am in a happy relationship (2 years in March), we have an apartment and 3 cats together; we each have our own car. We're talking about having a baby, and have been actively trying. My cycle is out of wack because I was on birth control pills since I was 18, and only stopped taking them this August.

Things are great on the surface, right? I have been struggling with my mental health really badly these past 2 months or so. I have taken time off work due to it. Only used 2 sick days, and the rest has been due to a lack of work at my company. I have a few days of work coming up and then I will be off for 7 days for a mini staycation.

While things are relatively fine, our home is a bit of a mess. Our bedroom is an organization disaster. We have laundry to be done (his task), but we have shared laundry in this building and we never get an opportunity to use the machines, because they are always in use by the other tenants.

We were looking at buying a house before Christmas. We paused the search due to other financial obligations. He bought a brand new car at the end of the year, so now we have put the search on a hiatus. Which is fine, it gives us the opportunity to save up, because our rent is super cheap.

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. I guess I just needed a vent. I don't have a therapist anymore, because the one I had was just a social worker and meant for ""short term"". I'm going to talk to my doctor about an increase on my SSRI, or possibly a different medication. But I don't want to be on anything too high that would need to be decreased once I get pregnant.. Well, if, I guess.

I've been crying a lot. Feeling hopeless. Worthless. Wanting to hurt myself and generally not be around anymore. I have been a bit irratic lately, but in private. My partner doesn't even know that I have been mixing pills with alcohol, as well as pot (it's legal here 🇨🇦). I don't want to die, but often I am crying to myself telling me as such, that I wish I was dead. I find myself struggling to get through many days. I just feel so lost. I haven't done anything I have wanted to do in life. I thought I would have had 3 kids by this point in my life, but I made many stupid decisions in relationships. Not with this one, though. But I still wonder if he wishes he chose someone else, or maybe he feels like he can't leave me. He tells me otherwise when I ask, but I dunno.

Life hurts, man. I was born with a condition that caused me to have arthritis at an early age. It is manageable with regular painkillers, but the older I get, the more pain I get. I have trouble using stairs, I have to take them one step at a time (one foot up, next foot to same step, repeat). I need to push a shopping cart when shopping, to help my balance.

Ugh, I dunno guys. I'm just rambling I think. My partner doesn't understand mental health, and I don't know how to help him understand it.

I don't know what I'm even posting for. I just don't know what I'm doing or why I feel this way. I just wish I was ""normal"". I want a baby so badly, before my body shuts down even more.

I said things I still regret, and I will always be sorry to you for that. But that didn't justify you sending my scar pictures to my friend, exposing my darkest secret. But yet again, you apologised the next day and I was too blinded to move on. 
But now I'm done. I've blocked you on everything. I've cut off contact with all your toxic friends. I'm done. But I love you. I think I always will deep down. You're the first one I ever opened up to. You'll always be in my heart for that reason. I hope you do recover, I know you're so clever and you want to go to medical school, and I know you can do it. I hope you get the high rise apartment in New York, with lots of room for your cat. I hope you are happy, and in another world I would be there next to you to cheer you on.

1. I've cheated on many many partners, solely to benefit myself with feelings of validation from multiple people, or just to feel SOMETHING. 

2. I've impulsively messaged tons of both men and women in an attempt to flirt, just so I can feel wanted and loved, even if I had plenty of friends and family or a boyfriend/girlfriend who cared about me.

3. I've used so many people for drugs, sex, attention, etc. just because I felt like that's the only way I could function. I've also charged my own family members and friends gas money just to buy drugs after bringing them to wherever they're going.

5. I've lied to people about my feelings towards them to make THEM feel wanted, but ended up leaving them in the dust shortly after.

6. I've made myself seem like a totally different person than I really am just so I can have people tell me what a nice person I am, even though I quite obviously was not.

Ever since I can remember I've had this ability to change the way I perceive space. It is very hard to explain, but the most accurate explanation I can give is I can perceive what the world would look like if everything shifted 90 degrees. Like north becomes east, east becomes south and so on. And so I can get 3 types of these perceptions apart from the normal one. Nothing materially changes in the room I'm in. I would shift constantly between these perceptions as a child but then I stopped doing it. Recently I started doing it again and saw that these perceptions gave me mood swings. One of them makes me intensely elated in a nostalgic sort of way, and one of them makes me gloomy and depressed the entire time I'm in the perception of space.

I'm very bubbly and try my best to keep a good personality at my workplace. It's gotten me far with the management and I've gotten a lot of promotions because of it. However, there are instances where my coworker interactions make me feel like ... trash. 

For example, today. Instead of there being calm discussion about WHY something was mixed up, my coworker decided to come up to me and yell ""What the fuck is wrong with you. What is going on"" in front of customers. Not the greatest way to go about that situation. Followed by the same coworker calling me dumb when I accidentally spilled a drink. This is a coworker that I sometimes have a lighthearted joke with here and there, but never so much for her to yell at me in front of customers and for her to call me dumb.

I always think the worst in situations and have weighed the doctor decision for years straight and I hoped cops would have just got me by now because I cant make a decision for anything.

382,volusias,1548610503,1,"All my time is spent thinking of argument scenarios in all kinds of situations with all kinds of people. It's extremely draining, and I always lose in the end, which then leaves me feeling drained and upset as if I've had an actual argument with someone, except there's no possibility of talking it out (because it never really happened in the first place). It leaves me feeling utterly powerless.

The stupid thing is instead of telling myself ""well, it didn't really happen, it's just something I imagined"", I can't help but think that it's something that could realistically happen at any moment. Because of this it still has a very real effect on me, because it tells me that were I ever to actually end up in such a situation, I would lose and the effect will be a million times worse because this time it would be real.

And I can't stop doing it, every time I lose an argument in my head, the need to keep imagining it in order to actually be prepared rises. So I do it more often, lose more often, my need to keep trying in order to protect myself (in case it actually happen irl) increases, and so I end up in a horrible downward spiral.

So many therapies or meditation/mindfulness exercises focus on realizing the objective situation, and for some reason this seems to be my weakest point. Because for as far as I know I rarely get involved in heavy arguments, irl there's not much going on to talk about. It's literally all just scenarios in my head that haven't happened yet, but they have an almost equally negative effect on me.

I was wondering if anyone perhaps has any advice on how to go about this, because I really can't seem to stop these compulsive thought arguments. Imagine getting into about 10 intense fights on the daily. I'm absolutely exhausted and feel really hopeless because of this. On top of that I feel extremely guilty and hesitant to talk about this, because my actual life really isn't so bad when others have so many struggles to deal with irl that they can't control. My problem is literally just in my head, defeating myself for God knows what reason.

I'm already going to therapy, but it's going a bit rusty so far. I'd be really grateful just to hear other people's thoughts or opinions on this.

Tl;dr
My real life seems fine, but I'm constantly tortured with imaginary compulsive arguments in my head that I lose 9/10 times. I can't seem to stop it, because I feel like it's a way of preparing for the worst (even though it seems to not be working).

I'm finally on a wait list for a psychiatrist, but I'm trying to figure out what I might have before the end of the year, when my appointment will probably be, in hopes that I can start helping myself.

Here's what I experience;

- Mood swings, like one minute I'll be perfectly fine and the next ill be super angry, or one minute I'll be extremely happy and the next ill be balling. 
- Highs and Lows. My SO has noticed that some months I'll be really happy and enthusiastic about everything and super positive and the next few months is like a downward spiral of depression and anger, but I can't spot myself in these phases until they've passed.
- Anxiety, mainly about germs and people and public crowds (which probably stems from my emetophobia). 
- I have been known to spend lots of money recklessly on things that we don't need in the heat of a moment, only to regret it later.
- I need constant reassurance from my SO that they love me, or I'll start to think that they don't. I honestly don't know why this is because we're very happily married.
- I sleep. A LOT. I can sleep from 8pm to 10am and sometimes inbetween.

Depression, extreme anxiety, worried everyone hates me.

I also need to:

Get all my engineering studies done, start making money, workout, ""become a man"" or at least a strong dependable person that people want in their lives.

I would like to:

Improve my social skills, get better at guitar, get a girlfriend, read more.

What I really need help with is the first three things. I don't know if I can afford to see a therapist but my uni does have people to talk to.

I feel like I may need CBT.

I'm part of a sports club and I would like to take a break (maybe 4-8 weeks or more) to sort myself out but I feel like this may make things worse. I do plan on joining some meetups in the meantime.

One of my issues is that I always feel like I'm on the outside of any social group, and that everyone talks to everyone on Snapchat and Facebook except to me. I'm wondering if I should actively change this or grow to not care, I really have no strategy right now.

Another element of this is jealousy, when I see friends messaging people constantly but I rarely get a message it makes me feel unloved.

If I do take a break, what should I say to the people in the club that I'm closest to? More, less, or nothing?

I'm really in a terrible spot, right now. None of my problems are that serious at the moment but they're very severe and could get worse.

He's mentioned a few times that he wants to commit suicide and is very adamant about it, not giving much reason other than he feels like he isn't progressing. In response to this I have helped him apply to university and such but he's just thrown it all away at the last second. He has recently moved and due to landlords demands we no longer see each other as frequently and our chats over messenger lack substance as he works nights. I know he's struggling at the moment and as he result is treating me disgustingly so I have been trying to distance myself as I am fragile. Last night after a few days of not speaking, he got drunk with a random guy (didn't even ask me if I wanted to see him but he'll go with someone he doesn't know...) And messaged me at 5am saying he will kill himself November next year and I won't even know. November is my birthday. I asked if he could at least pick a different month and he said no. I really genuinely care about him and I don't know what I can do. I'm his emergency contact on his doctors information so I will be the first person to know. This is a horrible situation that is completely unfair on me as he's been treating me so badly these past few months, the extent being leaving me in an alleyway with a broken ankle and nowhere to go. He won't accept professional help in the slightest and will cut me off if I try. I'm at a complete loss of what to do. He's given me a deadline to change his mind essentially. I feel like I should tell his sister because I know he won't, however she is polish and there is a language barrier, I wouldn't want to scare her or anger either of them. I feel like there's a reason he only told me.

390,oeimili,1548598902,1,"I think it depends on the nature and severity of the mental illness. Some mental illnesses cause the individual to make connections that others don’t. I believe autism is one where the individual is making too many connections in their mind which paralyzes their physical movements.

I think bipolar individuals on average make more connections between things than most people. This gets out of hand when you are manic. You start believing that these thoughts are the more important thoughts in the world. (God wants me to do this, aliens are coming, seeing things...).

I honestly think that with the right medication and right counseling, people will mental health issues are blessed with hyper awareness of reality. It is not some sort of “super power”. It is just something that we have. We are hyper aware of reality and it makes us go “crazy” as some regular folks would say.

Mental health is not a joke. We are not crazy. We are not blessed (even tho we could potentially use it for good). We are only burdened with the weight of reality that so many normal people forget.

If you just forget for a moment that you are the center of your world and meditate on the fact that we all are extras in someone else’s world, I think that by taking attention off yourself, you will feel less pressure and less anxiety and less depression. I say less... it will never be completely gone. Many of is are stuck with a life long struggle. And you have the choice and ability to live a balanced life which is at war with your mind.

With the help of medication, counseling, group therapy, music, art, dancing, relationships, God, religion, politics, friends, nature... I believe that you can do this. You CAN live a good life. You WILL get better with time.

What she hears doesn't make any sense apparently. She says that life is ""life is tolerable this way"", but obviously she still want to get rid of those voices and sounds.

I'm a 20-yr-old female college student who struggles immensely with self-restraint. That's the real biggy. I'll attempt to commit to a task, but whenever I even slightly lose interest/motivation, it's like my brain just checks out. I can't focus for the life of me, and even the most mundane distractions will rip me away from any semblance of productivity. And forget about finishing projects, especially the long-term ones. I'm an artist, and often I'll find that over the course of two-three hours, instead of committing to a single drawing, I'll end up bouncing between 5 different ones, making a tiny amount of progress on each of them. I've gone months without actually finishing a single drawing. It's an incredibly inefficient work style, but the only one I can consistently manage.

I'm pretty fidgety, and when I'm sitting down for an extended period of time, I'll get up and use the bathroom way more often than necessary just so I can walk around. I can't seem to stay seated for long, in general (unless I'm being sufficiently stimulated). I'll fidget, or \[again\], make excessive visits to the bathroom. I also pace like a madman when on the phone, if that means anything.

I'm pretty impulsive, with both my money and my time. If I decide I want (or want to do) something, I'll almost always just let myself have it. Not because the consequences of doing so are benign, but because their effects aren't imminent enough. I could give these decisions (like buying an unnecessary $200 iPod touch) more thought and deliberation, but there's often an urgency to these impulses (I have to buy this thing NOW! Quick, before I stop being excited about it!) that prevents me from doing so.

Sometimes I forget to pay attention during normal conversations. I am RECKLESSLY forgetful. I feel like a total screw-up of a human, and have for a damn while. Even if I don't have ADHD, if there's anyone who can relate to what I'm going through, and has advice to offer, I could use it.

Other than a few depressive episodes that I never told anyone about in middle school, my years leading up to college were pretty average. One thing that I started doing towards the later years highschool was excessively smoking weed and nicotine. It wasn't a problem at first and it was pretty fun but I started to taper off of it after a while during my first year at college. I failed to make any meaningful friends and it made me extremely depressed. I would wake up at 4pm on some days, go to class then go back to my room and sleep again. The only thing I did was do school work, and hook up with girls on tinder. Eventually I was able to get out of my depression around spring time but I noticed my memory was getting extremely bad (remembering what I ate the day before was really hard). It started improving after a while and my memory was getting better but around September of 2018 I started falling in the same depressive cycle except it seemed worse. I would wake up late, lay in bed all day, walk around for a little then stay on my computer until I fell asleep.

I am going to a psychiatrist for the first time Monday afternoon and I really don't know what to expect. I've had issues with anxiety for several years now but I've been feeling lately like I might have depression but I've never had an official diagnosis. 

I'm a second semester nursing student and now this is becoming a problem and getting in the way of school. This is mostly because I get very overwhelmed with all the work and studying that I need to do that a lot of the times I just don't end up doing it (which was not really a problem for me until I started nursing school). I have a hard time being motivated to even go to class sometimes because I have a hard time concentrating and I live an hour away from my school. I am tired pretty much all the time, even if I laid around in bed for most of the day and did basically nothing. It's been getting a lot harder for me to get up in the morning and get started. I feel like I've been moving slower and slower lately and by the time I've mustered up whatever I need to study or anything, the day is mostly over. I worry sometimes that I might just be a lazy piece of shit but I've never felt like this before. I feel like I'm on the verge of failing even though I am doing relatively well and I want to quit school all the time.

There's also just been a lot of stuff going on in my family life, mostly in the last two years. I'll try to keep this part short mostly because there's too much for me to talk about but all in all, my dad left my family about two years ago very suddenly for another woman and I have not seen him since. My parents got divorced about a year ago and it's been very hard on my mom and she has, in turn, taken it out on me and my sister with screaming, projecting, etc. Most recently, she was talking with me about how the end of my parents' marriage came about and said to me ""I'm not trying to make you feel guilty"" and then proceeded to tell me that me losing my virginity to a man I wasn't married to played a part in their divorce. I don't know how she came to this in her mind but it definitely made me feel like shit to know that she really thinks I'm partly to blame for their shitty marriage. She's also told us all before that if she knew what was going to happen that she never would've married him, never would've had kids, told us to not have children, etc.

I'm mostly worried because of how much this may cost and I will probably end up not being able to keep going if I can't afford it even if I need it. I'm also worried because I took advantage of the free student counseling services at my last university and my mom dragged me to the counseling service at my church and both experiences totally turned me off to therapy; I'm trying to go in with an open mind.",mentalhealth,First psychiatrist appointment - not sure what to expect,2019-01-27 17:44:36
413,Jcup-bow,1548570995,1,"So I don’t know if there’s something wrong with me, but I’ve been wondering for awhile, so here we go.
I’ll have moments(sometimes days) where everything will go numb
I don’t know how to describe it, but I’ll try
-I’ll be able to feel things but it doesn’t feel real or it doesn’t feel like I’m feeling it
-I’ll see the world around me but if feels like I’m looking through someone else’s eyes
-I’ll hear people talking but not make the connection that they are
-I’ll be doing something then completely forget everything that was happening
-I’ll be in class and then not be able to remember anything

So basically everything stops feeling real
All senses
I stop feeling a connection to myself
And let’s just say I’m kinda in an abusive relationship with myself, so if I’m home alone and this happens...I get reckless

419,SecondRealitySims,1548567681,1,"I really don’t see the point in posting here anymore. Most of my posts fall into the void. Course, this is the first post on THIS account. I wasn’t banned from the subreddit before. I just decided to make a new account cause I made some mistakes on the other. 

Today: So Today I went to one of those rich people parties. A Muslim family had flew their private jet and rented a local art museum for a wedding celebration. It was like so rich people they even had those little finger food. It was an actual piece of fish with just a herb on it. Anyway, there was this part where a band they’d flew in came. Everyone was dancing and having fun with the music. I just, didn’t. There was just nothing interesting about the music or anything there. It just felt sorta boring, like, well, everything. Even know things aren’t very interesting. It’s all just a consistent state of dullness. I laugh a bit and this and that but I’ve never actually danced or anything. I can even remember when I was younger just wanting to sit out when my family was having fun. And my mom would have to pull me in or something. 

Friends: I don’t actually have any good friends. I moved to a new town and met some guys I sit at lunch with. We laugh a bit but they don’t care that much. It’s like. We have open campus and everyone’s going out the get food and shit. I can’t drive (I’m in high school but SD driving laws are different), and they just leave without me. I’d like to think they simply forgot about me. But they’d seen me, knew where I was, and most certainly knew I carry around cash. So I don’t think that’s the case. I barley even know anything about them except their names. One girl went on a little speech about her life issues and shit but that’s bout it. I just can’t really talk to people that much anymore. I know what I want to say, I just can’t or it always comes out the wrong way. I always pronounce it wrong or something and sorta justs wants to make me stay silent. I even just don’t care when people gets hurt sometimes. My brother had thought I’d stolen his Playstation controller and attacked me. I hit him in the throat, and he couldn’t go to school cause of the swelling. I knew I should have felt bad. But I just didn’t. 

Anger Issues?: I sometimes get mad at things that other people find weird. My best example was when before I moved and was with one of my school friends, Tyler. I was reading this book I’d just got and he messed up the front cover. One of those annoying bends that you can’t get out. I’d got mad and started yelling for my mom to drop him back at home. It was a small thing, but I’d gotten really mad over it. I finished organizing my room once. Which was new since a lot of people call me unorganized (I don’t agree). But, then my dad came in to clean and put things out of place. I got extremely mad and said he might as well keep the room if he was going to mess things up (he just moved stuff around). I can understand it was ridiculous looking back (that’s the beauty of retrospect). But it seemed completely reasonable at the time. 

Weird thoughts: Sometimes, when something is going on, I just think about what thing I could do that person. Like a kid was playing with a big pack of water bottles out in the snow. And I kept thinking about grabbing one and pouring one on him or throwing it at him or something. I remember a while ago when a girl was being annoying. And I just pulled a pin out a poster on the wall thinking about what I could. I stopped and put it back and didn’t do anything. But, it’s just weird thinking about it now. 

Situation: I live up in the Mountains in South Dakota. Since my mom had to move for her new job. It’s good. She’s got a lot of stock in a company that could blow up. But definitely not right now. We’re living out an apartment on lease for a year. She claims we’ll go back home after the lease is up. But I don’t think we’re going to. I don’t have much freedom. I’m just at home, school, fencing, or some store. I can’t just ask to go outside. Not only because they won’t let me but also because of the perpetual hell-like amount of snow and cold wind. I could get my drivers license. But any spots aren’t open till the summer. So, If I needed help or anything I’d have to go to them. 

Help?: People have recommended that I see a professional or something. But, I don’t know if I really need to. Even if I do, I just don’t know how. I’ve wanted to tell them. But there’s nothing worth they suspecting I need serious help. And if my mom thinks I’m hiding something from her and don’t trust her to talk to her about it. It may just really hurt her feelings. I just want to know if there are other options or how to tell them. ",mentalhealth,"Is there anything wrong? Do I need help, and how?",2019-01-27 16:41:21

Ever since I’ve became pregnant, I’ve been plagued by moments of PTSD from my childhood it seems. Remembering things that I didn’t want too, fearing that I’ll end up like my abusive, unstable, alcoholic and drug using mother (even though I know I won’t)and constantly trying to avoid my father who I never had a problem with until I got pregnant because of all that shit that came up.

I suffered with depression in high school and then went through a bad bout of it again before I got pregnant with my daughter. I’ve always had high-functioning depression but lately I’ve just been so tired of everything. Like I’m constantly tired but sometimes I feel happy, others I’m just wanting to lie in bed and eat like shit or workout super hard just to forget.
I’ve talked to a counselled and it works but he said that my attitude was generally positive and I seemed happy when I came in so I wasn’t considered “high-need”.

426,baskeyt,1548560563,1,"I will try to provide context in what follows. Our father was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was in his mid 20's. He was also an alcoholic, and I've garnered that this was co-morbid with his diagnosis. Our mother reflects on the negative symptoms the most, such as his inability to do his share of raising my brother and I. He left when I was a baby, my brother was around 5. I believe this had a profound impact on him.

Our relationship was fairly good early on, but as he grew up he became very hostile to me and exhibited classic anti-social behavior: deception, lying, inability to make friends outside of the 'bad clique', early drug and alcohol use... He also very early on manifested 'schizo-adjacent' traits: grandiose thinking, paranoia, propensity towards conspiracy-thinking. He often spoke in a glib and ambiguous way, like he was foiling your attempts to understand him while still trying to impress a sense of insight or savvy. Aside from his anger and hostility, which I think stemmed from his abandonment and fatherless upbringing, he always seemed to genuinely believe that he was exceptional, that he was profoundly smart and occupied a central place in the world, that it's shadowy forces and schemes revolved around him.

In his early twenties he started using meth, and this is when his grasp of reality really started to deteriorate. He'd report full-blown hallucinations, shadow people mostly. He claimed that contrails were dispersing agents that made fibers grow out of his skin, which only he possessed the ability to see. Around this time he had his first kid with his wife. They are still together, and they have a few more. She has told us that his usage is sparingly intermittent, and she is confident that she knows exactly when he is using, which I believe. Aside from this, he mostly seemed to have shaped up. He wasn't in jail, and he was holding a steady job and making quite good money doing so. He was involved in raising his children. I had my suspicions that he had schizophrenia, but I never was confident because the positive symptoms may also have resulted from meth. Cut to the past several months.

He has quit his job, he told me with nonchalance. He explained that he felt he was being pushed out and didn't want to give them the satisfaction of firing him. He has savings, and a 401k. He was going to get a job shortly, but for now he was enjoying his time at home with the kids. Okay. Around this time he confided in me that he sees 'invisible aliens made of gamma radiation' at night when he closes his eyes, and they are stabbing him, futilely.

A few months pass and I am told that he has started using again. I go to his home and his demeanor is detached, flat. He spends a lot of time in the garage, in the dark, thinking. No reports of meth-type-psychosis this time but he now no longer plans to return to his field. The wife has picked up a full time job but it is nowhere near enough to keep them afloat. She is due for a baby in a couple weeks. He says he wants to get on disability for 'sensitivity to electromagnetism', which takes a year and plenty of documentation, by the way. 

Just yesterday I visited them. She just recently had the baby. and she's returned to work. He seems to be present enough to watch the kids and the newborn, for now. I don't believe he is currently a danger to them, through negligence or worse. Still he's in the deepend. He keeps with him a backpack filed with his essential documents and, sensing some sort of imminent intervention, he claims hes got enough in it to send everyone to jail. He unplugged the router, it's been tampered with, apparently. I went there to tell him finally that I think he is schizophrenic. I said that I've suspected this since I was a teen. I implored him to go to the hospital and get help, but he immediately retorted that he doesn't need help, and he doesn't have schizophrenia. I told him his family is going to get evicted and he said matter-of-factly, 'I haven't gotten a notice'.  I told him that his wife income is simply not enough, and that the only way to avoid destitution is for him to return to work, and for that he needs to get help for his thinking. In the few times that he revealed some delusion or something, instead of humoring it or letting pass as I always have, I said, 'this is what I'm talking about'. After his simple denial I didn't push the issue. It seemed counter-productive, and so I just enjoyed time with his kids. He's a grown man, and an obstinate one at that. I can't force him to go get help. I don't know what to do. The wife is in her own state of denial too.

If I can honestly speculate, I think they are just going to move in with her parents. Those people are clueless, and do anything to avoid confronting him or involving themselves outside of genteel grandparenting.

It's so self-referential sometimes it's slightly ""weird"" while still being a jab. Sometimes I'll have a two-parter where the first part slips out, I catch myself, and don't finish the thought which leaving it unexplained is also weird.

I can't engage in normal banter. I've been trying for years. My mind is empty. Sometimes I think of something, then it's gone, but usually someone else is faster and goes right over me. Then there's the periods where my mind is a storm of negativity, insults, self-hatred, victimization, I can't seem to wrangle. It's weird. I'll have swings between irritability and empathy within an afternoon of being around coworkers, maybe 1/3 of the time it's actually neutral. I'm stable and content when I'm not trying to keep up with the constant socialization, it's draining and distracting. My poor memory and space-case nature is the butt of jokes at work.

I physically can't keep up with my coworkers.

I'm 20 years old and for the last year I have been running with my mom with a trainer, this trainer has multiple students and helps all of us at the same time. Over time I met most of the people he helps, I thought everybody was really nice.

Over time we started talking to a guy (around 40 years old) who never stops talking, I never thought anything about him but he was always in some sort of drama with other woman in the group of runners.

My mom always talked to him and after some time he invited us and paid us different careers (he didn't do this only with my mom and I, he usually invited around 20 other people per career). As time passed my mom has stopped running meanwhile I still run in this place, since my mom was gone he started talking to me instead (again, this dude doesn't shut up).

He would tell me tips on how to run and things like that. Usually this annoyed me cause I didn't like to hear him talk and talk but I tried to be nice and listen to him and nod my head even though i wasn't really listening.

I feel he feels as if I need his tips and that I like him talking with me (maybe because i just stay silent and nod every time he talks?), the thing is that today my mom and I decided to go on a run and he was warming up where we all usually warm up. As usual he would not stay quite about his tips and out of nowhere he says: ""Also I was talking to one of the girls and we thing you should change your bra since your chest jiggles a lot, you could get hurt"". I felt so uncomfortable since there where a couple of people around, I don't know if they heard but still.

I know the bra I use its okay since I don't hurt myself while running and my boobs don't jiggle much, they jiggle a little but not to the point to it being something to worry about. Also, if it this was the case I would feel one of the girl would tell me this, right?. After this I have felt super bad and actually got depressed.

I have a history of body dysmorphia and anxiety and this made my brain panic. I'm so sad cause my mental health (regards my body) had improved a ton this last couple of months.

It affected me horribly to the point that I was crying 24/7, couldn’t get out of bed or eat. Right now we’re talking but unsure of what’s going on. 

During that rough time I had no willpower to do anything for myself. I was experiencing horrible anxiety and I had no friends and have never felt lonelier. Now as I am easing back into eating and no longer crying in my bed but I also seem to have a guilty conscious or one that prevents me from being happy. There’s something in my mind that will randomly take away my strength. 

Imagine when you are super excited to do something such as go to a a hyped up restaurant and someone says like wow that sounds dumb and your excitement leaves and you no longer are interested in going. That’s how I feel about random things such as telling a friend a story, making myself food, or going to the stores. I will plan to do something but then I get this sudden feeling over me and I no longer can do it, I’m not sure what’s wrong. ",mentalhealth,Not allowing myself to be happy,2019-01-27 13:43:19

I feel like I need to tell someone the truth and I don’t know where to go so I thought I’d come here, I’m sorry if anyone gets upset by this and I hope they know that’s not my intention.

I’m 20 years old, living in London, and suffer from a depressive strand of bpd. Or at least, I think. I’ve had doctors tell me that there’s a very high chance I have bpd but it can’t be diagnosed whilst the waiting list for psychiatric assessment is closed, at least that’s what it was when I last checked. 
I don’t get too angry but when it’s bad I am very self destructive and have depressive mood swings where I don’t leave the house for the space of a week or two at a time. My job as a temp in hospitality has shifts but they’re hard to come by now that Christmas is over.
I’m chronically depressed all the time and unbearably bored and lonely. I try my hardest to make music and art but I’m so lonely and it doesn’t feel like it’s filling the void, it just feels like a distraction. As much as I love my music and the people who support me I’m still so sad and I feel so ungrateful because even though I’ve been given this gift I still feel sorry for myself.
I got addicted to Xanax after getting out of an abusive relationship and had to get myself out of it late last year and lost my best friend in the process. She won’t talk to me over a small bit of drama that happened before I went off the grid for a month. She says unless I can promise her I “won’t fuck her over again” she has no interest in speaking to me but it was so much more than me going out of my way to fuck her over or anything. I was really really sick. I was so depressed and beyond dissociative. I could barely give anyone around me compassion, even myself. 
She refuses to even have a conversation with me until I say “I’ll never fuck her over again” and maybe I’m too proud to say it but if that counts as fucking her over then I can’t make any promises. I could get addicted again, I’m very likely going to go off the grid again, and tbh it feels like if that’s how she reacts when something goes wrong with our friendship how is she going to react when things get worse. I don’t trust her to cope well, fuck knows I’m not coping well. 
I don’t think I can deal with another kind of drama right now. I’ve been through so much stuff that feels fucking impossible this year. I’m so, so tired.
So now I have no best friend, only friends who I don’t feel comfortable talking from the heart to, all I can think about is xanax, I still haven’t got any mental help after the abuse because they also have a closed waiting list for that. I’m so tired of sitting in my house with my family who all have their own mental issues and all seem to be beyond depressed too. All the people I’ve told I love you to won’t talk to me, after my recent breakup I feel lonelier than ever. 
I guess the worst part is that I feel so lonely, but the only reason I have in my mind not to kill myself is not to upset other people. I wanna be alive for myself. I wanna happy to be alive, and I don’t think I ever will be.
I’m sorry for ranting but I’m so unhappy. I don’t really expect anyone to respond or anything but I really don’t know where to go or what to do.

445,Thund77,1548550214,1,"
So ok, I am living in this new world view where people tell me, youre lucky, PTSD and be completely cured. Borderline can be completely cured, as both are mostly from some root of the childhood abuse.

Let me share some context here.
We all live in different countries around the world. And I think that USA is the country where people going to therapeutists have at least stigma. This is me judging from media, tv and stuff. I feel like stigma in USA is maybe finally less and less.

I am thinking about going to psychotherapy. This will not be good psychotherapy, in my country it is paid by the state, but lists are long, and quality is very, very poor. The waiting rooms are too crowded, and sometimes you wait for appointments for months. I am from Croatia btw. But first, let me ask you some questions for those who went to the psychotherapeutist:


1.*  How much did it help you, and did the therapist came to the root of this diagnosis of PTSD?
I will not talk about my diagnosis and I hope so niether you, because just by talking about it it gives me so much pain. I think writing this right now is a bit easy for me, because I am using some really usefull medications.
Two things about my causes: it happened what it happened. I feel shame and guilt. So, people tell me it is not my fault. It is not so easy to accept that as a fact. My abuse lasted for more than a decade. When someone say to me ""It is not your fault"", I dont believe that person. I feel like the person really must know me, really really know me for 20 years before I opened myself and when he say that, there is possibility I could believe him or her. But therapeutists will make you feel good because of money, or it is their job. What could they do to disarm this thought?


2.*   My primary thought about feeling really healed, is looking back at my past without any ounce of pain. With completely guiltless, free heart and soul I can talk about it as I talk about it what is my favorite football game or something like that. But how can you talk about it? For some time I went to Jung psychotherapeutist, realy nice guy, at the moment I mentioned the trauma, 10 years of trauma to be exact, and thinking about it makes me feel so much pain. Remembering places makes me feel pain, even tv shows and movies and commercials from that period of time makes my heart really like under the press holder or how do you call it. Every time I went from my psychotherapeutist, it made me feel pain.
Question here is how do you talk about it without feeling pain?


3.*  What schools of psychotherapy do you use? I heard cognitive behavioral therapy is the best for PTSD. But it is really the most expensive. I cannot really afford it. Therapeutists I will go to soon will be old school freudian types. But anyhow I want to hear your comments on therapeutist schools, gestalt for example or any other, and how much it helped you.


4.*  How long do you go? Months, years, decades? And how many therapists did you changed and why?


5.*  And finally. progress. Can you tell me a progress from 1 to 10 how was on beginning, and the same 1 to 10 how is it now?

&gt;I hope this post will help others too, not only me. I feel like Im going to this subreddit only when I feel pain, and I want to see and hear progress. They say it is curable, so let them make some examples. Or some of your success stories, that would be great. I am also sorry if some simmilar post has already been, and please link me to it

I wish you a road to fast recovering,
fellow sufferer.

455,Oreogrl054,1548542876,1,"I have an exceptional amount of stress in my life. It is hard to put to words what it is doing to me Mentally, emotionally and physically. 
I have an ongoing nasty custody battle, I have financial stress due to this and in general, I have stress within my current relationship. I have recently had to take my sister, brother in law and their child into my house and they have not been helping as agreed on bills, they aren't providing their basic necessities and using mine, they do not have the money to provide themselves with food etc... They are both now working but all of this has fallen on my shoulders. 

I have stress associated with keeping my house clean, doing all I should as a parent while dealing with my daughter's father and him constantly making me feel like less of a person. I continually hold myself to high standards and try not to put our daughter in the middle but they do constantly. 
He has told her on video chats ""I'm sorry you have to deal with your horrible mother"" etc.. yet she lives her dad and has issues with the court ordered time because it is not enough for her so I give a few days a month while knowing he is writing it down and going to use it against me. This is all very stressful. 

I have stress in almost every area of my life. I feel sick, I am unable to get proper sleep most nights and I feel like I am in a constant fog and not able to function most days. 

I have dental issues that I have not been able to take care of that cause me pain because I am giving all of my extra money up to take care of my attorney. Which I have already paid 18k to. I make sure my daughter has all she needs but I literally have a chipped front tooth that has a huge cavity now and other major dental issues that I can't take care of. This has also caused drug accusations by my daughters father. 

I cannot enjoy anything, and even the smallest of tasks seem like a mountain. I can hardly function. I have not even been able to properly prepare my case and get documents to my attorney because I am so stuck. 

I am in a constant state of stress and I do not know how to handle and push through all of this. 

Now on to my meds: 
I have lorazepam, .05mg
Ut really does not help because all of this stress is still there and it doesn't take it away. So mainly I will only take it when something over the top happens, IE drop off and pickups with my daughter that are bad. She screams and kicks when she comes back to me and doesn't want me. 

Methylphenidate 60mg/day in three doses. 
I don't know if this is helping or hurting because I have only been on it for a month and so far it hasn't been life saving. 

Flexeril 5-10mg at night
I am in almost constant pain, and I take this to help relax my muscles that are so tense and the cause of the pain. I never experienced this until I had this huge amount of stress. 

Sleeping habits:
My mind constantly runs at night at what all I have to do and most nights I only get about 5-6 hours and I am unable to nap or fall asleep sooner. Sleeping pills do not work well for me. 

When I wake in the morning I instantly feel the stress of just running my tongue on my teeth. I then feel all that I have to do for the day and feel the stress. I instantly think about how I can handle my daily tasks and still be present with my daughter. 
I clean every day and it takes me a lot of time and then usually am unable to do more after cleaning, such as preparing my court case, making phone calls, etc... 

I work when my daughter is at her father's house, so there isn't much of a break there and I travel for work. I usually sometimes since having to cover my attorney travel with her as well, most often I travel to my boyfriends house which is 2 hours away from me and he helps me with her but more seems to pile up at my house of things undone. 
I make it a point to spend time with my daughter doing activities like going to a trampoline park, or the movies, museums usually at least once a week. (Not good options where I live so I have to travel at least an hour for these activities). She is in dance and goes every Tuesday night. 

Unfortunately I do not spend as much time playing with her when we are home. I cook three meals a day, and clean etc.. but I don't take a lot of time to do arts and crafts etc... and this is a huge stressor to me that I am not doing enough for her. She is three. 
I can literally sometimes see my failings, but I am in such a fog and unable to function/push forward that it stresses me. 

Then there's the things that are happening one after another. Like the last three times she has come home from her dad's and has been seriously ill either that night or a day or two later. This last week she has a stomach flu that lasted 6 days of puking and diarrhea. Me being up all hours of the night with her and all hours of the day. Doctor trips, trip to the ER etc.. that literally kills what little energy I had and makes it to where I can only focus on taking care of her and not do anything that I need like the paper work for my attorney, making calls, doing some work from home... 

This is not the whole picture, as it is really hard to put to words but I just do not know what to do anymore. It's not something I can just ""get over"" or even tell myself to do better the next day. I am literally expending all of my energy that I could possibly have during the day. 

Antidepressants did nothing for me and generally scheduled anxiety medication does not help me because I have such a huge issue with energy that anything that makes me tired is too miserable because I am not able to push through the tired feeling. 

The methylphenidate actually does not give me energy it calms me down and does help me focus, but it's like everything going on with me is not going to go away and a pill can't take it away so the benefits are very limited to helping me daily. 

Please help. I feel like I am drowning, like I am having a very slow motion mental breakdown and watching myself crash before my eyes. 

I do not have depression, but all of this stress makes me have some symptoms but I have not struggled with it before. Also, I did not ever have anxiety either. This is the hardest time I have ever been through in my life and the stress on my shoulders is not something I can change. This is all rooted in the stress that I am facing. 

I have tried all the generic coping mechanisms, breathing, meditation, self care etc... I need some solid advise from people who have been through a similar time in their life. I need to know how to function. I am at a point where I cannot cope and I cannot change it and it is literally making me very sick. 

I cannot stomach food most of the time, I can't sleep and I can't ignore the stress to be able to not fixate on it/think about it all the time, every day, night. I even have nightmares about certain things like the custody battle next month, or not being able to have enough food to feed my daughter and just horrible scenarios. 

Please help. Thank you so much

458,honestlynott,1548540684,1,"For the past year, I have been experiencing some weird feelings that have led me to believe I could be showing signs of schizophrenia. I'm worried to go to a therapist and discuss it since I don't know if it will affect me in the future when I'm looking for work.

The symptoms are not life-threatening and I'm passing by. It's mostly delusions and occasional hallucinations but I might be imagining those myself. It only became a concern when I started discussing my ideas to my friends and they would mention at how strange it was, or that they were worried about me, or straight out saying ""It almost sounds schizophrenic."" 

My delusions themselves vary time to time. The amount I believe in them also vary time to time and I honestly wouldn't call them delusions myself but rather hypothesis that I follow by deep down...

This includes ""one in all and all in one"" or the diagram I have been drawing up for something called MDS (Mind Body Soul) where I express my ideas to my feelings of detachment though that might just be my depersonalization (not diagnosed). It often comes to the fact that nothing is real other than myself and some higher being since our senses cannot be trusted but I'm not here to ramble about that. Another thing is that I have huge memory gaps and often find myself unable to understand the timeline of the past year or unsure if things really happened at all.

Please slow down. Especially when you are manic. Call/talk to someone close or a counselor. You will begin to feel again. Trust me. Have patient with yourself.

We feel too much. We have a “super power”. We can tell what other people are feeling and we feel it too much.

463,jordannelliott6,1548538380,1,"Hi everyone. I’m [] a first year college student who just recently started her second semester after a month long winter break. I had no problems adjusting to college first semester and didn’t experience any significant homesickness, besides the occasional missing my parents and my boyfriend (a year younger than me, still goes to high school in my hometown). My life in college is significantly better than my life was in high school, I have more friends than I’ve ever had before and I’ve been more social and outgoing than ever before, and overall I feel better. I’ve gotten a better hold on my anxiety and depression with the help of medication and an established routine for my day, and I feel that I’ve come a long way. 

Ever since I’ve come back, however, I’ve been extremely homesick for my family, my home, and my boyfriend. I’ve found that I become severely depressed on the weekends, usually starting Friday night, and I isolate myself from my friends and do not leave my room. I’m very focused academically so I spend this time usually working on homework or studying, but I often can’t find the motivation to do that either. I make up excuses to not go out (it’s cold, I don’t drink, I can’t drink with my medication, I’m tired, etc.), and then I spend time alone in my room. My roommate and I live very different lifestyles so we are not close, but we live well together, and my friends all live in other dorms, so they’re not as easily accessible. I really don’t understand why it seems to hit me so hard on the weekends, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

466,chocolateandjam,1548536587,1,"I suffer from anxiety and depression. I'm actually a pretty happy and positive person, I'm just not very happy with my life.

I hope this doesn't offend anyone, but I think that a lot of people who suffer from depression (and maybe anxiety) don't have an external reason for it. It's simply a chemical thing inside them that makes them interpret and think about things in a very negative light. As a result, taking drugs to counter this chemical imbalance would help.

I feel like in my situation, there are a lot of very solid, real world, reasons that I have anxiety and depression. No matter what happens to my brain chemistry, those things will still exist to bring me down. I don't feel like antidepressants will have any benefit to me.

I have gender dysphoria which effects me on a daily basis - it has caused a lot of social isolation, lack of motivation (why bother doing anything, it will never get met any closer to the person I want to be), etc. 

My childhood was very bad in a neglect sense - I didn't talk to anyone or get any attention from my parents for most of my life. I think I've probably spoken less words in my entire life than most adults would speak in 6 months. As a result, I think I lack a lot of social skills. I find it very difficult to make conversation, and don't really like how my voice sounds.

I now 30 and no longer have any friends, and am not close to my family at all. My anxiety/depression, lack of social skills, and gender dysphoria, make it nigh impossible to meet new people. Even when I try my hardest and do make a new friend, it's just a 1on1 thing, which tends to fizzle.

I'm also retired, and pretty much stay at home all day. I don't interact with anyone. Obviously this worsens my anxiety/etc. I'm working on it. Trying to get a job, getting out more, joining a social sport group, etc. It's a long hard road, but I'm working on it.

So yeah, my anxiety and depression stem from these things. I have pretty extreme social anxiety because of the way I talk (which I get negative reactions from people about), because I can't keep a conversation going, because I don't have anything interesting to talk about, because I know I'm socially inept compared to others. I feel like my entire life is one of those nightmares where you're in an important school exam and you haven't studied or anything. My therapist keeps coming back to negative bias, and thinks it's all in my head - but it's not. I just feel very comfortable with her and she doesn't really see it.

She really wants me to try anti-depressants. I don't think they'll work. I told her I'd try LSD micro dosing first, which I'm doing at the moment. It's not really having any effect on me.

474,ClearBlue_Grace,1548525748,1,"I’m so so sorry if this isn’t okay to post here. I know it’s long as hell but I just need someone to hear me. 

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always had really bad assholish tendencies. I don’t know how to improve myself. I’m such a bitter person at times. I get irrationally upset over small things, and my mood can go from feeling super happy and energetic to crying in the shower and just canceling my plans for the day. 

Whenever I feel this ugly mood starting to creep its way in, I can usually catch it before it really seeps in. I try really hard to just take deep breaths and relax. I tell myself what I’m feeling/thinking is irrational and I *know* that it is, but I just can’t seem to shake it. My only way of dealing with it when it happens is isolating myself. I don’t want to lash out at other people (I rarely ever do, but I know my ugly mood definitely shows and I don’t want it to affect other people). I don’t want to be an unwanted negative presence in the room. I don’t want to be that person. 

I wish I could be optimistic and kindhearted. Instead I get ridiculously upset over things other people seem to just shake off and move on from. Some days I’m perfectly fine and I’m in a bright and happy mood, and though literally nothing bad happens, I just suddenly find myself in this ugly fog. And it’s like things that I normally think when I’m happy just don’t seem to click when I’m in this mood. All the positivity that I genuinely believe in, and all the things I love and cherish just don’t seem to fucking matter at all. I just don’t understand it. 

I’ve already tried therapy for years to improve myself in other personal ways. I found it very unhelpful and honestly kind of a waste of time. I’ve had four therapists, and none of them really did anything. I don’t understand what therapy is supposed to even feel like. Am I supposed to leave my sessions feeling like crap every time? I gave a lot of effort and I feel like I just sat in a room with strangers for hours on end. I did the breathing exercises, I did the things they recommended and I felt nothing. I can hardly remember anything any of my therapists even said; therapy was that unhelpful and unmemorable to me. 

If therapy can’t help me, can anything? I try so fucking hard to just stop moping and to stop being so negative but I just can’t seem to keep my mood and my line of thinking consistent. Going back and forth between optimism and being so bitter about everything is honesty exhausting. It’s like there’s another person living in my head and I just can’t seem to make them stop thinking for me at times. 

Some days I feel great. I feel good about myself and I’m productive and I enjoy talking to people. Other days it’s like I’m suddenly a different person. The worst is when I start off feeling great and then suddenly I can’t even look at myself in the mirror, I get sad and then the sadness turns into irritation. It’s like my brain just wants to find reasons to be irrationally upset. I also cry so easily. Even when I’m feeling good, I cry all the time. Sometimes happy things make me cry. I get very sentimental about things that are probably stupid idk. 

I know the answer to all of this is probably “Get off the internet, no one can solve your problems for you. Realize how you’re feeling and stop feeling that way”, but that’s obviously not working and I have no idea where to go from here. I’m just tired of this back and forth. I don’t want to be that person people are uncomfortable around. I don’t want to be unstable and unreliable. I don’t want to wake up wondering who I’m going to be today. It’s like I have no sense of self. I don’t even who who I am when this ugly haze comes over me. My thoughts can be so conflicting at times and I’m just so tired of it. I’m tired of making plans for my future one day, and then planning my death the next. Though I live a relatively calm life, my thoughts make everything feel so chaotic and overwhelming. 

I’ve wanted to post about this for a while, but I’m worried I’m just going to get a bunch of people telling me I’m crazy or to “just get off the internet”. I don’t need someone to sit down and tell me this isn’t okay, because I’m completely aware that I can’t keep going like this. I keep hoping that maybe if I just confront it, as if I’m confronting another person, that it might help me gain some control. Or that maybe writing about it and trying to talk myself though it will just make it stop. I don’t understand how anyone is mentally stable. I don’t know what it’s like to not get pissed off over stupid stuff and regret it and hate myself later. The more I try to write this all down and really evaluate it, the more I think I really need serious help but I don’t know where to even begin. The thought of sitting in therapy again, talking about nothing to someone who’d probably rather not be there, is highly upsetting. The thought of beginning a laundry list of medication doesn’t sound so great either but maybe it’s what I need because obviously my brain is broken and somethings not quite right.

477,Ammarnaqvi,1548522524,1,"A number of studies carried out by neuroscientists and they confirmed that there is a connection between meditation practice and improving your memory.

&amp;#x200B;

A study conducted by the researcher in Boston found that frequently meditation bolsters the cerebral cortex of brains. The function of the cerebral cortex is to deal with mental functions such as concentration, learning, memory and providing ability to make decisions.

In a study at Boston found that regular meditating increase blood flows to the brain, which results in a stronger network of blood vessels in the cerebral cortex and reinforces memory capacity.

## 2nd Study on meditation tells: Meditation improves Memory and Attention

Another study which was conducted at University of California at Santa Barbara, which had 48 undergraduate students were asked to take either mindfulness class or nutrition class.

Both Classes met for 50 minutes four times a week for two weeks. Students were taught by “professionals with extensive teaching experience in their fields”.

The student of mindfulness “emphasized the mental strategies and physical posture to focused-attention on meditation.” They describe the class of mindfulness in more detail and another group of students was given good nutrition in a diet.

 Participants required to integrate mindfulness into their daily activities and to complete 10 minutes of daily meditation outside of class and another session conducted during class, participants sat on cushions in a circle. Each class included 10 to 20 minutes of mindfulness exercises requiring focused attention to some aspect of sensory experience (e.g., sensations of breathing, tastes of a piece of fruit, or sounds of audio recording students focused on):

* Sitting with a straight back, legs crossed and gaze lowered, Focusing to decide between elaborated thinking and naturally arising thoughts.
* Decreasing the distracting quality of past and future concerns by reframing them as mental projections occurring in the present
* Taking help of breathing as an anchor for attention during meditation.
* Repeatedly counting up to consecutive exhalation
* Allowing the mind to rest naturally rather than trying to forcing down the thoughts occurring in mind.

The students of both classes took the GRE (Graduate Record Examination; the tests which considered for grad school application) before and after the classes of two-weeks and also including the tests of distractibility and memory, where they counted their “task-unrelated thoughts coming in mind” while doing this they needed a proper concentration.

Hi. I would like to stay anonimous, you can call me May. I am a guy, 25 yo. Live in Russia, incredibly sorry for any mistakes you find in this ""letter"". 

I hope this is the right place to write this. I will post it to some other subreddits too, just in case. 

I am thinking about ending my life. I am seriously considering doing this. I see no future for myself, no solution for all my problems. Right now I have 10 problems happening at the same time: 

1) Gastritus and 3 other stomach ilnneses  	

2) Conjunctivitis of unknown reason. I can be allergic to something, I am not sure. One year ago it was so bad there was a pus inside my eyes, I was scared as hell. It somehow connected to junk food I eat. I've tried to find a reason but couldn't. My eyesight is bad from birth and now gone from -5 to -7. There was a risk of retinal detachment but it's ok now. 

3) My grandmother is going crazy. I am not sure what exactly is it, it can be marasmus or dementia. I live with her and my mom and grandma screams a lot, makes fights, 	says we want her to die and steal her stuff 

4) I have no friends. All my efforts to find some friends with similar hobbies were in vain. My gf works all the time and she has mental problems too. She cries a lot, she harmed herself with pills and energetic drinks 

5) I stopped to enjoy all of my hobbies. I loved to read comics and books, playing games, all that stuff. Well 	now due to my eyes problems and other problems I can't do it anymore. I don't want to spoil good movie for myself, because I'm 	feeling myself like trash, want to sleep or my eyes are burning like hell 

6) I don't have energy. At all. I want to sleep always all the time, it's hard for me to do stuff. It really just hard to do ususal work. I have this strange feeling of 	euphoria only a bad one, when your brain works pretty slow and sometimes you forget things and don't understand things. It can be chronic fatigue. Plus depression and neurasthenia. 

7) I can't stand the noise from my neighbors. I just freaking hate them. From one side there is drunk people who fight a lot. It was a year long, I tried to fight them and it took almost all my energy I've had. Sound insulation had no effect. Now it stopped, one of them stopped drinking I think. Then there was a TV above me which screamed at 5 am every morning for half a year. It took me a lot to find out who did it. Now it's 	repairs for 2 years. I am not sure who exactly it is but I am so sick of that. I just can't stand that noise anymore. I feel uncomfortable, uneasy, scared all the time. It just doesn't end. 	It's so loud. I am turning into a different person, I scream, I am mad at everything and everyone, I don't control myself. 

8) I am having sleeping problems. I sleep from 6 am to 15, it's unhealthy as hell. Only at night I can relax and draw. 

9) I wanted to become an artist. I have 0 talent but I really love it and wanted it to be my career. 	From the very childhood I've drawn and drawn. But a lot of stuff happened. 

10) Prostatitis or smth like that. I can be stucked in toilet for 3 hours sometime.    
    
 What happened:  

All the problems from above 

My first gf played with me. She breakes up with me, she lies to me, then she returns to me. I was like a little puppy who's chasing a car, car stops and then drives even faster. I loved her like a crazy, but she cheated on me and, well, she tortured me mentally

My 2nd gf  broke up with me and found another guy in a month. Maybe she was dating him 	secretely, I dunno. It was right before our wedding. 

My father has anger issues, my mom too, she s also very paranoid. I have it all. 

My cat died and I blame myself. He was ill for a very long time and I was too dumb to find the right hospital for him and too tired to do a little extra effort. That's when I started to truly hate myself. Oh and also I have tanathophobia and just very afraid to die.  

  
 Don't get me wrong, I don't want to die. I want this suffering to end. I just can't live like this anymore.

 Yes I've been at doctors. So many doctors I don't remember them all. I spent all my money- and I still have all these illnesses. I don't know what to do. I tried all kinds of pills for everything and I still feel like shit. Spent hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars.   

Yes I've tried to live somewhere else. I feel very uncomfortable at other places and last time owner just chained locks without a notification. 

I lived in a hotel when I had money to feel better. Now parents pay for me and I am like a leech for them. I have money for food and sometimes for things like pills, clothes, maybe few comics or . Nothing fancy. Yes I fell bad for being shut-in. Please don't blame me. 

I want to talk to somebody. Doesn't matter. Someone who's going through a lot too. Or maybe someone has inspirational articles for me, like ""comic artists who has mental illneses"" or ""writers who's gone through a lot""? Love this stuff, I am lying to myself there's some kind of hope for me. I feel like I can break any day now. 

Sorry. 

You know what's worst? I wanted to draw so bad, and I draw so bad. And I have 0 energy or sanity to do so. It will take me years to learn anatomy and I already have so many ideas for comics, ideas I love and wanna draw for my entire life. I wanted to become the best, maybe move to USA or Japan sometime in a future. Now I just...trying to not kill myself. I just don't see a solution. 

  
 TL;DR I am suffering from depression and neurasthenia I guess. I have a lot of problems, all in the same time, and I don't know how to solve it. The most troublesome is my neighbors.

483,lustforwine,1548509765,1,"Hi everyone! I just wanted some advice. I haven't spoken to my friend in a few years and I do feel bad for not replying to her anymore. We went to the same school and she used to have no friends, so I asked her to hang out with me and my friends. It's not until I started talking to her that she want from happy, nice and cheery to grumpy and mean. All over high school she would fluctuate between being incredibly kind, nice, in a very happy mood, positive, cheery and a great friend to grumpy and mean with no good reason. When she was in this unhappy phase she would do things like steal my stuff, make up lies about me to my friends, be extremely paranoid and complain I am talking about her behind her back. When we went to the beach on our school trip she was SO NEGATIVe, and this is only 1 example of the negative things she did. She kept telling me in a very mean way ""oh they're looking at you"", ""those girls are laughing at you and talking about you"", ""you're gonna get wet"". She would also keep saying how she's ugly and fat and saying she wants to kill herself and die. She had health problems with her heart and would try to make us feel pity for her for being sick. She told my other friend that she hopes we all die &amp; she would call other people fat.

 So my question is, could this be caused be a mental condition? Or is she just moody because of her health conditions? But the thing is I have coeliac disease and other issues (I'm also going to be checked for ADHD which I'm 99% positive I have) and I don't seek pity from other people and I don't take my anger out on others and be mean to them. I do feel bad for deleting her on Facebook but I can't handle being with someone who changes moods more than the weather, I put up with it for 6 years. I cannot predict what she will do, I feel like she would poison me if I got on her bad side.

484,gone-going-fishing,1548506967,1,"Hi, 16 year old male, I've been having innapropriate thoughts which disgust me and go against my morals, both of sexual and violent nature, whilst also accusing myself of such thoughts from other innocent thoughts, such as an example of a young girl saying ""I love you"" to her mother, me thinking that I wish someone were to say that to me and then after telling myself that that meant I wanted that girl to say it to me, even though that wasn't my original thought. 

Often two subsequent thoughts will merge to form a twisted idea that I wasn't actively thinking about, or random innapropriate associations will occur, and less regularly I get straight up innapropriate imagery or ideas.

Because of this I have repeatedly been calling myself gay*, paedophilic or incestuous, as well as murderous and violent despite me having no desire or intention to carry out such things. It feels as if I have another person in my head forcing these thoughts upon me and I find it very hard to escape them, and I hold myself responsible for them as they linger in my mind.

499,babyfacedOle,1548482660,1,"I'm a young 20s dude working in a very intense field, imagine something along the lines of commercial real estate development. I was a really bright student in a university program in finance. I guess the point I am trying to make is that I'm supposed to be alright. This is always how I've seen myself too, at least alongside my sister who has severe anxiety issues, and will realistically never live a stereotypically normal life. 

The problem is, I actually think I have some problems too. I just don't know the benchmark to compare myself to, nor do I know whether I'm just in a 'funk' or if I have legitimate mental health issues that need assessing and treatment. 

I am often an irritable guy. I get in moods where the smallest things will tick me off. I'm talking stuff like my shirt getting untucked. Sometimes I will feel physically uneasy and want to go live on an island somewhere. 

Also, my attention span has seemingly gotten worse over the past year or two. I will sometimes type something up that just doesn't make sense at all. Like, at work saying ""good morning"" at 3 in the afternoon by reflex. This is perhaps not the best example, but I am constantly in auto-pilot mode.

Finally, some events have made me realize what the every day normal could be. There's times where I'm at my best self, and feel awesome. I don't think excessive drinking is a positive thing, but it's crazy how much better I am at connecting with people. However, followed by this is several days of severe depression and anxiety about overexposing myself, shame, and other invasive thoughts. 

I do think part of this is caused by circumstance. I have had a really tough time dating lately; there was one girl I really liked and it just fell through. This cycle repeated itself a few times actually. It hurts to type out, but I've never even had a serious girlfriend nor sex. I've been capable of attracting the very best women when I'm at my best self, but these times are few and far between. This shame, this lack of experience, is really weighing down my mental health, and it's self-perpetuating.

My job is a really 'good' job, and I am doing way better than many of my fellow graduates who are unemployed or selling insurance to family. But I still know that it's not the job I want permanently, or even long term, and that itself is causing me a bit of an existential crisis.

And finally, I'm still living at home. I have zero debt. In a way it's good to have that support system, but I'm actually wondering if it's bad for my mental health. It's an abstract thing to describe, but I see myself falling into the same behaviour patterns when I'm around them. It's almost like they don't recognize that I've changed. Also, the way we all communicate with each other is, frankly, very toxic. I definitely saw these things more clearly when I spent some time living abroad.

Can some kind soul help guide my sails? I can afford counselling, but I'm not really sure where that will take me. I am preferring not to get on any medications - that's just a personal thing, but perhaps I should open myself to it. 

Thank you so much.

Just recently one of our dogs died. What makes it worse she was still young. Didn't even reach 1 year yet. I don't want to grieve, because that just makes me feel sad and angry which I really hate.

Makes me just want to bash my head on the wall... 

I know. It isn't healthy to keep my feelings all bottled up. We need to grieve properly so we can move on with these feelings. But I'm so used to bottling up these feelings. Like, very used to it. Never once have I had anyone to ever talk about or share my feelings. Only to myself. 

I am taking meds so it's helping a bit with my emotions. But I sometimes find myself still thinking about her, and end up thinking of hurting myself again. But not as intense as I would have when I don't take meds. Just a little popups in my thoughts here and there. Then I force myself to ignore those feelings all together like I always have.

Sigh... I know. This isn't healthy. But this is how I raised myself to think. Bottling up feelings. Even if someone offers, I wouldn't really care or try to talk to anyone since I'm more used to being with myself than with others.

512,napkin21,1548472533,1,"Over three years ago (I wanna say approximately November 2015) I was diagnosed with chronic scoliosis and anaemia. It’s been something I’ve been fighting and struggling to cope with since then. My scoliosis can often almost “flair up”, if you will, leaving me in extreme pain or constantly uncomfortable. My anaemia sometimes will get worse enough that I feel almost cloudy minded. I’ve been receiving treatment for them since diagnosis. 
Close to two years ago (February 2017) I had a mild concussion and the immediate after effects were horrible. I felt like I lost a piece of myself. A month after that my boyfriend at the time was hospitalized for suicidal intentions. I was basically a wreck. I went to school, tried doing work. By the time I got home my head would be pounding and I would be so full of grief that I just went straight to bed. Looking back in my journal for that year I can tell I was depressed. All I wanted to do was die. I used to pray to God that he would end my suffering. I never harmed myself or planned/attempted suicide. I was just constantly exhausted. Motivation was none existent. I cried almost everyday out of pain and grief. 
Fast forward 6ish months, I had finished that semester was almost done summer break and I was starting to feel better again. My boyfriend was dehosiptalized at this point and we had decided to remain friends. I had managed to work through that rough patch on my own. I was too embarrassed to reach out for help because I was known as the positive one by family, friends and teachers. 
Now skip to September 2017 to February 2018, I was under immense amounts of stress. I was working crazy hard to get a scholarship so I could attend  postsecondary school. I tried talking with the school social worker about the intense anxiety I was having; crying during presentations, avoiding social outings, isolating myself in fear that I would lose my scholarship. But it never helped, we never clicked. So I trudged on by myself once again. The fall and winter months were hard and I was always really down but as spring rolled around I got accepted to the school and I earned the scholarship. I was on top of the world. 
Then in April 2018, my best friend’s grandmother died after being in the hospital for 2 weeks. She was like another grandmother to me because she had babysat me when I was in elementary school. She even told me I was another granddaughter to her considering how much my friend and I spent time together with her. I was so so heart broken. 
But things got better. I made a few new friends in the last months of high school that really helped me through the post-grief. These new friends made me realize that if I experience intense emotions I did in the past that it’s totally okay to get help. I promised myself to take better care of me!!
Then in August 2018. My maternal grandmother died. I started university the next month. I was done grieving at this point, in the past I usually bounce back after a few weeks. But also the seasons turned to Fall I was just sad all the time. No real reason. Some days I just lost all my focus and motivation. But then another big hit came. My paternal grandfather died in November... I once again was completely broken like in February 2017. I started counselling/talk-therapy at my university because the services are free to students. Some how I made it through that semester. I almost failed two classes. But managed to get all my credits. Everything sucked. I was in so much mental and physical pain. I still am. 
My new semester started three weeks ago and it’s happening again. I’m falling back into the hole I never quite got out of. I can’t work. I can barely eat. My sleep is often plagued with nightmares but I sleep anyways and for as long as I can to not have to deal with my real life worries. I go to class and will often suddenly feel the urge to burst into tears or throw a fit. I still am trying to see my counsellor every so often but wait lines are long, many students need their services because like them I wouldn’t be able to afford it otherwise. I’m so behind on work that I’m just barely scraping by. Im so so scared to ask for anymore help because I’ve already done it so many times in the past couple months. I’m not used to it. I feel so selfish even though I know it’s not selfish to get help. I don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes I feel I should drop out of school and ruin my dreams of getting a degree. Other times I fall back on those old dark desires that I just wish someone else will murder me because I love my life enough to keep it but am not happy enough to want to live it. I feel so isolated from my friends. Almost half of them have stopped talking to me in the past couple of months for no reason and it hurts me a lot. I know they care about me they just show it differently from my love language and none of them seem to understand that. They don’t seem to understand that then texting me “hello” will make me feel so much better because they attend a different school so sometimes I can’t wait to meet up for them to care for me. 
I miss my grandparents and my friend’s grandmother so much.

Someone posted that they were diagnosed with adult ADHD and had really successful treatment and finally felt normal. That post and others about ADHD sounded like me. I started researching ADHD and everything fit. Mind you, I'm pushing 50!

So, excited about finally having a potential answer, I tried to get an appointment with psychiatry...they said I had to do intake with a psychologist first. OK.  I've done therapy in the past and they sucked...reliving (and therefore reinforcing) the same crappy experiences over and over again...how is that helpful? 

This one was different. And dug deep. And asked so many questions without offering suggestions about how I might be feeling. Just had me tell it. By the end, ADHD, OCD, anxiety and depression. (What comes after trifecta?)

I only went for a referral but she said she really wants to help me. She really believes she can help me deal with past trauma without having to constantly rehash and reinforce it. And she referred me to the psychiatrist for medication. She thinks an anti-depressant would be good, but agreed that it wouldn't hurt to treat the ADHD first and then see if I need the antidepressant. I think I'm just used to having some level of depression...what I don't want is to be numbed. I don't want to lose the range of emotion but man, if I can just FOCUS. If I can feel ORDER in my mind. Stop the racing. Stop forgetting things. Stop feeling inadequate and actually believe people that say I'm awesome at my job. BE NORMAL.

I tried to put the incident behind me, but it effected me to the point where I started feeling anxious and depressed enough to call in sick for mental health reasons.

I took 2 days off, and explained to my boss that I was not in the right state of mind to come into work.

I arrived after 2 days and about 30 minutiee into my shift I had a meeting with my boss.

The fist sentence to me was to ask me if I thought it was appropriate to take 2 days off for mental health reasons. I replied, ""yes"".

He went on to explain the reasons why he felt this was not appropriate:
1. He had a business to run
2. I took 3 total days out of my alloted 6/year and it was only January
3. He needs people in the office

He then went on to ask me if he should have to worry about the next time ""something like this happened""?

I said to him that the real problem was that the act of publicly shaming someone error was permissible and taking mental health days was not.

I ended asking my boss if I would have had the flu would that have been permissible, and he replied, ""well, you didn't have the flu"". I asked him what the difference was if in both situations the person is I'll, and he didn't have a decent reponse to that.

The discussion ended with my boss telling me he now wanted a daily report of what I've done for that day.

I am so aware in situations when I'm supposed to react, like when a girl texted me saying that my (now) ex was dating both of us at the same time, I had no reaction. I didn't freak out, maybe sobbed a little from time to time but nothing dramatic, I just wanted to hear his point of view on why he would do that. I even joked about it to both of them!

&amp;#x200B;

So we spent hours talking, and when he went to sleep I cut myself. But since then I realised that fag burns are much better because they're less messy. I did it literally behind my exes back once, and once when I was extremely sad at the pub. It feels like having a coffee in the morning. All emotions released. I don't know if I'll stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm also drawn to it because the only attention I remember getting from my dad is when I would 'misbehave' and he would hurt me.

538,useridjeff,1548459967,1,"  I wanted to share my thoughts about anti-depressants. I speak on this topic because it is something that I know first-hand; I know what I’m talking about. 

I over-heard someone tell another person leaving the doctors office that “Drugs are a crutch”. Well, maybe that statement is true, maybe not. For me, its’ a part of my day, like taking vitamins in the morning. It’s just another thing I do that’s helps me be a better me.  

Crutch!? If you break your leg, you might need to use crutches, till you are able to recover to the point you don’t need them. If you have high blood pressure, you would take a medication for that. It wouldn’t be the only action that you would take, you would be told to get out and be more active. Also true advice for depression. Anti-depressants is a part of someone’s help with depression. Other actions will help; therapy, physical activity, personal and possibly spiritual growth. What we need is different for everyone, and what might be needed at one point in your life might not be what’s needed at a different time, but these are some of the basics that a lot of people find helpful.  

Personally, I seriously a taking my life for the first time over 40 years ago. I was to young for anti-depressants and options didn’t really exist. I would have been given a drug that kept me from wanting to hurt myself but kept me from being me and living a meaningful life. Today, there is so much more choices and knowledge.  

My advice:

Find a doctor who knows what they are doing, either a psychiatrist or a really well-trained doctor. You want to find the best doctor you can; it’s your mind, after all. After you find someone, take their advice, but keep in mind. The person who knows best about what’s happening is you. If you don’t like the effect it’s having, talk to your doctor. They have many different choices, and sometimes it takes a combination of more than one; It does for me. I think the goal is to help you, not to make you not feel like yourself.

539,Cobra_547,1548459099,1,"Hi. I've been working in a restaurant as a waiter for almost four months now. The job itself is fine, sometimes lots of fun, almost always I get the nicest customers. There is but one problem.

I don't drink alcohol because of things from the past which involved some members of my family and I don't go to bars or other such establishments. The thing is because of this I am frequently looked down upon by my other colleagues who go to pubs to have beer and such things and I always head straight home, because that's what I want. Most of the time it is a real joy to work with them, but after the shift ends, all I really want is to head home. That makes them see me like I'm breaking the group and generally that I do not want them as friends.

So I got to the point where I'm considering to leave.

And also there is this teambuilding in a vineyard in spring and I really don't want to go. Simply because I don't want to be surrounded by alcohol and drunk colleagues and also because I want to spend my time with the person I love.

So for the first time in my life I turn to this page to perhaps give me some advice on what to do next.

I just moved and I'm currently waiting on a job to hear back from. I've had a lot of downtime and I'm finding it harder and harder to deal with myself.

Yesterday I had a date and I brought them to my friends birthday dinner, which I was hosting. I had a list of things to do that I made with my mom over the phone so I wouldnt get over whelmed.

553,Barely_Hanging,1548449087,1,"I'm 23 years old. I'm in a long-term relationship of over 3 years. I've never physically cheated on my girlfriend nor have I ever had a problem being faithful in any of my relationships other than this catfishing behavior. I love my girlfriend and our relationship is great. I do struggle with depression but that's the only diagnosis I have ever received. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I have become infatuated by certain people. Sometimes it's because they're attractive, sometimes it's because they're very nice to me, and sometimes I just can't pinpoint why I feel suddenly infatuated with them. I can have 0 feelings towards someone one day and then a month later be in a mental state where I can't stop thinking about them. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I become infatuated with someone I get their phone number.  I either buy their phone number from spokeo, go through a mutual contact's phone when they're asleep to get it, or look for it on social media. Then I use a texting app to reach out to them. I try to convince them that I'm an old classmate, neighbor, coworker, etc. I tell them how beautiful they are and if they're interested in chatting and meeting up for some drinks. It only lasts for a day or two at the most and then I delete the app and never contact them again because obviously I can't meetup since I'm not the person in the photos. When someone rejects my catfish persona or ignores me I feel really hurt and depressed for a while. I have done this to about 7 people in the last few months. I think it's only a matter of time til either my girlfriend catches me or someone else figures it's me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's wrong of me to do this because I am in a relationship. I have felt guilt but it wasn't until recently I realized how creepy this behavior is.

what I mean is that no matter how much anyone loves me, it's still too little to me. I constantly 'dream' about having an older partner to feel safe and loved by. It's not exactly dreaming, I just feel like I need that to ever be happy in my life. Like it's the ultimate goal of my life. It's the only thing that matters for me.

I'm interested in people around the age 20-30, which isn't too old, but it still seems off since I'm 15. I'm mostly talking about hugs and although I know it sounds weird I am basically addicted to them, being hugged is the only way I can release my stress and everyone who knows me at least little bit knows how much I love them, I could cuddle with people 24/7. But it seems more like an obsession than love. I behave like a dog waiting to get its' treat.

On a few occasions she did physically hurt my sister and I. She has lost all her friendships and hobbies and interests, and is scared of doing anything out of fear that it will all be monitored and used to ruin her. She has stated that she would commit suicide if I weren't her responsibility.

My family has had trouble finding a solution in the past, as she believed her mind to be sound and vastly superior to any other persons, and that any psychologist or professional would only lie to her and attempt to destroy her. It has gotten severe enough where I think it is best if she is institutionalized without her consent, and I move in with nearby family.

a guy who goes to my school is suffering from severe mental health issues. He clearly struggles with it quite badly but takes it out in the wrong way ie he spreads rumours about people, threatens people, does a lot of drugs and drinks alone during school time. a lot of people think it’s for attention which is perfectly valid for someone to want attention tbh. but basically this guy attempted to sexually assault me, beat up my boyfriend while on acid and told everyone at school that it was me who tried to rape him and beat up my own boyfriend. since then he hasn’t apologised but he keeps trying to be my friend, and i’ve been constantly nice and friendly towards him because i have been through severe depression and know how easy it is for something to make it worse and more severe. 

however, a lot of people have started to criticise me for being overly friendly to him even though i don’t like him and think i’m being fake.

571,RektMyAnus,1548430561,1,"My heart palpitations leave me breathless and shocked for a split-second repeatedly. They totally disrupt whatever I'm doing, and it's frustrating me.

Doctors are saying I'm okay, that it's just my mental disorder. They're not saying anything specific or giving me any meds for heart problems. I'm on a couple of mental health meds, though. For depression, schizophrenia, and I guess anxiety.

The problem is that they're very distracting. They start only when I'm focused on a mentally draining or stimulating task, such as thinking or learning something. I'm currently trying to get into game development, and it seems impossible to do due to my heart and the other problems.

My heart palpitations have a concrete beginning. Basically, I was lying in my bed and playing OldSchool RuneScape. Then I got scared due to something. My laptop was on my chest/stomach. I jumped up, and it obviously elevated my blood pressure along with the fear/shock I had. Then I felt a painful, hard thump in my chest. Afterwards it was difficult to breathe for days, and I started having near-constant heart palpitations that disrupted my sleep.

The heart palpitations have greatly lessened now, but they're still obviously there. I haven't had any palpitations while lying down anymore, only while sitting or walking around.

I just don't know what to do about them. They make it impossible to do any kind of mental work.

My life is doomed to be shit. Everything just piles up, and it's honestly making me borderline suicidal. I'll just end up homeless or dead in my 20s-30s. I'm 23.

578,Twinkofoz,1548426835,1,"Hello everyone. I'd like to start off by saying I'm writing this post as my symptoms of mental distress have now started to concern me quite a bit, and I feel like asking questions anonymously could save me from feeling extremely uncomfortable.

In short, I have been having very dark , violent , evil thoughts, which are now urges. Someone who annoys me in the slightest way, I would kill if I had the right opportunity. I would have no remorse, and would actually feel good doing it. The rage that I find inside actually makes me laugh and happy, just knowing that it's possible to do. 

I have never acted on killing someone, however as a child, these urges where there,  which I acted on, not knowing the consequences, and with no reason either. I used to get into situations where I would be alone in a pool, with another young person my age 7-8 at the time, where I began drowning them. Only to stop when I knew they were close to losing consciousness. Almost as if I just wanted to see what it's like without doing it. This happened 2-3 times. I would get into trouble , but being young it would pass as rough play in the pool gone too far, as there was no witnesses. Which I would bend the story to relieve me of blame. This type of stuff I do all the time, but not necessarily by myself. I party with people, who I constantly get too drunk. I give them more and more alcohol or drugs, knowing that it is harming them, simply because it's so amusing. I have no problems with watching them spew, green out whilst suffering physically and mentally. It is something that makes me laugh harder than ever.

I know it's wrong because I've been pulled up on it multiple times, but again I can so easily play the card of ""it was a drinking game"" and "" they chose to do it"". Which they did, but I would pressure these people, some friends, some even family. With absolutely no care for their well-being. In fact the part of them being unwell is what I wanted to happen.

I have had a  history of being sexually abused when I was young. Not raped, but being underage and shown sexual acts by someone older and mature, and basically thought I was willing. But it did extremely mess me up, especially when it come to coming to terms with my sexuality in my late teens early 20s.

I have epilepsy, which requires medications, but I've had all of these mental issues since a young age.

I've been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder by a psychiatrist and psychologist. I've checked myself into hospital during a near relationship break up, thinking I would now start committing such dark thoughts.

I basically obsess about harming/killing others. It doesn't scare me, in fact it would be great to do it. Which is why I know something is really wrong. The only reason why I can't , is because of losing my relationship with my partner. But if that ends, I feel like I will be a major threat to society. I feel like I could possibly be a psychopath. But I don't necessarily fit the generalised description of one. But do have the many messed up thoughts and urges they do. 

I'm willing to answer as many questions as possible.

The goal for me is to be diagnosed correctly, so I can receive help to stop the internal suffering this is all causing. If I could understand what's wrong, and how to approach all of this, without being in trouble, or losing my job and relationship. I would definitely be able to live a somewhat normal life.",mentalhealth,Do I need psychological help? Violent thoughts etc..,2019-01-26 01:33:55

584,levelonesc,1548414900,1,"Hello reddit,

I just wanted to share one of the most traumatizing experiences four my mental health in my life that I'm still extremely tender about a decade later.

So a little backstory, my father and I have always butted heads. I don't know if it's because we just have personalities that clash or if because he's abusive (unintentionally and mental, not physical). My father was THE guy back in high school. Typical jock popular with everyone. If he didn't like you, no one did. Was probably a big bully like he was to me growing up.

Anyway, growing up around him was difficult for me because while he provided food shelter and a lot of material goodies ( i was spoiled by things) he was never the guy i could talk to about my issues. Which started piling up around puberty. 

One of these issues is ADHD and mild aspii syndrome (just got diagnosed as an adult). I was and never have been particularly neat in anything. Handwriting? Hardly legible. Locker at school? An absolute mess. But there was one category of stuff that i did organize. My creative folder. I organized them in what i admit was crazy to people who didn't understand my method (everyone). I organized them in order of importance to me. 

Now to the actual spirit crushing part. One day I was asked (for the millionth time) to clean my room. And for the first time in a very long time I did it. I'm not sure why I was able to do it that day. Maybe something good happened. I can't remember. But i remember cleaning and organizing properly everything in my room. Under my bed, my desk, made my bed, vacuumed, wiped down everything, did my laundry. I felt proud of my clean room. I was on my bed feeling great because not only did I have a clean room, but I'd done it to what i assumed was to my father's standard.  I was wrong. 

As i was on my bed feeling proud of myself, I hear stomping footsteps coming into the basement and my dad bursts into my room. Angrily. I asked him what was going on, why did he seem so upset? He ignored me and started to basically white glove my room. Which was spotless. Seeming to get angrier that he couldn't find anything he opens my closet. While i admit i didn't pay as much attention to my closet in my cleaning process, i did vacuum and organize all my shoes, snowboard, kite, rc car, and hung up all my shirts and coats. One thing i didn't touch was my creative pile. I had them ear marked in every which way, stacked so i could easily find what i looked for because i knew exactly where i put it. Turns out my dad finally found what he was looking for. Something he didn't deem clean enough. He proceeds to start yelling at me, screaming almost, and starts tearing everything out of my closet throwing everything to the floor like it was all trash. Including soon be clothing, some shoes, my kite that is had since i was six, and a fewother things. But most importantly to me was over 1000 pages of creative writing, drawings, music that i had written, thoughts i had about the world around me, etc. Thrown to the ground.

After my dad was done, I confronted him. Asking him why he had done what he had done. He got defensive saying it was my fault because i didn't organize those papers the way he wanted me to. I flared, stating he had no right to come in and just absolutely destroy my room like that. He said it was his house and could do what he wanted. 

I gave him an ultimatum after trying to explain what the pile on the floor that he had strewn about many to me. I told him ""You need to clean this up. Everything you threw to the ground means a great deal to me and i had it organized in a way i could find everything. If you do not clean it up, I will assume you don't care about anything you just did. But i warn you, if you do not clean it, i will not either. I will throw it away and i will hold you responsible for killing my creativity. And i will never forgive you for it.""

He didn't clean it up. Then he left my room. Angry, i proceeded to grab a 50 gallon garbage bag and put everything he threw to the ground like garbage into that bag, crying the whole time. I composed myself a bit then carried it upstairs. I confronted him one last time. ""This is your last chance to right the wrong you caused me."" He ignored me. So i threw it all away and it happened to be garbage day that day. It got taken before i could cool down enough to reclaim it.

I left to my only sanctuary at the time and refused to go home until i knew my father was asleep. 

I confronted him about it again about a year or two ago when he asked me why i resented him so much. After bringing up that story he tried blowing me off, but I looked at him dead in the eye and said ""It may have been nothing for you, but that was my world that you trampled on and threw to the ground. I will not even consider forgiving you until you at least apologize for it and even if you did I'm not sure I would forgive you.""

He brushed me off again, and I haven't brought it up again. But I did stop calling him dad and call him by his first name instead. And while i don't ever block him from visiting his grand children, I never go out of my way to make them cross paths.

This final semester is where we work full time with a nurse on 12 hour shifts and only have a certain number of shifts (35) before we are done. In that time, we are expected to work towards becoming independent and confident in our abilities, and only need our instructor as a supervisor rather than a lead. 

It’s incredibly stressful because I feel like my instructor is expecting way too much from me very early on. For example, I was given a full patient load and expected to manage on my own on the third shift (which is crazy because usually you start the first week by shadowing and then get one patient with lots of help). I ended up breaking down after the shift because I felt like it went horribly wrong and I had no idea what I was doing. This was all in front of my instructor. 

After that shift, she said she realized she was putting too much on me too early on and she was going to slow down a bit however she hasn’t. The last few shifts I’ve had three patients and been expected to complete skills independently that I have never seen demonstrated nor completed myself. 

She is also continually criticizing me by saying things like “your IV bag is running on fumes, you need to change that before shiftchange (it was the end of the shift) otherwise you’re leaving your teammates stranded!” When in reality, the bag still had about 200 mls in it running at 82/hr. I can’t seem to anticipate her expectations of me because in that example, I figured the other shift had at least two hours before they ran out, and the new bag was already pulled and ready to go sitting in the med room. 

I come home exhausted and feeling like I have no clue what I am doing. Is this normal?

603,Daysbefore_,1548389908,1,"18 year old male. Senior in highschool. 


I have never opened up about any issues I’ve had in part because I feel ashamed of myself and also I feel as if nobody else goes through what I go through. I guess I just need somebody to talk to. 


    I’ll try to be specific.

Throughout high school I’ve always had friends. Never been a popular kid, but people who know me know I try to be a a legitimate caring friend. I would say I’m an extrovert. I love when somebody says hi to me in the hallway or I meet somebody new, and I love hanging out with friends. 

   Gradually throughout high school I have felt like I’ve been torn down as a person. I feel defeated. I used to be such a happy kid who didn’t care what people thought but now I hate walking in the hallways and avoid school sporting events because I just feel isolated from the people at my school. Everybody seems to have their exclusive  clique, which are connected to other cliques. I feel like I am an outsider in the social aspect of my school. I’m afraid to talk to most people in my grade because I feel like they are above me in a social aspect. I’m afraid to talk to girls because I am insecure about myself. I haven’t hung out with a girl in my entire life. It’s hard for me to talk to girls because I feel like they will think I’m a loser. In class I am always anxious because it seems like everybody knows each other and they have no interest in getting to know me. 
   
    I feel depressed at school. I feel like I wasted high school being a loser and while other kids are planning their spring break vacations I’m going to be sitting at home alone. While other kids are asking dates to prom I don’t have anybody to ask. When other kids are getting invited to grad parties I won’t be. I feel sad, lonely, and honestly a little depressed right now. Have never felt quite like this in my whole life, and I am just looking for some help.

So I’ve never really talked to anybody about this issue but I’m in my last semester of high school and it’s something that has been bothering me throughout these past four years. Hopefully this is the right place to talk about this, thank you for anybody that is willing to listen. 

      Ever since freshman year I’ve felt an increasing feeling of isolation from people in my grade and school. I feel as if I am on the outside looking in at an almost weblike social structure between different cliques and groups and I just feel like a leftover who doesn’t really belong anywhere. 
     The main thing that bothers me is I feel like there is this aura of exclusivity around these cliques at my school and I just feel totally left out. It’s to the point where I don’t even like walking in the hallway anymore because of everybody talking to each other in their groups. Im not an introvert; I thrive when I am talking to people at school, but i just feel shut out from the rest of my grade. 

     I honestly have a feeling this is coming from insecurities of myself. I haven’t talked to hardly any girls because I just feel so insecure all the time. I’ve never hung out with a girl. I feel like a complete loser every day in school and now I am in debate class and am terrified to get up in front of the class. I wish I just wasn’t insecure and I wish I didn’t care so much about the social aspect of school. People are going to all these different places for spring break together at school and nobody has invited me anywhere and I just feel so alone and I really need somebody to help me out I feel terrible about myself and I feel like I wasted high school. 


    Sorry if this post makes no sense. I really just started writing and wrote whatever came to my mind. Maybe I overthink things too much, maybe I am insecure, maybe I am depressed, I have no idea. But the feeling (which has increased) the last 4 years of high school is making me feel terrible and it’s hard to go to school because I feel sad and scared.

609,anonmethis,1548386742,1,"That never-ending internal struggle is really driving me crazy. One half of me is ambitious, unstoppable. Has a focus and drive that no distraction can penetrate. It feels like I can do anything in the world and I can do it absolutely alone. There are goals and motivations and dreams, things to accomplish and things to look forward to. Reasons to live and excitement found in everything. Not afraid to try new things, even welcoming it. Not afraid of anything, it feels like nothing could get in my way. I wouldn’t let it. That half has hope, that half is still a dreamer and wants to try despite knowing the outcome. That half hopes that things might be different just this once. That maybe they’ve changed. Maybe it isn’t as bad as I expected, maybe it’ll end differently. Without fail, tragically yet expectedly, ends up wounded each and every time, the pain more agonizing each time. But there’s always that warm familiarity of disappointment and sadness for it to run back to.

The other half says shut the fuck up, you worthless piece of shit, you’re never going to get anywhere. Your dreams and hopes? Fucking forget it, you’re always a disappointment in the end. You can’t and haven’t done anything with your useless life. You’re not worth it for anyone to stay, for anyone to bother dealing with. You’re not worth it to anyone, how haven’t you noticed that by now? Stop trying and just give up already, stop clinging on. All you do is fuck up and it’s all you’re good for, you can’t do anything right and you always end up being a burden to everybody around out. Always causing problems. You should just stay away and life would be easier, it goes on without your presence. 

Then, there’s that little shred of conscience left that prevents me from ever doing anything rash. It makes me feel guilty, it stops me from doing wrong. Prevents me from being completely selfish for once. It prevents me from only thinking about myself and how I feel. It’s sickening that I always put everyone above myself even if I’m dying inside, and no matter how much I want to be selfish, it’s impossible because I’ll get absolute hell from myself for making that decision. It stops me from just completely giving up and taking the easy road to solve my problems no matter how much I want to — it forces me to suffer through the hard road, to endure things I didn’t know I could, to barely push through to the end. Barely hanging on, falling apart completely. Breaking, if not already broken.

And for what? Life is fleeting. Nothing makes a difference to me, life is rinse-and-repeat, an endless cycle of repetitiveness until the day death takes its hold on you and you welcome the freedom it grants you. At the end of the day, does it really matter? Everything is lost in the end. What’s the end game here? Suffering each and every day, pouring blood, sweat, and tears into life, but what do you get out of it? Temporary happiness? A distraction from the fact that life is meaningless? Ceasing to exist rather than suffering day-to-day, that would certainly be the peaceful option.

I mean I wish I could just ignore it, I really do. This is why I need medication. It’s not just about my own willpower or wanting to change the way I think because believe me, no matter how hard I’ve tried, the root of the problem always comes back to haunt me in the end. It’s a demon that refuses to leave. This is how my brain works whether I like it or not. It’s not as simple as just trying to change my thought process or trying to forget about all my problems even though they’re well past. It’s a fucking real struggle to fight this demon, simply because it’s what comes naturally to me. I think that’s the part that everyone I try to explain this to just really doesn’t get. 

My brain doesn’t work the same way a normal person’s would, this way of thinking is so fucked up and it always has been; all the problems in my life only contributed to it, they were never the sole cause. I’ve been this way since I was so young, and sure I can take steps to improve my thinking and all that, to work on myself, but the straight up answer is that it will never disappear because that’s how I am and there isn’t shit I can do to change that fact. I can mask it, that’s all I can do because no amount of willpower in this world or reliance on God can fix this way of thinking; if it could, almost 19 years later I wouldn’t still be this way. It’s literally like that one song, idontwannabeyouanymore, 

I was made from a broken mold and just have to accept that. That entire song sums up exactly how I feel about myself. No one could ever understand what it feels like to be me, what it feels like to be tormented by your own mind on a daily basis and the amount of strength it takes just to fight it. No one understands how hard it is to keep fighting and not want to just give up and die, it’s so tempting to take the easy way out. The thing I have to realize is that I’m broken and I can only patch it to feel normal, but I will never be normal. I don’t think anyone knows how that feels unless they’ve gone through the same thing themselves. 

Everyone always says you need to try harder, you need to change your mind set. I honestly wish it was that easy. Like I said, no one understands just how hard it is.. If I wasn’t trying, I wouldn’t even be here anymore. I would’ve gave up so long ago but I’m still holding on and refusing to completely give in, even if I’ve come so close to doing so several time. No one understands how it feels, and if I’m honest that makes me feel so alone in this world. I feel like I can’t even open up to anyone because I can’t accurately explain how I feel. It’s not a point of focusing on the ambitious side, it’s the fact that I have to fight so hard to control it and I don’t always win that battle. Being constantly tormented by my own mind every fucking day isn’t exactly something easy to live with. 

And neither is the fact that whether I like it or not, I’m broken and there isn’t shit I can do about that except to mask it and pretend I’m normal like everyone else. It’s not something easy to come to terms with, because now not only do I not have control of my body’s limitations and what I can do with it, but I don’t even have control over my own mind and my emotions. I don’t know how people don’t understand this, all I’m ever told is either to get over it because life is hard, you’re not trying hard enough, you don’t want to help yourself.

it s kind of stupid but, today a youtuber i like posted a video about his depression. in the video he said, ""if you were looking for a sign to get help, this is it! this is your day!""

but most times i tell myself i dont need one, i'm not facing any incredible struggle &amp; i'm just making up that i need help or that i'm sad or whatever. imposter syndrome? idk. i also am not a big fan of self-diagnosis so i would never label myself with [so-or-so mental health issue], but when i read about symptoms, i see myself. and then i fall into thinking that i'm just making that up, too.

615,halojumps,1548381008,1,"The past year has been a nightmare. Nothing less. On Mother’s Day my mother and only surviving parent had a stroke and went into the hospital. After several months of trying to motivate her to participate in rehab therapy, she passed away early December. She was under 70. I had been living with her and carry so much guilt from not being able to care for her better. 

The day before her stroke, I was unable to get out of bed. Crippled with depression and feeling stress from a shit job that I cared too much about. At one point during that day I had even looked into outpatient programs around my area, knowing well that if I didn’t reach out to someone soon, I would try to kill myself for a third time. That’s embarrassing to admit; that the two previous times I couldn’t even manage to off myself correctly. Add those tries to the multitude of mistakes I’ve made in 30 years. 

When it appeared my mother might just have a real shot at recovery, I sat down with a calendar and started looking at dates a few months out - I needed time to clean the house, sell my belongings and ensure my brother, my only other surviving relative, was not left with a mess. November 3rd was the day I settled on. I began to clean the house; donate items and toss what wouldn’t be wanted. I began to stockpile meds and went so far as to take a class on using a firearm so I would be prepared when the time came. As my mothers condition worsened and her inability to participate in her own recovery began to be her undoing, I felt the need to not add more stress to the situation. I didn’t want her heart to break any more than it had already been broken. She had stopped eating by the end of September and the towel was officially thrown in shortly after. I couldn’t blame her for not wanting to be here, to be stuck in a body she no longer had much control over, to be surrounded by the miserable atmosphere within the nursing home. To know she would never come home to her puppies, her own bed, her old life - everything she had known since the mid 80s when the home was purchased. Inside I felt hurt, maybe even jealous to some extent that I couldn’t take her place. I was upset she was essentially choosing a slow suicidal when all my life I’d been told again and again by this woman that it was disgustingly selfish. Being a child of someone raised in the 50s/60s, mental illness was something that HAD to be in the bloodline. It was something that didn’t exist outside sanatoriums from ghost hunter shows she watched or trials of the seriously sinister on Investigation Discovery. From the time I was old enough to understand what the symptoms of depression were, I was told there was no history of mental illness in the family, therefore it didn’t exist. I was “too sensitive, overly emotional”.  Despite my outward appearance, that of a lanky kid with almost black hair who just wanted to play kickball and be one of the boys, my mom never questioned gashes, bruises or wounds that had been self inflicted for years. 

At 16, I made the first attempt to take my life.  Naively downing an entire bottle of Tylenol PM and any prescriptions I could find in the house. Clearly all I accomplished was making myself extremely sick. I remember waking up a day or so later, fully coherent and being thankful I was still alive. The sun felt warmer on that day than any beautiful day before. People seemed nicer. It felt like maybe this (the self hate, worthlessness, consuming depression) was something I had to put to rest before I could be whole again. Sadly it wasn’t long before I fell back into self destructive habits, more angry with myself for now having confirmation I was a failure. I became more brazen when I felt the need to self harm; instead of being methodical and exacting about the process, I got sloppy. I didn’t care if my tool of choice was clean, if I had peroxide or iodine to clean with, bandages to cover the damage. I managed to somehow make it to 19 before trying to overdose a second time. I went to a friends house, spent the night and asked to stay another. I snuck home and into our finished basement where I downed pain pills, benzos and finished off two bottles of vodka before falling asleep.  Since I’m here and typing this,  you can guess what the outcome was. 

For the next decade I would keep everything to myself. The self harm increased. I found new ways to punish myself and ‘cope’.  The desire to die never left. I took everything to the extreme. I did things I never thought I would do. At the same time, I honestly did not care. The only regret I have is not going further. Not fully allowing myself to go down the rabbit hole out of obligation to my coworkers - not my family.  For some reason I felt it was important to show up for them until I had everything ironed out in the chaos that is my mind. I also couldn’t take the devastation of facing failure for a third time.  When I finally felt I had my out planned, hours of time spent into researching and saving money to get away from my situation, my dad passed from a massive heart attack. My attention immediately went to caring for my mom, doing everything I could to fill my fathers shoes and be the support she needed. When she passed this past December, my expiration date was instantly reset. Mid February.  

I’ve been in and out of forms of treatment. I’ve done minimal outpatient, talk therapy, journaling, art therapy. I’ve seen several psychiatrists, been on just about every medication for PTSD, severe depression, anxiety and BPD. I’ve tried diving into CBD, meditation and self care - I couldn’t commit to something I didn’t believe in doing. I feel I have exhausted any help available. At this point I don’t see a point to pouring money into things that aren’t helping. For six years I’ve been hoping for that Ah-ha! moment where all the words spoken at me about how life is worth living... they’ve just been in vain. They were only said because the person opposite me was recalling the script laid down for tense situations. After losing my job, the one I mentioned caring about too much earlier, after working for the company for 11 years - being cornered into resigning due to the fact I was receiving calls from the hospital ICU to make decisions that would impact my mothers recovery, I have yet to find a new job and it’s not from lack of trying. Wanting to find a full time, non-seasonal job anytime from Oct-Jan is a joke. Retail, unfortunately is what I know. It’s not where I want to be. I refuse to work for $9/hr and have my job dangled over my head if I’m unable to nail down a certain amount of credit card apps in one day. Is that all I am worth? Fuck that. Fuck trying anymore. I am fucking exhausted 24 hours a day. Fuck feeling invalidated by others who tell me there’s nothing wrong with me, it’s normal to feel all I’ve felt and continue to feel. There is nothing worse than not being able to stomach your own reflection and being alone with that shit day in and day out.

616,walktothesunset,1548380927,1,"I don't know what to do in regards to what's going on in my head. It's been a year in which I have episodes of hopelessness and complete despair at least every week or so. Nothing is wrong, I'm extremely blessed. I'll just suddenly feel so anxious and alone and trapped. I get the urge to isolate myself and feel heaviness on my chest. I found about 2 weeks ago that inflicting pain on myself physically gives me so much relief. When I do, I feel like I can breathe again and I'm scared that it'll become a habit. I definitely don't plan to kill myself even though I fantasize about it at times. Is this normal for a teenager? I got off all social media last year when I first started feeling these things. I take care of myself so much better but now, a year later, nothing has changed. I know that it's super easy to feel overwhelmed with all of the hormones, but I don't hear any people my age really talk about this. I'm a very social person and I have a great relationship with my family, I'm very involved in school, and my life is good. It's just this pattern that I thought was going to end a long time ago hasn't. Since then, I've felt much more disconnected with my friends. I don't care about things as much as I used to and people tell me I've changed. I don't want to speak to my parents about this (even though I trust them so, so much) because I don't want them to get worried, especially if it's just a stage that I'm going through as a teen. I'm scared of speaking to a school counselor because of the self-harm part. I feel uncomfortable when I'm alone because I get scared that I'll start feeling that way again. When I'm around people I feel like I'm distracted temporarily, but even then I'm usually zoning out. Don't get me wrong, I have really good times too. A lot of things make me happy, but everything is so temporary. I've been exercising to feel better too, but it doesn't help nearly as much as self-harm. I just want to know: is this okay? Is it necessary that I speak to someone about this? Do all teenagers go through this? Thank you so much. ",mentalhealth,Is this just a phase?,2019-01-25 12:48:47

618,Bipolarbear2019,1548379938,1,"Hi all,

This is my first Reddit post, I never really talk about anything to anyone but I need to get this off my chest, sorry to seem like a pain.

I have severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), anxiety and bipolar, having  been diagnosed in 2017 (although I can’t remember a day I never was like this, I just never had a crisis enough to attend a psychiatrist unit, more of that some other time maybe).

I was offered to be put on a mood stabiliser for my bipolar, and an anti-depressive for my OCD (I could react badly without the mood stabiliser), but I was too scared to actually take more medication than I already am for my other conditions, specially as I know people who medication made them worse, and pressure from my family not to take meds.

I convinced my psychiatrist that I was getting better and, in our last appointment, totally fine and happy in life for a year and that I had no manic or depressive episodes, even though it was not true. 

She referred me to get CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therspy) for my OCD and as I was ‘fine’ as far as she was aware, she didn’t continue with medication for my bipolar and discharged me. 

Don’t get me wrong, she was an amazing professional and I couldn’t have had a better psychiatrist. 

I got offered an appointment for my CBT but as I was abroad I couldn’t open the letter (I was unaware) and as I had missed my appointment as I was in another country, I got discharged from the CBT sevice automstically.

In the past weeks since I got discharged, my life and disorders have had a turn for the worst with me contemplating suicide every minute of the day, even though I know I won’t do anything as my girlfriend and my family love me so much and I couldn’t hurt them like that. But I feel sometimes that it’s the best way out. I’ve had a business failure, I’m tens of thousands of pounds in debt, I’m just 18 with no future right now and my mother is moving to another country whilst my girlfriend is here, and I don’t know what to do as I’ve never been away from my mum, and my girl is two hours away by car, longer by train, and my heart is split in three places, I feel like death is an option to get out of everything.

I’d like to go see my psychiatrist again and sort everything out but I’m too embarrassed to go back, and my family thinks I’m well so it’d be out of the blue and bizarre, so I’m terrified of going back if I had to...

I don’t know why the heck I wrote this, sorry for wasting your time, I just don’t know what to do. I’ve had so many business failures ever since I was 15, some were successful but they weren’t what I wanted to do (yes, I know I’m still young), and I know my mental health affected my decisions and that’s why I stopped doing a few businesses. I still have my ambition but I want stability and I know life’s not easy. I’m very grateful for each opportunity I’ve had but I’m just scared I’m a failure already...

Sorry,

Thanks for taking your time,

Bipolarbear2019.

628,Nasty_Nate221,1548372222,1,"Hi guys, I am a 23 y/o dude and I have recently self-diagnosed myself with OCD. I am seeing a therapist and we talk about these things, but I was seeking different opinions on what's going on with me lately. I've been kind of experiencing relationship OCD with my gf for a while now. We recently got back together after I ruined our relationship by cheating, which I believe was also fueled by my OCD. 

We've made much progress in the 3 months since we started back together but there's been many speedbumps such as cheating OCD and such. However, I've been experiencing this specific thought and obsession lately: I feel so guilty for ruining us that I've been confessing every little minor thing I did with other women during the time we were apart (i.e. texting, nudes I had of others, interactions w/ the women I had sex with). When I have nothing left to confess, I start searching my memory for more to confess.

She understandably gets mad when I confess these things, but it's mostly because she doesn't want me to tell her about anything unless its another instance of me having sex with someone during our time apart (which I've already told her all about). I feel so undeserving all the time and I believe this is what it stems from; my guilt. The worst part is that I feel like every little bad thing I did matters so that's why I haven't stopped myself. Even after she tells me these things don't matter and that she'd rather not hear about it.

 Is this a specific form of OCD? I know about scrupulosity but that's more religious. Help me out guys.

Tl;dr - Obsessively confessing to my gf minor things I did with other women during our breakup (I.e. texting, nude pictures, interactions with women I had sex with).

644,myquarterlifecrisiss,1548362844,1,"So my mental health right now isn’t the worst but it’s not great and I’m scared it could get a lot worse. I have a counselling appointment in a few weeks and that should be a regular thing, and ive never had counselling for a long period of time so hopefully it should help me vent every once in a while. 

However I believe that I would not be as depressed as I am right now if I was not as lonely. That might be an ignorant thing to say because I know people can have all the love and money in the world and still be very depressed, but that being said people always say speaking to someone helps your mental health and I don’t have many people I can turn to, and it makes me wonder if anyone actually cares about me which fuels my depression more. 

My parents don’t really care about how I feel and even though I’ve heavily insinuated I’ve been feeling down they don’t question it. I don’t even know if speaking to them about it and telling them explicitly that im not in a great headspace is a good idea because they definitely have that ‘people your age don’t have real issues’ view.  

I first told my two best friends about my mental health about 15 months ago, and at the start it took me a while to go see a doctor because i didn’t believe myself at first it was mental health, then when I went to the doctors not much was done.  So I have a feeling they kind of gave up on me because they ask occasionally nowadays but very rarely, and they know I’ve sorted counselling and they ask why i haven’t been talking to them as much recently but they still don’t really wanna talk about it. I could blame myself in this situation however because i struggle being open with them about it, but sometimes i ask if they should care more or get me to talk about it more because i ask one of them a lot about her mental health, but then i feel like she just asks me back out of pity. I also hate it because they’re only really the two people i can talk to and i feel like such a burden because they both have a lot more close relationships than I do so they don’t always talk to me about their problems, but i don’t have anyone else i can talk to about mine. 

I’m really trying to make new friends at uni but I struggle to always attend uni in the first place, and I can’t help but feel jealous and not relate to how bubbly and happy they are. Im also on tinder at the minute but not really having much success at the moment hahah. 

So i was just wondering if anyone else has felt really lonely when their mental health is not good? And what do you do?

There are specific things I tend to obsess about, but it is never about cleaning, harming other people etc

Years ago I used to have symptoms of Hocd (I was obsessed with the idea of being a lesbian/attracted to women after some people spread the rumor in middle school) and it was terrible because I switched from obsessive/intrusive thoughts, anxiety, reassuring myself constantly etc 

Then it went away but my anxiety seemed to focus on other things like negative thoughts about the world/complete generalizing (which send me into deep depression too), my appearance/looks and how people perceive me, thoughts about someone I was close too online and about relationships.

**My main reasons for seeing one is to figure out my mood / emotional instability, my irrationality. I also had a lot of physical/sexual abuse in my childhood &amp; early teen years so I wanted to get help for that because that's something I've never talked to anyone about. My parents still don't even know to this day.**

***FIRST VISIT, JAN 4th, 2019:*** 

So the January 4th, I see the therapist for the 1st time. I'm naturally very weary of ppl, but she seems like a nice lady. She was calm, and had a pleasant tone. This put me at ease with her. She asked me some basic questions regarding the abuse but she didn't pry which I appreciated. After talking to her during that session, she concludes that my case is a bit complicated. She also says that I have PTSD, and also seem to have bipolar. I didn't know that I could have ptsd because that's something that I always thought that soldiers get when they return from war. And I didn't agree with her saying that I may be bipolar because I explained to her that my mood will fluctuate in the same day, my mood doesn't stay the same for weeks at a time. My mood can literally go high/low all within the same day. I can go from being normal/calm...and something / someone can set me off and then I'm raging and going off on them and I will usually be very verbally abusive and once I get that out of my system and calm back down, then I'm typically apologetic. My personal relationships also tend to be chaotic... some minor thing happens and then I want to break up with my bf. I also told her about very recent incidents that happened: I broke up with my bf because he added a girl and liked one of her pics on Instagram. I wouldn't take him back until he ""unliked"" her picture and blocked her. Like I literally could not think straight or calm down until he did so. Which to his credit, he did. I also told her about the time last year when my break up happened, and I hooked up with one of my exes, and immediately after the hookup, like literally the next day I started obsessing over getting him back and how I hoped that I'll get pregnant so that he will always be in my life and can't leave me.  I've also been told by my current bf and other exes that I'm very controlling and possessive. Even when I'm telling her all this, the therapist just tells me that's normal, everyone is like that a bit. I wanted to ask her, ""well if this is normal, then why am I even wasting my time by being here???"" I don't know if she genuinely doesn't care, or if she's fuck!ng with my head??? It's like I know something is not right with me emotionally and I'm trying to understand myself better and trying to get the help for it, but I have a freaking therapist who just agrees with everything I say, and just tells me that the things that I do or feel are normal...!?

&amp;#x200B;

***SECOND VIST, JAN 22:***

The therapist asks what's going on in my life. I'm currently going a breakup with my current boyfriend, so I was telling her about that. Then as I'm telling her about my breakup, she stops me and asks ""why are you smiling?""

I was a bit caught off guard by that and I was only smiling because I do that when I'm nervous. She goes ""are you entertained by all this"" referring to me telling her about my current breakup and my other relationships. And I told her, I'm only smiling because I'm NERVOUS. Like what the hell?? Why would I be entertained??? But I got this vibe that she was being judgmental towards me. 

Then I tell her that I'm talking to my ex again (who is a good friend, and also the ex that I've hooked up with in the past), and that we're meeting up this weekend. And she asks what we're doing, and I told her that we're hanging out in his town and I'm going to be staying at his place over the weekend. She tells me to not hookup with him, and I told her that I'll try not to? My breakup is tough on me and I literally have this need to connect with someone, like I feel empty and alone if I don't have anyone and my ex is someone who has always been there for me, even tho I didn't treat him well either in the past. 

I also told her about what I did last past weekend. I had met up with my best friend, Sara and we went out for dinner. And I told Sara about me seeing a therapist and basically I'm giving her a recap of my 1st visit. I also mentioned to Sara that I don't agree with my therapist thinking I might be bipolar because my moods don't last weeks at a time. And Sara then tells me to ask the therapist ""whats the difference between borderline and a bipolar disorder?

So I ask my therapist this question during the session, and she completely shuts me down. She just very abruptly says ""I don't want to discuss this right now"". Ummm what??? I have a legit question and you're just gonna shut me down like that. At this point I could tell that she was getting a bit irritated or pissed even. She turns her back and says she's gonna schedule me for another appt next week and we will talk then. She then gets up and opens the door for me to leave, and as I'm getting my purse and standing up, I ask her what I should do about David (ex I hooked up with) and she very angrily says I'm not discussing that with you anymore. Basically she wanted me out of her office immediately and as she's walking me out to the exit, I say to her that this (therapy) is hard for me, she shoots back at me ""yeah well therapy isn't for sissys!""

I was at a loss for words at this point. She seemed so pissed at me.

He and I became super close, more friend like than anything. I honestly spent most of my time in therapy just going to talk about whatever with him....not actual therapy. I was so happy around him and he even admitted to having acted very different with me than others.... and that there was ""feelings"" and even though friendship/contact isn't against the law here, he has his own personal rule for 2 years anyway. 

It's been so hard, I think of him daily, wishing I could say something funny to him, to know how his new job is, to know if he's ok.... I always wonder if he remembers me or has forgotten me already. I cry so often and I hate it. I know this is grief but it still sucks and it feels like it will never get better, this has literally been the longest month ever and it's still not over

I don't want to go to therapy with anyone else, therapy itself is not for me. I hate being vulernable and talking about deep things with people. He claimed many many times he was completely ok with me reaching out in 2 years and while I realize I may not care then or he may not wanna see me then, for now, it's what I'm holding on to, it helps me get through the day

However I still feel so lost, so insanely sad. Such a huge piece of my heart and my biggest joy, is gone. I don't know how to go on without knowing how he is, without knowing for sure if we can ever speak again etc.

I could use some advice. I have an anxiety disorder so most of the time I feel completely fine, but sometimes things just trigger me and I start panicking.

673,NhanFiction,1548334335,1,"Honestly, I'll be blunt. This is going to come off as a bit of a rant because I need to get this off of my chest for my own sake.

Anyway, long story short, my younger brother (he is the middle child) has been an asshole to me over the years. It sucks because he and I use to be best friends as kids. We used to play together all of the time. We hung out together. We told each other everything.

But as we got older, we drifted apart. It happens. It's normal, but the way it has gone pear-shaped is definitely hurting me.

Basically, I have fucked up a lot over the years. OK. A lot. I messed up a lot here and there. I fell into a long bout with depression (still am). I was long-term unemployed off and on for various reason.

I was a mess.

Conversely, my brother lined his ducks up in a row, got a nice-paying job and has continued to flourish with better career opportunities. On one hand, I should be happy for him. I have always been proud of how smart and adept he is at just getting things done.

However, over the years, he has become really arrogant and hurtful toward me. In short, he looks down upon me because I constantly am trying to get my damn life together. It's been a real struggle for me.

I don't do drugs. I don't drink. I don't have illegitimate kids to worry about and stuff, but I still have it hard because I am my own worst enemy. Especially right now, I am just trying to stabilize the ship.

My goal is to save up money, get out of this damn state and really get my life going. Chase my dreams. All of that jazz.

I do a lot of self-therapy things like blogging, writing stories, I also enjoy making videos and whatnot... At this point, this isn't about me getting ""famous."" It's to help me pass the time and keep my head above water.

For my brother, he thinks it's so damn hilarious just to make accounts and leave nasty comments or talk shit about what I do. He used to make fake accounts to do it. But now, he is just being blunt and is just using his real name. He knows I'll see it.

I feel like a damn bitch for just having to block him and whatnot. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if he has found my Reddit account or whatever.

Ugh. I know it could be way worse. He has his own life. I have mine. In the grand scheme of things, I know part of me needs to be the bigger brother here and just ignore him. Prove him and everyone else wrong.

Nonetheless, part of me feels vulnerable to him just going out of his way to be rude and nasty to me. He totally doesn't need to, but he does it because it's ""fun"" for him to kick me while I am down.

Yeah, I get it. I keep spinning my wheels again and again. I obviously am trying to figure this all out, but something keeps hindering me. I really do want to solve this damn mystery. Mental health isn't some random thing you just flip to the ""OK, good to go"" part without something more to it. It's complicated. 

The way I see it, if the roles were reversed, I wouldn't even entertain the idea of kicking him while he is down. I just wouldn't. I would help him in any shape or form. It's not like I ask him for money or anything like that.

She’s always doing wild stuff like spending loads of money on us and being obsessed with a new lover and getting 3 tattoos of his name (actually true) that she’s been with for half a year then the next minute locking herself in her room threatening to commit suicide over something minuscule.

Although I’m much more tame I’m worried that I am starting to show these symptoms. I’m a very impulsive buyer. My paycheck is usually almost gone within the first week after I get payed, and I have no problem taking friends out to eat to make them happy. I have trouble paying back debts to family because of this (owe my sister some money from before I got a job), and it’s not like I’m just being dumb, I just have such a strong urge to get rid of all my money. I can’t stop thinking about stuff I want/need to buy.

I’ve also noticed that every now and again I’ll just get really motivated to do stuff. I’ll start learning ASL or playing the piano or I’ll just sit down and draw a person in one sitting, or I’ll have a crush on someone and put everything I have into that relationship from the get go, I’ll even start thinking that I’m over my depression because I’ll feel so elated.

I cancelled plans with my friends over winter break because of this, I just feel so exhausted and drained constantly. I’m so exhausted that I can’t stay awake in any of my classes. I even fall asleep sometimes sitting in a stool with no back. My head starts to jerk very noticeably, I don’t even have to sit with my head on my hand, I just can’t stay awake no matter how interested I am in the subject.

I can’t keep things straight or remember stuff, and I get so confused that I often find myself desperate to remember something and have no idea what I was wanting to say.

689,JMTHEFOX,1548313781,1,"Hello everyone, I am from New York, United States. Since I was a college student since 2013, I have started to feel like I have thoughts about being suicidal and fear of being a pedophile.

I am very attracted to women at my age but I am also attracted to girls that are 14-16 years old. However, the latter part really had me concerned that I would become a pedophile, since I talk to people on Instagram who are 14-16 years old and most are from Indonesia. I mostly avoid talking to those people about having a sexual relationship and avoid requesting child porn as much as possible, but I still keep having sexual fantasies about them that I really feel bad for myself. I also have a sexual fetish seeing women wearing knee-pads while dancing to k pop music.

I am also very concerned about committing suicide for being a pedophile or going to jail. I even fear of being beaten to death and even losing not only my friends and family, but also my chance to start my business.

I tried going to counseling in Kingsborough, but the suicidal thoughts keep coming back and I am increasing my interest in getting mental help. Am I still being a very horrible and creepy person regardless of doing the right thing?

692,W_Walk,1548309304,1,"For context, I’m 18 now and in college. Since I got to high school I had a few episodes of physical anxiety and depression but nothing that was too concerning for me to get help. A few times during my high school career I can recall being in social settings or situations that made me throw up or get physically sick. I’m not an introvert. I love being around people and talking with people but it seemed that once it got to serious situations such as prom, nice dinners, and school events I got nervous. I got nervous to the point of physically relieving myself or having mini panic attack episodes. I kept telling myself that nothing was wrong with me and that I simply had stomach issues. Well about 6 or 7 tests later and many doctors visits they determined that nothing was physically wrong with me, but that I had anxiety and depression. 

Okay so enough of the lengthy context, my depression is caused by my anxiety. This specific anxiety that makes me fearful of certain social situations that terrify me. About a year ago I got a girlfriend and she is the sweetest and most beautiful girl in the whole world. She has helped me with so much but there’s still one problem. I can’t eat in front of her family. Every time I’ve tried I get nervous and have to excuse myself. It feels just like my high school prom and all those times before where I thought nothing was wrong with me but now I know that something is wrong, and I’m not sure if that makes it better or worse. I’m currently on antidepressants but I still lack the courage and ability to eat in front of her family in formal/serious situations. It’s run everything in my life. Now it’s to the point where every time I go to her house I hope and pray that none of her family members are coming over so I can isolate myself. It doesn’t feel right. It’s unnatural to me and not who I feel I am. It’s made my depression worse but for the most part I’ve been a lot better recently. I see a psychiatrist but I still have been losing faith and losing myself in this rabbit hole of confusion and paranoia. My girlfriend is very supportive but the frustration is noticeable. I love her with everything and I’d do anything for her but I also worry that this may ruin our future together. If anyone has any advice/words for me then please do. You guys seem great and I’m new to this thread. If you read this much I appreciate you for listening to my story and my current situation.

694,lucatree,1548307606,1,"Honestly, I don't even know where to start. I guess I could give a little background. I grew up in a very strict Asian household with both my parents working; I was the oldest daughter and there were a lot of expectations for me to act and behave a certain way because my parents were pretty traditional. I probably knew that I was attracted to girls since a young age, but I'd also been attracted to boys. It really didn't become a problem until I got into puberty. I was becoming more curious about my sexuality, and I knew I was into boys AND girls, but I couldn't express my sexuality in any way because my parents were so strict. I became addicted to being on my computer and being online with my online friends who didn't have to know me in real life and who I thought would accept me for who I was. Except that I wasn't really who I was. For about a year or two, online, I think I was able to express my suppressed attraction to women through a personality, basically an online personality, and he took the name of Kris. Except that it didn't feel like a ""personality"" like I was acting or anything. If anything, it felt pretty natural and actually pretty relieving to be able to express myself as ""Kris."" Anyway, Kris was really flirty towards women, but he really was attracted to any gender/sex.

 At the same time, I was diagnosed with PCOS which is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, excess androgen, and polycystic ovaries (which is what PCOS stands for - PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome.) I was put on birth control to regulate my periods so that my hormones could be properly regulated as well. Around this time, Kris started going away, and I got busy with preparing for college so I wasn't online as much. Plus, he suffered a pretty hard rejection from someone he liked online. Anyway, I went to college and started exploring my sexuality more. The freedom I got from being away from my domineering parents and that judgmental household was the best thing for me. The only reason they let me go away was because I worked hard to get a full ride scholarship so I could leave the town.

Anyway, this sounds super weird and kind of offensive but after taking my birth control, I started feeling ""feminine"" again. I was starting to become more interested in wearing feminine-style clothing like bright pink, yellow, spring-y colors and floral prints and what not. I even started wearing skirts which was a big thing because I hated wearing skirts. Anyway, nowadays, I identify as gender fluid, but when people ask for my sex, I say girl because that's what I'm feeling. If I ever feel differently, I'd say boy if I felt like I was more like a boy that day. It was really hard for me to find a gender identity that I thought fit, but it worked for me. I also came out to my family about a couple of years ago which was pretty hard. My mother cried saying that she was a bad mother for not being able to take care of me properly that's why I turned out the way I was; and when we argued, she said that she wished she'd never given birth to me. That sucked, but I'm over it now because I've decided to cut out most of my family from my life and surround myself with positive relationships. I don't really communicate with my family anymore but I do see them from time to time and it has been very superficially civil but that's alright. 

So now I've come to terms with my sexuality and my gender identity issues, and sometimes I still struggle with my gender identity issues. I wonder, is it because of my PCOS and excessive androgen that causes me to behave more masculine or like girls? And now recently, I find myself getting the urge and desire to express ""Kris"" again, except this time he's taken on a different name of ""Lucas."" And it's strange because his name changes but he's the same person and he still has the same issues that I had back then, and all he wants is to be accepted but I don't think anyone will really understand. For awhile now I've contemplated DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), but I don't think this is it. I don't have switches that change me into a different person, and he doesn't express himself in me physically but my mental state of mind does feel a little different whenever I'm expressing him. It's like I said before, it kind of feels like a relief whenever I'm him; he's fun and funny and charming; he gets alone with everyone, however I still can only express him online. I once told a professor of mine a little bit about ""Kris"" and she asked if she could start calling me that because she thought I meant that I identified as a male named ""Kris,"" but that's not it. Honestly I felt uncomfortable when she asked if she could call me Kris. I wasn't sure why, but maybe it's because I feel like I'm not Kris and he's a different person. Honestly, I don't know what to make of this and sometimes I let ""him"" (Kris/Lucas) go online and be himself, but I'm in a healthy and stable relationship with a guy. But ""he"" (Kris/Lucas) is kind of flirty online which makes me a bit uncomfortable sometimes but also relieving in a way? Honestly, I don't ever plan to cheat on my SO because I love him. I just don't know how to deal with ""him"" (Kris/Lucas) or these urges I get from him. ",mentalhealth,"PCOS, Sexuality, and Gender Identity Issues - did they create ""him""?",2019-01-24 16:26:46

I’m writing this, I suppose, because things seem to be at a point of spiralling now.

I’m having daily panic attacks. Ones where I’m in tears and hyperventilating but also can’t breathe and my heart races so fast. It can be triggered by someone being too close to me on the train, thinking about my future, basically anything. It’s starting to hurt my body a lot. I can’t go to events with my friends for fear of having a panic attack. I get so nauseous I can’t eat. If I don’t see someone and they get to close to me I jump out of my skin and shake for hours after. Sometimes I get so frustrated by this and don’t know what to do I will just hit myself until it stops. 

I feel so isolated from everyone, including the few who are close to me. 

I go through spirals of very bad thoughts about self harm and they do go away but always come back. 

Changes in my routine distress me to a not normal degree.

It’s made me realize I need to speak to somebody about what’s happening and maybe get some help, and I’ve been contacting my local mental health centres and trying to get in touch with therapy centres (local free ones, as I can’t afford a real one and don’t have medical coverage or any benefits). People keep referring me to other people and then people simply don’t get back to me. I do keep trying but it seems so bleak. I have made an appointment to see a medical doctor but I’m afraid he’s just going to prescribe me some random medication and that it will be hard for me to describe what’s going on and thus do something to make all this stop. 

(Also, I do yoga, take cbd and ashwaghanda and constantly practice calming activities but it only works for a little while).

Tonight I’m pulling an all nighter with my boyfriend to help him revise for his biotechnology exam tomorrow. I study English literature so obviously I don’t understand any of it, but I’m a trained tutor so I’ve been reading it aloud to him and asking him questions and pretty much tutoring him. Now there are a LOT of scientific words and terms in his notes. Many of them are long as well. I’ve never seen these words in my entire life and I’ve been having a lot of trouble reading them and pronouncing them; some of them I just can’t read at all. This is very upsetting for me because before the past year or so I could read and spell really well (I taught myself to read at the age of three and by year three (2nd grade) I had read all of the books in my classroom and even the ones in the year six (5th grade) classroom. But now, there are so many words that I can’t even read at all and it makes me so sad and confused because my reading difficulties have only arisen during my early adulthood. I’m really anxious not knowing why I’ve developed a reading problem. I also struggle to find the right words when I’m speaking to someone, switch around letters and word order and something weird; it’s like I’m autocorrect; for example if I’m reading aloud , and there’s a word with some of the same letters as another word, I often replace the real word with a similar one. I’m really confused and frustrated and worried. I’ve also become very confused, even more forgetful than usual, and sometimes forget what someone said seconds ago. I also lose things a lot and I’ve been having loads of trouble waking up in the mornings. Can anyone help?",mentalhealth,Having Trouble Reading Suddenly?,2019-01-24 11:50:51
718,champangemami18,1548290535,1,"So, I don't want to say I have anxiety because i was never diagnosed but I do have..anxiety issues?  Everyday, I'm full with worry and fear. Its even worse when I'm exhausted or stressed out. I feel very trapped. Like I'm in a bubble full of just pent up anger, worry, fear, insecurities..all of that. Sometimes it gets to the point where I'm getting sleep paralysis. It usually occurs when I'm feeling exhausted, stressed, and I'm having anxiety all at once. It's even worse when it comes to my family. I think of the most horrible things sometimes. Like this morning while waiting for the bus, i thought, ""what if my sister got ran over?"" And it freaked me out. Sometimes random thoughts like that pop-up. My niece and nephews used to sleep in bed with me and they jerk a lot in their sleep. Sometimes i think its them having a seizure and i always check if they're still breathing. I can't sleep well unless I check constantly. I think I've always been like this, since i was younger i was always full of fear and worry. My worst fear in kindergarten was being kidnapped. But I didn't get my first panic attack until the 7th grade. It just happened out of no where. After that, i was alwaye scared of everything. Like that i may get a seizure, i may have a heart attack, etc. It gave me a lot of anxiety attacks. I still have them. My mom knows theres something wrong, this isn't normal. But she thinks i do it to myself. I have no way to cope. I hate when people recommend meditation because i can't sit still for long periods of times, it makes me feel uncomfortable. Like..my body gets all..tingly and weird. She never let me see a therapist, because shes against pills. I just wanna see one to learn coping methods or something. It sucks living like this.

I seem not to care about things that I really should. Like, it’s weird to describe. My brother had hurt himself and was screaming his ass off. My mom and dad were rushing to take care of him. But, I just didn’t care that much at the time. I just found it annoying. I love my brother and stuff but I just didn’t care.

723,userxnotxfound,1548287224,1," One of the more looked over groups of people with mental health issues I feel is those of us who suffer in silence. Typically regarded as the strong/helpful/thoughtful/happy person in the group/family. Check on your happy friends/family members. Just because we always seem happy or something along those lines, doesn't that we are ok. But it goes both ways. We may think we're strong and can handle it ourselves, but we are wrong. So if any of you who are like me ate reading this with doubts towards seeking help because you think you can fix yourself, read my story. Hopefully you will realize sooner than I did that we are weaker that we could imagine since we've built our ""strong"" foundation on the premise of helping others out. 

 
 I have always been the person that's always there for others when needed. Wether it's mentally/physically/spiritually/emotionally, I'm always the supporting brace for everyone. Luckily, I have great group of friends that have had their fair share of issues and could spot something wrong with me through a happy and confident demeanor that I always wear. They reached in and pulled me up from the relentlessly consuming pit that I had fallen into. 


 I spent 17 years walking the edge of ""the pit"", skirting my own issues and insecurities by helping others and building upon the feeling that I'd get from doing so. When it all finally caught up to me, the foundation I had built was so brittle, and I had no idea how hard it was going to crash down on me. It hit me like a wrecking ball and destroyed the confidence I thought I had built myself up on. I was lost in the swirling void of depression and suicide. Even today as I sit here after seeking professional help, my mind delves into the darkest corner and my stomach sinks. But I'm learning to turn that negative energy into positive force. 


 I don't mean to ramble on, but I just wanted to say to keep an eye on your happy friends. We aren't as happy as we lead on.

731,iwanttobelefthanded,1548281314,1,"I am going to do this as a single discussion instead of two. 

I am dealing with severe anxiety around work mostly but even every day tasks. It’s bad. I have a real hard time getting started on work and making it more than a couple hours per day before I feel absolutely exhausted. It all started after my divorce and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better, just worse. There is something about it that gives me a highly irrational “fear”. I put it in quotes because I don’t know the right word for it. Best we could describe it in therapy is a fear of failure...maybe. But I have absolute confidence in myself to do the work. It’s usually quite easy, I’ve been doing it for over 15 years. But now, when it comes time to sit at my computer, something just hits me and makes me run far, far away from it. (I work from home, self employed doing freelance work which gives me the ability to avoid work). Once I somehow do start it’s not too bad and I get stuff done. 

I came up with an analogy: Something is after me (clients, need for money, bills to pay), I don’t want to but I have to dive under water (go to work) in order to escape it but I can only swim and hold my breath for so long until I feel desperate to climb back to the surface (stop working) to gasp for air. I can make it maybe 2-3 hours at a time and usually never more than one work period per day. 

I have absolutely no idea how to get myself going to do that initial dive into the water. Once I do, I do fairly well and I know the more practice I have at it the longer I will be able to stay under water each time... but it’s late afternoon today and I still have not yet been able to dive in. I know it feels great to get something done but I still can’t get myself to do it. It took me 2 weeks to do a mobile deposit of a good sized check that was just sitting on my counter because I felt “afraid” of it. 

As for memories, I learned something new yesterday in therapy that I just didn’t know was not normal: When I recall memories I cannot recall the emotion of it. I *know* how I *likely* felt, but the actual emotion doesn’t come back with the memory. The visual memory of my daughter’s death is relatively ingrained in my head - I can *see* the hospital room, my now ex wife, the nurse, the machines, the shrill scream of my ex mother in law when they pronounced her, etc. but I have no emotional feeling in my body when I recall the memory. My therapist essentially just didn’t know how to respond. We were trying to do some EMDR around some other traumatic event (not my daughter’s death) and she kept asking me to relive my emotions and I just stared blankly at her saying I can’t do it and she stared blankly at me not understanding why not (and not in a mean way, my therapist is amazing and I credit her with me even being alive today). She asked me how far back I can recall an event with emotional feeling and I told her never - for me this is my normal and all I know. I kind of knew that people could feel the emotions from a memory but I never have been able to, it’s just how life is for me. I know I feel emotions... sometimes. I will cry at a random TV commercial for who knows what reason. But I also know I don’t have emotions during a lot of events as they happen as well though - I know I go through it in a completely logical manner just to get through it. Like the hospitalization and eventual death of my daughter I remember solely thinking about my wife at the time, doing whatever I could to console her and not thinking about myself in any way. It may be why I have a detached feeling about the whole thing or a lack of emotional memory because I was so wrapped up in someone else’s emotions I didn’t leave room/energy for my own. 

I don’t know what to make of this emotionless memory thing. I already feel overwhelmed with life as it is now and the thought of reliving past traumas and actually feeling it all sounds horrendous.

I have been hanging out with a friend I met about 2 months ago for almost every day. He is going places in life and well-liked by just about everyone. His brother is popular as well and he has a solid friend group. We are all 25, 26. 

When he first started bringing me around a lot his brother told him he could do better. His bro is considered to be the “better looking” one and gets a lot of hot females.

I say he should ask his bro (they are living together) because I have been there a lot and want to be respectful. He asks and his bro says that I don’t really match the group aesthetic or fit in basically. He doesn’t really want me around.

I love her to death, but I know she's going to get burnt out sometime sooner or later and leave. And then I'll truly be alone. What's worse is that I don't think anyone will really care. I've tried to kill myself a few times in the past, but I'm too much of a pussy to really follow through in any way. A guy like me, I really don't believe I deserve anything. I'm not a valuable member to any society/group/anything. At times it feels like maybe I will be valued, or maybe I'll make a new friend, or maybe I'll be able to finally get some fucking sleep, but none of it ever happens. I like to think that someday things will get better. That I'll eventually have a wife and kids, have a good house doing the work I have a passion for.

I've covered [mental health](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/why-millennial-men-dont-go-to-therapy) [issues](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-stigma-of-ptsd-is-keeping-veterans-unemployed) [extensively](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/going-crazy-on-the-high-seas) and am looking for some help on a story I'm working on. 

&amp;#x200B;

The story is about people who end up in the emergency room thinking they're having a physical emergency when they're actually having a mental health issue (like a panic/anxiety attack, psychosis, etc.) I've spoken to some ER directors and senior doctors who say this is a frequent occurrence, especially with men. The underlying issue seems to be the lack of access to preventative mental health measures, as well as the ways we downplay mental health symptoms in American health culture. 

I'm reaching out here for stories about how you ended up in the ER because of an unexpected mental health emergency, perhaps one you had no clue was related to mental health (this is different than going to the ER because you self-harmed, for example). Did you think you were having a heart attack? Or that you were going blind? Or just felt internal pain?

Good morning, everyone!

First off, if I'm posting in the wrong place then please let me know, I'd be glad to remove this post for any reason.

Secondly, thank you for taking the time to read this.

My name is Austin, and I'm a 19-going-on-20-year-old on the west coast. Growing up, I never felt like there was anything wrong with me in terms of my mental health, I just felt what I felt was normal. My mother her entire life has struggled with severe depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. My father, on the other hand, has only dealt with major social anxiety for as long as he can remember though he refuses to admit it. My brother and I both deal with our own forms of anxiety and depression, though he was the only one in the family that refused to be diagnosed or seen by anyone.

In October of 2016, I was diagnosed with ""major"" depression, and major social anxiety (I don't feel like my depression is major at all, but the social anxiety oh boy yeah). I was forced to undergo treatment after going through drug therapy for bringing a fat bag of weed to my high school right at the start of my junior year (so I *think* that was 2016). I talked to my appointed counselor at the weekly meetings (interestingly enough, I got put into AA classes because the teen marijuana group was full I guess) and after maybe 4 or 5 sessions she referred me to a mental health counselor barely down the road from my house at the time. I signed up and made my first appointment.

My first appointment, my mother had to be present. We sat down and talked about the normal first-day things (the uncomfortably personal questions) then he asked my mother to leave the room at my discretion. Afterward, my counselor and I spoke about my personal life and who was in it. I spoke a lot about my s/o who I was with for a little under 2 years at the time. I don't remember specifically how it went, but I remember my counselor asking me how often I masturbated in one day. To this day, I'm not sure if that's a normal question but whatever, it was so long ago.

At the next session, he diagnosed me with a couple things and explained what they were to me. I knew all that stuff because this was around when everyone wanted to have depression so I knew quite a bit about it though I didn't agree with his diagnosis of ""major depression"".

As the months went on we saw each other every Tuesday before I left to my GED classes, and we continued to talk about my personal life, as you would. He frequently told me to leave my girlfriend and cut certain people out of my life. I never agreed with any of these statements, and usually just stormed out.

My girlfriend knew I was undergoing treatment, and by the time I finished my drug counseling, I was still going to mental health counseling at my preference. She frequently told me what I was feeling was in my head, and they're just filling me with lies. I knew her intention was to help, she was just really, really bad at it. She would ***never*** do anything to intentionally hurt me without justified reasons to do so, but this still hurt. I **needed** her support and love throughout this process, and the absence of it made the whole thing that much harder.

My parents wanted to be supportive, but I was such a little rat bastard, I made it extremely hard on them to enjoy my presence. They frequently fought, and tried to divorce a couple of times throughout the 20+ years they've been together, and I've always blamed myself for their issues. I'll get back to that later.

I was considering ending treatment as I felt worse than I ever have after. I was prescribed something for the depression, anxiety, and something else (started with a C) for sleep issues. I attempted overdosing on the depression/anxiety pills, but I instead just threw up and passed out. A few weeks later, I swallowed a handful of the sleeping pills and collapsed. My brother supposedly found me and I woke up handcuffed to a bed in a hospital with my parents very angrily glaring at me. I can't even explain how disappointing it was to wake up like that after a failed attempt. I'm not sure what happened in between, but I felt fine besides a stomach ache for a few days. They took away all my pills, which I was all for. Then made me sign that paper that says I legally cannot harm myself or I can go to jail or something.

Alright, now just after I turned 18, I finally opted out of treatment and was home-free. I said I no longer need mental health assistance, and I'm ""cured"" or ""better"" or some bs I could say to get out of that place. I left, and never looked back.

Since then, I've tried offing myself a few times by going ""down the road, not across the street"", hanging myself (instead I just crushed my trachea and couldn't talk for three weeks), and almost leaping off one of our local bridges before being stopped by a good friend of mine. These were all in horrible moments, and I was incredibly happy none of them worked.

I have bad days, and I have better days. It's been a while since I had a good day, but some are better than others

But my issue is, I no longer have *days* or *moments* where I want to leave this life, it's been a constant thought in my head for months. Every day is the same, I'm no longer happy unless I'm alone, and I can't stand the presence of anybody, and it's taken a huge toll on my girlfriend. Ever since leaving my parent's house, they've been thriving and happier than I've seen them for as long as I can remember. I *knew* they would be as soon as I left, and I'm so happy I was right about that. I'm toxic, and I infect anybody close to me, and nothing I'm doing can change that, believe me, I've tried.

I have considered leaving a note explaining I'm running away and giving my car away to a stranger so I can off myself without leaving my family or s/o in grief, rather they'd be angry I left without explanation. Every day is the same, some days are harder now, but usually, it's the same feeling. I've been working out more to try and motivate myself to not only quit smoking but stay alive, though it's not helping.

I only find happiness in cigarettes, and music whether it be destroying my drum set or trying to play guitar.

I forgot where I was going with this, so I guess I'll end it here. Thanks for reading, if you did.",mentalhealth,"My story so far, being in the final chapter.",2019-01-24 07:27:49

748,chick-killing_shakes,1548272313,1,"I'll try to make this brief. 

Last August, my best friend of a decade suddenly messaged me, telling me that he was thinking of killing himself. We live about 3 hours away from each other, so after sobbing on the phone together for about half an hour, I made a panicked call to his parents (who live in my city) to tell them what was happening. They made the drive to him that afternoon, and took him straight to the doctor. He started taking medication to help him sleep, and some for depression; he was also seeing a councilor regularly.   

This all came along quite suddenly. For our entire friendship before and after high school, he was a wonderfully happy-go-lucky guy. He was in great shape and loved the outdoors... always a hard worker, and immensly talented in his chosen field. He went to festivals and socialized, always the deepest thinker in the room. 

In the past 6 months since that message, he's lost a lot of weight and his posture has deteriorated noticeably. We all convinced him to quit his job, as it was extremely obvious that it was a large part of the problem because of how resentful he was towards the line of work. He has been unemployed since (not a bad thing, he needed the time to recover), but I know things are getting to the point where he needs to go back to work. His parents offered to help him out so he could take the time he needed, but I'm not sure how long that has lasted. 

Yesterday, we chatted online while he was getting ready for an interview, and then afterwards. He looked great, and I told him to stand up straight and kick some ass. He was in relatively good spirits when he got back, and I was asking him how the interview went; he said he hit it off with the interviewer! He seemed a little confused about what the interview was for, as he had responded to an ad for a labourer. When it dawned on him that he had interviewed for a recruitment agency, I watched him go from 10-0 in a matter of minutes... not because recruitment agencies are bad, but because he didn't realise what it had been for. He started becoming super self-deprecating, and abruptly ended the conversation later because he was ""in a hole."" I told him he was doing a good job, and let him go. 

This whole thing has me wondering, am I coming across as superficial? We talk nearly every day, and I try to maintain a positive attitude. I let him talk when he wants to talk. I talk when he doesn't. I often try to remind him that his feelings are coming from an inbalance upstairs, and that his depression doesn't own him; but being someone who has never experienced depression before, am I even helping, or am I just part of the problem at this point? 

Bottom line is, I want to help him recover from this, and I'm at a loss for what to do on my end. I'd give him the world if I could.. but I'm just another young person trying to make my way. Do you have any recommendations for small things I can do to help lift him out of this?  Things I can avoid saying that could potentially make me a source of unhappiness and anxiety? Any and all guidance is welcome here.

I like to play with children's toys such as Lego, especially stuff like princess castles or plush toys. I talk to my pillows for emotional support like teddy bears.

I tried to purchase a dildo (it is quite realistic) just to see how things would pan out and I found myself holding on to it for comfort when I feel sad or depressed at night, like a symbol of strength and warmth.

Everytime I think of myself being in a relationship, this voice comes up to say 'who do you think you are, you're too young to talk about stuff like this'. But yet my domestic helper is always teasing me about why I'm so old and still hasn't been in a relationship.

753,Daretobe9721,1548263213,1,"Hey all, 

Thanks for reading this, this isn't about me it is about one of my roommates. I just don't know what I should do about it.  If i should report him or just leave him alone. Backstory. I am in college and couldn't pick my roommates this year. I have two. One of them is ok, but the other is just a little off.  Let me describe what I mean by off.  He has mood swings. If something doesn't go well, then he gets caught up in depression like really bad depression. He says he feels sad, and rambles on tangents about his family and how he wants to make them proud and stuff when he is down. But then literally an hour later he gets a good grade on an assignment and he is leaping through the roof with excitement and saying how awesome he is and how he is one of the best students here, even though he hadn't read the book or studied or anything.  I think he has bipolar disorder. I have tried to ignore this part of him, but has he other things that make me worry. He smokes, juuls and dips like crazy. He went through an entire pack of juul pods in one day once. Since I do not using tobacco I don't know what that means, but my other roommate who does says it is to much. All he does is sleep, eat, goes to class (we are forced to) and uses tobacco products and plays a crazy amount of video games.  My other roommate is not as concerned about him because they play the same type of games. I am not a huge gamer.  Other things he does. He gets worked up about the smallest things. He couldn't get the teacher he wanted and he flipped out for a week, ranting on and on about everything that has happened to him until he got the class he wanted and then he acted totally normal and like he wasn't ranting to us about the class. He sleep talks, stays up until 2 or 3am playing video games and then freaking out the next day when he has homework due. He never checks his emails and relies on us to tell him when we have something we have to do or somewhere to be. He goes around bumming juul pods off people when he is out and when we tell him he should go to the store (which is a  walk away) to get some because its cheaper.  (he pays 45 dollars for juul pods here when he could get them for 30 at the store)  he flips out and rants.  We All do rotc, different Rotcs but still rotc, he tells us how he wants to have all these leadership positions and how everyone loves him and how he is the most intense person in his platoon. He wants to have a spot that involves a lot of planning, teaching and spending alot of time with the first year students next year, and supposedly he says that others have told him he would be good at it. When all I see is that he lays around in his bed and sleeps and plays video games and never works out and despite him saying he is good at planning how is it that he can't seem to submit his assignments on time? He also switches his story around constantly.  We ask how our grades are all the time earlier in the morning he said he had Cs but then he said he had Bs and As later that day.  I ask him about this and he said aww no I never said that I had C's, even though my other roommate was there and heard him as well. Whats more concerning about this is that we have an honor code and lying could get him kicked out of school.  I try to listen to him and his point of view and what he thinks but he just has screwed logic and doesn't seem to understand simple things. he says he doesn't believe in politics but he is an is major. We asked why he is an IS major then and he said so he could proof other people wrong.  he is enlisted in the national guard, which i don't get how, unless he puts on a show of being smart for other people.  He believes in aliens, and angels coming down to earth as aliens.  He thinks one of our instructors is an angel because he told him that God believes in him, even though my other roommate said he does that stuff all the time. But this roommate refuses to believe him.  We are a smallish school and we are really supportive of our other classmates. For example this roommate (who is on the poorer side) wasn't going top be able to come back this semester because of money. All of us chipped in and helped pay for his way to get back here. He takes that to mean everyone loves him.  However, he didn't help another one of our classmates with the same issue because he didn't have enough money, even though he spends money on pizza every night and juul pods.  Which the fundraiser wasn't asking for much, like $5 a person.  He also continually says he is going to quite juuling and he stops for a day and then goes right back too it. Which i wouldn't mind  but he then says that he quit. He also says that he does stuff and accomplished it when he just signed up for it. We ran a 5k and he says he completed in even though he just signed up for the race and stayed in bed.  He also says he has heart attacks from drinking to much coffee. I think he says this just for attention because i am a lifeguard and know the signs of a heart attack.  All he said he felt was tingling in his foot and dizzy. Which isn't a sign of a heart attack, I told him this and he started yelling at me.  He has done this twice.  He also believes in conspiracy theories, he goes on about the big triangle (No clue what that is) and the illuminati. He said he was joining the illuminati by applying on a website, which looked like a scam.  Both my roommates told him this because you had to pay money to join but he totally ignored our reasoning.  And then gets pissed off when he doesn't have money to buy stuff. I just don't know what to do. And how he got into stuff like the army without people realizing all these issues he has. Is he just really good at hiding things? Is he playing stupid? What? I try to get to know him but he never likes talking about himself or what he wants to do. He is very anti social except for with the people that no one really likes. He doesn't care about anything (even though he says he does) and I am starting to get fed up with it. I can't stay up every night until 2 ( I am a light sleeper) to him playing video games, and I have asked him to stop and he says he is going to stop certain things but he never does.  He has said his mother was put in an asylum, even though he says she isn't crazy. even though he believes he is the product of some super soldier program with the CIA. and that is mother tried to rat the program out and that is why she was put in the asylum.  He hasn't talked about killing himself yet. What should I do?   Thank you so much.",mentalhealth,Need advice,2019-01-24 04:06:53

I don’t understand why he likes/loves me because I haven’t added anything positive or negative to his life and honestly everywhere I go I seem to find someone that has a fiery hate towards me when I don’t know what I’ve done. He’s so sweet and honestly amazing but I can’t understand why he sticks around with me. He’s said that this is more than a short thing (when I asked him) and he is even making ideas 5-7 months in the future (like “oo do you want to see this movie that comes out in may”) when there’s no guarantee we will still be together. 

I am terrified that he will begin to resent me just like everyone else. How does he know his feelings won’t change like he’s said? Wouldn’t he just be better without me? How does he know he has feelings for me in general? Why, even?

I want to be “normal” and believe in “love” and that it’s possible for someone to have those feelings for me but I don’t even like myself that much so how can someone else?

I’m not sure how coherent this post is or if I’ve gotten my point across. Re-reading it it just sounds like I’m lazy and complaining for no reason but these things are slowly overtaking any functionality and I don’t know what to do and I have no one that I can talk to without fear of ruining the relationship. 

I also don’t like to talk about any of this head stuff because there’s always someone out there having more issues than me so I don’t really have a place to say anything about my trivial issues. But today I’m letting go to see if I’m just being a lazy person and need to get over myself or that something is wrong. ",mentalhealth,I have energy but I don’t do anything,2019-01-24 02:07:54

I've recently started dating someone exclusively, but I can't help but assume the worse or analyze every possibly negative comment made against me. This has been hell on my friendships; it's starved a good deal of them. It's part of the reason I've re-entered therapy.

I'm furloughed and have time now to reflect how I'm not happy in my career.

I've got full-on anhedonia. My only real hobby is the gym, and that's sometimes only out of a sense of obligation.

I'm just, tired. I don't know how to explain it other than that. Physically, yes, but it goes beyond that. I'd go so far as to say I've thought of suicide, even if only passively, daily since last summer. Yes I've called hotlines, with disappointing results.

I tried the 2nd CSB in my area. It's a city/county split deal, so basically I have access to 2 of everything. This place is bigger and on the phone yesterday they said ""assessments are from 8:30 to 11 but you won't see a doctor the same day."" Idc because same day assessment = better than what I've had so far.
Well I showed up about 9. Was told it's a 3 hour wait 1 hour assessment. I tried not to cry and to not be a jerk, told the lady ""uh I kinda had somewhere to be"" and slunk back on the elevator.
I have work at 1:30 and I'm terrified of not being perfect, so even being less than 3 minutes early makes me feel awful. Perfectionism has set in heavily. My eating disorder has gotten bad again too. And it's showing. A coworker is super mad with me because he thinks I'm being mean to him, but I just need a whole lot more space than he's giving me right now. So work - the one place I feel decent - is becoming hell.

So now I'm at work 4 hours early debating whether to go in and ask if it's ok to show up whenever today, or if I can call out. Or what they think I should do. I called out in October of 2017 and I really hate to do it again so soon. I don't think they can find anyone on such short notice. I know company policy is to do it 3+ hours before start of shift, but still, I feel awful considering it. And too awful to work.

I actively tried finding support throughout most of last year due to the loss of a friend, and an extreme amount of support from my partner. 

I went to a few therapy sessions within my University, and was put on different SSRI's. The therapy was great, the medication not so much. I ended up dropping out of University and getting an apprenticeship in a field that I am passionate about and have made a massive improvement from this time last year.

That being said, I am still suffering from a lot of anxiety / depression on a day to day basis and really struggle to manage my emotions in a normal way. I snap way too quickly, and the smallest of things can ruin my day. This can really affect the relationships with the people around me who mean the most.

I am now stuck on what to do, I can go back to the doctors but will more than likely be prescribed another SSRI and be told the waiting time for therapy is 2 years (UK). I understand that my GP isn't going to be the miracle that changes my life around. That is down to me, but I don't know how.

774,chimera1432,1548244188,1,"I've been dealing with anxious anger for probably as long as I can remember. I have anxiety and a sprinkling of depression so whenever this comes up the after effects are usually pretty severe too. I feel as if this comes from having your sense of pride and superiority challenged by others. I've seen this in myself quite frequently where someone will show me something that they are proud of but is also part of something I myself have pride in (which is very rare that I do). This leads to a slew of critical feedback and nitpicking which can make the other person feel bad and that in turn makes me feel worse. It's not something I can control, easily anyways, and it feels like I just blurt it out without really thinking about the other person. Say for example, a friend shows me an art piece that they are really proud of and challenges my perception of superiority. I would begin to unrelentingly critique and point out what's wrong with it and what could be better. Now that can be seen as a good thing but in the end it just leads to the other person feeling sad or offended. The reason I call this anger is because it deeply irks me internally when it happens like someone just insulted me and my brain processes it by trying to make itself perceive it as worse than it actually is. This ends up making me seem to look rather egotistical which is not the case. In fact, I would say that being as such would be a marginal improvement over my current mental state. I feel as if this is some sort of defense mechanism to protect myself from lowering my self-esteem anymore than it already is. Learning to accept that people are not out to hurt me is definitely a trial in it of itself and a difficult but necessary step towards better mental health. Hopefully I was able to shed some light on the situation for those who might be struggling with something similar and are confused as to why they feel that way.

I know that I got sad when i was little but I don't remember being really sad past that. Sad things have happened to me ( nothing big like the death of a loved one though) but when they happen I kinda just go ""oh, ok, what now"" and continue on. I don't want to state my exact age but I am in the teens though this has been something I have noted for a long time (pre-teenage years) and I have been wanting to know if it is abnormal in any way.

As a side note (though it may be useful) I don't really react when others hurt themselves. In primary school I would see people, especially younger people, get hurt all the time and while everyone else fussed over them I would simply watch it and not really get what all the fuss really is.

786,brokenmindfulness,1548227073,1,"I’ve been trying to update a log of my journey lately with my mental health. I have two other posts if anybody is interested in week 1 &amp; 2. Each week has been really eye-opening and, thankfully, they’ve also been going in the right direction... I think this week has been the most intense, hands-down.

I didn’t have any of my groups or appointments because the office I visit closed for a week, but after doing some very major self reflecting I realized what a lot of my problem is. Turns out; I’m an asshole. No way around it, that’s just the honest truth of it and it took me 29 years to really figure it out — ha! Not what I was expecting but it sure does explain a lot. 

I’ve fought with depressive issues for as long as I can think back to, except maybe when I was a young kid. Otherwise, I remember always being so combative, headstrong, ready to stand up for myself and fight anyone who seemed like they wanted to fight with me. I have my reasons; I mean, *I have so many reasons...* Brothers and sisters, I have a list as long as my arm that I’ve been adding to, editing, and defending for years now. **It’s become who I am.**

I’ve always been *this* girl: the one who suffers, the one who’s plagued by life, the one who’s sad, who’s the victim of abuse, so lost and so lonely... I believed it. I subscribed to it. I stayed so stuck and petrified by it... but I also said it on day 2 of week 1 of this new journey: I *will* take my damn life back from all of this, and to really open my eyes to how I’ve been living my life so far really shook me. I can’t think of a single excuse for why I should have ever let myself get this far down when, all along, I thought I had all of them.

This is why: *I’m* the girl who was raped. *I’m* the girl who was abandoned by an alcoholic father. *I’m* the girl who was let down by an emotionally abused mother and later abandoned. *I’m* the girl who was suicidal, who picked abusive relationship after abusive relationship. I’m the girl whose breakup was so tragic it made the newspaper in every major city in Oregon. *I’m* the girl who has this list of 5 different diagnoses that nobody can seem to sort out... I have so many tragic, stupid stories about being homeless, losing my whole family over circumstances I *still* don’t understand. That’s me, this hot freaking mess that screwed away my 20s on nothing but depressing, heartbreaking crap and never stopped to wonder why it kept happening to me.

Now I see it. There were so many things in my life that, yes, were out of my control. There were so many more things that were. There were so many times I could have prevented my life from going the way it did and now the only options I’ve let myself (allowed myself) to have were destructive, inexcusable, and so far below what I deserved. **I have been so stuck in this rhythm of believing that life is only out to destroy me that I never thought for a second that I could change it and watch it grow into something better.**

In the meantime, anyone who’s gotten close to me has been pushed away. I’ve tested them, held them away at arm’s length because *god forbid I let them love me*, and I’ve cut them off the first time they do anything even remotely human because **I’m afraid.** I’m afraid of the world and I’m afraid of myself. 

On top of this, all I think about and talk about is the negative crap. *”When I was only X years old, this happened... then guess what? *This* happened too! You think you have it bad? You don’t know anything about *this*!” Who in their right mind wants to replay all of this with me, nonstop, like a 2 year old watches their favorite Disney movie 5x a day? Better yet, **why the hell would I let myself live that way??**

This is tragic. This has turned me into somebody who is always angry. This has made me somebody who is always sad. I’ve done abusive things to my loved ones and validated every second of it. I do have legitimate issues with the way my brain is able to operate day to day, but it’s not 90% imbalances and 10% me. It’s more 30-40% depression or PTSD or AD(H?)D and the rest is all yours-truly. *I’m* the girl who refused to get real with herself. 

After I started to open up to this new, radical idea (about Wed or Thurs of last week), things intensified a lot. Depression got worse, anxiety got worse. I kept replaying every asshole thing I’d done but hadn’t seen before the same way. It was like I was on a bad trip. 

Then it hit me: I *am* that damn girl. I freaking survived. I survived all of it. I still stand straight. I still have a massive, loving heart. I educated myself, I beat the freaking odds, I created a family of my own, I did things in my very short 29 years that almost *nobody* I know has been able to relate to, whether for better or worse. I survived divorce. I survived an eating disorder. I survived addiction and holding a sign up on the street, asking strangers for change (then started asking *myself* for change). I did it without my mom, without my dad, without my brother. I’ve been lied to, betrayed, literally spit on, and **I am still here, still trying, getting better every day.** 

Nobody will *ever* be able to love me the way that I love me. Not because I don’t deserve that love from others and not because they aren’t capable of giving it to me. Because I am the *only* one who has seen my story, from start to finish, and has seen every single step of the way that I fought to **live** even when I felt there was no point. I am so proud of myself. I love the mother that I am, I love the partner that I am. I love the strong ass woman that **I am**. 

Shenriyu Suzuki has a quote: “You are perfect just the way you are, and there is still room for improvement.” 

I will become a better person every day. If today I can look at my mistakes and see them for what they are, and tomorrow I can make a life I deserve and love, then I’m just fine. My legs still work, my heart still works, my head is kinda funny but it’s filled with thoughts and ideas that are truly worthwhile and unique to me. 

I **am** taking my damn life back. For what it’s worth, the answer has been right in front of me and I never believed it. I deserve happiness and I deserve rest. I deserve answers. I deserve to believe that I’m beautiful and strong, caring, compassionate, and one fine cook if I do say so myself. I deserve love, and I really owe it to myself **to love myself**.  This is my life — my one, precious life. **I will continue to survive, and I’ll do it with a smile on my face because I deserve it.**

I’m a student in a mental health counseling program which makes me feel even more useless that I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

My possible symptoms:

I assume everyone hates me/don’t want me around so I don’t even try to make friends. I generally do things alone &amp; only have one really close friend, my best friend of 3 years.

I get random mood swings from time to time so one second I’ll be fine &amp; the next I’ll feel really down about myself. I thought it was depression for a while but my symptoms to last long enough for it to be that.

I can get incredibly irritable &amp; angry at the tiniest things like a customer leaving their dirty cups at the table instead of throwing them away.

I have a very tumultuous relationship with my mom, who I suspect has a personality disorder. She lashes out at me a lot &amp; calls me names only to cry &amp; play the victim when I call her out.

I have anxiety that I take medication (hydroxyzine 25 mg) for.

I dissociate from time to time. It mainly happens when I’m driving (which is terrifying) or when I’m about to take a picture of myself. It occurs randomly sometimes too, most times when I’m class.

I feel like I don’t deserve any kind of happiness in my life. If something bad happens, it’s because I deserve it.

I have been diagnosed with PTSD by my psychiatrist of over a year. The reason for this diagnosis stems from my early childhood and young adult experiences with my mother. My mother left my father almost sporadically days before my eighth birthday around 2am. She grabbed my dog and I and left in the middle of the night for her mother’s house (my grandma). Shortly after arriving, a man entered my grandmother’s house and introduced himself to eight year old me. This man would turn out to be my mother’s future husband (keep in mind that he arrived at my grandmothers house at 3am the night of my mother leaving with me). Flashing forward an unknown amount later, my dog was put on antidepressant medication, which seemed to stem from the dramatic way my mother dragged us out of the house (with a police officer outside and in a hurry). In my later elementary, middle, and high school years my mother took her husband to every school event that I was in, which i did not want to happen. I did not want this to happen because I already have a dad. Also, my dad lost tens of thousands of dollars in divorce court with my mother, just to get half custody with me, and had his name besmirched around town which made finding clients for work nearly impossible, reducing him to half of what he earned prior. Additionally, my family found a hidden journal from my mother detailing her plans to take the house my dad made for us and move in with her new husband, which I think hurt my dad deeply causing even greater anger towards my mother and her husband. With this in mind, I did not want my mother’s husband to attend my school functions, mainly choir, because of what seemed like too many shady things piling up to give any glimpse of credibility towards the accusations my mother always threw at me about my dad. In high school, my mother would take me to school and pick me up on assigned custody dates. In the morning she would be almost to happy, but depressive level sad or angry when picking me up. During my sophomore year, I reached a breaking point. My mother leaned over to me in the car and told me “I don’t care what you think, I’m taking my husband to you’re school events and graduation.” When at home I grabbed all my things and threw them in a big plastic bag to take to my dads. He told me that I should give my mother another chance so I don’t regret it for the rest of my life. So I did. She seemed to change for a while, but ultimately reverted back to her old attitudes. I left a second time for a separate reason involving nasty communication between the three, but my mother called me and said that if I didn’t come back she would call the cops and get me back. To save my dad the possibilities of court for this reason, I went back home to my mother’s. I actually walked out about six months after my eighteenth birthday when I became a legal adult since my dad was stuck paying for everything, while my mother and her husband barely contributed, even though they made $200,000 annually. The last straw came when she refused to help contribute to my college education, leaving my dad to accrue all the debt and hardships associated. I talked to her on and off after leaving and tried to get her to help with school, but she hung up on me on the phone, angered that I would discuss that topic. I told her that I didn’t want to see her and chose to live with my dad permanently. She called one day through a no caller ID, and her first words to me were of anger. Additionally, she did not seem to wince at all when I told her that I was having heart surgery for a condition that I had no prior idea I was born with. Instead she just replied, “oh yeah, well I may have cancer,” without acknowledging anything I said about my surgery. I ran into my mother’s husband’s daughter one day at the mall and said hello to be civil, but she acted like I was not there and shunned me. Within this whole nightmare, I felt stuck trying to keep the peace between my mother and father, since I had the naive attitude that parents deserve undying respect.

I worked through the anxiety that was caused by trying to maintain the peace, but I am still deeply affected with persistent thoughts. Of these thoughts, I feel like a terrible son because I left my mother and the idea is constantly in my mind that she is suffering and could die alone without me. It’s a double edged sword, where I’m damned if I go back and damned if I hold my ground.

I’m a pretty strong guy so I know I will ultimately be fine, but if any of you have experienced something similar or have any words of advice, it would be of great utility to me and I would appreciate it.

Using a throwaway account, so here goes nothing.

I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. , a senior in an extremely small high school, and I can tell that the light at the end of the tunnel is almost there, but I just don’t know how to keep going.

Growing up my parents would fight for hours and my two siblings were fairly older than me so we didn’t really talk about it much, leading to me locking myself in my room a lot. I never really socialized until freshman year, and I feel that my social skills have taken MAJOR hits from that. For example, I am in my school’s One Act Play, and I am in a scene where I have to act like I’m romantically holding this girl, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I don’t know why, but the thought of touching someone else gets me super anxious. So when I get anxious from not touching someone or saying the wrong thing I take it super hard and feel bad, thus repeating the loop. Sometimes I feel like I’m not even human, or I should even try.

My dream at the beginning of this year was to attend my dream college (won’t name it), which requires a fitness test. I trained all summer, but now that my heart murmur is being questioned I can’t stop thinking they will reject me. This has also caused stress and (I’m pretty sure) caused high blood pressure.

Financially I know my family can’t pay for college, so this dream school is about the only way to make it work. I scored a 33 on the ACT, but physically I am weak. I’m afraid of failing my family. I held three jobs at once during the summer to support myself and not use my family’s money, but now due to the amount of school activities I’m in I had to quit. My dad splits some of his income into a private account so we have issues paying bills with what’s left, and my mother has medical issues that make me scared to leave her alone for fear of her passing out or falling. 
My family has also had extreme bad luck with cars, as my first car died within a year of being bought. I have since gone through 4 cars in the course of roughly 8 months.

School ends in 4 months, but with baseball, 5 academic events, 2 artistic events and no job I feel burnt out, sad, and basically worthless. I have to do all these activities to look good for the dream school, but also have to drain what precious money we have left because I don’t have a job. 

I don’t have any close friends I can talk to, don’t have any romantic feelings for anyone, and just feel like I shouldn’t really exist. I feel like I am floating, unable to change anything even though I HAVE to change something to get to that light at the end of the tunnel. I’m not suicidal or anything, I’m just tired, sad, and I don’t know what to do. I feel like what constitutes “me” is a bunch of actions, not a real personality. 

TL;DR
I feel like a major fuckup because I can’t do basic human interaction right, probably overburdened myself (but can’t escape it), worry constantly about my parents, whether it be their health or spending money, and I’m just tired. My brain is numb and I don’t know why I act the way I do. Maybe I’ve got a mental illness or need some therapy.  I just don’t know.",mentalhealth,I don’t know what to do.,2019-01-23 15:26:14

I've struggled with this feeling of not fitting in anywhere for basically my entire life. As a kid, surrounded by loving family, I felt wrong. Like I wasn't supposed to be with this family. Like they were a bunch of happy ducks and I was a happy chicken. Among friends I feel like the odd one out. Even when we're having fun I tend to ruminate on  why they would spend time with me. At work or school, I feel entirely out of place. The most messed up part, in my mind, is that I feel the very same about my twin. Like I don't even belong with the one person who has shared every step of life with me, is my closest ally and loves me to death. Even with her I feel this sense of ""wrongness"". My husband is in the same category as everyone else. Not even with him do I gain a sense of true belonging, and he knows me very well. 

I don't know why I feel this way but it makes everything so incredibly difficult. Life is just painful. Always has been. When I was young, I used to stare up at the night sky and just have this sense of knowing that I didn't even belong on this planet. I wondered where ""my people"" were and if I even had any. Were they coming to get me one day? Would I fit in with them there and gain a sense of belonging? Would I feel the same there as here? I had childhood fantasies about how great it would be when they finally came, when I would feel like I clicked in with society. Like I belonged somewhere, truly. 

Does this pattern of thinking have a name or a cause? I want to fix it, so I can stop thinking so much and just enjoy life. I often wonder about death and why I didn't just die as an infant. My sister and I were preemie babies and technically died after birth and had many, many years of intense medical care. I wish I had just simply ceased existing at birth.

817,Hardy326,1548210344,1,"Hey,everyone, I’ve been on this page for a few days now and would like to tell my story. My reason for this is that if I do, maybe it can help some one else out their.  I’ll be honest, I am super nervous about it, but I hope someone may find some help in it. When I was about 7 years old, I had a great uncle, who was “the fun uncle” get hospitalized. This is believed to be where my anxiety had begun. I was put on medication at the age of 9 and shortly after I turned 10, he passed away. This being my first real loss, I didn’t know how to react, especially when I was taught that the men of the house weren’t supposed to cry or get emotional. (I had misinterpreted what was meant as a be a big boy situation.) My 6th grade school year things got so bad that the school had released me for threatening my own life. As the years went by I continued to try and cope on my own. (I had stopped seeing my psychiatrist in the summer between 5th and 6th grades.) In the summer between 8th and 9th grade, I finally met my Grandfather on my mom’s side of the family and around Christmas time my 10th grade year, he passed away. I remember the last phone call I ever had with him. He had called me while I was at Lunch, and he was drunk. (That was common for him,unfortunately). I told him that when I got home I would call him back, he passed away a few hours after that phone call. I still regret it, but at least I got to tell him I loved him. The rest of my school years would pass, I would graduate, and get a job at a local grocery store. I would pour a lot into this job. So now I lived with my Mom, My dad, and my Grandma on my dad’s side. She was in bad health when we moved her in in February 2017, and I loved her to death, but like with anyone who you live with, we butted heads. So one day at work, I get a call that she had been put in the hospital after collapsing. In the mindset I was in, I thought I would go visit on one of my days off, the next one being that upcoming Tuesday. I got a call at 9:48 that Sunday night telling me she had passed away. So in April of 2018, as a result of her passing , I had a major panic attack. I also contemplated suicide that night as well. About 6 hours after that attack, I went into work on Monday. Things were different though. I felt nothing and I Chalked it up to the grieving process, however we got to July and I dealt with these Anxiety attacks and Depressive times even though the grieving process had ended. In late July, I went back to my old psychiatrist and was diagnosed with GAD and Severe Depression. I thought my life was basically over. I took the meds I was prescribed,and for a good little while, they helped. Then my psychiatrist retired in October. So I was left in a bad place mentally, where would I go from here? So I went to a therapist and since I started seeing him, things have been very back and forth with this battle, but then about a few nights ago, when things were getting pretty bad,I found this place, I found a place where my experiences in dealing with what I have dealt with for a majority of my life can be used to try and make someone feel better and help them in their times of need. 

All of this to say, I love each and every one of you. I hope all goes well for you all, I will keep all you in my thoughts and I hope that maybe, if we keep pushing forward through everything we each have to face, that we can all see a brighter tomorrow.

IMPORTANT: I am not currently in danger of hurting myself and i have the suicide prevention number in my phone. I AM however always contemplating killing myself to free myself from this constant health related anxiety. 

I am a 26 year old american guy, no health insurance. 

For the past 8 years now Ive been battling some absolutely crippling health anxiety. After almost dying doing some drugs in college I really shouldnt have (K2/spice), I have been in constant fear that I am dying for one reason or another ever since.

 Ive convinced myself I had heart failure and had multiple echos, EKGs, ultrasounds, etc of my heart done, all clear. The stress from all of that caused me to develop migraines really badly within the first year. Those migraines caused me to convince myself I had an aneurysm or meningitis, so I had CT Scans, MRIs, angeograms, a spinal tap, all came back clear and I was told it is just migraines. This has been going on for years and this past summer I spent a month in an inpatient facility for actually trying to kill myself over it.

Now, after recently reading about a brain eating amoeba killing a woman in seattle for using a neti pot, ive been sleepless and at a 12/10 on the anxiety scale convinced Ive got only a week left to live. 

I'm at the end of my rope, I dont know how to stop feeling this way all the time. I have constant panic attacks, I spend a lot of my days crying and I am just so paralyzing AFRAID that I'm dying I can hardly function.

I barely moved out of my bed for two days. I literally didn’t change my clothes for two days. I haven’t cleaned my apartment in WEEKS and i have two friends coming over tomorrow.

So instead of looking for a psychiatrist that could see me sooner, I waited. Now I’m suffering. My psychologist appointment was scheduled in December and it’s not until March.

I have never excelled in school. Im smart enough to do so, and generally need to pay minimal attention in class to complete my work, yet my grades have been poor all my life. Its something that makes me very upset because my ability is not holding me back.

Lately however I have felt like shit and my grades have dropped into mostly failing range. My entire family expects me to go to college, and at this point im not sure if id even be accepted to any.

Here is my actual problem though, recently my brain had just felt off. Ive always had some anxiety but never to the point where my I worry about everything, overthink everything, EVERYTHING. My head has also just felt foggy and down. In the past few months Ive had a really bad habit with weed. Im not dependent on it, but very regularly use it, and im starting to realize how much its affecting me.

In the morning, i have recently struggled to get out of bed to go to school. Frequently I would skip days after not doing an assignment to try to do it at home to get it done 'on time' but I never end up doing anything. I have no discipline or motivation nor no how to build it effectively.

My dad divorced my mom a while ago, and their relationship is poor but could be worse. I have little to no relationship with my dad, often we dont speak more than hello to each other. He has some undisclosed mental problem that he has never talked to me about. (It could be nothing, but he is very antisocial, and has said to me that he has ""something wrong with him"")

My mom and I are much closer, but with all this stress I have been taking my anger out on her. She isnt very strict at all, and doesnt beat my ass like she should if I get frustrated and raise my voice or something. I feel really bad about treating her like this, but I continue to do it. Its not something she seems to care much about but I worry about our relationship in the future.

Im in high school, dont do shit with my life, so any advice given will probably be taken. Thank you if you bothered to read this. Im just lost and need a point in whatever direction is right. Mabye this is just snowball anxiety and im fine and normal, or mabye my brains just fried.

When I was 13 my IT teacher told us as a class that we could be living in the matrix. This had one of the worst affects anything has ever had on me. That night I was sat around the TV with my family when I felt a deep cold sweat, a sickness and light headed. I ran upstairs and that’s the first time I felt depersonalisation. 

I had crazy thoughts about my family being aliens and wanting to kill me. I kept my window open every night for a quick escape. Even at school I would skip lessons and go home. Home wasn’t even safe. The worst part was the constant feeling of deep anxiety. It made me suicidal. 

Everyone thought I was attention seeking and when I would get really bad they would say “not this again”

she wants me to do law, while i want to do something else. she tells me that what i want to study isn't a professional course and no one's gonna take me seriously and finding a job is gonna be difficult.

(keep in mind, she studied law)

she also told me i'm scared of it, which is essentially what upset me. the fact that a particular course doesn't appeal to me makes me scared of it. when i tried to tell her this, that's just what she keeps telling me. so i go into the kitchen to cool down, which is very difficult because i'm already in tears.

she calls my aunt, one of my favorite people in the world, who is also a lawyer. by now, im trembling. before my aunt can even finish a sentence, i scream. it just comes out, and is probably the loudest noise ive ever made. i run upstairs still screaming, practically clawing at my hair. and then i enter the bedroom and lay on the bed, and then proceed to have the most horrific five minutes of my life.

it's almost impossible to breathe. i can actually FEEL my heart beating against my chest. i'm literally convulsing on the bed.

worst part is, she is NOT concerned. i hear her downstairs, telling my aunt not to worry. she quite literally said, 'don't mind her, she's just upstairs screaming'.

ive calmed down by now, and i decide to go take a walk. so i put on a bra, grab my phone and head downstairs. the moment i reach the door, she explodes on me, telling me that i was stupid and spoiled, and that it was by the grace of God that she wasn't going completely crazy on me. then she tells me to go upstairs.

now she's treating me like i'm the most disgusting person on the planet. im actually too scared to go downstairs to have dinner.

847,cjbravo1,1548185277,1,"  

I’m starting to feel burnt out. I’m recently engaged to my girlfriend of 5+ years, just bought a house, and started a new job. And yet I feel unmotivated, frustrated, and burnt out. 

Recently I started thinking about how my life felt better before I started college, even though, in truth, it wasn’t that great. I often felt depressed. I didn’t have many close friends in school, and I often felt like I was different than everyone around me when it came to activities, hobbies, interest, etc. Looking back, I don’t seem to focus on this, but instead think of all the good times I’ve had with the friends that I did have. I think of how I had a little bit of a social life during the end of high school, and that it was the people in high school itself that I didn’t get along with. People called my friends acted friendly but turned their attention elsewhere as soon as they could. I didn’t know what it meant to be a friend. 

God this is stupid, I’m sorry that I’m just ranting and making no sense. I feel like I need to put my thoughts on paper. I’m not even looking at the screen, just typing as best as I can. 

Anyway, after high school I started college. It felt like a fresh start in life, and I could re-create myself and meet new people. I enjoyed making new friends and eventually getting involved in theater, but I felt unmotivated in all my classes. As if I didn’t care about the subjects and didn’t care about the work, I was putting into it. It was just “something I had to do”. Friendships were more important, and school work just sucked. 

At one point I toured the U of M with my younger brother. It was his intent to go there after high school, and me not so sure as to what I wanted for my future decided to tag along. I remember walking around the campus and feeling an incredible sense of motivation. A feeling of “I can do this” and “I can succeed here”. There seemed to be a feeling of comradery, which I didn’t feel at the time at the community college. My younger brother went onto the U of M, but I did not. I haven’t felt that sense of motivation or comradery sense then, and I don’t know where to find it. 

I remember taking walks around the campus since my train ride went through there anyway, and I felt like I needed to think things through. I remember yelling at myself internally, hating myself for not “being successful” and feeling like a failure. These thoughts and feelings would follow me for the next 4 years after college, and my feelings of self-hate and unmotivation made work life and social life very difficult. Many times, I would get into fights with my girlfriend over…anything. Most of the time wishing we would break up so I could find my own path and ambitions. 

Initially after college I wanted to move to Seattle or California. TO be in warmer weather, be right in the tech industry, own and drive an old car daily.  Pipe dreams I know, but something that seemed like fun to me. 

I always have this thought / idea that I must succeed in all my ambitions before I turn 26. (no special reason, just an age that I came up with years ago). I always felt jealous of my younger siblings, who got to do the things I never could growing up. They got involved in sports, but my parents kept me out, saying that I couldn’t handle playing with a group of other kids. I was a hyper kid, and was always finding ways to get into trouble, but even still, the feeling of jealousy was always there.   
 Both my younger brothers got involved in band, and other extra activities outside of school, where I did not. I always felt like I wouldn’t fit in and felt like everyone would not accept me. This made getting involved in college VERY difficult, as I didn’t know how to interact with others, and always felt shy and anxious about everything. Talking to others in a small talk way wasn’t always too difficult but getting involved with others was the problem.

I hate this feeling of constant accomplishment. I hate this feeling that I’m doing the wrong things with my life, and I’m failing where I need to. I make a healthy amount of money to sustain a house, car, and life with my fiance, so why don’t I feel as though there’s something I’m missing, or there’s something wrong with my life.

As of lately, things seem like they’ve just completely shifted. I can’t even put a finger on exactly when I think it happened, which is frustrating. It’s hard to even put my feelings into words.

853,wtfishappening12345,1548183049,1,"[throwaway account for obvious reasons] 
I think I might start having serious problems if I don't get this under control. I'll start at the beginning:
I've been having a pretty hard time the last five to six months since I realised that the subject I'm in university for is not what I want to study. It's not the field I want to work in later. It's just not the right thing for me. So I started looking for alternatives, which was pretty good in the beginning because I had the opportunity to find things I like, I was hopeful because from now on, everything will get better. Well it didn't. 

Since I want to start working something related to design, illustration or animation and the job market in my country is pretty small in that field, I'm having trouble finding anything. I've applied for apprenticeships, for universities and for dual studies (all of them very hard to achieve, some need whole portfolios with over 20 artworks which have to be especially creative and well done and not generic and bla bla bla), so I basically worked my ass off to get anything done but my parents, who I'm financially dependent on, don't think that's enough. They're threatening to cut off the money they're sending to me, saying if I don't have a job or university until march (which is absolutely impossible), I'll have to get my own money and see how I'll make a living. It's pretty hard to earn a decent amount of money without an education here and I still have to afford the education that is yet to come for me so the whole thing is pretty devastating.
But not only have my parents lost trust in my capabilities, so have I. I'm scared that I won't get accepted in any of those companies I have applied for, I'm scared that I will have to work as a cashier or waitress for the rest of my life (not saying it's not a respectable job, it's just not for me and it's pretty much the only thing one can do without an education here) just because I'm not good enough to achieve what I wanted to achieve. 

Into the bargain, I got fired from my job as a waitress because apparently some people from my team didn't like my personality. I don't know what I did wrong, nobody wanted to tell me either, I was doing my best all the time I've been working for them to be nice polite and a decent person... I have some history with bullying in school and I feel like I'm just thrown back into that time where for no particular reason, nobody liked me.

Now with all this coming together, I feel like I'm stuck with a serial killer that is myself. I constantly feel the urge of cutting my wrists, hurting myself, like I did back in school. I constantly feel like I want to be dead, just non-existant but I'm afraid to die and I'm afraid that urge will someday drive me into suicide. I don't want that. I have a loving boyfriend, whom I love with all my heart, I have amazing friends whom I'd never want to lose, so I don't want to do this to them. I have a great sister who is so supportive and a tiny little niece whom I loved from the first moment on.
But nevertheless, even though I'm aware of all the good things around me, I feel like there's no place on this earth for me... 

Now my question: how do I keep going? How do I keep myself from having those thoughts and urges? How do I get out of this hole of insecurity?

I do have an older sibling who has moved out,but he has his family,wife,kids,almost died from a flesh-eating  bug before he even got married,so he has had his problems recently.For  some reason it has always felt like my responsibility to help my parents,they have always told me not to put my life on hold for them.  


But that is easier said then done,since my dad become ill in 2007 with MS that's pretty much exactly what I  have done,once he could no longer drive,no longer do things in the  house DIY,take my mother to hospital appointments,it all fell on me to  take over the mantle,my brother went off to live his life,had a load of  relationships eventually got married with kids.  


We  do have carers coming in for my dad,but they only hoist him in and out  of bed and help him into the shower,everything else in between is on me  or my mother helps where she can.  


I can't say I am even pissed that my brother lives his life,only thing he pisses me off about is not phoning my parents more to see how they are,but I guess he sees it as if there is a problem I will phone,but again that comes down to the whole you are in the house.  


But it's not easy,I never expected this to be my life,and to a degree I stopped living my life a long time ago,the only purpose I have to even get up in the morning is the responsibility I have to my parents.  


It's come to the point where I don't even know what I want out of life any more,my ambition is dead in the water,there is no dream job,money does not bring me joy(when I was working I spent stupid amount's of it),materialism does not bring me joy,life no longer brings me joy.  


My life is at a stand still,a constant repeat of earlier days,I have always secretly battled with my mental health,this month makes it a year without self harming,I have never sought help in regards to my mental health because since 13 I always had the mindset that I wont live to old age.  


I have seen my fair share of family death's over the year's be it from illness such as cancer or heart attacks,and suicide,I suppose these have played a big part of how I think.  


I have exercised,gained weight,lost weight,gained weight again,no matter my size,I always end up going back down the road of feeling miserable,joyless,lifeless,at times,I have had months and weeks in between all of this where I  have felt on cloud 9 felt the ambition to do things,heck feeling like  that is what landed me getting a job to begin with last time.  


But these days feeling positive is not as often,before I got a tattoo to cover up the SH scars I was alright started back working out,eating healthy,but i  stopped for a week or 2 after my tattoo,and my mood started to go  shitty,and it's been like that since November,there are days,where I feel like right I am going to get back to it,start again,but then when it comes to the crunch,I just have zero motivation to do it,or anything else for that matter.  


It's actually pretty difficult to even put into words,how I  feel,but basically life just currently sucks.",mentalhealth,"Life is at a standstill,lost.",2019-01-23 04:41:27

860,supergoten99,1548177347,1," Ok,  so i have a friend who has confided in me that she was diagnosed with  bipolar disorder about 13 years ago. In many ways she has created a good  life for herself, she's married to a good guy who has been with her  through everything, she's formed a good career for herself, etc. She  recently got a big promotion at work and she's a damn hard worker.  However this promotion has caused a lot of stress too, she's always at  work anymore. She's stopped doing other activities that she once  enjoyed.  However, she can be one of the best friends you could ever ask  for, she can be the type to talk to you at 2 in the morning to make  sure you're ok. She will be there to help in any situation.

Other  times she can be the total opposite and will shut down on you.  Sometimes she will fly off the handle in a situation where i'm just  trying to help. I've never been diagnosed with anything because i've  never had the money to, or been too afraid to, go see anyone to talk  about it, but I definitely have social anxiety. I've never had a lot of  friends and i constantly worry about everything i say being taken the  wrong way, and i feel like i push everyone away. If anyone says one  perceived negative thing to me, i take it as ""they hate me"".

My  question to you all is, what do i do in these situations? Last night,  my friend got a little mad at me over something and told me she didn't  need the drama because she's barely holding it together right now. I  told her I was sorry, I didn't mean to bother her. At this point I was  already upset, she then said she hoped I was ok but just needed alone  time. I replied and said I understood but that i just wanted her to know  that i do care and to please take some time to take care of herself.  She never answered me.

My brother has  never liked her and told me that she's using me, that she's selfish,  etc. He says that the problem is that I care more about her than she  does about me, because I consider her more of a best friend than she  does to me. I don't believe this at all. She's still my friend, it takes  more than this for me to stop being friends with someone, but i have  been upset since last night and keep crying over it.

Should  I back off and let her have space? Or should I check in on her and make  sure she's ok? If I contact her too much I feel like i'm being  annoying. But I don't want her to feel alone either.

I'm sorry if this seems like a rant and if this type of thread isn't allowed. But thank you for any advice you might have.",mentalhealth,How to help a friend with bipolar disorder?,2019-01-23 04:15:47

I've been working a shit job at a warehouse, entry level. Around that time my psychiatrist closed up shop. I wanted to put off a new patient appointment since my wife and I have been hoping to move soon I weaned myself off my Viibryd, and finished taking my Mydayis and Abilify. We have some money saved, and aren't in financial dire straits yet, but I've noticed I am gaining weight, and absolutely dreading walking up every day. I am taking a ton of unpaid time off which is a BAD IDEA right now, and having a very hard time making myself go into work. 


I've been knowing I need help for a few weeks now. I've been trying to make an appointment with a psychiatrist but haven't gotten one set up yet. I called the office where my last psychiatrist worked this morning, they haven't called me back. I went to my GP because I've been feeling frequent fecal urgency (MY old GP suggested stress related irritable bowels), and they offered to write me a prescription for my antidepressant. I stupidly didn't take them up on it because they didn't want to write a script for my ADD meds, which I feel like help more anyways. 
When I am on my Mydayis I am more motivated and seem to have least trouble dismissing any suicidal or negative thoughts along with getting more stuff done and feeling like less of a fuckup.


I'm not going to kill myself, I have a young son who depends on me, but I am having a really hard time here. I not sure why I wrote this, but maybe folks have some suggestions on how I can get meds to bridge the several week gap until I can get in to see a psychiatrist, or something else I can do.


I lived with untreated ADD until I was 28 or so. When I was diagnosed I told my mother and her response was ""oh, I know. They told me in elementary and middle school, but I didn't want to put you in drugs that turn you into a robot"". I can say unequivocally that the medicine vastly improves my quality of life.


I had two suicide attempts in college and flunked out of my intended major. I did graduate with a STEM degree I don't use, but feel like the lack of treatment for ADD seriously impacted my life and I definitely realize allowing my meds to dry up was a grave mistake.

None of the games I used to play interest me anymore, in fact they easily make me very angry.

I've had to give up a lot of things that were leading me towards the wrong path consistently, I've had to change my playlists, and stop going to certain reddits. I've pretty much had to give up all social media because all I do is argue with people on it all day long and it's not productive.

I just had a three day weekend that felt like being in prison. I have lost all of my friends to marriage and kids or they've moved away / we've grown apart. Even my own brother and I can't talk anymore without arguing and it's not productive.

I tried going to church, had plenty of people shake my hand and greet me nicely, but it just feels like there's no way to actually connect. I've experienced the same thing in my yoga and crossfit classes and at meet ups. I'm constantly surrounded by people I don't know how to connect with. I talk to them, but it's always just small talk and what else would there be anyway?

873,litmonst,1548163659,1,"Firstly I apologize if my text will be long, I just simply don't know where and who else to say all this to. My life is typically normal. I am 20, in college, have plenty of friends and don't really find it hard to make others. However; my sole problem lies within me. I would go to a therapist, except I am not in that sort of family that can easily accept me going and I am not really working (cultural issues). Now I apologize again because my mind is always a chaos and I have problems organising my thoughts so I don't know how to form them into words or by which order, but to put it plainly, I have severe insecurity problems. A distorted image of myself. Sometimes when I get my occasionally unexplained bouts of depression, all horrible thoughts would roam my head. Like I am fat, I am terrible, manipulative, selfish, self-centred, obsessive and dramatic. Simple things can cause intense emotions to me (whether positively or negatively), and when I get anxious, which is basically daily, the urge to scream never leaves my side. The worst emotion I'd get is when I am sad or angry, tears falling, and I start to either victimise myself or loathe others who are the reason or simply hate existing. It's not that I wish to die fully, I do fear death and I am in a religious family, it's just that I wish then and most of the time to not exist at all. When I am in said emotions on bed, it would overwhelm me how much I want to cut myself, throw myself off the balcony, break an arm or a leg, and I keep withering in bodily pain just to how much I want to hurt myself to feel like I am letting off steam. 
My self image isn't really getting better when it's easy for my mother to always tell me I am a selfish person who doesn't care for anyone but herself and her needs whenever a simple problem occurs between us (i live with my family), and even though I yell and say how is that even relevant, I often find myself thinking she is true when I deal with other people outside my family circle, thinking that me wanting to take that seat next to the window other than my friend because I love it is a typically selfish act of me. That wanting attention is my self centered actions. That me feeling like I am not in the mood to help my brother with his studies sometimes make me feel like a horrible person because she makes me feel I only care if I am the one profiting. I honestly wouldn't say she is wrong, I don't even know who am I anymore. I find it hard to understand my emotions, to know whether I am crying when a friend hurts me because I am victimising myself or because they are wrong. Am I trying to appear a saint? Am I just... I don't know honestly, I don't even understand myself. I do like praise sometimes, especially that to people, they say I am the kindest soul and sort of, no one thinks I am malicious or anything, but I often find myself wondering if everyone hates me, if they are speaking behind my back, if they smile fakely, if i am unimportant and no one would care if I just disappear, and thus whenever a small act of kindness is shown, I treat it like a total blessing and almost worship the person for it.
I have troubles expressing emotions to my family and I did tell my mother how I recently cut, how I just hate myself and hate everything about me and just wish this ache in me to disappear, this is not the first year tbh, I think it's all built up. I have been having all sort of self harm and suicide threats to others since I was in middle school. I'd often scratch my hands whenever I even make a mistake in an exam, though I am not sure how is it my issues or just me wanting sympathy from others. Such thoughts make me disgusted of myself. 
I am sorry I am treating this like a diary, I just don't know how to deal with it. 
My grandmother who I've bene close to for years,living with us, died over a month ago, and till this moment I find it hard to cry about it or act visibly depressed. I act arguably normal except for excessive sleeping and boredom. It makes me feel terrible that I am like that when I a sensitive person who can cry from a Chopin or Mozart piece but cannot get depressed when I really loved my grandmother. 
I don't want to self diagnose and I hate doing that, but I stumbled upon borderline personality disorder and related to many of its symptoms, and tbh even if it isn't true, it felt good to feel like I belong to something. That there's a piece of text telling me this, all this, is because of a disorder. I felt understood, when I always feel like no one understands me the least. That I am constantly judged.

I am sorry again for the rant, I don't know if anyone would honestly give it the time to read or reply. I just want to know if anyone goes or went through something similar and what should I do or make of all this.

883,ohmahgolly,1548151473,1,"I dunno if it’s just me but I feel most comfortable or like my authentic self in situations that most would find uneasy. 

For example, if somebody tries to fight me, I feel like I can be myself and not stumble over what I say. I can make eye contact and not feel awkward. I have been in a fight where midway, was swept with the calmest and seemingly spiritual slow motion sensation. Like what I imagine a heroin hit would be like. 

On the opposite spectrum, when I start to make new friends, I become extremely anxious and uncomfortable when things start to go well. I wish that I didn’t even start to get to know them and feel weird. It’s like, I naturally click with them at first until I’m like oh shit, I think we’re friends, what now? I feel an urge to avoid them whilst trying to force myself carry on with them so they don’t think there’s anything wrong with me or more importantly them. Sometimes I even judge them as if to look for things not to be their friends. In worse cases I’m disgusted by them. Then I’m disgusted by my disgust... then disgusted with myself for being disgusted by a good non-disgusting person. Ultimately, I just never get that natural closeness and comfort from people that came naturally with childhood friends or whatever. It’s fucking lonely. 

Or when people are telling me something positive and exciting, I don’t know how to respond, but if they start talking about problems or negative things, then the conversation flows more naturally. 
I struggle to make small talk about how nice the birds sound or beautiful the day is, but find it easy to talk about some crime that happened in the area and how disgusting some people are. Like, “how fucked are thieves and meth heads...” blah blah blah. Judge judge judge. 

People get awkward if someone starts crying or is in discomfort but I am happy to listen to them or console them while they go on how shit things are. The buzz kills and downers are my people. 

It seems like it goes beyond just standard pessimism. It’s attached itself to my physiology; I don’t get adrenaline in risky situations but can’t breathe and am trying to escape when someone tries to get to know me and give me a chance. I avoid walking the social spots at work but chase risk and almost kill myself every day on my bike. Fuck isn’t that what psychos do?

I don’t want to want to be like this and am constantly at war with my self, trying to fight through discomfort and be positive but it just comes across as unnatural or even sarcastic. At least if I was a full grump then I’d be authentic. 

It’s annoying how a handful of humans have ruined the reputation of all humans for the brain. It’s a cruel biological irony. We need companionship but are wired with fear of those who have hurt us. This is obviously a problem when they’re the same thing: people. Like, maybe a certain ethnicity robs you, then your heart races whenever you see that ethnicity. You know it’s unlikely but all the stupid brain cares about is survival and will look for patterns to keep you safe. Little does the bastard know that it’ll eventually wire its own demise, making itself so lonely and starved of love that it’ll shut itself down. 

Anyway before I drag on any more...

Does anyone else know what I mean or have any suggestions? If not at least this was cathartic. Right now I’m thinking of starting a gratitude journal to try and become more optimistic. At the same time, I’m fucking lazy but will put pen to pad if it get results.

Momentarily Depressed throughout the day bringing feelings on hopelessness and anxiety.

Generally blank mood. Unmotivated/Numb.

Massive loss in sex drive. ED / PE.

Almost as if I can feel the complete lack of seretonin produced in my brain.

Feels like I have a set amount of happiness per day. Everything that brings me any happieness seems to have a massive come down that lasts a few hours.

General brain fog (used girlfriends toothbrush the other night accidently)

Girlfriend is questioning behaviour and doesnt understand.

Sometimes will temporarily go away and will return to usual self for an hr ish.

During these periods of normality i feel motivated and full of ideas/energy until a hard crash.

Sometimes crave alone time. Girlfriend feels im upset with her. Scared to completely open up to her knowing she doesnt understand.

Scared to take anidepressents, fear they will change my personality and remove emotion (past experience). Also fear addiction and disagree with living life medicated. Fear it will affect relationship both normally and sexually.

Denied military service due to past mental health history dating back to before i was 15. Knowing there is a 3-5 year grace period that is nearing completion. Dont want to reset that.

Moments where i feel like breaking down and crying over nothing.

Both parents take antidepressants so i figure my poor mental health is hereditary.

I’ve tried treatment for depression but of the 5 medications I’ve tried for 3 months each, none did anything (not even a side affect). so maybe I was misdiagnosed. I’m gonna write everything I can about my health and I want your help using criteria from the dsmIV diagnosing me.

DISCLAIMER: I am only looking for opinions, if I think I need a legit diagnosis I will see my doctor. 

- I’ve been depressed for around 4 years, each year the depression got a little worse. 
At first I was still attending school and hanging out with friends but now I spend all day in bed watching movies on my iPad with all windows closed so that I can be in the dark. I rarely leave my room, I almost never leave my house (once a month) and I am not motivated to do anything.

- even if I wanted to do something like online school i still couldn’t, I don’t have the attention span. I would just sit there and star at the computer and think “this is too hard” and I would give up. Even though while I was in school last year I was getting A’s and B’s. 

- I struggled through grade 9 and 10 to go to school. I missed majority of my classes because I would only show up maybe once a week. 

- I started getting suicidal thoughts when I was 13, but they weren’t too serious they more anxiety based like “I don’t want to go on stage for graduation, I can just kill myself before then”.  I got more steroids suicidal thoughts when I was 15, I hate myself and who I am and who I’ll never be. I’m 16 now and still feel this was a lot.

- rarely (but sometimes) I feel like my body isn’t my own. Like I’ll stand up and walk around because I feel like grew a bit (even though I know I didn’t). I look down at my arms and my hands and I know that they are mine and that I’m controlling them but they still just don’t seem like they are really mine. 

- sometimes when I’m watching a movie or tv show and I know there is about to be a sad scene I make myself numb so I don’t cry. (Making myself numb just feels like I put a sandbag on my chest) (very weird and difficult to explain) 

- don’t like crowds or places with loud crowds or when strangers try to talk to me.

- I scratch my head a lot, sometimes until it bleeds. I don’t know why I do this.

- I’m not good at putting my thoughts into sentences that make sense to everyone else. Like if I want to say something I know how I’m gonna say if but once I start talking I forget and everything gets said wrong and out of order.

This is all I can think of right now. If you have any ideas please comment.

I used to cut myself and am often suicidal, and the only advice I’ve ever gotten was to take a walk.

Recently I’ve gotten into a relationship with a person who.. has some issues. Let’s just say that something happened to her a couple years ago that has caused her to have major depressive disorder, and many suicide and self-harm problems.

For reference, I’m 16, she’s 14. 

I’ve started to feel as though I should put away my problems so that I can focus more of her. I’ve tried to talk about my problems, and she’s been amazing with letting me talk about them, don’t get me wrong, but I constantly feel as though I don’t compare to her as though I’m not as important.

Recently I’ve been punching and hitting myself every time I attempt to text her about my problems and it’s getting worse and worse but I’m so afraid of hurting her that I can talk to her about it.

For personal reasons, I can’t talk to my family about it, as my father would dismiss it as hormones, my mom would misinterpret it but still be supportive, and my sister would talk about how she’s been through worse and I’m acting like a child.

I feel like there’s a part of me that wants to seek help but then there’s another part that just hates myself and just wants me to end it all. I’ve never tried suicide but it’s still there. But I can’t do that to my girlfriend, I’m one of the only guys who hasn’t treated her like shit, and I can’t do that to her.

Ok. So this is a long, complicated issue, but the short of it is my sister (late 20s) has been going downhill for awhile now. She is drinking in excess (so much so she now has a dui), taking drugs (real drugs. Not just pot) , and only hanging out with one person (her ex) that treats her like utter garbage. She refuses to stop hanging out with him no matter what crazy bullshit he pulls because he is her “best friend”/“only friend.” She has no hobbies. When she isn’t working she goes to the bar or this terrible ex’s house and they drink and do drugs. I’ve recently learned its more than just pot. She took random pills he gave her and she blacked out and missed a full day of work. I try to make plans with her but she usually cancels on me. She rarely answers my phone calls or texts. 

Every time we think she’s hit bottom and will finally see that she needs help, she doesn’t. It just gets worse. She blows off concerns and says she’s fine, she’s not an alcoholic, everything is good. However, an extended family member has confided that she told them she called a suicide hotline last week. 

I’m terrified I will lose my sister. I don’t know what to do or how to talk to her to try and get her help. She’s an adult. Can we force her to get mental health help?

So I(F) am hopeless in love with my ex-girlfriend. We've known each other 5 years and had lots of break ups and getting back together through. We broke up about a week ago after being consistently together for about a year and a half. We were happy, in love, planning our future, our family, etc. 


We are still friends and she knows the way I feel. We broke up because I have very bad anxiety that is very difficult to deal with and I recognize that. In the beginning of us getting back together this time I helped her with opening up emotionally, I loved her, took care of her, and she loved me in return. She has worked very hard to become a better person and it shows. I know she loves me, I know she wants or wanted to be with me and even now, she just wants room for us both to grow and I agree. She has anxiety as well and that is the hardest aspect of our relationship. We both have a lot of personal growing to do and while I used to think it's something we could and should do together, I've really listened to her and realized and agree that we both need to deal with some stuff on our own. 


The issue is, I am insane. I am obsessed with her. I feel like there is a split in my brain of the me who truly loves her in a good way. I want her to be healthy and happy even if it is without me. I recognize that. This side of me very much so wants to be with her but recognizes I am not good for her as I am right now and I need to grow and work on my anxiety and bad habits so that we can have the life we planned. I need to give her space to grow on her own so we can be good for each other. I want to be her friend as we are with no pressure, I just want to really be there for her as a person and not as my significant other. 


But there is this other half of me that can't eat or sleep due to heartbreak. I think about her 99% of the time, she consumes my every thought. I get anxiety when I am not with her and when I perceive something that'll hurt my feelings. And when I see her the high I experience is unmatched. I recognize I have an unhealthy obsession and in the past my actions regarding it were much worse. I've learned to calm myself down and exercise a bit of self control instead of frantically trying to hold on to her. But I cannot stop my thoughts. I cannot stop obsessing every second of every day. Even as I try to work on my personal things, it all leads back to her. I recognize this is unhealthy. 


I want to be a capable and stable person who is self sufficient, reliable, and not crippled by anxiety. I want to be good for myself, not just her. I cannot love her the right way if I do not fix this and I have ruined things thus far with my shit. I know I can get her back, I know she loves me and I know I have a lot of work to do and I just desperately want to change my mindset because the anxiety I feel every second over her is CRIPPLING. It is taking over my life and I am so frustrated with myself because it makes me feel crazy. 


I know I love her, I truly do love her in the best way. But I am also obsessed and I need to separate the two. Has anyone gone through this? What can I do to help myself? 


TL;DR: Im in love but so obsessed with my ex girlfriend. I need help pulling the two things apart so I don't drive myself insane and ruin something beautiful with my crazy. Please help me ",mentalhealth,Limerence vs love,2019-01-22 11:17:19
924,anime_weirdness,1548116024,1,"The feelings of sadness, happiness, fear and so on are, I've felt, essential to feeling 'normal'. And for at least the past 4~ years, I haven't really had many true, genuine emotions. I thought that when I graduated college, I would be able to move somewhere more 'active' and be able to experience the full gamut of emotional experiences that I never got the chance to have as a burgeoning adult

So here I am, a recent 21 years old college grad, working as a researcher at some energy company, over a thousand miles from my friends and families. And I feel more numb than ever before. I don't feel depressed, just empty.

In an effort to feel something, I decided to take a crack at watching anime for the first time in my life. I've always liked new experiences, so I thought it'd be fun.

And Christ, I love it so much. For what feels like the first time in my life, I have powerful, long-lasting emotions, purely because of the shows I watch. I can't put in words how much I appreciated having my stomach drop in the climax of Parasyte: The Maxim, how much I cried in the last episode of Made in Abyss, how much I wanted the protagonists in Girls Last Tour to have a happy ending, and so for more shows. It gave me an emotional high that I always vaguely knew I wanted, but never knew that I craved this much.

And now it's all I really think about. Trying to track down the next anime that'll elicit the same, powerful emotions from deep inside me that the 'real world' has, historically, failed to give me. I think about it when I workout, when I go to work, when I go to bed at night. It's one of the first things in my life that I've ever been obsessed by.

So, this leads to my question: should I take a step back from going deeper down this rabbit hole? None of this feels particularly emotionally healthy, to depend on some series on the internet to give me a sense of completeness. But I could also be overthinking it. I don't know.

This happened like 7 years ago. I've always regarded it as an ""episode”. I’ve wondered if it’s some sort of synesthesia but I can’t be sure. 



One night, I was with friends at a small house party and we were all drinking. I think I got considerably tipsy -- like the loose level of drunk where you're a lot more fun but not out of control. Gradually, people stopped being people in my head. They turned into two lines connected at one point and divided by different angles (think: 7th-grade geometry homework); if they moved they were vectors. The angle degrees and length of their lines were different for every person. IIRC, some were even triangles. It was a party, so people were talking. But I didn't see talking. I saw mathematical operations as the interactions happening between them. Multiplication, division, subtraction or addition, depending on the emotion they were speaking with. (Example: if they were laughing loudly, they were multiplying with each other).



It was so weird and so overwhelming. I tried to explain it to one friend but I think she thought I was crazy. It was impossible to stop thinking like this. It only wore off when I fell asleep, which ALSO was difficult to do. It was verging on too stimulating. 



I realize this isn't really synesthesia as I didn't ""feel"" this in a sensory way, but if it's not synesthesia then what the hell happened? I don't think it means anything, especially because it's never happened that intensely again, but if anyone has any insight I'd appreciate it lots.

There were times between 2015 and 2016 I questioned whether there was even any purpose to life as I just couldn't imagine anything being worse. But by early 2018 through self reflection and therapy I did improve and even now I am a hell of a lot better than I ever was then. I just remember it coming on in waves and feeling almost trapped in what felt like a box of, well the closest thing I could say is of despair. At the time I even felt embarrassed as I knew exactly what was happening but I couldn't do anything about it. This was a few years ago though so I can't remember exactly what went through my head at the time. It happened probably once or twice a day. Although I've felt better for a long time, in the last couple weeks I have had this sadness come on over me. It's different from before and no where near as bad but I seemed to have lost all drive and motivation. There are bits of desperation at times but for the most part it's just a feeling of melancholy. It is becoming more frequent and I just have to wonder what it could be any what I should do. ",mentalhealth,What is wrong with me?,2019-01-22 09:30:48
938,The_Razza7,1548108865,1,"I've never given any thought to mental health at all until recently. The last couple of years I've found myself being emotional and crying for various reasons be that really missing family that have passed away or even just feeling lonely, even though I still have plenty of family and friends to spend time with &amp; I've never really spoken about how I am with anyone so I am really nervous writing this because I feel a little silly writing about that I'm happy or it may come across as I'm fishing for attention or something. I feel like I need to express myself though so here it is....

&amp;#x200B;

This past weekend a really random event caused me to think and come to a realisation. The weather here in Northern Ireland has now started to get quite cold and I thought I could do with a new coat so I did some online window shopping, picked one out and went to the shop to pick it up &amp; also picked up a nice steak to make for dinner that Saturday night. Yesterday, in what I am certain is a sign of getting old I started looking forward to trying this coat out in the terrible weather we have come Monday morning &amp; it put a smile on my face.

&amp;#x200B;

Smiling got me thinking on why I was feeling happy about it and realised it wasn't just that, even though I hadn't done anything particularly spectacular or awesome in terms of activities I thought I'd had a pretty damn good weekend. On Saturday I bought myself a nice new coat, I got to spend a good bit of time playing &amp; having fun with my 3 year old nephew, an activity which is probably my favourite thing in the world these last couple of years &amp; was then able to have a lovely meal. On top of that I was able to watch some TV shows that I really love, got some gaming in &amp; got a chance to relax some as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I got to do some of the things I most enjoy and managed to realise that whilst I have days here and there that I may feel lonely or sad about missing people or one of the many other emotions that take hold, I overall am pretty happy and allowed myself to feel good about it. On days where I maybe do feel a little down I hope I can remember the little things that do make me happy and can embrace those.

Our home brings with it an undeniable feeling of familiarity and comfort. We can be out all night having the time of our lives when, all of a sudden, have a yearning to “just go home.” But is our home actually a covert catalyst of anxiety?

Let us begin by exploring the *Biophilia Hypothesis* for a moment. It was proposed by naturalist, biologist, and author Edward O. Wilson in 1984 in the book *Biophilia*.  The Biophilia hypothesis, or “BET,” is the notion that human beings possess an inherent, intimate connection with nature. Modern society’s current ways of living – heavy industry (and pollution), obsession with money, addiction to technology – has effectively separated us from our former abode, causing a conflict in the subconscious.

Wilson’s theory makes sense when viewed from an evolutionary perspective. Not long ago, man lived out amongst the elements, save for rudimentary shelters like caves and tree branches. When not resting, you would find the men, women, and children outdoors, hunting and gathering for food, water, and other necessities of daily life.

#### What does the Biophilia Hypothesis have to do with home-induced anxiety?

Well, if Mr. Wilson is indeed correct, **our home is separating us from our original habitat** – and no species is okay with exile!  Another idea is that *nature signifies life and vitality*. Indeed, plants and trees – two of the most commonly-found things in nature – *permit* life; a fact that may help explain why we find flowers and plants adorning most homes and workspaces. The hypothesis may help explain why many people feature nature at the centerpiece (if you will) of their homes – a concept known as *biophilic design*.

In other words, as *Mammalia*, we human beings – despite our advanced intelligence and, for some, vehement insistence to the contrary – inherently desire to return to our original home out in the elements. As a side note, Wilson’s hypothesis gathers steam when you consider that**humans are the only species who do not actively reside in the natural world.**

At the very least, the Biophilia Hypothesis makes us think about our relationship with nature. Whether it explains away the deep-rooted anxiety that some (all?) experience in the home is up to the psychoanalytical among us.

The Biophilia Hypothesis aside, we *do* know that **one’s environment can influence their state of mind**. Given that the home is indeed an environment, it is reasonable to assume that it can spur anxious feelings, but why? Here are 9 possible ways that your home can give you anxiety:

1. **Your place is cluttered and disorganized**

Okay, so check these numbers out. Per a survey of more than a thousand Americans over 18 years old, 47 percent constantly worry about the orderliness of their home. Also, scientists know that **too much clutter raises cortisol levels**. Per Psychology Today, the stress hormone cortisol “is public enemy number one,” with high levels of the hormones causing disturbances in learning and memory, immune system, metabolism, and more.

*What to do: Start small by organizing your bedroom closet or kitchen drawers. Eventually, begin thinking bigger and take on more time-consuming projects. The enemy of anxiety is action. Take it.*

942,Draav,1548106981,1,"My fiance has been to so many doctors and therapists. It just doesn't help.

Scheduling time for doctors is next to impossible, even with night hours, we have work and she is a teacher so taking days and time off is a difficult thing to do and she is just adding to her anxiety about not be a good teacher and worry about getting fired because she has to take off.

Actually calling and scheduling, even assuming that there is time, is a very stressful scenario as well. No one answers, people say they will call back and never do, appointments get cancelled (after she calls off work, so she doesn't get another chance to go for weeks), have to leave tons of voicemails that never get responded to because the specialist is out or the doctors leave at 2 pm. 

When there actually is a appointment met, nothing helps because they are blocked by another specialist. Sorry can't help need to talk to your psychiatrist, sorry looks like you need to get an MRI for us to help with the leg pain, sorry you need to find a therapist to sign off on this.

And each one is it's own hell of a fetch quest. The problems she's having make it hard to even go to the grocery store without having a panic attack, she's in so much physical pain she just cries every night, then lapsing into a panic attack because she can't tell if it's physical or mental pain.  

And people experiencing these issues are expecting to schedule dozens of appointments with people that have unclear schedules while she maintains her job every day? Also have to throw in insurance and money into the mix. Finally finding a doctor that understood but then getting denied coverage is another thing to add to the pile.

I have no way to help. I don't know what to do besides offer comfort. I'm not trained in this. I can't just keep saying go to a doctor, see a therapist, when we've been going through this nightmare of finding help for years. And more health issues just keep coming up. 

She just keeps saying it's not fair, and it's not. She builds up energy for days trying so hard to fight through the pain and mental pressure, just to make it to a doctors appointment which is cancelled the day of. She spends weeks trying to schedule an appointment with her psychiatrist, which keeps going to voicemail, and not getting calls returned. When she asked her general practitioner for help, they call the psychiatrist in the office, her answers and says he'd be happy to schedule time. So she looks like a crazy person looking for drugs. We leave the office at 2pm (appointment scheduled for 11:30, we sat waiting for the doctor for 50 minutes after the nurse checked blood pressure), and call the psychiatrist who has left the office for the day. At 2pm. Been over a week and still can't contact them. Has to go through withdrawal now because she's been cut off cold turkey from an antidepressant (That apparently she was never supposed to be on, it was just supposed to be an attempt at lessening the physical pain of what they guess is Fibromyalgia, they have no idea why she hurts)

If she didn't have me next to her, she'd probably think she's going insane, with someone actively making sure nothing ever works out. But I can't help, I can only just watch and give hugs (when she's able to be touched since her skin hurts quite often).

Hopefully I'm allowed to vent here, I just don't want to keep this all in my brain and start lashing out. ",mentalhealth,People always say to get professional help. But it's so hard to do,2019-01-22 08:43:01

I'm nervous about seeing one because I've never really talked in depth to a doctor about these things. I just know that me venting and not being able to resolve my anxieties on my own all the time has been putting immense strain on my relationship with my boyfriend, myself, and my sister. My mother deals with a lot of mental illness as well so she let's me talk about stuff with her. We all think a psychiatrist and therapist would be good. The thoughts of medicine make me uncomfortable. I had a really bad time with Xanax for my depression years ago. But coping mechanisms don't work for me like they used to. I can't use self-harm as a coping mechanism either and I still get STRONG urges to do such again.
I'm moving, trying to keep my relationship afloat, I have an interview tomorrow, and I'm trying to figure all these things out. I don't have friends to hang/talk with anymore. So I thought here would be okay to vent and maybe get some reassurance that shit will be okay. It feels lonely trying to handle all of this. My ownself feels like its saying ""bugger off"".

947,Sun-lun,1548103974,1,"Hi, I'm not properly diagnosed but my therapist is almost positive I have bipolar. I did some reading and found that people can experience hallucinations, but they're most commonly audio ones. This was way before I was hallucinating 24/7. It's been happening for probably 3/4 months now. Whenever I look at something, whatever I'm looking at (including peripherals) looks like it's moving/morphing/distorting. I've been looking for a visual aid for ages and have only just found one - [this is the best visual representation I've come across that shows what happens pretty much constantly](https://gfycat.com/BountifulUnluckyCowrie) (0.5x speed is the most accurate).

Sometimes when I'm lying in bed, the ceiling above me looks and feels like it's getting closer and closer to me, but is obviously not moving, but the more I looked, the more and more intense it felt. It's affected my sleep a couple of times in the past week too, as I see shapes in the darkness in my room due to the constant morphing. 2 nights ago I seen what looked like the silhouette of many octopus tentacles moving around on the ceiling in total darkness. 

Does anyone else experience this? I don't know if it's just my eyes playing tricks or if my mental health is getting worse. I smoke weed every day (for the past 6 months or so) and have done recreationally for years and have never hallucinated from weed before. Obviously it's not a good idea to do any drug every day, but I'd be dead without it. I turn into an unstable mess without it. It's taken like 12 years of basic, free NHS talking therapies, suicide attempts, drug abuse etc to get taken seriously, and I'm now on the list for a mental health assessment, so hopefully I should find out what's going on soon. 

Apologies for the train wreck of a post, I'm just a bit worried atm.

As of late - the past year or so - I've been feeling exhausted. School causes me tremendeous amounts of stress, so much, I have actually threw up and somehow got fever days prior to important exams, even though I aced them. My mother still struggles with mental illness, which she sometimes takes out on me.

To see just how disfunctional my family is - my parents are actually letting my 20y/o boyfriend to live with us.

My one ""escape"" would be music, which I absolutely love. However, I'm bad at it. I'm average at guitar, drums and uke and a terrible singer. Everytime I try practicing I realize just how absolutely terrible I am, even though I spent a good part of my childhood isolated from other kids and focused on practicing instruments and singing for 5-8hours a day - which would be literally all of my free time. Realizing how bad I am after so much practice makes me feel absolutely useless. I hate it. It manages to make me cry everytime, sometimes several times in a day. My bf, who is a singer, literally never practices, but is really good at singing - that upsets me even more. He doesn't put in any effort while I do and he gets so much more out of it.

I don't know what to do. All I ever think about is what a disappointment I am to myself. I've tried everything, but I can't seem to get better.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway... as mentioned, I've been kind of depressed for a few months ago. I would say it is a mild depression + a lot of laziness. I went from going to school (3 years ago) to dropping out after my 1st year in college so I could start my own business but I slowly stopped caring and now I live with my parents and do nothing all day. the only productive thing i do is probably play some games and make my own food (which most of the time Im making some pasta noodles and putting cheese on it). I went from being excited to be independent (always wanted to be independent but here I am), to basically being a shell of a person. a lazy log. I stay home all day and play video games, eat, and sleep. my parents have given up on me basically and no longer nag me to do something. they were never encouraging of anything I did, and often insulted me for mygrades and the college I went into. I am not really close to my parents, but I am somewhat closer to my mom, as my father and I have a really bad relationship but we all still live together.

&amp;#x200B;

unrelated but comedically ironic: I used to look down on young adults who stayed home with parents and didnt have a job as I thought they were lazy and pathetic, and I've literally become my own worst fear.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway... so now that I basically do nothing all day and literally am super useless lol, whenever I get sick or hurt - at first I try to get better and heal myself / make sure that I do everything in my path to get better. but now when i realize im sick, I just sort of accept it and actually appreciate being sick or hurt because I feel like if im sick then it's because I'm sacrificing myself so others close to me don't have to suffer. that im taking away some of their pain/ sickness, so they suffer less. 

&amp;#x200B;

i think/ know it sounds really crazy that i've lost my mind, but at least that way i dont feel that worthless... and there is 1 in particular very close to me... i wont disclose who or what, but basically they are very sick and are dying. Ive been with them most of my life since I was a young child, and i try to do everythin I can to save them, but i know they are dying and will not live much longer. so because of that, I often pray that i get their sickness and pain so they can be pain free and not suffer, that I openly accept and WANT to be sick and hurt not for attention, but so i can take their place in sickness and suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

anyone have any advice for me? I don't know what i will do once that being dies, i dont know if i will continue to live or not. it's not that I'm in such a deep depression I'm suicidal, it's more like I've devoted my whole life to them and they helped me overcome depression before - and while I believe i can still find happiness and fulfillment after their death, i dont know if its worth the effort (as mentioned, im just lazy).

These symptoms may seem like a rather common affect of lack of sleep. However, I am not sure if I am hyper sensitive to my mental state or if it is something more. I've read a lot about dopamine and serotonin and my guess is that my dopamine levels are lower than the average person. Alcohol (in larger quantities) augments these symptoms once the effects have worn off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figure someone on this forum is quite knowledgeable in neurobiology and I wanted to just post the question on this forum...

&amp;#x200B;

My symptoms generally include: depression, lack of interest and focus in activities that are generally of great importance to me, lack of motivation, feelings of sadness, and I'm often paranoid/hypersensitive when interacting with others. These symptoms are not always at once but definitely have occurred with some correlation. 

&amp;#x200B;

The odd part is, even in an exhausted state I still know that this is basically my brain running at a reduced state, so I am aware that its not my normal state of being and can sort of ""muscle"" my way through. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on why this may be occurring (in what seems to be a heightened state) would be great!

Does anyone have anything they can tell me or any advice because it's actually starting to become so unbearable. I'm so fucking lonely, I go out and try to talk to people, I go whenever I'm invited places and I still don't have a single person I actually can feel comfortable around, even myself. I'm paranoid af sometimes I convince myself people are listening to my thoughts so I just feel like people are judging me even when I'm completely alone.

961,OnionWayWay,1548097655,1,"Brain fog is an informal umbrella term for a number of related symptoms that involve the sufferer's brain feeling slow and like it’s not functioning correctly, almost like it’s in a fog. Presentations can involve anything from memory problems to difficulty thinking to confusion. It can be caused temporarily by coming on or off of certain drugs and medications, but many cases are chronic. A lot of the time, chronic brain fog is caused by an underlying physical health condition or nutrient deficiency, but it can also simply result from stress or anxiety.

In the recent decades there has been a surge in awareness and acceptance of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, but chronic brain fog has been left to the wayside in these movements for what I believe are three reasons. 1. Brain fog is ambiguously defined and it can take so many different forms. Two cases tend to be very different from each other. 2. It is not very well known about by the general public and is called by a variety of different names in different cases. There are different names associated with different underlying physical conditions, for example: Fibro Fog, Lupus Fog, MS Fog, etc. and there are also many different synonyms for the condition itself such as cognitive disfunction, mental impairment, clouding of consciousness, etc. 3. There is less stigma surrounding it than the other conditions I mentioned, and stigma was one of the major motivations for spreading awareness of those conditions. People don’t make claims about people faking their brain fog for attention or give them useless advice like “just be happy” in the same way as something like depression, however, there still tends to be a lot of misunderstanding that comes from people who have never experienced brain fog which is why it’s still important to spread awareness about.

Along with that, spreading awareness is important for those who are going through this and are unaware that they are not alone and that there are [communities on the internet](Reddit.com/r/brainfog) that are there to support them.

It’s sometimes difficult for neurotypicals to understand why brain fog makes life so difficult and why it is so soul sucking, which is what I’m going to attempt to explain in the rest of this post. When you don’t have brain fog, it’s easy to forget how much you need your brain in day to day tasks. Everything from talking to people, to doing work, to even just thinking idly requires some amount of brain function, so when your brain starts functioning below it’s normal level all of these things become a lot more difficult and mentally exhausting. Suddenly you find yourself looking at various things in your life with dread that you maybe used to look at with excitement or at least indifferently. It’s also not easy for others to see just how hard your brain has to work now to go about your life and they tend to be less empathetic towards your struggles than you sometimes need them to be, which can be isolating. Another major source of suffering comes from anxiety surrounding one’s brain fog. Since your brain is literally the organ that makes you you, it can be terrifying when it stops working and you can’t trust it anymore. Due to brain fog having so many possible causes, many times sufferers are clueless as to what the source of their brain fog is which can be even more scary. Many are left with the fear that their brains are permanently damaged and they will never recover. Doctors also tend to be dismissive of patients presenting with brainfog because there simply isn’t enough knowledge about it and it is difficult to find the cause. This is even more isolating.

963,Throwitoryeetit,1548097357,1,"I will state before I begin that I do not have any clinical mental health issues, rather just a recent bout of anxiety that has been causing me grief. I'm posting here after weeks of frustration, relating to my lack of sex drive. Up until about 3 weeks, I would say that my sex drive was relatively normal. I watched porn pretty much everyday, and never had any problem getting aroused. However, this all changed following a burst of anxiety I had (unrelated to my sexuality), and ever since I have had a very difficult time becoming aroused at the thought of porn or women. Strangely enough, if I look at porn, I have no problem getting an erection, however, I do feel ""hollow"", and it just isn't as enjoyable for me as it used to be.

At the same time, I also had gnawing doubts about my sexual identity, which started a few months back after a friend of mine came out of the closet to me. I have never felt attraction to men, and thus pushed the thoughts away once I first had them. The questioning would come back sporadically, but it was easily dismissed. I think part of the reason is that I never told anyone about this information, and as a result, it remained bottled up since last August. This all changed a few weeks ago, and almost everyday I have been constantly barraged by questioning about my identity. In combination with the lack of sex drive for women, where I can't really get an erection unless I'm looking at porn, the past few weeks have been quite tough for me. I have felt fatigued and uncomfortable everyday, and can barely do other things because my head is constantly swirling. I have been going to therapy, and I have noticed that I have been getting better everyday, in terms of my head clearing up and regaining control of my thoughts, but I still have a weak sex drive.

Once again I should reiterate, I genuinely have no attraction towards men. Never in my life have I felt anything for men, and I don't even like to watch porn with men in it, as the sight of a penis turns me off. I recently tried to look at porn with penises in them, trying to entertain the idea that I might be bisexual, but all it did was reassert the fact that I only like women. I feel so frustrated because I went from being your average hormonal college student to basically a nervous wreck. Like I said earlier in this post, I’ve been improving, but my sex drive still hasn’t rebounded. Is there anything I could do to help speed the process along? Should I refrain from porn, until it comes back? Will it come back? I just want to get back to normal.

Learning to feel again has been hell. Real emotions are powerful and unpredictable and obvious. It’s hard to hide how you feel when haven’t felt for so long. Sometimes, the emotion is too powerful, and my brain defaults to crying as a coping mechanism. Learning to feel again, to cope with such extremes of emotion, you may be forgiven for thinking that sadness is the hardest part of it all. It is not however; the hardest emotion to relearn is actually happiness. 

I am a man in his mid-thirties, and 2018 was a rollercoaster year of extremes, some ups and lots of downs. My marriage broke down and at first, I fought for it until I broke down and there was no more fight left. I was fired illegally from a job I’d held for less than a year, and was told by the pro-bono law firm that sought to represent me that my case didn’t make financial sense for them to take on, which left me no option but to accept the blot on work record. My ex-wife left our home whilst I was coming back from work on the day I had been fired, leaving only a text message to outline her selfish reasons for doing so. The blot on my work record then prevented me from applying for a dream job in law enforcement. A different company provided a reference that, whilst not ‘bad’, cast enough doubt with another police force that I lost a civilian job offer literally days before I was due to start training. I was so broke I was relying on handouts from family and friends to top up my benefits to keep the roof over my head. My debts to family and credit cards tripled in six months. Then, I got a new job and met a new partner at roughly the same time, and we had to decide whether to begin a relationship that would become long distance almost immediately; we did so knowing it wouldn’t be easy, but it would be worth it. I found a new place to live 150 miles away from ‘home’, my girlfriend, and the support network I had grown over nearly fifteen years since moving back after university.

Perhaps I was foolish to elect to come off my medication when I did. Perhaps I wasn’t as ready as I thought. Perhaps I was buoyed by counselling and jumped in too soon. I will never know. I doesn’t matter now either. I reduced my dosage incrementally, went through the withdrawal, and took my final tablet on December 31st; I also threw all my spares away.

So what has this to do with happiness? The tablets I took for almost seven years kept my mood stable, and prevented my sadness from overwhelming me when it was high (low?); they also kept a limit on my other emotions. As such, I haven’t really felt anything properly for a long time. I felt happy during that time yes, but the medication stunted it into a kind of perma-contentment. I freely acknowledge that my depression was mild, and I never felt suicidal or drawn to self-harming; I know I was lucky in this regard. Yet, the years of stunted emotions mean that now, when I feel content or satisfied with something, it feels powerful like an extreme happiness; and, when I experience that kind of profound happiness that comes from feeling in control of your life and going where you *want* to go, feeling as though the things you wanted and wished for, and deserve, are coming to you at last, a happiness that lifts you and from which it feels you not come down, it is almost a euphoria I cannot cope with. It is often so intense that it scares me, and leaves me prone to the old, bad, habits of self-depreciation and self-sabotage.

January has, thus far, been a month of intense emotions. My brain gets more and more SSRI free, and is being allowed to regulate its own chemicals; my feelings are having the lid taken off, their limiter is being removed. There is sadness this month yes. I am sad because I live apart from my girlfriend by over 100 miles. I am sad because I must rely on social media to speak to my friends. I am sad because the building into which I moved does not allow pets and I wanted to adopt a cat! But I am using what my counsellor taught me to cope with and process this sadness, and it is working. There is more happiness this month, and it is this happiness I am finding hardest. 

I have much to be happy about, amongst other things I am employed and have a home. I have friends that I can know I can call on regardless of where we are in the world. I have love in my life even if my partner and I are geographically apart. I am standing in front of two roads that lead to two similar dream careers, both extremely well paid, deeply meaningful, and with excellent development prospects that will take me to retirement with a pension. I look at how much meaning and potential I have in my life once again and I am happy. And because I am happy, I cry. I cry because this happiness is more powerful that I can properly handle at this time. Sometimes, I can stave off the tears, and move my mind to new thoughts or tasks. But often I feel them roll down my cheeks as I sniffle. You would see me and think I am upset. But I am not. I am literally learning how to feel happy again, and it’s one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.

My counsellor, who’s praises I can never sing high enough, taught me how to really understand that now famous phrase “it’s ok to not be ok”. Over seven weeks, I learned more and more how to acknowledge how I felt when I was not ok, and to allow myself to feel that way; to validate and process the feelings in a healthy way. Had I the opportunity to see her now, I would ask that we did similar work on the phrase “it’s ok to be ok too”. I am instead teaching myself that it *is* ok to feel happy. It’s ok to feel happy about going to work a job that gives meaning to your life. It’s ok to feel loved by someone who is thoughtful and caring and beautiful. It’s ok to feel excited by the future and the promise it holds, the potential for responsibility and good pay and excellent prospects right through until retirement. It’s ok to not be ok, and it’s ok to be ok too.

So I will continue to learn how to feel again. My life will move on, and things will change. One day I may learn one of my career options is closed and I cannot choose that road. Or my relationship may not last long term. Perhaps some of my friends will drift away and lose contact. It is equally likely that my dream career may happen all of sudden, or my relationship will bare a family and lifelong commitment, or I will gain new friends into my support network. I will experience losses, and I will experience gains. And I will experience these new, intense emotions, learning to make them more predictable and more bearable. As hard as it is to grasp at the moment, I will do this because I know, it is ok to be ok.",mentalhealth,Learning to feel again,2019-01-22 05:22:39

This is a translation of what my therapist gave me a few months ago and it has helped me a lot with stopping. Thinking. And then, reconsidering how I am feeling or what I am thinking before I either act on it or let it bury me. Overthinking, overanalyzing and reading into situations from a biased perspective is something I am highly guilty for, but I know I'm not the only one and thought I'd share what helped me, hoping that it will help someone else :)

List of mind-traps
There are several mind-traps people fall into, sometimes without realizing it before its too late. Here are 7 of them:

1. *All or nothing mindset*
You look at things as ""black"" or ""white"". If your accomplishments aren't perfect, you look at yourself as a failure. You collect all negative experiences.
""I'm ugly if I'm not as pretty or prettier than the prettiest""
""my speech was total crap because I stumbled on some words""
""I am stupid because I didn't complete this test we'll enough""

2. *overgeneralizing*
You look at a negative occurance as a pattern that never ends.
""she doesn't wanna see me, no one will""
""I will be lonely my entire life""
""I will die alone""
""I will never be capable of....""

3. *Disqualifying the positive*
You reject positive esperiences by saying they don't count. This way you maintain your negative assumptions which otherwise would be contradicted by daily experiences. 
""but that assignment was easy"" 
""I must've had a good day"" 
""I was lucky, wait until next time and you'll see"" 

4. *Reading minds*
You randomly conclude that people think negatively of you, and you don't care about figuring out if it's really true. 
""he doesn't like me"" 
""they think I'm boring"" 
""they aren't really interested in what I'm saying"" 

5. *interpreting fate*
You have a presumption that things will go wrong and you feel convinced that your presumptions are facts. 
""I won't be able to do, say, write, eat something at all"" 
""my voice will Crack and everyone will hear it"" 
""I will panic"" 

6. Emotional reasoning 
You assume that your negative emotions reflect things as they really are.
""it feels like this thus it must be true"" 
""I am so nervous that others probably think bad things about me"" 
""I feel stupid so I probably look stupid"" 
""I feel so anxious, this will probably not go very well"" 

7. Shall-statements
You give yourself requirements that you ""shall, must, will, have to"". You can't live up to your standards which are too high, and you often feel hurt, inadequate or guilty. 
""I have to always be perfect"" 
""I must always be capable of saying the right things"" 
""I must always have control""


Whenever you realize you are falling into one of these mind-traps, ask yourself the following questions to start unwinding the cluster of thoughts that are overpowering you or sending you into a spiral. 

Testing of the negative automatic thought:

1. What kind of proof do I have for this thought to be correct?
2. What kind of mind-trap do I fall into?
3. Am I taking hasty decisions?
4. Which alternative viewpoints are there to this?
5. What would someone else, who know me well, say?
6. What would I have told my best friend, if he/she were thinking like this?
7. What speaks against my way of thinking?
8. What have I experienced from similar occurances in the past?
9. What is the worst that could happen?
10. What is the best that could happen?
11. What is the most realistic result? 




I hope this will help you reflect and stop yourself from falling into the depths of your own imagination. 
In my experience it felt silly and worthless at first, but after I did it a few times I would start noticing that I was spiraling earlier in the process which helped me guide my thoughts to a more productive and logical rather than emotional direction.  I hope this can assist you to do the same :)

979,Zippete32,1548088262,1,"I would like to improve my mental health and get to a better place. 

I've always suffered from some sort of social anxiety. I don't know if I can actually call it that, because I've never been diagnosed, but I do get very nervous in social situations, like talking in front of a crowd or just even in class; I'm not good at making friends or small talking or talking to anyone I don't know; I'm constantly afraid of what people are going to think of me.   
I've had three anxiety attacks in my life, two of those were school related and one was during an overall bad and overwhelming week.  
I go through periods where I have no will to do anything and spend my days using my phone or just laying in bed. They can last from a few days to a few weeks.   
I've never planned or seriously taken into consideration suicide, but I do think often about it. I would never have the courage to do it.

I've talked about all this only with my boyfriend, since he's the only support system I have (which is bad, I know). He's understanding and supportive, but of course he doesn't really know how to help me.

I hoped things would change after finishing high school (school was really bad for me, I've always been good and got the best grades, and I've always suffered from the pressure and expectations that come with it - mostly from myself), but now I've started university and, although I like what I'm studying, I don't like going there because I spend the whole day by myself and it is really tiring and disheartening. 

Seeking professional help is unfortunately not an option because I go to an expensive school and I don't want my parents to pay for that as well. Moreover, I would have to talk to them about this, and I don't feel comfortable enough to do it.

For the last few months I haven't been feeling like myself. I feel distant from myself. I catch myself daydreaming a lot now when I never really used to when I was younger. I also tend to forget little things. For example, this morning I had to of plugged in my phone to let it charge but when I sat down at my desk and looked behind me I didn't remember doing so. Or bringing up the laundry and throwing it on my bedroom floor. I'm also forgetting things easily to write in this post as I'm typing it. Little things like that. It's not everything, and it's not all the time that I'm forgetting but I am aware that I am.  

My chest hurts sometimes, right above my heart. Or maybe it's my actual heart, I don't know. It's sort of like a shock feeling. Nothing too bad, it doesn't interfere with whatever I'm doing at the time it happens. I've never had a heart attack so I can't compare it to that, but it doesn't make me stop what I'm doing to hold my chest and catch my breath. My doctor had told me it's a common thing when you have anxiety or you're feeling nervous. I don't know if that's the case though.

My head seems to hurt sometimes as well. Not like a headache or a migraine, but almost as if someone knocks on my head. Not really hard, but enough for it to be annoying.

I feel nervous about going to work as well and I don't know why. It's a slow time at the place I work and I'm only working part time there so I don't have many shifts right now, and when I do have to go in I'm nervous. I've been there a year so I don't know why I would feel nervous about it.

It may be worth mentioning that I've had an ingrown toenail in my big toe for quite some time now, I've got it taken out once and a few months later it grew back in. I haven't been back to the foot doctor since. I know I should, but I've been busy lately. I don't know if that would have anything to do with how I'm feeling.

Like I said, I feel distant from myself, but it doesn't feel like I'm watching myself or anything like that. Whatever actions I make I know it's me making them. If I walk or move my leg or my arm or whatever it is I'm doing I know, in my mind, it is me.

Lastly I just wanted to say thank you to anyone who reads this post, and maybe at least someone has a clue to what it is I'm going through.",mentalhealth,I don't feel alive?,2019-01-22 03:29:51
981,wsdpii,1548087957,1,"I've been suffering from social anxiety for about five years, in addition to PTSD from a violent altercation for almost two, coupling with severe depression. It's been an impossible struggle. I've seen dozens of therapists, counselors, and psychologists, taken uncountable combinations of medications. 

I managed to make some progress over the last year, making a few friends, going on a few dates for the first time in my life (though they went nowhere I was still proud of myself). I even went to a start of semester party (the first of been to in my year of college), even getting up and singing some Johnny Cash on the karaoke machine. I ran off and threw up afterwards (I wasn't drunk, before you ask). People are still complimenting me about it. Going to the gym helped me start to lose weight and the physical exertion made me feel happy. I even went back to church for the first time in a long time (that was the source of my PTSD). I felt like I was finally pulling myself out of hell.

But two weeks ago I broke my humerus on the way to classes. It was a really bad break, and I've been in constant pain since. The break itself doesn't bother me, I can get through pain, it's the fact that I can't do anything. I feel useless. I could finally see daylight and just got pulled back to the depths. I can't exercise. I can't write. I can't play many videogames. I can't drive. I can hardly walk. I can't work. I can't donate blood (something i used to do regularly feel good about myself). I have to rely on the rare goodwill of my roommates to leave the apartment for food or for doctor's appointments. They don't want to help, so I've been walking most places. They don't understand that I can't clean my dishes (no dishwasher) until I heal a bit more. Everyone keeps trivializing the injury. It's always ""boo hoo, you broke your arm. I did that as a kid and it wasn't so bad"". No one considers the fact that, just like my mental illnesses I'm fighting this battle alone, I don't have a support group, I don't have my parents to help. 

 All of my old coping tactics are impossible. I've lost all my progress, and it's only going to get worse, as I can't get out of this brace for 5 or 6 more weeks. I've gotten into some really bad levels of sheer despair. I've had invasive thoughts of suicide, which I haven't felt in almost a year. Every day is a struggle to stay sane. I doubt if I can get through this, and even if I do I'm not sure if I can start over again. I just wanted a place to vent, but if anyone has advice on how to keep myself afloat I'll owe you my life.",mentalhealth,"An injury set me back by months of progress against my mental illnesses, I don't know if I can do it all again.",2019-01-22 03:25:57
982,itsjustafoot,1548084768,1,"I stopped seeing my psychiatrist in August because I was tired of being treated like a child. He had a very heavy accent and raised his voice a lot, sometimes snapping at me. He looked at my case file and decided what medication I needed without even consulting me, then appeared irritated when I was reluctant to switch. He made me take a $3000 urine test before he prescribed me anything without giving me a little “Hey, why don’t you make sure insurance will cover this”. He took me off of Paxil for a week right after ramping the dose up by 10 more milligrams. It ruined my life for months. For those of you who haven’t experienced Paxil withdrawal, look it up. It is hell. Went back to see him, shaking, delirious, and vomiting, and he doesn’t know what could possibly be wrong since “that doesn’t exist”.

It’s a low-income clinic. That’s the only way I can rationalize it. 

He wouldn’t put me back on Paxil so I had to get my next bottle from my GP, who I started seeing in May. It’s September now, and I run out of Buspar. I call the clinic and they send her an email. I figure since it’s on my chart and she knows about it, I can expect to get it at the pharmacy in a couple days. 

I don’t hear anything back. 

After two weeks, and I run out of the medication. I think I’m fine for a little while– maybe just a bit anxious– until I run into a trigger and I get a few anxiety attacks. Like real, full-blown ones. I didn’t know I was experiencing a diluted version until I was completely off the Buspar for a bit. Worried, I call into the clinic again and they send her another email. No response, of course. 

So, I’ve been living with the attacks. I was afraid to seek out another psychiatrist. I really thought my GP was just missing the emails because my pediatrician had prescribed all of these for me for years without hesitation when my first psychiatrist retired. I visited my GP in person after a car accident in October. I remembered to bring up the Buspar thing and she tells me to just call my pharmacist so they could send a request to refill to the clinic. I leave and thank her, do everything she says, and realize that I can’t get Buspar from her because she hadn’t prescribed it originally. This is in October. 

Skip forward to November. The car crash made it hard to breath, walk, everything. I am unmedicated for anxiety. I’m living alone in a college dorm miles away. I speak to someone maybe once a week. My mental state is declining. Did I mention I tried to hang myself in August? Well, it was in that same room. I’d think about it every time I looked at the ceiling. I don’t try to find a new psychiatrist. I stop going to therapy. Life sucks, and I don’t wanna live it. Paxil withdrawal threatens me like a gun to the head if I don’t get my next bottle. I let it all just happen to me because I don’t know I deserve any better. 

I moved back home in mid December. My parents are concerned. I lost 15% of my body weight. My BMI is 16.5. I feel weak and sick every day. Anxiety improves a little after moving back and I think I can just go without the Buspar for a little longer. 

That is, until this week. I’m a major hypochondriac and right now I think I must have brain cancer. I’ve had attacks almost every day this week. I passed out in the shower yesterday and luckily sustained no injuries. My shower thoughts aren’t fun and quirky. Me passing out increased said anxiety of brain cancer and made me sick to my stomach. I had enough last night and called the clinic. They said they’d send her an email, like always. 

But this time, she responded and I got a call back. The people at the desk said I’d have to go back to that psychiatrist. She gave me a hard “no”. 

Now, if she had said “no” in September instead of bullshitting me, I would’ve found a new psychiatrist by now. It took four months to see the awful one. You guys should know how bad it is to schedule with psychiatrists. 

It must be that they’re nervous to handle psychiatric medication. These aren’t antipsychotics we’re talking about. This is 7.5mg of Buspar (not a controlled substance). That’s the lowest dose and I took it once a day instead of the recommended twice. It isn’t crack I’m trying to get here. 

If she’s so worried about liability, she could’ve, I don’t know, referred me to a *psychiatrist.* 

I told the people at the desk to remind her that I don’t have one and I really need it. I’m waiting for a call back. She doesn’t need to worry about me coming back. I’ll never see her again.

984,indianmango,1548082320,1,"Hi there. This is my first time posting on reddit and I just finally got around creating an account. I'm writing this on mobile so forgive me for any errors. This would be a pretty long post so I'll thank you now if you do decide to stick around untill the end. 

I'm turning 23 in a couple of months. I'm an albino, and I don't have many friends. I live in the PH. I've been bullied a lot growing up and now as an adult, I struggle to keep eye contact and make genuine connections with new folks. As you might have already guessed, I got an incredibly low self esteem which I think has been the root of all my insecurities in life. 

My mother is diabetic. What little is left from my salary, I send back home for her insulin and other meds. She already lost viision on her left eye, and I fear that the other one will go next soon. She is also losing strength in her legs, and she now relies on her cane to get around.

I quit my first real job  (outsourcing industry in this country is really big) writing product descriptions for ecommerce sites last December. I couldn't stand the office politics, commute (traffic in Manila is hell), and my immediate head was a total ass (demanded more workload with the same pay, and took all the credit for the team's performance).  

I went back home to try my hand at remote, home-based jobs. That way, I can escape the commute and be much closer to family. I just finished my first ever online interview a few hours ago. The company does web development, branding, ecommerce sites/dropshipping, and most of the products that they deal with are adult toys. They'd pay around 600 USD for a month of 40-hour workweeks. That is really beyond entry level pay in my country, with new graduates earning as low as 250 USD a month. 

Problem is that we are talking about sex toys here. I know I can learn as much as I need about these things to write a half decent shopify product description of a fucking butt plug. I know these things are perfectly fine and are not at all taboo in the western cultures, but in here, it is like I'd be crucifying Christ himself if I do take on the job. And I don't think I will live to take on more pressure in my life right now.

Now I've dealt with a lot of pain and frustration and loneliness my entire life, but nothing comes close to the horror of just thinking of the day she goes blind. There is so much anger and sadness inside of me. I see my classmates and friends living their lives, going on vacations, buying stuff without ever worrying about a thing in the world and I fall deeper down the hole of envy and self-loathing.

I'm a mess. I need some input, people. How can I stop feeling the way that I do? How do I force myself to get it together? If you were in my shoes, what would you do to turn your life around?

In turn, she is seven years younger than me, a very innocent, cute, petite catholic girl (I am her first) and she completely adores me. We support one another and we will be married within the year.

So here's the fucked up part. I constantly go behind my fiance's back and have the most hardcore and degrading sex with street prostitutes. I find the most worn out, desperate, drug addicted, and unwashed prostitutes that I can find. I abuse them. I pressure them into anal, oral, and vaginal sex without condoms. I fuck them hard and when they don't like it, it turns me on even more.

When I can't find streetwalkers, I go to strip clubs and watch violent and degrading porn. Not even porn. I like to watch videos of people degrading prostitutes, and even worse. I hang out on /r/watchpeopldie all the time and page through clip after clip of people being flayed alive, limbs cut off, hearts cut out while still beating, crushed in industrial machinery, etc. etc. I force myself to watch them from beginning to end, without looking away.

I honestly have no idea why I do this. I think it's because I was heavily abused all through childhood. I have been doing it since I was about thirteen, and it has become a really powerful drive. I am addicted to it.

When I was in college I discovered 4chan and it only escalated my behavior. I was terrified my first time I acted out my fantasies with a prostitute. I was a senior in college. She was addicted to Oxycontin and let me have anal sex with her after I paid her rent.

Each time it got easier and easier until it became the norm. After the initial rush wore off, I had to escalate my behavior in order to even raise my heart rate.

If my fiance knew it would destroy her completely. I love this girl and I have to deal with this problem before we get married. She is the only bright spot of wholesomeness in my life.

Please help me. I am genuinely afraid of myself and I feel like sometimes when my life is troubled this starts to spiral out of control. Please help. This is not a joke.

PS: I know what you're going to say. Yes, I even did therapy. I lied the entire way through. I was just too embarassed and ashamed to admit anything, and I wanted my therapist to think I was a good guy. I just made up some bullshit about being depressed, which was technically true, but I never told him the real reason why I was depressed.

I also have really violent fantasies about rape, voyeurism, and sex with underage girls. Nobody knows that I have this aspect of me. They all see me as such a nice guy, they don't see that I am actually a monster underneath the thin veil of humanity that I have to wear every day.

I think I am a sex addict. I think I might be kind of a Sociopath. But there's so many more aspects to it than that. Please help me.

1000,stayonmypsandqs,1548058464,1,"Hi everyone, My name is Kyle and I’m 19 years old and I want to thank all of you personally for reading this post, I am going to try to be as honest as possible with myself in this. 

I come from an abusive background, my mother on drugs and neglectful and my stepdad physically and verbally abusive for 10+ years, my real dad not in the picture. As much as I don’t think this affects me today and I am over it, it may be the cause of some of these issues.

For the last few years i’ve been trying to figure out what is wrong with me so I can seek help. I’d say my main issue is the inability to feel most emotions. I don’t get sad very often, I rarely feel guilt or strong connections towards people. For example, when I started this post I was feeling extremely sad, that lasted a whole 2 minutes and I feel better now, better meaning my normal emotionless state. I feel as if people close to me were to die I wouldn’t be upset (my dad, my mom, my grandmother.) In fact, I know I wouldn’t be upset. I would say “damn that sucks.” and life would go on. And I recognize that is a huge problem. These lack of emotions and connecting with people take an extreme toll on my relationships. I have had an amazing girlfriend for almost 2 years and she puts up with all of my bullshit but I can start to see it taking a toll on her. I don’t like to kiss, cuddle, or have sex. in fact I don’t like to do anything intimate at all. I feel very emotionally detached from her most of the time. But sometimes I feel extreme love and affection towards her but I have ZERO clue how to express this. I spend forever just thinking of the things to say, or what to do to show her and it’s gone as quickly as it came and I feel emotionally numb again. This causes her to feel like I don’t love her and I recognize this isn’t fair at all. I will feel this emotionally numb until she tries to leave or break up with me. This drives me absolutely insane. I will break things, cry, scream, hurt myself and do anything to make her come back. At the time I legitimately feel very sad and lonely as well as guilty for the way I acted that made her leave but the second she gives in and comes home, or even If I know she is on the way home I am back to feeling empty. She claims I’m just pretending to be sad to manipulate her and I really hope that isn’t the case. It’s a very scary thought to think I could be manipulating people when I think that I am feeling genuine emotion for once. I tend to age regress and pretend I am still a toddler age.

I feel the need to please women whenever I can to make them like me, give them money, buy them food, etc. I can’t keep a stable job. I try it out for a few days to a few weeks, sometimes walking out mid shift crying. I feel like all of my friends don’t know the real me. I feel like I just match my personality to who i’m hanging out with at the time to make myself more accessible to them. The things I am interested in I feel like nobody understands or wants to talk with me about, I love technology, cars, and music but I can see people get very bored when I start talking about things i’m passionate about, I am the type of person who always wants to know the answer to a question, and why something is the way it is and the reaction I get from most people is “why, it’s not that serious.” and that’s very upsetting to me. cause talking about my interests is one of the few things I can put effort into.

Basically long story short, she was treated poorly by her family and her fiancée, cheating and mental abuse.

I being an empathetic person once complimented on how cute she was in a romantic manner, I realized that wasn’t the best choice. I think I initially wanted to console her, then I developed an interest.

She just told me she wasn’t into me. I apologized a couple times on separate occasions and she seemed cool with it. She even said she’d be down to go the the bar, do fun stuff, this or that, etc.

Maybe I confused her platonic affection for interest? Maybe I’m just experiencing lust?

I feel guilty writing this. Maybe I wanted her to help me with my feelings of loneliness with a companion, and I thought she could help?

It was also pretty easy to see his face in a few of the videos and we are fully convinced it’s him considering when we confronted him about it, really just messing with him not fully believing at this point, the account got deleted almost immediately.

Some details about my friend, he is one of the most straight people that I know. I’m not saying that’s necessarily a good thing, I fully support gay people, but he is simply quite masculine and shows absolutely no sign whatsoever that he is gay. Although he has never had a girlfriend and has never really showed a great deal of interest in a particular girl, he makes comments about girls being attractive all the time. He is literally the last of my friends I would expect to do this, and if any of my friends just came out randomly and proceeded to act the same after the fact, I wouldn’t mind at all, but considering brad had a Twitter that posted some very NSFW stuff and asked certain people to do equally NSFW stuff to him, it’s all just very weird.

Me and my friends started wondering if he has a different personality, possibly even a disorder such as dissociative identity disorder.

I've been able to suppress the rage sometimes but I'm afraid I'll say something I'll regret if it comes to that point. 

I was put  on antidepressant at one point during this,which helped, but I found myself to be numb again so I stopped taking them. Now, I'm starting to get angry again.

These feelings coincided with the onset of my depression and CBT would suggest that these feelings served as an important factor in the worsening of my mental health.

After basically four years of being apart from him since we’ve left school and having blocked him on social media to get some space, my feelings, although diminished, still exist.

Despite being in a relationship with a girl I care about enormously, and having gained a new circle of friends and experiences at university, I still love him. I still find myself crying sometimes about how much I miss him, or about how if only I was with him and could be happy.

I’ve been struggling with some mental health problems for some time now, I seeked help because of possible depression last year before the summer.  The NHS messed up and claimed they saw me, when they never have, this confused me, my GP was on the phone to the NHS (Mental health department) for ages, it was intense. 

I’m almost certain I have social anxiety or similar, my brain tells me everyone is staring and judging, I shake and breakdown sometimes due to social interactions. 

Furthermore, I’ve tried to kill myself, twice. Both were self inflicted wounds, not overly bad but bad enough to raise attention when family members saw it. 

To be honest, I would rather be diagnosed with these problems and get therapy or medication than leave it. However I am honestly scared to seek help again, it’s like the GP doesn’t understand my problems. Even though he probably does. 

I know many of you are going to immediately say YES! But I have extremely important exams soon, I am super limited on time right now, and I really need to focus on getting these grades.

This will sound strange, but my obsession with how I look stemmed from comparing myself with kpop idols that are inhumanely attractive. I know they have layers of makeup and professional stylists with them, but I spend a decent amount of time thinking about what I would look like if I had their stylists.

I'll get very excited about taking myself in a new direction then quickly lose focus and momentum. To be honest I really just like playing video games, listening to (sometimes making) music, and watching TV/Movies that I get really into. Throw in some social interaction, sex, and exercise here and there and I would probably be good for life. It makes me feel lazy that I care so little about figuring out all the things other people are out there doing (relationships, career moves, social activities). Maybe I just don't have the energy for all that?? If I could be anything, I would be a creator (music, writing, movies). But I've only seen that as a fantasy.

Felt like a 50 year old senior. Graduated, got a scholarship to study in europe and used my medical insurance to do the surgery there. I was alone in a foreign country. I remember the doctor asking me after the surgery if someone can pick me from the hospital and I replied by asking him to give me a number for local taxi. He looked confused. When I was done with the surgery, my mom skype called me and blamed all that im through on playing soccer and not listening to her etc. 

I spent weeks secretly seeing a psychotherapist. I tested the waters by asking my wife what she thinks if I went to a psychotherapist and she said “you are not crazy, are you?” Now that she knows Im depressed she sometimes tells me that I should’ve disclosed my depressive tendencies before marrying her cuz she didn’t know that im that bad. Cuz if she knew she wouldn’t have agreed to marry me.

1041,wewora,1548027465,1,"I've been dealing with a stupid amount of new health problems the last 9 months and I'm just so done with having another one pile on. My body is determined to collect as many permanent health conditions/changes for the worse as possible lately, it seems. Like I would just like to get sick for once and get fully, completely better. 

I've had insomnia since May. Felt completely unlike myself because of it all this time, on top of having terrible under eye circles and bags, which made me feel lovely. My skin has been the worst ever in my life. Developed hyperhidrosis in August, which has been awful to deal with. Had neck pain and a chronic headache since August as well. Been out of work and feeling directionless for a while. Unable to meet anyone to have a relationship with, despite trying. On top of having OCD for many many years, which got worse these last few months after getting better for several years.

Now, I finally got a job that I like, don't feel so lost anymore and of course not stressed about finances. My sleep started improving just a little, started feeling more like myself finally. Found out how to manage my hyperhidrosis a little better, and it seemed like it was calming down just a little bit. Skin got a tiny bit better. OCD started getting a little better too. Even met someone who I really enjoy being with and started looking forward to things, feeling like maybe I can actually achieve the life I want, and be an independent, mentally healthy person, and be able to focus on things in my life aside from my health. But I took new medication for my headaches/neck pain, and it caused hormonal changes that changed how my body looks, and it seems like it will be permanent, and I can't ignore it. I just want to scream and cry every time I think about it, and I feel it all the time, whether I'm moving or sitting down. I'm so mad that it happened. It can't be fixed except with surgery, and that's risky, expensive and can have imperfect results.

I'm so done with feeling out of control of my health and my life, and having new problems pop up. I know there are many worse problems in the world, and that I may even be acting spoiled. But I'm so tired of having to adapt and troubleshoot the most basic things because of stupid health conditions. I'm tired of being uncomfortable. I'm tired of having obstacles. I want to have the life I want. I know I'm not a perfect person, but why can't stupid crap like this happen to truly terrible people, like dictators actively trying to make life worse for others? Who in the universe did I piss off that these things keep piling up this year? 

I mostly just needed to get this all off my chest, but I am also looking for advice on how to ignore something that keeps bothering you but that you can't change or that bothers you for the majority of the day.

I have been against going to therapy and getting on meds since being forced to as a child and teenager by my parents. Cut to being nearly 30, transitioning and giving it a shot because hey, maybe itll help now. I started  searching for a therapist who took my insurance and had experience with trans people. Last fall I did some searching and found Therpaist #1. She was okay until she even insinuated that me as a transman could breast feed a possible child my wife and I have. Any decent therapist would know that's a huge dysphoric trigger. So I left her last January.

Found #2 in April after my wife and I went through some really hard relationship stuff. She was great at first. Part of the glbt community. Well versed in trans issues and she had a therapy dog. She was great to talk to but she didn't really /help/. She never wanted to help control my anger or anxiety. She just said everything would be fixed after my gender confirming surgeries this Feb. I stopped seeing her this past Nov.  While seeing her i saw a nurse practitioner for meds. She told me I had a ""gender mood disorder"" and gave me seroquel(which is a mood stabilizer)for sleep and vistaril for anxiety. Telling me that the meds for anxiety where temporary and wed find one that wasn't as needed. Well my insurance doesn't cover visits to nurse practitioners so I had to switch to the psychiatrist that owns the practice. She is only in the office ONE DAY A WEEK. When I  started seeing her in August, she put me on Cymbalta for ADHD, even though I've never heard it used as that and its marketed for depression. I told her I wanted a different anxiety pill, that the previous med dr said wed find something that was more stable than as needed. That didn't happen. Last session I told her again about the intense night terrors and night sweats I'm having because of the seroquel. Her solution was to just up my dose.  The mood disorder diagnoses has never been discussed. I try to bring it up and it gets glossed over.

I'm now seeing therapist #3 who is an older lady that is just isn't with the times. I dont plan to go back and at this time and I'm not seeking therapy further.

However, I dont plan to stop my meds cold Turkey. I do NEED those meds. I just dont think I need those exact meds. It's really hard to find any decent mental health care in my area",mentalhealth,Time for a new drs?,2019-01-21 10:19:57

I became a hypochondriac, my depression and anxiety is off the wall, I have this terrible fear of being alone. The moment I have a house to myself, I am crying, hyperventilating, and I basically just feel like I’m dying until someone comes home. 

Every “symptom” I get, I’m convincing myself it’s some lifelong STD, or some other disease that’s going to end up killing me. Headache, sore throat, fatigue, body aches? Must be HIV. Flushed cheeks, more headaches, side is hurting? Must be appendicitis. Glands that I’ve never noticed before on my genitals? Must be HPV. Bit my cheek in my sleep and now I have a scab type thing? Must be herpes. Possible swollen lymph node? More HIV. For fuck’s sake, I’ve had eczema my entire life and because I’ve been so stressed it’s the worst it’s ever been, and I’m convincing myself it’s not eczema and it’s actually a symptom of something much bigger that could kill me.

I wish I could stop crying on and off until my eyes are literally burning. I wish I could stop taking pictures of the inside of my mouth/back of my throat, or my genital area every 2 hours. I wish I could stop googling shit that’ll make it worse. I wish I could stop spending hours watching videos of people’s stories on different scary things. I don’t know what the fuck my problem is, but it’s so unbearable and I can’t take it anymore.

1047,shoulahby,1548018781,1,"Since fall 2017 I have lost more and more of my confidence up to a point where I became a very introverted, anxious person.

It all began when the summer holidays ended and school started again. I had never had any problems finding friends until then, I had friends in choir, clubs and of course I had some best friends I knew for years. 

When school started, there was a guy I directly noticed, he was rather quiet but you could see that there was something behind this facade. In class he’d often criticize and be more open with his own opinion than anyone I’d known. After some time I just started to text him, just to get to know him, I assured myself, knowing that especially many girls in our class already had a very negative attitude towards him without ever having exchanged a word with him. 

When I told my best friends, that I started texting with him, two of them were happy for me, but the third one just stated “if you’re becoming a couple, we aren’t friends anymore” without telling me any reason at all. 

I was shocked, but proceeded texting him which finally resulted in us becoming a couple and her to eventually ignore me as best as she could and talking badly about us behind our backs with her new friends.

One of my other best friends stayed with me, the other one acted as if there was no problem, ignoring that there were troubles in our group. 

A year later, I’m still happily together with my boyfriend, but having enorme troubles being to open to others. In the back of my head I always look at other people and how they can joke so easily, how they can be friends with everyone and ask myself, how I could ever be able to do so as effortlessly as it should be normal. My boyfriend doesn’t understand the struggles I’m in, he truly loves me and I love him, but we both know that he’s not good at being empathetic and that he’s very self-conscious.

I’d really appreciate any tips on how to fight these struggles, so that I can be as outgoing as I’ve once been :).

I never made a post on here before and to be quite honest, I only discovered this subreddit today.  I've been looking for a place for a few months now to talk with others and to connect with them, so I'm glad that I found this page, especially after today.  I just needed a safe place to vent and I'm glad I stumbled upon this page.

Today I broke down into tears for no reason at all, my wife found me in the dark listening to music crying for no reason. She's been really supportive of me and I love her for that. Sometimes though I find it difficult to talk to her about my mental health because in my mind I have this cliche that I need to be the strong one, I guess it goes to show no matter how hard I try to shed that stigma in my mind it still exists like a brick wall refusing to fall. Maybe one day I'll be able to let down all my defenses and truly open up.

Lately, my depression/anxiety has been the worst it's ever been but I'm taking the battle day by day and not letting it win. I recently discovered the book by Matt Haig called ""Reasons to Stay Alive"" and I'm finding that it's helping a lot. It helps to know that there are people going through the same battles as me. So before I go today I would like to share with you a quote from the book that really changed my perspective this week.

“Depression is also smaller than you. Always, it is smaller than you, even when it feels vast. It operates within you, you do not operate within it. It may be a dark cloud passing across the sky but - if that is the metaphor - you are the sky. You were there before it. And the cloud can't exist without the sky, but the sky can exist without the cloud.”

I can’t change it, I just can’t control it. Gratefulness is a good thing, but why stick to a life I don’t want when I can donate it to others? Worst thing is, I want to die and don’t want to die. I mean life is cool and it has the things I dream of, but I can’t control it. And I don’t want to die because it’s scary. Like it’s there but not for me. Kinda sucks, neither life nor death is in my favor. I mean motivation, books, self development, success. It’s all delusion to feel better isn’t it? I wanted to succeed. It’s not that I am giving up on my dreams; they’re just impossible. I kind of got lost, that I don’t even know what I actually want. Guess I am too nice for this world. You know? If I wasn’t afraid of death, I might have not been alive to write this post. I don’t want to die, but life sucks. I have been lying myself to feel better about myself, I just hate myself. Why the tears they coming out. Everything just sucks, I keep trying to get busy in things and act interested to forget about the pain I suffer. I act like I am interested in being an engineer, or a top college students. I am just lying to myself to get busy off the pain. Even when hope comes, and expectations rise: sucky people just remove your hopes and get your expectations down. 

I have been lying to myself since childhood, being dragged by the circumstances I was born in. I always hated myself, and lied to me about it. I am such a shitty person. I am a hypocrite. People have always lied to me out of pity, and I pretended to believe them. I’ll just face myself. I suck financially, socially, intellectually, from every direction. Self-esteem? Huh it’s just a delusion. People pretend to help, and I pretend that I am being helped. I know there are people far off worse me, and I feel them aswell. Indeed, I always wanted to be a billionaire so I can help. I don’t only carry my pain, I carry theirs as well.

CBT? CGT? All these therapy short forms ending with T? It’s all just me deluding myself, it doesn’t change the truth. This life sucks so much, Life’s just unfair and we have to accept it.  Some kids are sitting on millions and everybody loves them because they were born in a rich family, good for them. It seems life is all about fortune. I am done using Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates as role models. These two were just lucky, and rich already.!

Like always, some might call me a troll, attention-seeker, bla bla bla, all this criticism. Well, I just decided to post this because it’s just better and faster to write it down instead of pain in my mind.

Lastly, I would like to say: it’s not depression. Depression exists because life sucks so much and I get depressed because life sucks so much.  Life is nice, but it’s made for some people. I carry not only my pain, but others’ pain. I feel them.

The only way to keep myself from thinking about it is to talk to people, who I'm unsure if they're friends or not at this point. Get drunk, smoke, or have sex. I am trying to cut them all out for the time being, sex I have cut out due to the fact I feel used and horrible afterwards right now. I feel like shit all of the time, and I don't feel like anyone actually cares about me anymore besides my family (which I am over 1000 miles away from). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have started developing some terrible feeling in my stomach whenever I'm not around at least one other person besides my roommate, and have started having issues with my work because of this. Along with that I had an ex who lets just say I had to go to therapy over first term. I feel worthless, and it's only made worse because of the fact that she cheated on me many, many times. She trash talked me when I had a panic attack. I only found out about that shit when we were about to break up.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm outrunning my problems to stay alive right now, and some people apparently think I put too much energy into relationships and stuff and have called me annoying because of that. The only way I don't have that is by being a social butterfly and changing up who I spend time with every day, and I don't have any close friends it feels like. I just don't want to do it anymore, I don't want to run anymore because it's so so much energy. I miss being loved by someone that seems to care about me, I miss intimacy, I miss having people I could rely on for some stuff and having a shoulder to cry on. From what I understand though, most people enjoy me, at least when we're partying people love me and they say so but only sometimes. I can show up anywhere and get in and it's a fun time, but it's rare for me to get an invite so I have to do a lot of work to keep up with everyone.",mentalhealth,I think about killing myself every day,2019-01-21 04:57:44

For example, on websites I try to refrain from posting too much of my personal information due to privacy issues and I don't know maybe due to some paranoia of someone tracking me down or something. I know this sounds a bit too much so far but it's just something I try to do.

Also, I don't want to leave traces behind online and I mostly delete or again try to delete whatever I posted/said online. What's more I really try to have the most perfect Steam library meaning I hate having around unused games or games that I deem unworthy or just bad. They don't even have to be bad in the sense of gameplay just either awful presentation in the UI or they make grammatical mistakes or the textures look bad. I am even willing to go as far as to delete my Steam account for those reasons. I just don't like having things out of place or having irregularities. Also, on Steam I absolutely despise when people post low effort guides or ugly screenshots or just have weird names with numbers or all lower caps or strange symbols.

She wants to seek help from a professional therapist yet her parents are ignorant and aren't supportive. I asked her if she tried talking to our school guidance counselor... she said it only made matters worse. The guidance counselor told her parents about what she's going through (her possible mental illness + unsupportive parents) even though she didn't want her parents to know because of obvious reasons. Because of that, her parents got even more mad at her maybe for making assholes out of them (well it's true anyway, they're legit assholes.) No help at all. She attempted suicide once, fortunately me and her friends were able to stop her. I really don't fucking know what to do at that time but I tried my best to save her. I'm genuinely concerned, she needs professional help yet she can't receive it, the least I could do is always be there for her as a friend. I devote most of my time talking to her, listening to her rants, etc. But what can I do to treat her? To provide her the help she needs? I'm only a dumb and naive 13-year-old.

This is what she sent me describing them: [https://scontent.fmnl3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-0/p280x280/50581432\_2278358285781954\_2485430010064666624\_n.jpg?\_nc\_cat=101&amp;\_nc\_ht=scontent.fmnl3-1.fna&amp;oh=936f1d7d0d2425688436da930feeb650&amp;oe=5CC0A0FB](https://scontent.fmnl3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-0/p280x280/50581432_2278358285781954_2485430010064666624_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fmnl3-1.fna&amp;oh=936f1d7d0d2425688436da930feeb650&amp;oe=5CC0A0FB)

(let me know whether the link works or not)

&amp;#x200B;

Even when she's awake she told me as well that she can see these ""monsters."" These creatures repeatedly kept saying to her that they're going to take away her loved ones. No one else believed her but me and some few other friends. Her parents told her that it was ""all just in her head"" so they won't take her to therapy. That's all she ever wanted. I thought about saving up from my allowance so I can help her since she says she has no money for it... but I realized even if we have the money her parents won't turn her in. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to help her? Advice please. (sorry for bad English.)

1086,oj109,1547977032,1,"When I was 16, I moved countries and into a new high school in a big city.

I grew up in a dysfunctional home but I was also pretty sheltered because I grew up in a small town. At the time, some of my peers in my new high school didn't like me and I couldn't understand why. I became traumatised by my new high school experience, because in my previous school, I was the popular one and now I was the weird outcast. At that time, I felt like everyone was out to get me, but in hindsight they gave me lots of chances and tried to include me but I just misread them and looked for every possible hint of social rejection because of deep-seated feelings of shame. I was just this reactionary empty vessel with no sense of identity.

It's not until 5 years later (with intensive therapy and self help books plus some more socialisation) that I now realise that their maturity level back then is what mine is currently now. Now my mind is crystal clear and I can easily connect with people nowadays whereas before, I had this permanent fog to my mind where I had a mix of OCD, ADHD and anxiety which resulted in extreme shyness and me inadvertently appearing rude because I had an uptight personality (a coping mechanism)

I feel so despondent because I missed such a vital part of the growing up process (late adolescence) where most people had their first girlfriend, became more independent and seamlessly transitioned into adulthood. And high school where I am currently now forms the basis for most people's lifelong freindships. They were good people that wanted to be freinds with me, and they would've been a wonderful social network for me. I wish I could go back in time and set my life on a different path.

1088,fivesixfivefourfive,1547973935,1,"Life is full of responsibilities.

Work takes up 35% of your awake hours, assuming 40hr/week and a recommended 8hrs of sleep. This isn’t even counting time commuting or getting ready for work. It can easily go up to 40% of your time with just an hour of getting ready. 

Then there are responsibilities like shelter, eating, clothing, cleaning, car bills, internet bills, phone bills, electricity/water bills, staying healthy, whatever else.

Let’s just say it all adds up to 50% of your time (which is me being nice). All that time is spent in misery. There is nothing enjoyable about it. And it is nonnegotiable.

Shouldn’t the other 50% of life make up for what’s required of a person? Shouldn’t it, at least, cancel out? If not, then the majority of life is spent in misery.

What is supposed to be enjoyable, anyways? 

Relationships tend to have issues. They’re full of compromise and settling. People tend to get sick of each other.

Drugs are fun until they eat away at you.

Hobbies are pointless. They either become boring quickly or end up feeling like work over time. They’re just a waste of energy.

What’s the reason to even live?

There are so many religions, it’s tiresome to bother learning about them.

If there is no meaning, then why does it matter if someone decides to stop living?

I've been reading some of the posts here and after seeing some of the truly difficult rough lives some people here are sadly experiencing I genuinely feel bad posting here, like, what right do I have to complain?

I was battling depression up until a year ago, as for a period of 2 years I have been jobless and lonely. Then I have found a new job and started making progress, but the truth is that I'm still not happy. 

I live in a big city, there are people all around me, but my friends are mostly married or with kids, so hanging out with them only happens once in a while. On weekends I'm usually alone in my apartment and just have a general feeling of being left out.

I find myself having pretty drastic mood swings, I can feel great one day and depressed the next day, raising existential questions all of a sudden, what am I doing here? Meaning of life and all that.

Being 33, it's becoming harder and harder to find new people to meet and hang with, I've tried creating some social relationships with a few people from work but it didn't work out. I've been dating women but unfortunately not able to advance to a meaningful relationship.

Therapy is also something I've tried many times over the years, but I never felt like it works for me. I'm on SSRI (Cipralex) pills for 3 years and while it did help reduce depression and better cope with life, my general feeling is still of emptiness.

I try to look at my life objectively and focus on what's good, but sometimes as you're all aware, it doesn't matter what you have if deep down you just don't feel well.

What can I do to make myself feel better? Do you have ideas on how to create new social relationships? What activities/treatments I should try to better my life?

She's not in any immediate danger, but I will be staying up all night just to make sure nothing happens. She's been dealing with depression and an unspecified eating disorder but more recently has been ""losing time"" I suppose you could call it. This evening she left our dorm room while some friends were over. We didn't think much of it initially as we assumed she was going to visit someone on another floor and she seemed fine. 

After a little while we started to worry when she didn't respond to texts or phone calls when we knew she had her phone on her. We called the person we assumed she was visiting and they said they hadn't seen her. At this point we those of us left looked all over the areas of the building that we could get into and some of our friends checked around the outside of the building, but we still couldn't find her. With no other places we could think of where she could be, the friends went home, as it was now very late, but we continued to make a few calls. Just as we decided were going to find our resident advisor and contact the police, she walked in seemingly fine. 

When we asked her where she'd been, she said she didn't remember. Apparently, this has happened before. She's on Zoloft and has been to the hospital for both depression and her eating disorder in the past few months. Tomorrow morning we're obviously going to get some professional help, but I'm not sure what I can do for her personally and to help make sure this doesn't happen again. I don't want to invade her privacy, but it's quite concerning that she was gone for a long period of time, with no memory of where she was, in the middle of the night, somewhere not in or around our dorm. Should I ask her to share her location with someone on her phone so we can always find her or is there something we can do to make sure she doesn't leave when she doesn't know what she's doing?

I get some tests and blood draws taken and I’m told to wait in a room for a doctor. The doctor comes in a bit and starts off asking questions about the health issue that I was there about. The questions then start shifting towards mental health issues, and I was asked a lot of very deep questions and I had to try super hard not to cry. 
I’m also an international student, so I didn’t really know how health care worked here, or that my doctor would come and ask me questions about my mental health.
He finally finished with the questions and told me that he had made me a referral to the university psychological services, and the paper he handed me had the words depression and anxiety written on it in addition to my original ailment. I was overwhelmed.
Time and time again, I’d been told by my family and myself that I didn’t really have any mental health issues and that it was just how my brain worked, I had nothing to be depressed or anxious about, etc. I had accepted that and resigned myself to the fact that I’d never have a fulfilling life, or even a life. Now, all of a sudden, I have this kind doctor with a degree actually validating my mental health issues. When I told my mom that I might be depressed, she took me to a place of worship and asked me to pray, saying that would definitely “cure” me. When I told my sister, who actually has a Ph.D., that I would like to see a therapist, she dismissed it by saying that drugs were bad and that therapists were for crazy people.
I feel so thankful for this and oh my god I was crying all day yesterday.

1100,fluteluke,1547958885,1,"First, let's get this out of the way: this is a post about non-intimate touch by licensed professionals and that's all I want to talk about.

I have MDD and SAD, have had several great therapists, and am taking fluoxetine daily. That said, my moods still fluctuate. I'm self-employed, and tie a lot of my happiness into career successes. When things don't go well, I tend to withdraw, watch Netflix, and drink lots of alcohol. This makes me feel shitty, which usually pushes me further into the blanket fort, so to speak, until I'm in a full-on depressive episode or can break out of the cycle.

Something I love to do to break the cycle is self-care.

1) I have a monthly massage membership that I purchased for chronic pain (a repetitive strain injury that started parties through my career, which is a whole other later to my career/happiness issues); now it has become mentally therapeutic. I use the sessions as a touch-based meditation, and feels wonderful to allow my body to feel good and not think about anything else.

2) If you can't afford a massage, find a good practitioner, or don't feel good about getting naked-ish in front of a stranger: get your hair done! Man, woman, non-binary, go get your hair shampooed and trimmed. Maybe don't even get a trim if you don't want/need it, but even just going and getting my scalp massaged and my hair shampooed, towel dried, and brushed by someone else feels so simple but so powerfully comforting.... It's awesome. I don't know if it's like a childhood thing, like my mom fixing my hair as a kid? Maybe it's the same kind of thing as the massage.

I think that having someone whose job it is to take care of me, even though I'm paying them for it, can be incredibly comforting. I'm in control of if so I feel like I'm taking an active step in something.

TL;DR I get massages or get my hair washed when I'm depressed and even though it's not a personal connection, it makes me feel human and loved again.",mentalhealth,The power of touch,2019-01-20 15:34:45

I more or less understand the clinical definition but we are still figuring out what this means for our lives together.

He has dealt with depression and suicidal tendencies since he was a kid, but once he hit his twenties he started hearing “noise,” which gradually developed into whispering, then recently into distinct voices (one voice tells him to hurt himself, another to hurt others, another just says random nonsense) along with delusions (ie that I am an alien) and paranoia (can’t be near windows because people are trying to shoot him - sometimes thinks that I am trying to kill him). He is usually able to logic his way out of them pretty quickly, but the lag time for him to stop believing it’s real gets longer and longer. It got so bad so quickly that a few months ago he admitted himself into the inpatient program at the hospital, and for a while everything was great on the new meds. The depression has stayed away but the paranoia and hallucinations are quickly coming back (which is why they changed his diagnosis) despite the doctor upping his dosage at med review last week. The intensity makes it difficult for him to function in daily life, struggling to get through a day working at a gas station whereas when I met 5 years ago he was somewhat of a genius biochemistry student.

An important request! 

My name is Alex I'm seeking individuals who are interested in speaking with me about mental illness for my YouTube Channel Project Healing Minds.

Anyone who's interested in sharing their experiences related to mental illness, the battle, the overcome, the stigma really anything that could bring hope and a sense of community to others. My vision for this channel is to build a safe space where anyone in a time of need can log on and watch your stories and feel a sense of community, hope, and safety. I'm in CT and looking for people who are in the surrounding states. If you're not from CT or within driving distance of CT we can talk about how to do an interview together. I don't want anyone to feel like they can't share based on location. We'll make it work!  If you're interested please send me an email at projecthealingminds@gmail.com or message me here.

1115,jocelinekamajaya,1547951192,1,"Hi there. I'm a student studying abroad. I've only been here for a couple of months. It was fine in the beginning but it all went downhill. Now I'm at such a low point that I'm not even sure what's the problem or what's bothering me.

I wanted to switch universities next year to be closer to my sister, but the system is too complicated that my family thinks its too risky. I spoke to my sisters and they all said the same thing: just deal with it and try to make your life better. But I can't. Some days I just breakdown in class and can't continue. I can't even do basic chores and take care of myself properly, even though I want to do it. 

Today, I saw a text between my sisters saying that it was my fault that I didn't go to the same uni in the first place. And they were talking on how I don't want to put effort into getting better. I do want to get better, but I can't pick myself up. My parents aren't much help either. They just tell me to make friends and go to church.

So now I'm just wondering, is it really all my fault? Did I let myself fall this low? And why can't I seem to help myself? I really don't think I'm capable of continuing my studies right now, but I can't even pinpoint the reason of my problems.",mentalhealth,Is really all my fault?

1117,KakkenSlapper,1547949903,1,"Quite a long story. I'm not native speaker, but I think I can express myself clearly. I welcome any opinion about this, even if negative, loathing or anything. I deserve it. Advice is welcome too. I don't want emphathy, for I cannot give any. That being said :

Is it the family I grew in? Is it the people I once called friends? Is it the evergoing hatred that once grew in me? 

I cannot tell.
With that being said : 

Eversince I was a kid, I longed for approval. 
I always thought I'd belong to somewhere, at some point of life. It never was that. 
When I started to lose the thought of approval, I became violent, even in kindergarten. I kicked other children off one (not very high) bridge, that was in the yard, they were always the ones that couldn't even speak. I once took an icy snowball, and punched my best friend as hard as I could in the face with it. I took a friend with me, and we beat one kid up damn hard, and he was my good friend also. I never knew that it was wrong. I've never had the skill, or the conscience to differ the right from wrong. Even today. 
I have no remorse. 

My brother was sent to a family home by child services, because I became too violent with him, everyday, I beat him up, and there were no signs of it stopping. I terrorized my whole family, stole money, even as a child I could manipulate almost everyone to my will, no one expected that child that young could. As I was eleven, I was so violent that even my parents couldn't intervene when I beat my brother up, they were too afraid of me, attacking them the same way I did with others. 

I always had good social skills, more often people come to get to know me, there hasn't been a time where I've got a friend by taking the first step. Always others. I'm weird, never shared anything common with anyone that I've known. 
I've acted like I did.
I've always hidden myself behind the mask, as there is no one who I could talk to. 
Ever been, and never will. I know, that most of people would really, really be afraid to sticking around, the rest wouldn't be able to trust me. 

Mt brother and I are now in peace. I've apologized. He forgave me. Why, why the hell would he forgive me something that ruined his FUCKING CHILDHOOD? 
I cannot forgive myself. I ruined our family. 
I've never been bullied, by anyone. 
My father was a bit aggressive, but never hurted me. Oh, the yelling.. Didn't do anything. 

But onwards, to this state of life. I'm now 22, I've always manipulated and deceived people, without feeling guilt. I haven't been violent since I was teen, I've only asked for pain. I've harmed myself, tried to kill myself. With medicine, alone, and took so much that it should kill anyone. It didn't. With blades, and drugs. Why can't I just go? Where am I needed? What am I supposed to do? 
For now, I have nothing left. 
My behaviour has driven everyone away, and there is still people who cares too fucking much, I've done anything I would to get them to stay away. I don't care about them, and neither should they care about me. 
Only thing I can, and will do is to hurt them, not physically, but emotionally. 
I get what I want, the way I want. Always. 
I don't care about anything, that is on my way. 
I'm ready to ruin my own life, to achieve it. 

I want to burn, I don't want anyone to burn because of me. 

This week, I've pushed away the 3 close ones, that I could really talk to about this all. (Not all of it, obviously) 
But there is one of them, that made me feel the one special feeling, something there never was before. 

Shame, guilt, and left me more empty than ever. Even if she sticks around, I won't be there for her, anymore. I've shut myself off from her.

I've got nothing left. I am truly empty. ",mentalhealth,I am truly empty.,2019-01-20 13:05:03

1119,trextitan1234,1547947425,1,"Ok so to keep it to the point, I've been struggling with doing my work on time or even being able to do simple things that involve time management?

My first thought was maybe I have ADD or ADHD, but after both trying Adderall for a bit and seeing a psychologist, both me and her are equally as sure that this isn't what it is. The Adderall does help focus me in, but the problem isn't that I can't focus its just that at a certain point I refuse to? 

For instance, when I've had work assigned that I need to complete in a week's time and I'll have Adderall, I simply don't do the work, not because there are more interesting things that attract my attention, but simply because I don't want to YET. 

I only end up then doing the work when the clock starts ticking down, and it's odd to explain, but it's a tad thrilling? Ive done projects that should take 2 weeks in 2-4 days, and I've studied material that needs huge sessions to understand in a small amount of times. I end up watching my lectures at 4x speed 2 days before an exam, and work comprehensively to make sure it's all well.

Its not that I hate work, it's that it just feels like it isn't a challenge. I'm not lazy, I feel bored, and just not stimulated, so I wait until the absolute last minute. 

But this really ok? The course work requires time to take in and quantify and doing it overnight doesn't help that cause, I'm definitely not an A student, but much the rather a C student who's passing due to working the bare minimum at the last minute.

I recently had a phone assessment for anxiety with a NHS therapist but forgot to really talk about something which *could* potentially be a sign of a personality disorder.

I definitely don't want to self diagnose but I don't want to make a fool of myself by phoning up and asking if they could test me so I thought I'd check here first.

So, does anyone know if it would be possible to ask for a test with the NHS or whether I should go private?

Adopted from Russian to KY, USA. Adopted as a baby from an unknown family with a twin sister. Both raised in a loving southern home. Now the son is openly gay in a town that is not the best known area for LBGTQ families or people that aside, he is and has been showing signs of aggression towards his family including his two sisters (one younger and twin). Along with his aggression he has been compulsively lied about any and everything to his family, has stolen money and items around the home. He is not using drugs (they tested)

The mother and father have been told that he has some sort of mental disconnection and that it could go away somewhere in his twenties. I do not know the name of such said diagnosis. They have said if he acts out again in one of his rages and attempts to hurt anyone in the house they’ll have no choice but to seek a detention home for him. 

I am not posting this here to discuss morals of such places or how they’re parenting skills are so if you have such negative comments please go along your way. 

I am posting to ask this community for help in finding a place or organization that can help HIM. To find a treatment or program that can steer his path in a good way to balance his mind. He knows right from wrong but doesn’t see a difference of it in some aspects of his life.

1142,Robot_with_human,1547928768,1,"Hi thanks in advance,

I have been working at my job in (Finance) for 3 years and my supervisor, every time I ask him a question on a project, will call me out in front of the team, reprimand me for asking a question and/or condescendingly, in a aggressive way, explain things to me in a very hostile and negative manner. Here is a short list of things he has said to me in an **open office** setting wherein everybody can hear:

1. ""Okay, how many times have I told you, not to interrupt me while I'm thinking"" after I politely ask him a question.
2. ""How have you been here for three years and still don't know how to run analyses"" after I ask him what areas should our analysis focus on.
3. ""You cannot use prior work as a template for the current ask. this looks terrible, where did you even get this information from?"" after he reviews my work. 
4. ""Can you come here i have a question for you."" I walk over to his desk. He makes me wait for about 2-3 minutes and the says, ""never mind, I found the answer"": he has done this about 3 to four times   
I know that there are certain personalities and traits that come with people in finance field but we work on the same floor with upper management and this is what hurts me the most; I see how upper management and my coworkers look at me every time he ridicules me and/or treats me that way. I feel helpless and angry at the same time and completely isolate myself from coworkers feeling shameful and embarrassed. It has even carried over into my personal life in which I am super quiet around my wife and kids and don't wan't to do anything with them. I grew up in a very masculine (factory working household) environment where violence and yelling was the answer to everything so im used to dealing with angry people and hurtful comments. And I have thick skin and rarely have petty incidents like these affect me but have a family to provide for. But over the last 6 months or so I have let it get to me and for some reason am unable to shake the anger and the shame I feel because of my supervisor. I brought it up to the director of our department through two different emails after two separate occasions and she said she has spoken with my supervisor and/or will ""take-care of it."" And since then, the director has left and for about the last year and a half, I've been dealing with his pompous A-hole. I have also spoken to him on multiple occasions but he still continues to treat me this way. 

I know i can get another job but this job pays me well and the health care insurance is the best I've ever had ( my wife has a medical condition with expensive drugs for treatment), so leaving will be a financial mistake on my part and out of the realm of possibilities. 

I'm so angry at myself for setting myself up and placing myself in situations where he can do this to me. I always blame myself. I have tried to avoid dealing with him through headphones, going to other coworkers with questions and ignoring his snide comments but here we are. I am mad and have not talked to any of my coworkers for five days since the last incident. 

​

I've also gone to HR but HR sides with him cause upper management loves the work product that he provides and tells HR to tell me to ""lighten-up""

1160,Fratellaroni,1547907244,1,"Hi, I'm completely new to Reddit so I apologize if I'm not using this correctly.

I decided to join Reddit so I could get some insight from people that might have the same issues as I do. I only recently became open to my mother about the things going on in my head, and now that I've started talking about everything out loud, I'm beginning to realize it's not all exactly normal. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life, and was diagnosed with depression by my doctor when I was 13 after seeing my grandmother go into cardiac arrest and pass. I feel like I have overcome the depression, but not as much the anxiety. My mom's had health problems my whole life, and the older I get, the worse they get. About 2 years ago, my mom was diagnosed with an incurbale form of leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis. She was also diagnosed with gastroparesis after she had her gastric bypass reversed. She can't eat anything at all, and has to get all of her nutrients through a feeding tube. She's in pain nearly everyday and it hurts me so much seeing her like this because I love her dearly and I just wish I could help.   
I don't exactly know how to get everything into one post so I'm just going to list all of my odd ""problems"".   

* For the past year, I've been struggling with dissociation. 
   * This first manifested when I was a child. I used to dissociate whenever my anxiety was through the roof. It feels like I'm not at all apart of my body, and like I have no control over my body. The best way I can describe it is like watching life through a tv, or like life is just one long dream. It simply just doesn't feel real. I only had episodes like this every now and then when my anxiety was really bad, but I feel like I've been stuck in this state for well over a year. I thought this was because I smoked weed, but I've stopped smoking and I think it's gotten worse. I space out and feel completely disconnected almost everyday. It makes it very hard to concentrate on everything from reading, to holding complete conversations. 
* I'm an extremely paranoid person.
   * Now I talked to my mom about this, and she's pretty paranoid about some of the same things as me. Like I absolutely cannot go into public by myself without having an anxiety attack because I think every person that walks past me is going to attack me or snatch me. I think this is caused by all the shit I hear in the news, and my mom is equally paranoid about this. I've coped with this by bringing headphones with me everywhere I go so I can listen to music. Music is the only coping mechanism I've found that can actually calm me down.
   * Now this is where I think the paranoia is getting out of hand. I have an irrational fear of people hearing my thoughts. This started when I was a freshman, and I would ride the bus home. I would listen to my music and just talk to myself in my head and get lost in imaginary worlds. I don't know why, but I just started freaking out thinking everyone can hear what I'm thinking about. I know in my head that it is literally impossible for people to hear my thoughts, but I still have this problem. When I'm in public, I make it a point to say in my head, ""If you can hear me, raise your hand."" Of course nobody has ever raised their hand but I still have this fear. 
   * I'm paranoid of the government and hackers watching me through my cameras in my devices. I used to cover my laptop camera with tape, now I just tilt the screen back far enough so I know they can't see me. I'm also scared of them looking at my search history and constantly looking at whatever I do on my laptop and phone. I don't do anything illegal or even remotely weird. I only use my laptop for school (I do online school now) and every now and then to play video games. 
   * I live across the street from a school, so there's always people there and tons of cars. Even though I know the people are there because they work there, I still have episodes where I think someone is actually over there watching my house. There was one day in particular that I watched a white S.U.V. pull into the school parking lot, and I was overcome this feeling that they weren't there for school. I went around the house and closed all the blinds and sat in my room watching that one car. Of course, they never came over to the house, but I was still having a panic attack over it. This has gotten a little better because I constantly remind myself of that particular event, and remind myself that everyone in the parking lot is there for school. But I still have a deep gut feeling that people park at the school to watch my house.  
   * I live on a very sharp corner, so people have to go pretty slow around it. I tell myself over and over that people HAVE to go around the corner slow, but I still have this gut feeling that they're going so slow because they're looking into my windows, or they're sizing up the house to break in. 
   * I have episodes where I think people are in my house. I go around looking in every room for anybody, and I yell out to make sure nobody is there. This is extremely irrational because I have 6 dogs who bark at everybody and everything. So I know for a fact that if somebody were in my house, my dogs would let me know right away. 
* I have lots of ups and downs.
   * One day I can be super happy and productive. I clean the house, smile all day, and be super affectionate to my dogs and family. But then there's days where I wake up so fucking agitated. There will be no rhyme or reason to my downs. I've stopped reading the news on my phone in the morning because I thought maybe this was the cause of my downs. But it hasn't really changed. When I have my downs, I try to seclude myself from my family because even if they're all happy, any tiny little thing they say to me will make me even more agitated and I don't want to keep lashing out at them for no reason. 

This post is kind of a mess, but I needed to try and fit as much info in as I could. If anybody at all could help me it would be greatly appreciated it. I do eventually want to talk to a professional about all this, but I'm still working up the courage to do so. If anybody has any of the same problems, please let me know...

1163,mimi897,1547899976,1,"My best friend is having her second psychotic episode. Her first one was 5 years ago, when she was 24. She started accusing everyone of things that were not real, had visual hallucinations and made no sense at all. She went back to normal after a couple of days of medication. She was on it for about 2 years, then stopped taking it and was totally normal.

Her personality changed a lot though. She used to be super bubbly and lively and spontaneous. We were always the loudest everywhere we went and laughed the hardest. Since her first episode, she became an introvert, thinks everything super logical, had an 180 degrees career change and her empathy is lower (she isnt mean or selfish; she just doesn’t perceive things especially emotions if you dont tell her directly). I had to change a lot too and have always made sure she was comortable and not in situations that made her feel insecure and so on (large group of people, crowded areas, crazy lights, didn’t let anyone touch her phone or didn’t answer anyone questions about her etc).

I didnt know she hadn’t seen her psychatrist in two years. I began noticing something was off in summer and one month ago I was sure. She told me about some thought patterns she was having - the same as last time ( connecting memories and things that had no real connection to each other and being paranoid she is tracked and people want to hurt her).

She seeked help. Unfortunately things progressed to fast and now she is in a full blown psychotic episode again. We live in different countries and can’t do much. I begged her parents to get her fast to a doctor but they wouldn’t listen. Her friends over there the same.

I love her, she has been my best friend since 9th grade, I can’t imagine life wihout her. But I can’t imagine life anymore like this either - me always picking up the pieces, always being in the back and making sure she is OK whenever we hang out, then her going off the rails again, telling me the worst imaginable things (I know she is ill and it’s not really her, but we know each other so well, everything she says hits all my buttons), everybody else being super chill about it (let’s not upset her, let’s take things one step at a time etc - her parents have known about this for 2-3 weeks and just because she talks with them they think it’s not that bad this time and are not hurrying at all to get her medication. And all this time she is living alone abroad, isolating herself and god knows how much sleep or food she gets. One week ago she looked pale as a ghost and 3 kilos lighter when she is already thin). I feel all alone in this. 

Has anybody been successful with a similar situation? After her first episode the doctor said it might be paranoid schizophrenia, but had to monitor her. I guess he was right. I just feel tired of always paying attention to all the tiny details so she is comfortable, of dealing with her lack of empathy (which I know is only because of her condition) only for her not to go to the doctor, for her parents to be totally chill about it and then about this whole thing. It’s like they don’t realise a car could hit her anytime because she sleeps two hours a night because she is too busy looking for tracking devices in her house or overthinking everything.

Im just so tired of all of this and feel all alone in trying to help her and totally useless. I don’t know what to ask of her when she gets better besides to see her psychatrist on a regulat basis and go to therapy. I don’t even want to imagine going through this again. I don’t know how everybody else have the ability to distance themselves from the situation so well. It’s totally ruining my wellbeing and makes me feel frustrated, angry, lonely and just sad.

I thought it would be us taking over the world. And now it’s us working it out until all falls to pieces and I can’t do anything about it and no one will take me seriously or truly try to help get het back to normal :(",mentalhealth,"[ADVICE] How to be a good friend without losing it, too?",2019-01-19 23:12:56

I went through some breathing exercises with her that really helped me control my anxiety. So I feel like I have really tried to get to the heart of my issues. 

However, the anxiety does still persist. Its affecting my sleep, I will do everything in one day to get to sleep, be exhausted, exercise that day, read, put phone on aeroplane mode an hour before, masturbate and write. Yet it seems to take me hours to fall asleep because I have this anxious energy inside me. I now have really bad eczema which is correlated with my anxiety. It's all over my scalp and can bleed and create puss.

Basically, I have tried to deal with my issues in a healthy way. But I feel the anxiety is so heavily in grained in me because of my formative years that it will take year and lots of discipline, Ie meditation everyday. I feel like am genetically disposed to this kind of thing, my dad has also had anxiety, my mum had an eating disorder for ten year and both my grandma's have been on antidepressants.

I am now in my last year of university and have to write my thesis this semester. Everything is overwhelming, however, I feel like that's coming out in physical ways like my sleep. I am starting to think about using anxiety medication as a stop gap to get myself through my last semester. Can any one offer any advice about them? 

TL;DR I am in final year of university and feeling very anxious. Tried to deal with anxiety in counselling but feel like it will be a long journey. Can anyone offer advice on using anti-anxiety medication?

About 11 months ago I'd got a crush on a guy who didn't felt the same way about me and, long story short, he left (actually I pushed him away). Before that we would argue all days about anything and I started ruminating about anything (that situation, my university condition, family, friends and pretty much all my life). In the same period I started having panic attacks at night and so my insomnia got worse (I've got insomnia since high school). The panic attacks are gone, but I got really bad mood swings (from extremely angry to complete  despair, rarely happy). My plans for the future are gone and I've become very uncertain and ashamed about myself. Sometimes I even think that all the things that I'm feeling and thinking are just lies. A few months ago I pushed away all my friendships except for one. I rarely talk to my family and for my tendencies to be alone I'm terrified to remain single and without friends all my life.

I started this post with my ""heartbreak"" experience (it's ridiculous to use this word, but that was the feeling) because I began experiencing  discomfort from then, but I'm sure that it isn't the only cause. So 11 months are passed and I'm still frozen. I haven't a job (here it's hard to find one and knowing myself I would just quit university and began to work disappointing my family) and don't want my mom (my father died when I was 12) to pay for the therapist sessions also.

I'm sure I'm missing out on something. ",mentalhealth,Should I go to a therapist or just give me time?,2019-01-19 22:17:48

They fired me in December due to my anger outbursts at work. Because of this, I've been extremely depressed and my anger has hit an all time high. I've been having outbursts weekly which consist of me screaming and crying and throwing things in my apartment. I feel like it's really obvious why I'm having these since I just got fired and my life is spiraling downward. I know it's not management's job to keep tabs of resident's mental health or really give two shits about it at all but I feel like they should be more sensitive considering they know I just got fired and am having a really hard time right now. 

But instead, they've been documenting each outburst I've had over the last month and listed it all in my violation. I'm extra pissed though because several of the things I supposedly did were falsely reported and made to sound worse than it actually was. Even to the point that residents said they heard me yelling about a ""gun."" I never, EVER said the word gun or anything about a gun. What I actually said didn't even sound anything like the word gun so I feel like they added that to get me in worse trouble. 

I just feel so FUCKED over right now. I don't even have a handle on my illness at all despite therapy and medication and I'm afraid that I will get evicted because I won't be able to control my anger when it comes again. I told myself that I would keep it under control in order to not get fired but I couldn't even do that despite knowing I was on my final written warning. So, I got fired because I'm my lack of control.

I’m still an apathetic twat so I’ve no intention with sharing this other than on here, to organise my thoughts.

1175,KeepitonThisChannel,1547881850,1,"I'm primarily looking for some practical advice or guidance if anyone has any to share.

For some background: I am 29. I spent four years in the Army. Never deployed, never had any major head injuries (slammed my helmetted noggin into the ground pretty hard once, but it just gave me a headache for a night, never noticed any lingering effects beyond that), and had one major injury that affected my ankle and spine. It was a fairly stressful time, and following my time in service the VA diagnosed me with ""adjustment disorder with mixed depression and anxiety."" 

My question is how does stress and depression affect memory and cognition? I've been out of the military for over a year, my stress and blood pressure is way down, but I'm noticing more and more that my memory and my attention seems to be shot. I have a difficult time remembering details, I have a very hard time finding things (I looked around my kitchen for 30 minutes today trying to find a thermometer, including looking directly at the thermometer 10 times, and I still needed my girlfriend to come show me where it was), and it seems fairly difficult for me to follow mundane plans or directions for routine life events like returning phone calls or planning shopping trips.

If I don't write things down, I may as well have never heard them. It's like I permanently tune out information if I don't specifically stop to take note of them. I've started using Trello to keep track of my life and I've been using another web service to record notable life events because it's getting harder to recall the details of those events. Finding things that are not specifically where I put them is almost impossible. 

To caveat this: my abstract reasoning and memory is fully on point. I pull straight-As at college, I can discuss political events with great detail, I can ramble about philosophy or programming with seemingly no deterioration from when I first learned what I'm talking about, I can remember the plot points from TV shows for over a year with about 80% accuracy. Anything academic or distant I can fully grasp and retain. Anything that has to do with practical life or mundane memory seems almost impossible for me to work with.

So, my questions are:

1) Is this likely a symptom of depression or stress? If so, what are some logical courses of action to address this?

2) Does anyone else experience a similar cognitive decline? Is there something that you're doing about it?

3) Does this sound like something that can be worked on, i.e. something that I could do exercises to improve? Or do I just need to get used to living my life with a bunch of lists?

4) Is there any specific name for what I'm describing? If I were to see a doctor about this, is there a term for this experience that would sum up what I'm seeking help with?

1177,Rapturesfall,1547880469,1,"First Reddit post here, feel the need to write this out. Almost a year ago, last April, I broke up with my boyfriend of seven years. It was a shitty break up, but the relationship had been going downhill for a while, it seemed like the better choice. It still hurts, it's difficult to come to terms with losing someone who I was close to for so long, but it wasn't working out and I was becoming resentful.  

Unfortunately, we still live together, and now when we're both home at the same time, he ignores me, he hasn't spoken ten words to me over the last month and a half. I can't move out yet, because I can't afford anywhere alone and the guy I'm kind of dating now has to wait another few months before he can move out from where he is. I don't have many people to socialize with, so if they're busy, I go days without speaking to another person. It's starting to get to me. 

I've been feeling really horrible the last two weeks when I'm home, I have no desire to do anything, even when I know I need to. Nothing is interesting to me, I generally just want to sleep, but, because I'm quite an anxious person, I haven't been sleeping well either. If I'm hanging out with guy I'm dating, I'm pretty okay, but as soon as he has to leave or I have nothing to look forward to, I feel so lonely. 

I would crash at this guy's house, which worked out pretty well, but his roommate decided to tattle on their landlord that I was staying over (that's another story), so now I'm always home, and being ignored constantly is getting to me.

I'm heartbroken and in shock with news I had received yesterday, that my mother is pregnant. I'm 17 and I have one 12 year old sibling, so you can expect my mother is older. Less than a month ago, my mother and I jokingly discussed pregnancy and I confessed that with my mental health on the decline, I would very well go through with suicide if she became pregnant ever again. Yesterday she had revealed to me she is expecting with her new boyfriend and I was in denial. Until I experienced the ecstasied moment similar to then you realize you're high, I was convinced she was shitting with me. I excused myself from the living room to my bedroom where I threw up on my floor. It wasn't the fact that she's pregnant that got me. It was the pain she had brought me recently with a new boyfriend she only just striated seeing. It was the hurt she had brought me over the last year and a half since leaving my stepfather. It was the carelessness she's expressed to my younger brother and I, depending on me to mother my sibling for over a year. She's not mature enough for another child. I'm almost an adult and when she pumps this new child out, I'm never going to be given a break. I don't want children. My mother's behavior towards my brother and I has decided that.

I've had major behavior health problems since I was 9 years old and had to be admitted to a mental health facility. They've never improved.

1180,ticab678,1547875520,1,"       Hey, I'm a 16-year-old male named Miles. I have a few questions about certain actions that I do.
1. I like to toy with people's emotions. I'm VERY good at lying (I tell the truth just as much as I lie)
2. I like to study the body language of humans, mostly through the internet. I use the information I gather and test it on people in real-world situations.
3. I dislike most people and find them annoying/repulsive. Yet I still find that peoples minds and the way they work are fascinating.
4. I enjoy making social situations and interactions as awkward as possible as a means of seeing how people react, not vocally, but through body language. This is not the case all the time only when I'm in the mood. I have very keen senses when it comes to reading body language. I use this acquired skill in an effort to seek out weakness and anxiety. I either ""sympathize"" with them to become ""friends"" for later uses or I do what is mentioned below
5. I find it very amusing to assert my dominance over others not through violence but through intense unwavering eye contact and other body language. It's like staring into a dog's eyes and waiting until the dog looks away but you keep looking, like a primal instinct of dominance as I wait and watch them submit and accept the fact that they are lesser than I and that I'm the leader of the pack, that I am the Alpha. (Also It's not like I'm bullying people because they are weak because I don't go for weak plebs I do this to the ones at the top of the social hierarchy.
6. Generally, I am ""nice"" during conversations but I tend to use the rule ""keep your ""friends"" close and your enemies closer"". I say that because I like to become ""friends"" with people I hate until I become close enough to get some dirt (personal secrets) and then use that dirt against them later.
7. I also tend to befriend people for the purpose of using them
I know that there is (or should) be
something wrong with that but I beg to differ, in fact, I find it quite entertaining. Something weird I've noticed is that (sometimes) people that I haven't even met before think I'm creepy yet I've maybe seen them once and have never spoken with them before, which is odd because everyone usually likes me from the start. I think my actions might be slightly different from other peoples. I should feel bad, but I don't. Could there be something wrong with me, if so what?

Tomorrow it's actually going to be our fifth meeting, on the last one I got some courage to talk about my past because on the individual theraphy it wasn't that tough and I was able to present my view why I think I'm struggling with all those diseases. The main reason I think is my overprotective mother. When I was a kid I couldn't leave my neighbourdhood and my mom did everything for me, I didn't have any responsibilities. I didn't need to think because my mother was doing it for me. I couldn't even tie my shoes for a long time or make the bed. Still, to this day I can't do some of the things. I didn't knew back then it was wrong for me and if I knew what the outcome would be... Now I ended up with all those diseases, I'm unresourceful and have low-self esteem. The worst part is dealing with new things and the reason why I don't see any purpose in my life. Each time I'm confronted with something new I must ask someone for advice or depend on other person because if I have to confront something alone I ran away or just stand there like an idiot and don't know what to do until someone guide me and take the first step. I must practice everything because I can't think independently on new problems, situations. I always remember of the origami lessons that I had in school, when I was looking around the class everyone was trying to do something while I was just looking at those papers and didn't know what to do with them. I can't make the first step without someone helping me.  I feel like I need to have someone operating my hands. I feel like an useless idiot. When I was younger everyone expected that I'm gonna be great at everything because I was good at all subjects but this potential is no more there. Even, when I joined school first I already had this problem with new tasks, I wasn't just aware of it. I can't go to work because of it because I know how it will all end.. with mockery. I had apprentice ships 2 times because of the school that I attended and I was in hotel already... it was all the same... I even heard from one of the female workers out there ""I bet your mom does everything for you in home"". Of course I said ""no"" but it was the truth. I also failed my exams to attend university so basically I'm sitting at home waiting till I can write those exams once again. I think I lost hope that anything is going to be better long time ago. My day is full of listening to music and fantasizing, I don't even want to sleep, just keep fantasizing. Suicide? I don't have enough courage. I'm basically seeking an answer for what's wrong with me for four years. At first I thought it's maybe avoidant personality disorder but I think it might be dependent personality disorder now or maybe I am just stupid. I don't know. Anyway, it must be a rare disease since I haven't meet anyone like me. I just wanted to get something off my chest.",mentalhealth,I think I have a dependent personality disorder.,2019-01-19 15:16:51
1187,LoLTAJ,1547870324,1,"First of all, I'm not going to your typical counseling. It's a counseling program where interns and new therapists go to get their start on their careers. And my therapist shares everything with another: the head therapist of the place. So that's cool, but because I'm seeing two different therapists, I can see the other therapist working more.(one therapist is solo, the other one is a marriage counseling with my fiancée) and we're both improving a lot with very little therapy. She is, I'm not. 

So, I'm just wondering: what do you guys do during therapy sessions? What do you talk about? What happens?

I don't know. I see my therapist every week, and we just talk about the week and what happened, and usually I'm the one talking just rambling on about my week. And I'm not sure if it's working. I still get angry very easily, still get annoyed, etc. But I don't really talk to my therapist about it so of course it doesn't work but.. 

I don't know. Obviously therapy helps but I don't see it. And I think it has to do with me and what I'm talking about in therapy. 

This little kid and his mom always have a plan for what they're talking about in therapy. Like""today I want to talk about frustration and forgiveness. "" But I don't have anything like that. I just talk about my week. 

So... 

IDK. 

Really would prefer therapy to work, but need some guidance? IDK. ",mentalhealth,"Been going to counseling for some time now, not seeing any results, am I doing it wrong?",2019-01-19 14:58:44
1188,throwawayyhyhyhhh,1547870002,1,"Today I've noticed that I am very propense to have trust issues. It stared when my last class ended, one of my friends went to search for me and other one called me, I went to hang out with them for a moment, I then asked them to come with me for an icecream, they did, but midway one of them said (we are 3) that he wanted to go for his money back at the campus, and asked the other one to go with him, leaving me to buy my icecream while they did this. I then thought that they could hide my backpack, so I decided to go for it (They did this once last year).

When I got my backpack I found one of them (A), the one who was asked to tag along with the money guy, I'll call him A and the money one B, so he said that we wanted his backpack, idk why did they got away from each other.
A called B and then he wanted to go to the bathroom, so I went with him and was going to wait outside, but he took some time, so I stood up and waited on some stairs that allowed me to see if someone came out, after not seeing him my dumb brain asumed that he just did this to have me waiting there and gi away, so I went for my icecream.

I bought my icecream, and after that I called B, he didn't answered, so somewhy I asumed that they did all of this just to get rid of me, I know It's silly, but at the time it felt logical. 
After being unable to contact any of them I decided to just go home, but then my phone rang, when I picked it up I heard B's voice asking me where I was, then he asked me to come with them and told me where they were. So there's where I realised that maybe I was just stupid for doing all of this.

At the end A just took too long in the bathroom and B just wanted a hotdog, everything came together, I was the one acting weird. I did have a nice time after this, but it made me realize that maybe there is indeed something wrong with me.

I'll mention other things that I've noticed about myself:
Today I was very clingy with some classmates, felt really numb minded, and was somewhy kinda moody.
Recently I've been sleeping more than usual.
I think that I'm getting progresively dumber.
I've also been getting super lazy over the past 4 months.

I'll also like to mention that this friendshil with A and B started like 6 months ago and it came from a mutual friend that was really mean and she was the one who encouraged them to do the backpack stuff, I also had issues like this one with our old friend group.

I may be missing something, and I have pretty bad writting skills because english is not my first language. So I'd like to apologize for the long text and any kind of mistake that I made.",mentalhealth,I have trust issues and I think I'm deteriorating,2019-01-19 14:53:22

I’m not sure if what I have is maladaptive daydreaming because most of the article I’ve perused through describes MD as something a little different from my experience (even though the rest of the descriptions were spot on). I know what I’m about to share is weird but I was really hoping to find some people who can relate to this. Usually when I’m dreaming, I listen to music and pace around the room when I’m alone or I might even run from wall to wall while doing weird hand gestures with weird facial expressions if I’m really immersed in my dreaming (people will think I’m crazy if they see me doing this). Every-time I do this, one of the common scenarios I’ll imagine myself is of me having some sort of magical power combating enemies with my friends (I’m fully aware of how infantile this sounds) or performing for a crowd while the people I know fawn over me. The articles I went through describes how people with MD create characters and stuff instead of basing them on real life.

I might get a bit ramble-y or pedantic and it might seem like I'm making weird connections at some point, but there's probably a reason for everything. It's probably going to sound like I'm spewing my entire life story, but it's only because I'm just trying to figure out what's actually relevant and what isn't, and to provide backstory for why I think I am the way I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I would appreciate some mental health help/advice. I haven't gone to see a psychiatrist/therapist/psychologist yet for the same reason I avoid going to the doctor. **I'm not in danger, I'm not dieing, I'm not suicidal or in danger of hurting myself or anyone else.** I'd just personally rather avoid taking up a professional's working time if I'm not at a point where I literally can't solve my own problems myself anymore, or in an amount of time that's reasonable (I know that's vague, but it's hard to get out what ""reasonable"" actually means in a normal sentence, I just have a sense of when it makes sense for me to go see someone). I'm pretty close to feeling like it would help a lot to go see someone now, but that's why I'm posting here first, so I can talk to people who are volunteering on their own time to do this, rather than someone who has appointments with x number of people who \*are\* in danger and genuinely struggling. I also don't want to go in somewhere and have someone prescribe me anti-depressants that I have to become dependent on to function. I understand their purpose and how they're supposed to help you solve your own issues, but I don't have any legitimate personal real-world issues, I just have my thoughts. My actual daily life is probably pretty decent from an external point of view, and part of my constantly just wants to say that I'm being a baby and should stop dwelling or overthinking.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 26 (male in Canada) and if I had to boil down my problems, I'm pretty sure I've had some kind of depression or anxiety for a very long time. I have no idea if it's anything severe, I never really noticed it having a huge affect on me other than being lonely, being lazy, and beating myself up, which was never really much of a problem for me until recently. In high school and college I was basically a complete loner aside from both sides of my family and 2 friends (1 in college), and the people I'd make small-talk with or joke around with during class. I went into class, paid attention, and then either went home or to the library at lunch and read or played video games.

In high school I did decently well overall aside from some classes I really wasn't interested (I still passed, just barely), and got some scholar award for taking some higher level classes in the stuff I was interested in. I really took off with programming classes though and tore through all my work long before it was due, and had tons of time to mess around and experiment. It was fun to be creative in this way, and I knew long before the end of high school that I definitely was going to be kicked out and had to go to college, so I went into that.

College was about the same, I went to class, paid attention to the interesting stuff, tried to pay attention and make the effort to learn for the stuff I didn't care as much about, but at this point, I think depression was starting to take more of a hold on me, because I didn't really care overall. I was there 100% purely to get a slip of paper that said I knew what I was talking about so I could get a job, anything else was basically pointless to me. I failed a class twice due to low effort on my part, and because of that my schedule screwed up and I had to shift classes and split my 4th year into a 4th and 5th year. It was dumb, but somehow I still graduated with a reasonable GPA.

During college, we had to do a ""co-op"" program. Which, if you're not aware, is like a paid internship for school. You do some job in your field, they hand-hold you a bit, and you report back to the school on what you learned, how you approached problems, and then you got to see what everyone's experiences were like at the end of the semester. **Anyways,** I got picked up by a weird little company that has a really boring product, but incredible spirit for freedom and nurturing employees. In the interview, they were happy with the fact that I compensated for not knowing about important technologies by building my own version that satisfied my needs. In the interview they were offering to hand me a project of my own to do as I saw fit. They were also the only company that took me up for a co-op interview, so I agreed immediately. Now I know it was almost definitely because they just wanted cheap labour for some tools they wanted, but at the time it was a dream for me, I had someone interested in me and trusting me to do something big.

&amp;#x200B;

It's here that I started to gain some confidence. I was very aware that I was different from everyone around me. I was shy, quiet, reserved overall, until I was needed to do something, and then I had no problem going over to ask a question or introduce myself, aside from just generally having a hard time getting out what I wanted to say. I used to trip over my words, speak very fast, and bury myself in work during meetings so that I didn't have to look up or at anyone (I would just listen until I got the sense that everyone was working with bad information, and then try to correct it). I never felt like I was making a real impact on the company, but I kept getting put into special projects and I could tell that they were interested in me in some way. The only thing I could never figure out is if they were treating me like that because they thought I was good at what I did, or because I wasn't good at my actual job and they needed to move me around to see what else I'd be good at. I dunno, I didn't think about it a ton, I was just happy to have a job in my field, and to have actual spending money. My salary was low for my field for a very long time, and I think that really negatively affected my self-esteem, but I could see myself constantly providing value, and I never gave up on trying to make an impact.

Over time, I've gotten more outgoing, got a couple extra friends, but also became more pessimistic overall. I talk more, but I find I'm always talking about problems and ways we can go about solving problems, but also how we all constantly have so much busy work to do that we can't deal with the ""real"" problems which cause the busy work. I also felt like I was some crazy doom-sayer who saw problems in everything that noone else was noticing or mentioning. It came to a boiling point a few months ago and I just about quit. I did my research, I talked to all of my team, I went and talked to recruiters and figured out what I could be valued at and got a much larger number. I'd gotten used to being okay with what I was making, but I needed more to really be able to provide for my family \*and\* myself. I was getting tired of not knowing if I was valued or not, and was tired of not knowing how to get myself into a situation where I could actually make progress towards solving these bigger problems instead of small stuff. I didn't want to let the small work slide and make it look like I was ignoring my duties, but I absolutely had to put work into getting us out of the pit we were in, so I worked after-hours or on weekends to both show that I was dedicated, capable, and future-focused. It doesn't help that we've either had bad managers, or no managers, so it's hard to get noticed without taking the initiative yourself.

Anyways, things got worse, I got angry, an amount of anger that was scary to me because I was starting to scream at my pillow and punch heavy cushions. I've always been pretty emotionally reserved, so to suddenly feel like I had no other option to vent made me VERY worried about myself. I'd noticed that I was also starting to get angry at others, or that I was starting to dismiss them, or tell them how to do their work better. I still think they were legitimate good points, but definitely not presented in a way that they'd be receptive to, and likely they were things that don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Every time I lashed out, I immediately beat myself up for it because I immediately knew it was the wrong thing to do, but it's like I couldn't help it and \*HAD\* to take some kind of action. It was like I was just constantly detecting patterns of thought in other people that were leading to problems, and then essentially getting angry at them for not being different. I'm reserved overall, so it never really deeply hurt anyone, I never insulted anyone or physically lashed out, but I was starting to get extremely frustrated. I'm not proud of how I thought.

Then very suddenly, like over two months, things started working out. The company recognized that we were having such huge issues and put everything on hold to start a massive organizational rework project. My manager at the time recognized that I wasn't being paid enough and asked me what I was looking for. I gave him my research and amount, and he agreed to bring it to HR. It seemed like a complete 180.

Normally this manager and I didn't get along. I was constantly upset with his style of management that just put more work on us without getting any input, and with his constant habit of telling us about industry standards and how some technology is ""what everyone uses"", and getting everyone focused on reading up on it, and then like, 2 weeks later changing his mind and picking something else. We stopped talking for the most part while he focused on this rework project, and only talked to me when he needed something done. To see him suddenly apologize for his behavior, leave the company, and agree to pay me more was kind of a shock.

I finally had some confirmation that I wasn't an idiot or was being pitied or something, I wasn't just complaining uselessly and being afraid of the future, and that I wasn't just being underpaid because they thought they could get away with it, so I took a step back. I got my raise and some advice from my director, went on vacation this past Christmas/New Years, had some time to think and reset. A little before then, I started mindfulness. I started with meditation, but I didn't go all the way with it because I was already starting to take notice of my thoughts to a point where it was helping me. Having this little bit of time let me just take a sec and think about my life objectively, and I could take a breath and finally relax a bit after years of what felt like a blind panic.

I understood that this wasn't normal thinking, and that my beating myself up all the time and thinking I was dumb and not worth it was probably the cause of just about all of my life problems, so I started thinking about what could fix that and what caused that, and naturally went to my childhood. For much of my life, I've been worried about falling back on what felt like a stereotype. The standard ""my childhood sucked and I didn't get a perfect life so now I'm depressed, pills plz"" felt like such a hurtful cliche to me, like it was a convenient way to put all your problems on someone else and continue with your life while ignoring your actual character flaws. I don't think like that anymore, but I'm aware that some people very likely \*do\* actually act like that, so I've been trying to avoid being those people and learn how to pick out what's actually damaging from my childhood, and what's just me being upset that my life isn't perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely wasn't always like this, and the more I think about it, the more I realize that my later childhood might have actually had a huge impact on my depression, but I've just never really given myself a chance to think about it until now. As a kid, I was very playful and outgoing. I used to always get in trouble for talking in class, had unending curiosity about the world, and overall was having a very good time. I played outside with friends and had them over to play video games with me when it was allowed. I had good grades overall and I think my teachers were trying to convince my parents that I should be in some genius program or something. To this day, my parents both still tell me that they think I'm crazy smart, but I can't help but shrug it off. They're parents, parents say nice things, everyone's mom tells them they're handsome. I probably am very good at learning and conveying, but I have very obvious personal flaws that prevent me from feeling capable and ""normal"".

If I had to point to a specific point as a possible cause for my change, it would probably be when my parents split up. I was 10, and very suddenly had to leave all my friends, move with my mother to another, smaller city, in a geared-to-income neighborhood, and constantly have my Dad on my mind, and wanting to visit him as much as possible. He wasn't bad or anything, they just didn't get along anymore and we weren't in a good place financially, so they both moved away from each other. I think he was living out of his car for a while, but got back on his feet and starting seeing other people. He found someone stable, moved in with her, and lived his life.

During this time, I was with my mom and my sister, and was slowly watching my mom lose herself to the pressures of life. My early childhood feels like a dream. My Dad worked his ass off, doing all kinds of work he probably didn't like to, while my Mom stayed home, cooked and raised kids, and was the stereotypical religious housewife. We went to church, I wasn't allowed to read/watch Harry Potter or anything ""satanic"", and she got all the kids and families together for like, play-dates, events, and Tupperware parties. When they split up, everyone got more ""real"". 

Over a couple years. She turned into a completely different person, suddenly very open and accepting, loving and personable, very spiritual, completely against organized religion. She got together with someone else, who I didn't realize until later in my life, was a very terrible, manipulative person. I definitely wasn't having a good time anymore. They fought a lot, I either hid in my room while I was allowed in the house, or got forced outside for hours at a time because they didn't want me in the house (likely so they could smoke and talk about ""adult"" things with each other and friends). I started to need to leave, and so I somehow got them to agree to let me move in with my Dad (that part of my life is a little fuzzy, I just know I was asked and I said yes).

He's generally a great guy, but has the tendency to get angry sometimes. He obviously cared a ton about his kids, and seemed to have an unending supply of ability to suffer through menial work to provide for his family. If there was anyone I learned my ""just suck it up and get through it"" and ""you have to work hard for what you want"" behavior, it's from him, while I probably got my general ""unsure about everything, but open to anything"" outlook from my mom. My Dad made sure I did well in school, made sure I knew I needed to work, and kicked me out when I graduated college (not aggressively, I just didn't have the choice to stay and think about what I really wanted to do or laze around and enjoy life for a sec). All of this was great and obviously the right things to do because those are all important life lessons I probably wouldn't have pushed for myself. I left his house with the sole goal of ""make money, help your Mom and sisters"". This is like 10 years after moving in with him, and over that time, my Mom and sisters were getting steadily worse.

I visited her when I could, but it was always depressing. She was really struggling, and I was trying to help the best I could, but I was just a kid, and couldn't really do a whole lot except make sure the place was tidy, and that my sisters were focused on growing and getting out of there. It really pained me because I knew she wasn't malicious, she was just naive or something. I don't know. It's hard to really figure out now, but she's definitely not a smart person, and sometimes I even doubt that she's really as open and loving as she seems, but I care about her, and since she split with the manipulative shithead, she's sort of been growing, but she's 40-something now and I'm not expecting that she'll suddenly become an incredible person at this point in her life. She's content to finish raising her last kid, smoke pot, and try to find something in cooking she can do on her own (she's trying to start a business).

I had a ton of resentment for her, but very conflicted resentment. I absolutely hated her, both for falling for the shithead, and then continuing to let him manipulate her with their child, and bringing her whole side of the family down for years and years. I had so many thoughts of beating him to death and rescuing my sisters from their damaging life, but that wasn't a solution. I could see my sister grow my quiet and closed off, and my other sister start getting an interest in drugs and general bad behavior. I felt powerless from my Dad's, and tried to ignore it and focus on school and my bad social life, and then focused on my Mom and sisters when I was visiting them (and then later through chatting and texting when they were older). My mom was clearly starting to lose it, had to start taking some kind of anti-depressant or anti-psychotic or something. I think she had a mental break somewhere, but I wasn't present for it. She constantly makes spiritual excuses for her life, and leaves everything up to ""the universe"", and I couldn't help but blame that outlook for her shitty life. I just kept getting angrier and angrier at her internally for not smartening up and taking control of her life, but I was so afraid to say anything because she was already so emotionally fragile. It was torture, I want to cry just writing about how I felt now.

At my Dad's though, things weren't perfect either. He cared, and was a pretty smart guy, but he sided on the abuse side of things rather than helping when I wasn't turning out the way he wanted. I got called stupid for getting low grades a lot, I had a lot of very stern talks that made me feel small. It smartened me up sometimes, but that driving ""be better"" voice in my head was always him, and I was glad to get away for a while at college, so I could have some semblance of a normal life. When he split up with my step-mom and went out up north on his own for like 4 years, I was secretly glad but also sad for not getting to see him as easily. We talked, but barely. I did college and tried to focus on helping my Mom like I was supposed to, and he lived his life and figured himself out.

Eventually, my Mom did smarten the fuck up and fully completely got rid of him aside from 1 or 2 relapses that I made very clear was a bad idea. At this point I was past caring about her mental state, I'd already seen my two sisters turn into completely different people, so the damage was done and I couldn't bring myself to worry about her anymore. Over time we've gotten closer, but I think the only thing that let that happen was that I had to stop thinking about her as a capable parent and my mom. It feels bad to say it and I don't think I've finalized that until now, but we're just friends I think. I get along with her, but I can see myself taking a parent role with my sisters, and I think she expects that from me now. They're already old enough and have started moving out, but the one remaining with her is the daughter of the shithole, and she's very screwed up now. She cuts herself occasionally, she's extremely afraid of people, she lashes out at people for the simplest things or assumes everyone around her is stupid for not understanding what she wants and then immediately goes back to beating herself up for ""being stupid"". I can see her father's influence and her attempts to manipulate my Mom. She's going to therapy, but she's not really growing and my Mom doesn't know how to help her without just kicking her out of the house and making her fend for herself. At this rate, they're just driving each other insane.

&amp;#x200B;

So now after all that, we come back to now. I finally have money, a fair amount of it, enough to make everyone's lives easier and make sure nothing bad happens anymore and that everyone can pay for rent and legal fees, and for the first time in like 16 years, I'm confronting the fact that I might not have gotten out unscathed in all this, that I might actually be extremely capable after-all, and that if I don't take care of myself, I'm just going to end up hurting everyone around me in an effort to do my own thing or something. I feel like I don't know how to be normal, how to have a conversation with the people around me and actually like it, and how to either find what I really like in life to talk about, or to find friends that are also interested in talking about huge life things rather than like, sports or some game or something. I've got a passing interest in those things, and I'll play video games with anyone any day of my life, but there's gotta be something more. I'm finally at a point where I can go look for that something more, and I'm realizing that I'm VASTLY under-prepared to just be a normal human learning and loving and doing life.

I did a bit of personality research, and psychology research, and paired that with meditation and a bit of smoking pot to help expand my mind a bit, and it helped me become happier and more trusting of people, but I'm still running into those same problems I had before things started getting better. I don't know what I like. I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to be a good, normal person that people enjoy interacting with. Every interaction I have either ends up with me feeling bad for being aggressive without taking into account everyone's thoughts and opinions, or like I was too timid and didn't say something that I felt needed to be said, even if it's a minor thing.

I'm constantly thinking of the future, and just about every single action I take has like, an immediate goal, with a bit of a flair towards the future. Like I'll do a project, but build in redundancies, extensive reporting, and modularity because I'm sure it will be expanded later, and it pretty much always is. I do this same thing in conversations with people and just my outlook on life. I try to keep everyone focused on long-term goals and how we can reach them while also fulfilling short term goals, and this doesn't always work well with people. I'm running into problems a lot where I'm trying to tell someone something or do something in a specific way that could get them to understand things better and prevent a possible problem in the future, but then I get others jumping in and making a mess of my delicate act (which I'm not even sure will even do what I'm wanting it to), and then have to come up with a way on the spot to explain what I was doing (which is hard because it's very complex sometimes), in a way that both doesn't make me come off as a know-it-all, while also trying to avoid hurting their feelings, while \*ALSO\* trying to be open to the fact that I could be wrong. It's exhausting, and I don't even bother sometimes. I'm also running into problems constantly where someone will say something, I'll try to respond, then I'll get interrupted or talked over (which seems to be common in meetings, either because of necessity or because you can't hear someone), and then by the time everyone stops talking and it's polite to get a word in, the original topic is LONG over and I'd just feel out of place for bringing up my original point.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm feeling the same kind of anger coming up and so I decided to ask for help here. I'm frustrated, I don't know how to deal with people. I know there are tons of smarter people than me and that I'm no Albert Einstein or Bill Gates, but damn. I feel like I just take in the consideration of SO MUCH MORE than most of the people I work with that it's constantly making me wonder if I'm just trying too hard and should just stop trying to make things better overall, or if I really am actually a genius like people seem to tell me and should really push for the things I believe in. I just don't know how to deal with people in general, and constantly coming back to this wall of social problems is hampering my ability to grow. I want to be normal, I don't want to be this controlling asshole, I want people to like me without having to compromise what I like. I just want to be me, but I have no idea what me is.

At this point, I don't even know if I'm doing what I want to do, I just know that me working is a tool to grow, and I still need to have a bit of a financial buffer so that when I do figure out what I want to do, I have some money to live off of and provide for others while I do my own thing. In the meantime, I can get better with dealing with all kinds of people, prove to myself and others that I can provide benefits, that I have genuine value over another hire at the same price, and that I'm not going to live the rest of my life in the same 9-5 job. I'm trying to spend my free time learning and doing things I like, but I feel like some husk who's sole purpose in life is to work and give myself to others. I want to be me again, but the only thing I can think of as me is some loner who plays video games when he's not at work. I've been reading more recently about how to talk about people and what to do in certain, but nothing is clicking as of yet. Either that, or it's clicking very well and I'm just worrying too much. I see the things I want come into fruition slowly, but it never seems like anyone is happy about it, or that they're only acting on my suggestions because they're afraid I'll be upset if they don't humour me or something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

It's **maddening**, and I want to curl up in a ball and cry sometimes, but I keep plodding along, remain strong and objective, and spend my free time finding myself when I'm not stressed out, but I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid I'll never figure it out with my current outlook. I'm hoping someone can help. If this is too long and I don't get any responses, I'll just cave in and go talk to a therapist.",mentalhealth,Depression and my boring life story - [Extremely long!

1193,winloseor_draw,1547864721,1,"So I’ve been in a relationship for almost 6 months now and I absolutely love my boyfriend. Most days he makes me unbelievably happy and of course, because of my dependency, I’ve grown incredibly attached to him.
However, here is where issue has arisen. I have very very severe anxiety, paranoia, and worsening depression. He also suffers from depression and PTSD. I feel like our disorders clash with each other, his hurting me more than mine hurts him. Whenever he’s going through a bought of depression, it puts me in one of the worst mental places I think I’ve ever experienced, and my suicidal thoughts have grown more since we’ve started dating.
Along with my anxiety, I also have very bad separation issues, and he tends to go away for hours on end with no word. This scares the everliving shit out of me and I don’t know how to tell him “text me more” without sounding like a possessive lunatic. 
I don’t want to admit to myself that he’s triggering my disorders because I truly love him. He’s the only person who has made me feel safe to have the disorders I have and hasn’t triggered my paranoia, which everyone else I’ve met does. I just can’t bear to break up with him, but I’m scared my metal health will only continue to decline.

I’ve been laying in bed since class ended at 2 pm. I ate and ate while I watched TV not because I was hungry. I don’t know why. And then when I started getting all hot and shivery and tired I fell asleep like the sugar knocked me unconscious. I woke up not remembering where I was, but then I remembered the shame and self-loathing and the fat on all those places on my body that would only be worse tomorrow due to my latest slip. So what did I do? Against all logic I ate some more. At this point I felt vomit coming up my throat, but that didn’t stop me. My bed protected me, the blanket covering all my fat, so that no one could see. So that I couldn’t see. So that I didn’t have to feel the weight of it all or the tightness of my clothes that wasn’t there a year prior. Not that I was doing so well a year ago, I was just on the upswing of the pendulum, where I was hardly eating. In trying to heal I was slipping and sliding out of control. There wasn’t/isn’t enough friction in my life to stop me. So I ate some more, and then felt the urge to make it all go away. To avoid the consequences. I looked down at my hand, my right hand with two rings on it that my sister gave me for the holidays. One was on my ring finger, but the other was on my middle finger, so I hesitated. I had promised her I wouldn’t throw up for the rest of winter break, but break was over and I was back at college. The promise was fulfilled, but I triumphed anyway and resisted the urge. Instead of throwing up, I grabbed more food. Then, thoroughly disgusted and scared of the future and of anyone seeing me, that’s when I took my rings off. I went to the bathroom downstairs, not on our hall where people would be. I passed two girls in the hallway and gave a smile and a hello as I walked towards the bathroom where people take their shits in privacy. I went into the big stall that I had previously christened not more than a week and a half prior, and got comfortable. Squatting, hair loosely tied back like I didn’t care if it got a little on it. Hands resting on the toilet like old friends or lovers. Then I made a gun with my hand and shot myself down the throat. Pulling trig. I finally understand why they call it that. I’ve gotten better at it over the last few months. I learned that while you lose a little reactivity, if you go if rapid succession, you can get a four for one or even more. It’s hard to do too many because my tears and the snot dripping out of my nose demand attention. I wipe them with toilet paper that disintegrates all over my hands, as I look down at my vomit stained shirt. Damn, I am going to have to be discrete when I walk back to my room. I try to come up with something real quick. Maybe, I was washing my face, or drinking water and it spilled. My mom always did used to say that I have a hole in my lip. I start tasting acid and decide that enough is enough. I don’t want my voice to be noticeably raspy. I sit there for a second whispering to no one “help me help me help me help me help me.” Last time I did this, I think God was listening because I got an email with a job offer following my interview a few days prior. The good news lifted my spirits for a couple hours. My plea degraded into just one word, “help, help, help” as tears streamed down my face and continue to stream as I write. Help the poor girl, someone. She’s hurting and she’s a liar, but she’s scared and alone, and fat. Not really fat, but fat enough that she misses her abs from her running days, and all her jeans are two sizes too small and she can’t deal with it. She doesn’t know how in the world of college girls getting their only calories from drinks and then going on the stairstepper or the elliptical. She now gets anxiety from exercise especially going to the gym, but she used to be free. She used to be a strong runner. What happened? She used to love it. Help. Help her. Help me. So I go back to my room and hide under my covers and finally call a therapist, but it’s past five and it goes to voicemail and the voice on the voicemail sounds old and sweet like your grandma and you can’t tell your grandma this and she can’t help you so this voice can’t help you but someone needs to help you. You hang up but then you call again and leave the message. Just as you are finishing your friend walks in and starts chatting about her first day at work, but all you can think is I almost slipped up and she heard me. And then she is just sitting there and you have so much inside you, but you can’t say. You may as well be in a fish tank, slowly drowning and gasping, while the outside world can only see the muted, tranquility of the underwater world. She’s sitting right there and she didn’t see. Relief and extreme sorry. Whatever that equivalent for an extreme bitter-sweet. Help. Help me. You don’t whisper, but thoughts aren’t audible. As she comes closer pacing around the room, you minimize the psychologist finder website open on your browser. She leaves and you want to tell you mom, but she’s dealing with other crisis and she doesn’t know how to help. It would only scare her, distract her from your sick grandmother, and she would pull you away from school to come back home. So you think of your sister. She already knows, but she is younger than you and has her own issues and isn’t strong enough to carry me and my damage. Literally, she can’t even pick me up, the voice thinks like a fat joke that isn’t a joke. I shouldn’t have ever told her at all. It is too much, but I was so desperate and sad I had no choice, but to shove on her my burden.

1203,worldhello646,1547859282,1," As long as I can remember myself, I had the best memory that it comes. I could have remembered anything perfectly that happened in at least half a year span, could have recalled up to smallest details. Up until I started working as IT specialist for one and a half years, not realizing I had forgotten numbers that was mentioned, prices that clients should have paid, passwords of clients computers, I had to check everything that was checked in the system even thought I was the one that accepted orders from the clients, being the one that has written information in the company systems and have heard everything being mentioned, that has driven me crazy from the first time that I have forgotten something so obvious, even though I have driven myself to work as the best as there could be, remembering everything that I saw or heard at least once, as the time passed I had to check system configuration that we done and smallest of fixes that had to be done to the computers. That drove me crazy, not even that, but since I started working, my sleeping schedule has changed drastically. From feeling fully rested after 5-7 hours of sleep, because I couldn’t even sleep more, I felt fully rested after that and wanting to just jump out to bed after waking up, to not even being rested after 8 hours of sleep or more. My life shifted 180 degrees and since then I’m still wondering what really happened to me. I can’t trust my memory anymore, I can’t even trust myself to wake up early after working for at least 6 hours at random things. I have tried resting for whole day, but that didn’t change a damn thing, I lost my job to a mistake, the job that I did countless times before, I have failed, my colleges started asking if I have a girlfriend or something and not getting enough of sleep. I didn’t, I slept for 8-9 straight waking up feeling tired, sometimes spending an hour after waking up in the bed surfing on the internet on my phone, because I didn’t want to get up. From one of the best there could be I started to feel useless, failing even simple tasks that I have done countless times. Even myself I didn’t known what has happened, as long as I remember myself, I was on top of everyone, getting stuff done quicker and better than everyone else. 

As of now I can’t focus on single task, I started working on my own project, but I feel like I can’t do it, even though I have knowledge and skills for it. I’m jobless, can’t find any job, working on my own project hoping I can make business from it, but feeling tired all day after sleeping for at least 9 hours, because I can’t just wake up earlier, if I try to wake up earlier, I just fall back to sleep after turning off my alarm. I am feeling tired of all the bullshit and I have started spending my time on YouTube watching random videos, first for just half an hour to now for at least 3-7 hours daily. I need serious help because I don’t even know that is happening with me, I can’t tell if it is normal and I’m just getting old, but I refuse to believe that, or something seriously have changed me. I really don’t know what to do anymore, because if I continue what I’m doing now, I will feel even more useless. I seriously can’t think straight anymore and I have just started drinking to feel like something. As of now I’m feeling pretty drunk as I’m writing this knowing that this isn’t going to solve anything.  
 

I ‘m seriously feeling ashamed of myself as of now and because of that I want to keep my identity as human being and internet persona secret.

the first time happened was when i was in 7th grade and i was with this girl and things were more serious than a regular middle school relationship, it was super toxic because the girl seemed to be struggling with her family a lot and i never did much to try and help since i was struggling with something myself. after a while the consolers had stepped in and discussed with her about unhealthy relationships and i thought it was stupid but i was young and stupid. things were over dramatic because i couldn’t get over it after she broke up with me over text. it still gets to he both of us. a lot of things happened and a lot i can’t even say. i went through a depressive episode during my summer break where i didn’t eat much and i stayed in my room with a lap top and that’s all i would do. 

the events of the first time are similar to the recent thing that happened. it was my 15th birthday and my ex was called to the consoler because her friends was told by her that i made her sad. so they went to the consoler to help her out with me and yet again she was told that i was a unhealthy person to be dating. i know i’m smaller tempered person and i relied on the both of them to much. i also seemed to make them go into calls with me constantly and throughout our days since free time is a thing that a lot of teenagers have so i used it being in a call with them both when i dated them but it seemed to make them sad and trapped but somehow whenever i wasn’t in the calls i went into a depressive state. i’m at a point where no one my age is really a reliable source for help 

i wanna see if anyone that was my age was like this because it’s hard to find someone else who seems as petty or repetitive in anger or sadness. i’m really trying my hardest not to seem like some random emo teen on reddit and i’m know i’m just young and i’m growing up and learning more. but i really need help because last time all i did was say i was different but somehow do the same things, i was told by my first time this happened girlfriend that i was just repetitive and it annoyed her because i was clingy afterwards and i admit that i was annoying and she does too.  i’m starting to think i might grow to be abusive or something or that i should choose to ignore love until i’m a fully grown adult or whatever. this is what i could come up with as a description.(i posted this on the r/getting over it page but i also want to post it here to get more results)",mentalhealth,"i’m a 15 year old boy who has had 2 relationships where they ended by friends of the girls or them going to the consolers saying they were concerned for them two,",2019-01-19 11:44:08

1208,bodysurf808,1547856634,1,"I’d like to gather some tools or insight to help my girlfriend... I don’t know what else to do....

Background: I met my wonderful girlfriend a year and a half ago and we have been dating for about a year now. She lives with me.  Let’s call her J.  J comes from a home where she is the first generation to be born and raised as US citizen and her family from a third world country. She is incredibly hardworking and beautiful and also the first college grad of her family. Her upbringing was tough, filled with abuse, poverty, problems you name it. Because of her culture it was basically excepted to be hit for the smallest infraction. When I first met her I had come out of a long term relationship and just wanted a friend. She was the most sincere and kind individual I’d ever met and we had so many laughs and great adventures together.  After 6 months things boiled over and we became a couple. She always kept a crazy schedule saving up for a trip she took and is now back living with me for the past 6 months.  

THE PROBLEM: 
Since she’s been back it’s been one crisis after other some legit and some not.  Money problems I get it. I helped her back on her feet and payed our rent until she she was stable. But her mental health is very poor and has been a roller coaster .  She can be happy singing teaching Zumba then within the same day be freaking out that I’m going to leave her, she’s fat, she needs to move away, someone left a dish in the sink, so and so doesn’t know what it’s like to work. These infractions erupt into manic anger, silent treatment for everyone, childish games. Constantly anxious, angry, manic. She is stunningly beautiful and feels terrible about herself.  Just to make it clear this is not a couples thing. Her closest friends are concerned for her. She’s missed work this week because of “stress”. But life’ from the outside looking in is great. We live in a million dollar home in Honolulu, great friends, eat great food, keep an active lifestyle. BUT I am worried big time. She recently has spoken about self harm and and really dark thoughts, we are both very high Lobito and recently she’ tells me she’s too broken to offer herself to me, feels bad about her body. ( she is stunningly beautiful, Zumba and yoga instructor who does manual labor, total babe who gets attention anywhere she goes ).  I in no way pressure her for anything. I’ve stepped back and really have made an effort to encourage and have healthy habits. I’ve been meal prepping, we’ve both cut alcohol for a month now, training for a road race. I’ve spent countless hours talking through each crisis she is having basically on a daily basis, I’ll massage her when she’s stressed. Yesterday was too much for me ... I broke down on my own after an exhausting morning with her basically losing her mind over not having enough time for her to gather stuff for a girls night we were hosting.  Her girls nights are potluck style and she really had no obligation to provide anything...Her anger is out of control. It seems to be her only way of dealing with things lately. Soo I picked up her slack on this without complaints.... I’ve been encouraging her to go seek professional help but she will not. I don’t want to leave her but this whole ordeal has been a complete drain.  I don’t know what to do honestly. It doesn’t seem like her and it’s been getting worse....

I thought I was getting better. I felt like I was no longer so depressed, there was still stuff going on but I felt more free. I had really bad undiagnosed anxiety when around people and I trained myself to basically get over that because it would get in the way with job I want to work hard to get to. I still had intentions to die in the future (see previous post) but I didn’t call it feeling suicidal because so no longer woke up feeling like Abi should throw myself out the window. I was clean, self harm wasn’t even a thought I had, I still have scars from where I cut up my legs and I was staring at them one day and... 

I get really bad anxiety when I think of the moments in which I self harmed and the events leading up to it. People think it might be PTSD but that seems scary to consider. I’m still an apathetic twat so I’ve no intention with sharing this other than on here, to organise my thoughts.  I’m suicidal again, I don’t sleep, I don’t eat and I’ve become obsessed with putting the inside of my arm/wrist in boiling water. I’m (my age) going on borderline alcoholic, I seem dependent on drinking my parents forgotten whiskey every time I get home and I cannot stop thinking about how easy it would to get drunk or high, despite the consequences. 

Despite having improved in my ability to socialise, my want to wowow life has decreased and the only reason I go out with my friends is because they always beg me and I hardly see them anyway. 

I’m running on three hours sleep, my arm is burnt and I can feel the skin eroding, I’m soon to have a heart attack at the amount of anxiety attacks I have due to “unresolved trauma” and I just feel lost. 

I can feel my immune system decaying with my lack of sleep and I seem to do everything I can that will deteriorate my health. I’m going out tomorrow as my friend really wanted to but I feel like shooting myself in the head, not wondering around crowded shops.

I’m suicidal, I’m traumatised, I’m narcissistic, I’m manic, I’m alcohol dependant, I’m depressed and I’m still no more empathetic.

1218,Spwarklyz,1547848499,1,"After being very sleep deprived and only slightly recovering, I've started having strange thoughts, impulses, and imaginations. For example, I'll try and remember something that happened in my life, and out of nowhere the person in my memory will just cough up blood and look at me almost as if looking at a camera, in my imagination. I believe my brain is pulling this visual from [this Jimmy Fallon skit](https://youtu.be/zSiFLo3apjM?t=185) I watched a long while ago, before this ever started happening. It's very disturbing. 


Sometimes I'll think disturbing things, like my cat will be on my bed and I'll just want to kick it, or I'll be laying down and think about ripping my organs out. My cat was in the bathroom with me while I was peeing (she wouldn't leave) so I thought about pissing on her (sorry Zora.) 


I cannot think of a clear example, but there are times, especially when I get really tired, where I think up abstract thoughts that just don't make any sense, and I start to get angry at the confusion. I'll be doing nothing, and out of nowhere think ""Yeah the thing is..."" about nothing. Or someone will be talking and I'll think ""yep, yep, yes"" and just keep agreeing with them for absolutely no reason.


At times I'll feel like I don't have legs or arms, and my limbs in general just feel weak and like they aren't as sensitive as they used to be. Due to depression I lay in bed most of the day, and when I do get up and walk around, I've noticed occasionally The ground will feel like it is shaking, but only in my feet, and if I stand on one foot my hamstrings will tremble.


Despite mostly feeling numb I process emotions differently when I actually do feel them, for example I was listening to something that made me sad and I began to feel electricity run all through my body, and it went to my chest and felt very powerful, almost like my chest might explode with the energy.


Occasionally I hear things or things I am hearing will be amplified, for example if someone prounces a ""Huh"" h sound under their breathe, it may feel as if they're right by me whispering it in my ear. I used to play COD zombies frequently, and occasionally the sounds of the zombies screaming will play in my head as an innervoice, though I know they aren't real and it doesn't sound to be coming from the environment, but my own head. i would always play with a headset so I believe this could just be a sort of [tetris effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect). I used to play this game all day, every day, and stay up all night playing it as well.


I will constantly get dreams mixed up with real life. For about a year now I've had mostly sane dreams, however there have been a couple nightmares. One that stands out though was not a nightmare neccessarily, but I dreamt my mother was speaking to me and I just started yelling and yelling, stop to breathe, and just yell again. I also dreamt once that I was looking at myself in the mirror, smiling.


I feel this must be a weird combination of neurological and mental disorders. When I talked to my doctor about my symptoms, she simply tells me I have anxiety, and I do, however there must be more to it. A brain tumour, schizophrenia, anything, there's no way this isn't something else. It doesn't help that I am very scatterbrained, and therefore will forget to tell my doctor a lot of the symptoms that I've been meaning to tell her, and the symptoms change frequently as well.",mentalhealth,"Incredibly abstract/disturbing imaginations, thoughts, and feelings after sleep deprivation",2019-01-19 08:54:59

1228,throwaway56421345678,1547840717,1,"Okay. I am 23. I am not close to my family but I have four much older brothers and a much older sister (&gt;10 years difference). Childhood was okay. Manipulative mother, lots of screaming, alcoholic dad. Only real memory of my siblings was my oldest brother always screaming “get a divorce”. Since about jr high, I had terrible self-esteem and negative thoughts about myself. I harmed myself for the first (and only) time around this period. I ‘dated’ a few people before meeting my now husband when I was 16. He was 22. His parents were divorced when he was young and he had been a few relationships previously where he was with someone because he didn’t want to be alone and where he with someone for selfish reasons but he had been single for 2 months before meeting me and was at that time living life for him independently.

I had two or so close friends but never really hung out as much as my now husband and I did. I wasn’t very social and didn’t have much other relationships at this time. We took things slowly but eventually had sex after 6 months or so of dating. We both had high sex drives. We fell for each other pretty quickly and I moved with in after 2 years (when I graduated highschool). During this time, I did not tell my parents about him and kept it a secret. I was always considered “mature for my age”. I started my career at 18. I had been continuously working since I was 13 but this was my first adult office job… where I sat 98% of the day. Things changed at this point. I became comfortable with my life and because less outgoing. I gained some weight but I didn’t care as much about it because my then boyfriend loved me. I loved him to the best of my knowledge of love. Two compatible people that had warm exchanges, intimidate moments and brought each other happiness. 

He mentioned that he had a porn addiction. All I heard from him was that I was not good enough to bring him pleasure. He watched and entertained himself every day. He said the he was stopping. I repressed this and put it out of my mind. Our sex life slowed down to once every 2 weeks… once a month.. once every several weeks and remained like that. I would try to illicit a sexual response from him.. but would be rejected. I think we were in the roommate phase.

We moved into a new place when I was 20. At this point I started playing an mmo game. I met a few new people and it was fun talking to them and getting to know them. I met one person that I especially liked talking to. I will call this person my AP. I didn’t tell my now husband about the AP because at first I had a bit of a crush but our conversations were really just friendly and a little fun flirting. I was embarrassed that I had a new friend and felt shame that I was enjoying talking to someone besides my now husband. AP made me feel good. It was exciting talking and learning about someone new. This went on for about a year. I felt like I could present the best image of myself to AP without consequence and make my life more interesting or fun. 

Husband suspected something was going on but couldn’t bring himself to ask me about it. This was eating away at him. I believe around this time he had a hard time finding me sexually attractive or coming up with sentimental feelings. We didn’t acknowledge any of this and “swept bad feelings under the carpet.” We were both happy because we told ourselves that we were happy. 

After around a year of me talking/textings/snapping AP – Nothing NSFW just a few selfies etc. It got too much for me and the guilt was destroying my mind. I ended things abruptly without any real closure. I did not tell my now husband. I simply thought it is over and it will hurt him if I say something. At the time my husband and I were still living every day together. We watched movies, played videogames together, ate dinner together and went to bed every night together. 

He was seeing me with rose colored glasses I think. I was compartmentalizing stuff and thought I was happy. I felt happy seeing my husband and looked forward to it every day. I thought he was better at EVERYTHING compared to me. He led our growth and major life decisions and I hate to say it but I let him sit in the drivers seat. I was in the passenger sit happily. That isn’t fair to him. 

AP and I stopped talking for several months but I initiated contact as I missed him. We started talking via text/snapchat but again after a few months, I stopped it again because I had the same feelings. I grew depressed and anxious and was living a lie.

I was still happy when I saw my husband though. I had so many negative thoughts in my mind though – all directed towards myself.

AP reached out after several months again and we had been talking but not as frequently as we had before. I didn’t want anything serious from these exchanges and I cared about AP the way I would care about a friend that I had a crush on. During this time, my husband proposed. 

It was in public and I said yes. I wanted to marry him. He was my person. He was my bestfriend. Of course I wanted to marry him. I was not expecting this AT ALL and was completely blindsided. I cut off contact to AP immediately. My husband and I decided to get married in exactly one year from the proposal. 

We were NC until about 6 months until the wedding. I was so stressed out and didn’t really have anyone aside from my mother and fiancé to talk to. I reached out to AP for ‘stress relief’, talking and catching up. This lasted for 2 months and I cut off contact with the intention of never reaching out again.

My husband and I were married when I was 22. We went on a honeymoon, got a dog, bought a house and wanted to start a family. Checked all the boxes. 

Regular life resumed. 

Around Christmas time that year.. I had been thinking about AP and wanted to wish him a Merry Christmas. We spoke to a few weeks and AP had had a death in his immediately family. For whatever reason our always fun, light and flirt conversations got more sexual. Starting with “never have I ever..” etc. I remember thinking that I wanted to make him want me. I wanted to arouse him. I needed that validation. I didn’t need to get off or anything. I thought maybe this was how he wanted to handle grief. I send a few photos of me in a low cut shirt but that was the extent. He send me a video of him climaxing. 

Around new years I stopped talking to him. I said I didn’t want a relationship or anything else. He accepted that. We didn’t talk again until mid November this year.

Thorough the year my husband and I tried to get pregnant. We tried once a month or so but no success. 

In October of this year, I continued to play different online games and it was fun playing with people. I was lonely and it felt good if I could peak a guys interest. I liked being good at a game and being a gaming chick. I started flirting with some random guy that showed interest in me. He was in a bad place and it started by me cheering him up. Lowkey sexting was a think for a period of 2 weeks. I think I was trying to fill in the place that AP left. I was trying to get something important from other places than my marriage. I was guilty. I felt like a piece of crap. I ghosted that guy.

I reached out AP mid-november. I wanted to see if he was doing okay. We caught up… we flirted… we talked about turn ons and fantasies/possible fetishes.. It ended with him sending me a video of him climaxing on Christmas eve… which my husband found on my phone.

When my husband approached me with this… I sat and listened to what he said.. and I needed to take a walk. I took my jacket. I took my kitchen knife and knife sharpener and I started outside. I live in the country so it was dark and quiet (this was around 4am Christmas day). I walked until I got too cold and went and sat in a ditch on the side of the road.. hidden behind some trees/bushes. I threw my phone into a snowy field. I started cutting with the full intention of ending my life. I thought about jumping off a bridge.. dying of hypothermia in this ditch.. cutting my vein and bleeding out.. cutting my neck. 

I saw my husband in his car driving around to find me. I wanted to be invisiable. The pain I saw in his eyes when he confronted me… I couldn’t handle it. I couldn’t handle my life shattering in pieces because of my actions and my choices. The life we had together was gone. I was numb. 

I thought about my life and my regrets. I thought about how ending my life would impact him and my family. Leaving him to deal with home and animal expenses.. Running away from my problems.. Never seeing him again.. Never giving him closure or a reason.. That was too much. I couldn’t do that to him. I got my phone and started back to our home. I sent him a message and he picked me up half way and drove me home.

That night we separated and our 7 years together were over. We agreed the next day that I would continue to live at our home. I took down all the wedding/life photos of us throughout the years and it caused him pain when he saw them. His conditions for living together were that we had separate rooms, separate meals and separate plans. We have started marriage counselling and I have been to two individual counselling sessions since. We have talked about what has happened and I have apologized. We are both working on ourselves right now.

We still spend time together everyday (spending 2 hours together in the car on the way to work and on the way home) as well as either making our separate food at the same time, working on a puzzle or playing an offline videogame. He told me that he still has a porn addiction and goes at it 4-6 times a day. His illusion of us has shattered. He sees me as a person.. a person he doesn’t like due to my present habits. 

Since DDay I have reflected on my goals and wants and needs. I have corrected my diet, I have started working out, I am being mindful and making the best choice I can in every situation. I am trying to support him by my actions. I have avoided eating food at first because I thought anorexia was a solution but that is stupid.

He is adamant that he wants a divorce because our marriage has an astrix behind it now. He sees the past 7 years with regret and hurt. He said that he possibility for a relationship is still there. Right now he sees himself as single and unavailable… 

He hasn’t given up and he has told me that he has seen a dramatic change in the person that I was before Christmas to the person I am now. 

I hope we can both work on ourselves and grow together or at very least grow in a positive way and work through the pain that I have caused. If we end up not being together… The only thing I want is for him to be able to find happiness and shed the pain that I have inflicted. 

I defined what love is to me and I believe what I understood love as was much different and more immature than his definition. That hurts me so, so much and this is the biggest regret of my life.

I am not going to kill myself but take the much, much harder path of self improvement and healing

It's hard for me to imagine being happy once. Don't remember the feeling. Don't remember the feeling of looking forward to something. Or the feeling of purpose, a reason to do something, get out of my bed. I don't go to school currently, or I haven't gone for 3 weeks. And I'm not planning to go in the future. I'm ready to live my life, to do something I wanna do. To do something fucking exciting for once. I'm very lonely, but I've realized that it has nothing to do with how many people are around me. Its about being cared for, being listened to. I'm a good person, a good friend. But how much does it fucking take to get some love back? I've met many girls recently. Ive been nice, done everything I wanted to do, everything i thought would make them feel better. But every single one of em drifted away slowly. I guess I was too ""interested"" said a fucking tutorial on YouTube about ""how to get a girl to like you"". Wow I'm really that desperate? Do you really need all these strategies, all these lies just to get a girl to appreciate you? So fucking ridiculous. How much does it take? I'm gonna be myself. But that's clearly not enough for anyone. I'm so disconnected with the people around me, I honestly don't like my family. I know that's hard to believe, oh maybe I'm just going through a little phase? I'm tired of all that. My dad nor his girlfriend says they care but there's a huuuuge fucking difference between actually caring and reassuring that they do care. Maybe I would get a reaction if i told them that I'm on the verge of doing one thing. My mother died when i was six. And I've not really anything to say about that. I'm not looking for any pity, that's the worse of it all. Treating me like a victim. I'm right now thinking about going to the hospital and just say that I'm planning to do one thing.

1236,Abgahlorma,1547833880,1,"The symptoms I have are bad enough, but over the past 13 years that I've been totally disabled from work, a wide range of functional issues has arisen that literally seem to stack with the symptoms to make the symptoms significantly worse. Problems with motivation as a symptom of the illness and possibly also a medication side-effect are a clinical things, but add to that the 13-year gap in work history and not only having less than zero chance of ever having a prospective employer notice my resume because of it, not to mention such a long time being out of the swing of things that my old working-man habits have eroded until they're pretty much gone; are not any kind of medical reason to feel bad because they're perfectly healthy reactions to my reality, but still exacerbate my symptoms because they promote the same feeling as the symptoms themselves, which is: ""What's the use of even doing anything?"" Even if researchers developed some kind of miracle cure where I'd have to take only one dose of medication and voila, no more mental illness, I'd still be just as depressed because of the bottomless pit that 13 years of mental illness have thrown me into in an entirely non-medical way.

I'm wondering whether that contributes to the feeling I began to have only a couple of months ago, which is waking up in the morning feeling fresh and rested and relatively asymptomatic, and then immediately crashing emotionally because all I have to look forward to is vegetating in my chair like a turnip until it's time to go to bed. More and more often I'm postponing getting up, not because of any clinical symptoms, but because of the functional emptiness of my life that would be extremely difficult to change even if I were suddenly hale as a lord. It's gotten to the point that I'm terrified of recovery because it would mean sitting in my room like a turnip until I starved to death for lack of money to buy food, as I'd no longer be totally disabled from work but still functionally unable to motivate myself to lift a finger to do anything about having no source of income whatsoever.

1240,Artemis2611,1547832172,1,"Hi, this will be a pretty long post and english is not my 1st language so please bear with me.

I am a master student who is studying abroad. I worked in an institute for one of my project and also my dissertation. I guess everything started to build up from here. At the beginning I was really motivated and a hard-working student, so I tried to help and finish all the tasks they gave me including taking over some work during holidays time. After my first project, I thought I would have my summer holidays free since normally the work for dissertation starts from August. However, only after 2 weeks I was required to come and start working because according to my promoter, it was late to start in Aug and some experiments regarding my thesis had been started already. So in the nutshell, ever since I started working at that place until when I finished (almost 1 year), I never had a vacation that lasted for a week and during all periods when students can stay home for holidays I had to be present at my workplace. Oh, during my first project I tried to tell ppl who was responsible for the course in my univ that I had worked more than required hours and I was asked to come also during Easter holiday, but that person told me ""It's good because you will have more practical experience"" so I guessed the univ would not do anything. Anyway, I tried to keep up and even though I started to feel stressed, I  still managed to get through... Until winter holidays - the period which I have to finish and submit my thesis.

I know so well that I am not good (bad, even) in writing so I asked my promoter up front if she could try to read and correct my thesis at least twice and she said fine. As my prediction, the first draft got a lot of correction and comments that I thought it was best to rewrite a whole chapter, and because of the limited time I had left I had to stay up almost every night to rewrite and adapt my work. However, when I sent my 2nd version my promoter replied that she would not revise it anymore since she already gave me feedbacks. Okay, so, from this point I started to panic but still tried my very best to finish writing and correcting just in time for my submission deadline. However, well, first of all, my promoter sent me an email just 2 days before the dealine and asked if I could postpone my submission, and she said she should have adviced me so when she read my 1st draft. When I came to the office to deliver my printed thesis, I met my supervisor and she told me my promoter was upset bc of my thesis and I was not at the level they expected, I would be in trouble if the jury member had the same standard. The only thing I can do now is try to defense my thesis well at the end of this month, only then I could barely pass and graduate or I will have to wait until Sept for a retake. I have to say that since the submission of my thesis and when I heard the words from my supervisor I have been incredibly disappointed and have lost most of my motivation. I tried again and again to get myself together and prepare for my defense but whenever I open my thesis or the workscreen I started to cry, and whenever I receive any email from my promoter or my supervisor I start to panic (i.e. tight chest, raising heart beat, and the feeling is just simply terrified). I DID try to relax by hanging out with friends, shopping, watching movies...but none of those was effective. Now I start to lose my interest to do anything and just want to stay in bed for the whole day. It feels like I don't have any will or motivation left to go on, I start hating myself for being so weak and incompetent. And most of all, I feel extremely lonely, to the point that everyday I wish I didn't have to wake up, I just want to sleep forever and to be stuck in my dreams, bc at least I can see ppl I want to see and I can go home without worrying anything....

I am unable to keep up with daily tasks such as cleaning, upkeeping personal hygiene, which means my flat is extremely dirty and a complete mess, very much like somewhere off of 'how clean is your house'. Things feel completely impossible, as if i am being asked to climb a mountain. My memory is also poor and I often forget to or don't remember if I have done many things.

I went in vyvanse fall 2017 bc i had started the nursing program at college and it was more than i could handle (i do actually have ADD it was just much more manageable in high school since i didn’t have other things like jobs and family distracting me). my father also passed in february 2018. stress, sadness, and vyvanse caused me to lose a lot of weight. i didn’t feel great but i could wear whatever and not even think about it, i had absolutely no issues with my body for the first time since i can remember. i went off vyvanse after i got in a bad car accident and totaled my car (i had an absence seizure and i know vyvanse was the cause). i’m on a different medication now and i’m doing a little better stress and depression wise so i gained weight without realizing it. lately i’ve noticed it and it has literally been consuming me. i’m not fat at all, i’m just chubbier than i was, the pants i bought over the summer give me a muffin too now, my stomach isn’t flat when i sit down anymore, my thighs touch. that shit. normal people shit. since i realized my body changed though i’ve been having anxiety attacks pretty regularly, the worst being the other night. it lasted about 5 hours but at first was just irritability and like i couldn’t talk to anyone. by the time i went to bed it had started causing me AWFUL pain in my chest. like i had to make my boyfriend go to the other side of the bed and not touch me. after about an hour of laying there i fell asleep and woke up fine but the past week or so i’ve been falling into really bad eating disorder tendencies and i’ve become scared of some foods. i saw a picture of pizza today and my stomach literally dropped. i don’t want to be like this again and i don’t know how to just accept my body but i REALLY don’t want to get bad again bc the semester starts in a week and i start a new job at a hospital next month",mentalhealth,TW: ED idk what to do,2019-01-19 02:00:01

Over the past two years or so (I am young but an adult), I started to develop a sexual desire for younger girls, at first it scared me, but I began to be okay with it as I still had interest in women and thought I couldn't change my mind, and that meant I can still have a family as I knew if it came to I would rather die than hurt my future kids.

I took a leave of absence in the middle of my internal medicine rotation, but I came back for the next rotation. Next week I'll go back to re-do my internal medicine rotation and for the past few days I have an increasing feeling of dread when I think about it.

I feel like I'm in a much better place now since I finally have a combination of therapy and medications that work for me, but I'm scared that I'll have another panic attack or mental breakdown that'll force me to take another leave. This rotation has a reputation of breaking people down because it's a lot of work, even all our doctors and professors know it. I thought I would be fine when I started this rotation last year since I was slowly titrating my med to get to the right dosage and regularly seeing my doctor. I was constantly hypomanic and irritable, and then I had a panic attack during a shift in the ER, so I immediately asked for a LOA until I got my mental health sorted. As the rest of the rotation finished up, I kept talking to my friends and they always talked about the stress and how some people changed because of it.

I could really use some advice here. I feel like I'm getting worried about nothing. On one hand, I've seen how it stressed out people even without mental illness and I'm hesitant about confronting a trigger (or however you may call it).

I asked her also for a note to say I haven't been well the past few months, I needed this note badly.  I have social anxiety and depression,  and I was barely functioning bar one time I got a call from a company I tried doing training but was having severe panic attacks, I just got 2 assignments done for college,  and missed the attendance.

  I started crying in front of her and saying you don't understand how difficult life is for me,  she had no sympathy, she hesitantly wrote a letter saying I have a bit of anxiety but am fine,  which was not satisfactory at all, she told me to up my meds,  and gave me a name of an emergency walk in.

I was raped when I was 18, tried to kill myself 4+ times. I want to die, everyday, my mind never shuts up about how the past could have been, or what I could have done instead. There was times when I used to be happy, that is no more. Constant thoughts of going to the people who kicked me out and shooting myself in the head in front of them. I wouldn't hurt them, they hate me cause I just, am asexual and they wanted poly, they would be happy now as ive tried to contact the guy who got mad for months. 2 years of everything I thought I had a home, gone. 


tdlr: Diagnosed with PTSD, Clinical depression. My mind won't be quiet, Intense heart pain, suicidal. No health insurance.  
I take high doses of Citralopram already since 12.  It helps but not with this. I have not smiled in almost seven months.

Ive tried to get help before, they say change my Citralopram but it helps with what it does. I tried to switch made me worse. My brain will kill me, it will never let me rest, not even in my dreams. What should I try to ask about with my doctor? What helped with any of you all? Please and thank you, don't want pity party, just want to know what helps. I do not believe in therapy as my brain is made wrong, I have no friends in real life or boyfriend. I have about a month left til it wins.  I will never let myself forget my mistakes. Forgiveness I have done, but understanding it cannot.   


What medications help with quieting my mind, I keep having flashbacks, zoning out, daydreaming, recent severe sharp chest pain in arm and neck. Should I get a Beta-blocker or a PTSD medication(Couldn't afford the 800$ one never took it)

I've been dealing with 3 different ""voices"" in my head for a while now and we were able to put two of those different ""thought processes"" into those categories.
I just, honestly wanted to ask if anyone else has had an issue with your mind going on and on and on with itself. One thought process is more all over the place and emotional, Loki. Another is a bit more logical, Grey. And the other is more obsessive/compulsive, Benny.
These three drive me absolutely nuts because they just kinda ""talk"" to eachother. Like, even now I'm getting thoughts about ""why are u typing this shit out people r gonna think we r crazy"" and ""This is a good way to see if other people go through this.""

I’ve been having alot of symptoms for a very long time (7-9years) but i never really thought there was something wrong with me. But over the years I started realizing as my life is literally getting ruined. My moods pretty much control me in a way that sometimes I myself loose track of who am I. I do suffer from excessive mood swings that completely change my behavior from happy, talkative, social and productive to a complete depressed person who doesn’t wanna interact with people, not even by eye, and I would lock myself in the room for days full of negative thoughts while my friends are literally chilling in the living room. This has caused me so many social problems especially with my roommates who I argue with daily when im feeling down. I’d be so irritated and I’d go off on the person who just tries to start a conversation which really made me lose so many relationships but guess what, I dont care and im still the king of this world and no one is better than me, which changes sometimes to im a complete loser, embarrassment and shitty and why am i like this. This has confused me alot and I finally started realizing it. I dont blame any of them who went off on me once saying im very moody and they dont wanna interact with me anymore, and im like “good for you”. I literally can’t remember the last time I laughed hard as my ups are mostly talkings and producing tasks. When it comes to school, I have never maintained a steady sleep pattern for over 7 years now. I find it Impossible to sleep even when im exhausted and I cant get of bed even when i wake up. And sometimes its the exact opposite, I sleep little and late but I wake up early and very active. The smartest kid is now one year late on graduation because he can’t make it to class, who would believe it? And when friends and family tell me just wake up and go to school im like I don’t care! I have literally been empty with no feelings for years and one could really see it on my face and my voice tone as it never changes not even for a surprise or happy or whatever which so many have realized it and expressed their disgust, but I guess I still don’t care! again, this is me. But I’ve come along way to realize that I don’t really have a hand on this and I gotta do something because my social and academic life is literally getting ruined.

Everytime I socialize its like a blank mood when i don’t really recognize whats being said and what im saying. When I think of past conversations im like why did i say that? Why did they say that? And i say so many things that confuses the other person and sometimes I say irrelevant things and they would correct me but i insist im right. I have also lost lots of people for not turning their phone calls although I was doing nothing, there are people who invited me and wanted to hung out so many times but I never went.

As a kid i would get nervous about doing speeches and going to swimming training. Now I just keep having these ridiculous thoughts that prevent me from bettering myself and living a normal life. I'm under the impression every one I know hates me and are being nice to me just for the sake of it. I also believe I am a burden to my parents for not having a job rather I'm more like an expense for them. I am also too afraid to drive because of the potential for me to accidentally screw up and my dad get angry at me. Also because I'm afraid of getting in a car accident. I am overweight and have a disorder called trichotillomania (where I pull out my eyelashes and eyebrows) and a condition called Policystic Ovarian Syndrome (that affects my periods and comes with symptoms like anxiety, female baldness, difficulty losing weight, infertility). Because of these two conditions I consider myself very ugly. My friends and family reassure me that I am not ugly but I know I am, they are being nice and caring. I am quite awkward as a person and get anxious in social situations because I believe people do not care about me or what I have to say. Because of being ugly and being so terrible situations I have convinced myself i am going to die alone. Over the past year on dozens of occasions I have cried myself to sleep because of these thoughts that are being blown out of proportion in my mind. I would like to disclose I am not suicidal, in fact I'm quite afraid of dying ad recently a girl in my year tragically passed away in a car accident. Since then I have realised my own mortality and the concept of death is terrifying because it is so permanent. I know all of this must sound so nothing like I should just get over it because I believe that too. But these stupid thoughts are really consuming me and preventing me from living a normal, independent life. Every now and then each of my parents have said really awful stuff to me and that has really hit me hard. Like with my trichotillomania they have told me I don't look normal and have even mentioned the word ""freak"" a couple of times. It's honestly bad enough having that condition but when the ones close to you are reinforcing these negative thoughts you desperately want to get rid of it's just so disheartening. Fortunately they have stopped mentioning my trichotillomania to me but I know they judge me for still doing it. All I want is to just be independent. Be able to earn my own money from a job I'm confident in and drive to places comfortably. It's embarrassing being my age and unable to do these things and I'm tired of it.

1271,redcapris,1547796757,1,"I'm 21 years old and been having a really rough time with my mental health for the past three years. My doctor seems pretty confident that I have bipolar 1 disorder, because I've had a handful of manic episodes that respond well to lithium, periods of depression, and periods of stability. The depression is a lot more stubborn than the mania, though. And that's where my issue is.

So when I'm depressed, I become extremely sad, cry excessively, become completely hopeless for the future, ruminate excessively, think about suicide, isolate myself, barely leave my house, lose most of my motivation, and sometimes hear voices and/or become delusional. My thinking becomes very irrational, and I'm aware of this. 

I've had providers suggest that I have borderline personality disorder during these depressive episodes but then change their minds because all the borderliney symptoms go away when I'm not depressed. I've also researched BPD a lot because of this and don't relate much to it, even on my worst days. But my symptoms don't seem to go along with a typical depressive episode either. I posted on another sub recently how I feel like therapy is difficult because therapists make a lot of false assumptions about me and seem to misinterpret what I'm saying a lot. I also tend to find therapy very invalidating and often walk out feeling significantly worse than when I walked in. I'm also terrified of saying the wrong thing and getting labeled as difficult/melodramatic/exaggerating. I've experienced these difficulties both with general depression/anxiety cbt style treatment as well as dbt. I want to try therapy again but I'm not sure where to go next because I don't really know what's wrong with me. It's almost like, in addition to bipolar, I have some weird illness or personality disorder that isn't fully understood. This isn't baseless either - I have had several providers admit they aren't really sure how to help me or what do with me, or even what disorder I have. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't want to choose some random cbt/dbt therapist, go to four or five sessions with them and get nothing done because I spent the entire time explaining one single idea/correcting their assumptions/crying uncontrollably, then deciding they're not a good fit.

1273,tinacrum,1547795172,1,"## I often fall into long moods of sadness or frustration. Being that I'm 16, I thought maybe this was just regular menstrual cycle or puberty periods. I started going to counseling for anxiety and experiences in my past I had, but I could never really get into it. I tried to go alone with the methods being practiced but my mind felt foggy and unfocused. I kept trying but the anxiety got worse. I began to re-develop tics I had gotten from when I was a kid but they had gotten much more sever. I had just started going to a new school and already developed a nice social connection with the community, but my tics made me socially awkward (something I never struggled with). I started shutting myself out even more than usual (I was introverted before, but just to a normal teen standard) now it was hard to leave my room or even talk with my family. During this whole time, I never realized how dulled all my senses had become and how over driven my emotions were sometimes. Some days I couldn't feel anything and others it was almost everything at once. I had started staying home as my tics would get worse in public. All I could do to semi calm them down was being alone. One night I felt a overwhelming sense of tension allover my body, like every atom was tightening up. My tics got more sever than they had ever been and I felt like I couldn't take it. I grabbed a bottle of pills and was contemplating overdosing; I just needed everything to stop. I picked up my phone and started texting a support system. They calmed me down, I put down the pills, but in mid conversation my phone died. It was almost 12am but I wasted to charge my phone and get back to them, but while it was charging I fell asleep. I woke up at 1am to police walking in my house and asking me if I texted a hotline. I said yes and they asked to see the texts. By then my phone was charged so I handed it to them but the conversation had been deleted. I truly don't know how this happened, but because they couldn't see the conversation, they took me to the hospital. I stayed for one day, I felt safe and I didn't have tension but I felt extremely numb in the morning as I was getting consoled by a counselor. I felt tense again and anxious talking about what happened and what was wrong with me. Despite this, the counselor determined me fine to go home as I was ""intelligent in understanding my metal state and well being"". I felt there was/ is something much deeper that's digging at me that hasn't been addressed by myself or medical professionals. I feel like I often doubt that I can fix myself because every time I make myself try to be mentally stable and better, I don't trust myself that I can do it and it just gets worse, which probably has to do with my awful low self esteem. I am still very shut off, occasionally have tics but mostly apparent while I'm in public, although my mom says she doesn't notice, I still feel it very intensely. I have lost the motivation that I had had the beginning of the school year and don't care about work anymore, which has been very out of character. I wasn't ever on my phone much but now I just never look at it or respond to people trying to get to me. I often put off things because I see them as unimportant and my view of life has become extraordinary bleak, like life is meaningless because it ends kind of bleak. It wasn't till just twenty minutes ago that I re-discovered something so vital to life, physical senses. I hadn't felt them for about six months and all of the sudden they just returned. I didn't notice they were gone but this sudden change reminded me of something I had been missing. Now just want an explanation to the numbing of these senses. Could it be because I was so caught up in my mind that I began blocking out normal feelings and just focusing on self depreciating ones? I feel like that's it, but you tell me. Also, I feel like it's obvious my tics flair up while I'm in public. Why is this? I was never socially awkward but now it's like that's all that flairs it up. I mean even going to church gives me tics. So, why is that, shouldn't I feel at peace there?

1277,everythinghurts25,1547792819,1,"Hi, all. New to the sub.

I've had depression &amp; anxiety since I was 11 - the depression comes in waves. I haven't self-harmed since I was in high school, that's also the last time I was in any therapy or on any meds. I had major jaw surgery during my senior year and the last antidepressant I was prescribed was Prozac and due to the surgery it was liquid so that was kind of my final straw with antidepressants as nothing I'd tried was ever an improvement. I'd say I always kind of have a lingering depression weighing on me, but it's been manageable for some time.

As far as anxiety, that's been very persistent over the last 10 years. I imagine that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Maybe if I pursue something different career-wise, it'll calm down a bit but I don't think so.

But the depression has been different in the last few weeks. I feel absolutely nothing. Whereas before my depressive episodes consisted of crying and sadness, I'm just feeling numb and nothing. I have no desire to do anything. I just graduated with my BS last month and I'm pursuing a BA to be finished next year. I'm really happy with school but I have yet to find a related job in my field. In fact, I keep using my PTO so I don't have to go to work because being there is just creating more anxiety. I get panic attacks at work so I just go home and I sit in my bed and I feel nothing. I just don't care what happens to me and I don't know how it got like this. In addition, while I haven't acted upon it, I think about self-harming quite often and while I don't necessarily think about suicide, I just kind of think about dying - in the sense like, if something happened to me, I wouldn't care. When I think about those things, I also think about just driving as far away as I can or I think about getting drunk or high, which just kind of exacerbates my feelings. 

I'm just not even sure what to do with myself anymore. I'm trying to get a different job but I just don't think that's going to be the fix-all.

i've woken up in the middle of the night to this feeling two- maybe three- times in my life and it always lingered for a few days; very heavy. waking up to this in a dark room can really shake you, because it's like you're not you. the physical sensation of being in your body is still there and familiar, but the brain that's controlling and processing everything isn't the one you've come to know so well over the span of your entire life.

sometimes the insights this rarely achieved state yields are incredibly valuable, but they are also- as mentioned above- extremely frightening. i've lied to myself so much that my internal dialogue-- the one thing that's supposed to be pure and sacred-- has become tainted. i no longer know what it means to be true to myself. i don't know what's real anymore, because even my inner voice is always playing tricks on me, misguiding me. sometimes an objective voice surfaces trying to restore order in my psyche, but it's quickly shut down by the version of me which lives for making bad impulsive decisions which i know will hurt me. maybe that bad version of me was born of my innermost repressed desires... or maybe it was groomed by me to become the version of me that i think other people would best like- i don't know. even just typing all this feels unauthentic to me, yet i continue to do it anyways.

life floats by at staggering speed, not enough time to process it all. i'm in awe of everything, but don't care about anything. the concept of day/night/week/weekend/month/year is meaningless to me- it's all the exact same. goals and ambitions left long ago. waiting for something- i don't know what. indifferent whether i live or die. sometimes i feel moments away from jabbing a knife in my throat or heart or driving into oncoming traffic or jumping off a roof. glimpses of my old ambitions and superficial interests keep me around, hoping i'll execute the desire... but they're really only glimpses and dissipate the moment i ease off that momentary lapse of wanting to go on.",mentalhealth,are these moments of madness or epiphany?,2019-01-18 16:17:50

I’m writing because for the past 6 months or so, I’ve been having the bizarre experience of being unsure if I’ve said a thought in conversation, or if I kept it in my head. Multiple times when I’m talking to someone, I’ll find myself saying “I’m not sure if I’ve already said this but ______”.

When I look back on past conversations from days or weeks ago, I’m also confused as to what I’ve kept private VS shared in the discussion. 

I’m wondering if anyone has experienced this, or knows what it might be. Maybe it’s relevant to say that I do have CPTSD and an anxiety disorder. I’ve also had some psychotic episodes in the past where my reality became really confusing.

Sure, it is not an illicit drug or alcohol or nicotine, but I feel like something is wrong. I'm **not** attempting to kill myself - I love my life. I just... get these uncontrollable urges that don't go away until I give in. I don't get it - in the past, I was able to go for nearly a year between single cuts. In fact, before these 3 weeks of daily cutting, I hadn't cut since February 2018. Here's my question: **was I hardwired to be addicted to cutting from the very first time I tried it, back in 2014?** How is this suddenly an issue after 11 months of being clean? I think it's important to mention that I've always managed to go about 11 months between episodes. But somehow it keeps happening. Whether it's one cut or a dozen, it keeps happening. Like I said, this is the very first time it's happened consistently (daily) for an extended period (3 weeks). Also, I'll mention that **my therapist is aware of the situation** and we started doing DBT again today.

I feel absolutely powerless. I know the situation is absolutely out of control, and I'm honestly *terrified*, but I feel like there's nothing I can do. When those urges strike, there is nothing I can do to quell them but *give in*.

1300,Cyclotaur,1547778360,1,"A few months ago, I made a video, with an ambient soundtrack. I have always played guitar, but I came upon some effects, and some sounds that made my heart just sunder with emotion.  
Now my mental health has been a roller coaster since I was young. 2018 was a great year for me to be honest. But after the summer, until a little bit after new years eve, I gradually became more depressed and more anxious. But i stayed strong. I still did what I have to do, I still went to work. But it was so hard.  


In the end of november, when my depression was at a high point, I sat down to play guitar. And my depression was eating away at my motivation to play guitar, something that i have loved to do for so many years. Until i felt something. The sounds i came upon made my feelings just disappear.   


Whatever i felt, was completely numbed. The only thing i can explain it as, is an ego loss. My thoughts were completely shut off and i was entranced in the sounds i was creating. Although some may find the sounds and images i created disturbing, for me it is pleasant. I like to challenge my own mental health, to get healthier. And i do that via sounds that may trigger some peoples anxiety. I have listened to many tracks that have induced anxiety to me. And it is inspiring. Not only inspiring musically, but mentally. I want to feel the fear, to overcome it. I intentionally give myself anxiety to know how to deal with it when it comes to me unexpected. Are there anyone else that can share the same experience as i have to ""scary"" music? If someone is wondering what kind of music i am talking about i can link them.  


If someone is willing to listen to what i created during my ""ego loss"" link is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvNN3tz3HAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvNN3tz3HAY)  (it might be a bit scary to some, it was for my mom atleast. But there are no jump scares here just my emotions pouring out of me through audio waves)  


For me music has been the only thing that has kept me sane for so many years. And right now my mental health is getting better. Mostly because my motivation for making music is growing.

1305,RareMoth,1547776787,1,"I had something traumatic happen to me...

For context:
I have always had depression.  But it was under control until now.  I also had been successfully repressing some very very severe trauma that happened many years ago, but now it’s loose.  I had not been getting the help I really should have gotten and thought I could just ignore my mental health.

I don’t know how to describe it but it’s like I was a delicate house of cards but it was working until now.

I never did any drugs or psychedelics because I knew how precarious my mental health situation was and figured if I could just avoid anything traumatic, stay safe and reclusive, I could avoid an absolute mental breakdown.  It’s been a very delicate situation but I ignorantly thought I could just manage like this for the rest of my life.

This most horrifically traumatic event just happened to me and it’s like my head went off like a nuclear fucking bomb.  Holy shit it’s horrible.

The night after it happened:  
I couldn’t stop vomiting from sheer panic and horror and didn’t sleep for days.  I realized I was in trouble and I fucked up.  

Not only am I dealing with this new trauma but it’s unlocked Pandora’s box and EVERYTHING CAME BACK AT ONCE.  Like repressed memories, horrifying emotions that i didn’t let myself feel, everything I repressed.

I finally contacted a therapist and he recommended I see him twice a week.

Sometimes I feel like it helps, sometimes I wonder why I’m spending so much fucking money to vent at a stranger.  

I forget why I’m writing this post...

I guess what i want to say is this...

I feel like I’m experiencing ego death.  The realization came to me today.  The word “ego death” resonates with me deeply.  I’m not a religious person at all so I don’t mean it in a magical mystical sense, but every description of what ego death is supposed to feel like resonates with what I’m feeling.

Would it be ridiculous to tell my therapist this?  The concept of “ego death” does exist in jungian psychology but do you think he’ll think I’m talking about it in a mystical sense?  I don’t mean I reached enlightenment or anything dumb like that.  

Does any of this makes sense or would I just be wasting therapy time rambling about this bizarre sensation?

1312,rubber-toes,1547773484,1,"When I was little, I had my first trip to the dentist. When we went, we went to an adult dentist. This seems weird to people, but 1) my sisters had gone perfectly fine and 2) my family was, well, poor. Options were limited. When I went, I was fine, but the atmosphere of that particular office was just so terrifying. It was these round rooms with subdued lighting and everything was gray or green. The dentist was an old man and his assistant were just a bunch of young women. As a kid, this mental image just didn't work out, and I left the place kicking and screaming.
This happened a few times until, one time, I got a cavity. I was already scared of the dentist, but having to do extra and have a needle in my mouth? I couldn't do that. They tried to do fillings again and again, but every time, I wouldn't cooperate. So, I had to be sent to some special dentist for kids. 

This is where the story gets worse, though. This particular dentist was some lady who used a papoose board. If you don't know what that is, it's a guard used to tie uncooperative kids down. She also used sedation. As I've apparently learned, sedation dentistry isn't recommended for kids most of the time. This felt like TORTURE. Not being able to move, random metal things in my mouth, and all the while I was kind of woozy with the faint taste of strawberry sedation gas in my mouth too, so I couldn't even scream or try to move. After 2 or so visits, I got my filling. I can't blame my parents for this either because they're non-native English speakers and only saw me before and after they did this, so apparently my mom only had a faint idea of what was happening. 
For about 5 years after this, going to the dentist felt like the same torture, even if I wasn't tied down or sedated. I only scraped by because I never got a cavity until that point.
After that period, though, we switched dentists after this dentist retired. The new guy was just very mild mannered. His office had natural lighting and was well designed, which just sort of eased me too. After that, he retired too, and I'm perfectly fine at my current dentist. I've even gotten cavities out.
Sometimes, though, the memory of being tied down just comes back and I just feel sort of dirty? I don't know how to describe it, really. Kind of how you feel when you hear of something terrible that happened to someone else. That feeling. I don't know what it is, but when it happens, I just feel really bad. 
Does anyone have any idea of what's happening? I've asked my mom and she assured me it couldn't have been that bad, but I remember it, and when I do, I don't feel comfortable.

My self care as far as grooming and eating is improving and I was contemplating the entire exercise of self care because I know in the depths of my depression, I couldn't give a shit less and I didn't have any hope a self-care routine would make me feel better. 

I meditated on how far I've come as far as taking better care of me this week. What I've come up with is that ""self care"" for me means taking the best care of me that I'm able to on any given day, and trusting that I'll make progress regardless of whether I can give 10% or 110% on any given day. My self-care has improved immensely over the last year and I wasn't conscious of it until I thought on it more deeply. What I found in my thoughts on self care is that even when I was just going through the motions and not really doing things right because I didn't care, I was still building self-care habits. 

When I was at my worst, crying on the shower floor every day and only getting in the shower because everyone said it was important, at some point, I took the step from crying on the floor to running fingers through my hair because I figured maybe if I worked out the clumps to get water to wash all of the individual hairs, I'd scratch my head less in public and look less stupid. I didn't even realize I was doing it and I certainly didn't recognize it as a step towards better self care. 

I'm still evaluating my process so I can better explain it to people looking to improve their situation. Through a process of a thousand baby steps in the last two years, I've now got a full shower routine and set up of care products with my own chosen brands of shampoo, conditioner, shave lotion, beard balm, and toothpaste (I brush in the shower, it's just easier when you have less time in a shared bathroom).

You'll gain momentum if you trust the process. It may take years and you may not even note the progress you've made until years after that. Even getting in the shower every day started with me forcing myself to shower every other day. I promise that your energy is not wasted in your efforts and that you're making progress even if you feel like you're not going anywhere or getting any better.

&amp;#x200B;

this kind of connection is very difficult to definitively prove because obviously there are a lot of other factors related to both creative output and mental health but i would guess that a lot people who have spent substantial time around creative individuals can confirm that artists' perceptions of their surroundings often correlate to symptoms in the realm of various mood disorders, particularly: a fixation on the melancholy and disturbing qualities of life; obsessively making connections between various aspects of their experience; reading ""between the lines""; idealizing relationships (both personal and impersonal); and and finding themselves unable to place value on the things that are expected of a ""productive citizen"".  not all artists fall under this category (perhaps less so people specializing in more practical things like artistic cabinetry or something) but ""tortured"" people often find refuge in abstract expression. it's definitely a stereotype worth dissecting but it's disingenuous to label it the ""myth of the tortured artist""...and quite dismissive towards mentally ill people who do find reprieve in expressing the unique outlook that their condition creates﻿.

&amp;#x200B;

from an article in canadian journal of psychiatry-

""A model of shared vulnerability explains the relation between creativity and psychopathology. This model, supported by recent findings from neuroscience and molecular genetics, suggests that the biological determinants conferring risk for psychopathology interact with protective cognitive factors to enhance creative ideation. Elements of shared vulnerability include cognitive disinhibition (which allows more stimuli into conscious awareness), an attentional style driven by novelty salience, and neural hyperconnectivity that may increase associations among disparate stimuli. These vulnerabilities interact with superior meta-cognitive protective factors, such as high IQ, increased working memory capacity, and enhanced cognitive flexibility, to enlarge the range and depth of stimuli available in conscious awareness to be manipulated and combined to form novel and original ideas.""

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't post here much. I do have depression and anxiety and I have for some time. It's been a struggle that has affected my ability to build healthy relationships, finish my education and caused issues with jobs that I've held. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last couple of years, I realized I needed professional help and started to see a therapist regularly. In the last year I started taking medication. Throughout all of that, my dad was the one person I could always talk to. About anything. Almost at any time of the day. He didn't always offer the best advice, but I know he listened and cared. And did his best. In November of last year, he passed away. 

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't expected. It was abrupt. And nearly two months later, I'm still struggling. I know grief is a process. It takes time and it gets easier over time (or so they say). But it doesn't feel like that to me. Early December, I actually felt like I was doing better. Then the holidays hit and away went that feeling. And now mid January, I'm really struggling with it again. It feels like its happening all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I think of all the times I called him or talked with him when I got home from work. How he would stop by my store and buy something from me and we'd grab lunch together. How I could share something I found interesting with him and he'd listen. I want to work and stay busy with school, but it's hard. I feel like half of me is absent minded from both, thinking about my dad and how I'll never see him, hear him, or hug him again.  I miss him so much and I feel so lost and scared without him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess besides sharing those feelings and how therapeutic that is in and of itself.... is there any advice fellow readers have to help?

1321,ShrewThatWasNotTamed,1547765885,1,"This is my first ever full on post on reddit and I'm only doing it because I'm at my wits end. Apologies if it ends up sounding convoluted.

I'm a fairly outgoing and successful young adult who has been dealing with anxiety for most of my life. When I was younger it really hindered me, and it still does but I've gotten pretty good at the whole ""fake it til you make it"" thing. I've recently gotten back to university after taking a two-year break to take care of my mother. After she passed away I didn't let it affect me much because the rest of my immediate family was already struggling, and I felt like I had to be there for them. Now that I'm back on my own, moving on with my life, I feel like I'm finally falling apart and I don't know what to do about it. I live by myself and struggle sharing my issues with other people, as it makes me feel weak and like a burden. I'm aware I'm a very stubborn person, and know a part of my problem stems from not ever seeking help or sharing my problems with anyone.

A little bit before going back home to take care of my mother I did end up going to a counselling service, but I felt like it didn't do me any good. I'm weary of seeking medical help again, because last time it ended up doing more harm than good and it ended up triggering severe depression and suicidal thought. I'm not at that point right now, but I don't think I've ever been this anxious. I've been sleeping 1-2 hours a night if that. I second-guess everything I do. Every noise I hear startles me. I forget to eat. The semester has barely begun and I already feel it creeping up to affect my academic performance, which just makes me more anxious. Any advice on how to deal with this or how to try and start opening up about it to other people is most welcome.

Again, sorry if this sounds confusing or if this is just not the place for this kind of post. I just didn't know where to post it. Thank you.",mentalhealth,I think I need help.,2019-01-18 09:58:05

I feel there is so much more wrong with me because my head is just a big jumble of thoughts. Constantly i have suicidal thoughts (which my parents and doctor knows about) but they think it has decreased a little bit and honestly they have but now they are back more often. The suicidal thoughts yeah suck but i wont give into them  because i cannot hurt my family like that and i am too scared to go through with it. I feel like in the future i will though. Like just say whatever and let go. Im turning 18 this year and that makes everything worse. Past that i feel so messed up i DO NOT know myself enough to explain myself. There are times when i feel numb. It is the worst feeling ever but lately i havent been feeling that and been going straight to suicidal thoughts which i wish i felt numb instead. My mind is like always screaming at me i can never focus on anything because im trapped in my head. I never try anymore in school well i have good grades in all but one class but still i cant escape my mind. I can be fine one minute and for no reason want to die or have terrible anxiety. I feel as if i am not connected with the world. Like one time i was walking with my friends in school and i was so deep in my head i forgot where i was. I always feel as if i was someone else for a second and then back to like feeling again. Now i want to admit myself to a psychiatric hospital but i just cant have my parents worry more than they do and also the cost. I also need a therapist but i feel since my parents found like nobody that covered their insurance that they gave up. They ask me randomly if i think i still need to talk to someone and each time i say yes. Because i really do.

1323,arabianblonde,1547764630,1,"No one I've met seems to understand what this is. It started when I was a child, exactly when my childhood abuse ramped up considerably. I'd be doing my thing, and suddenly, I'm hit by this... psychological asteroid. I feel like the ground dropped beneath my feet, I'm in a void. The closest I can describe is this: like being punched in the chest, but mentally. When you're hit with so much physical force that you can't even register the pain, you can't even scream, the wind is knocked out of you, and you're just clawing for breath? It's like that, but mentally.  It goes away after a minute or two but it's the most excruciating minutes of my life. 

I know what it's like to feel suicidal. Joy slowly seeps away from life, everything seems dull and tedious, and the thought of going on is simply exhausting. It's hard to hang onto any memory that still evokes joy in those moments, usually after devastating fights that have killed my self worth. (Is there a name for this feeling btw?) It's similar to how I'd feel every time my mother visited: like walking in a nuclear wasteland, everything turned to white concrete dust, I'm just a husk, a corpse that's already dead, and I just want to lie down and rest. 

But this... mental punch thing I just described, it's different. The nuclear wasteland feeling, or the joy seeping out of life feeling, I can feel that it's bad. But this feeling... I'm not numb, so I know how terrible it is, but it's too much pain to process so I'm gasping for breath. My therapist told me it might be something like dissociation but I'm not sure what that even means. Is this common? 

Also, if I have these kinds of feelings, it feels like depressive states - but I was prescribed Lexapro to help with anxiety attacks (it's diarrhea, cold sweat, shaking, feeling sick, etc. right?) when my mom calls. Wouldn't the lexapro make it worse? 

Thanks for reading my barrage of questions. I'd appreciate any insight.

Whenever I look up this subject the key words are always depression, suffering, suicidal, anxiety, dealing with, etc. and I gotta be honest, I can’t relate to this at all. A couple of years ago I derealized and I finally felt free. I’ve never been happier. Sure I have ups and downs in life but on average I’m just happy. 

I’ve always had an interest in science as a child and studied it both professionally and as a hobby. Maybe my understanding of quantum mechanics has influenced and maybe triggered my perception of this unreal world. I don’t know. All I know is that I love this feeling. Knowing the world is a meaningless mess of chaotic fakery has brought meaning to my life, as ironic as that sounds. Like a lucid dream, I am free to do anything I want.

It's like if the person is getting ahead when it comes to self-improvement where I lack I get anxious or worried that I will be behind them or left behind or something? Not like physically because I know who my lifelong loved ones are, and family will always be family.

An more recent example is how I know multiple people who move up in their jobs. They seem to be more easy-going and even at times timid like me, but they are improving their leadership skills. It feels like to me that it's just to meet society's (and better yet corporate's) expectations. I feel like each person changes in a way that it would make them gravitate away from me, and thus leading to loneliness I can already naturally feel with my depression in the first place.

I know deep down that they won't think less of me, and that I feel supportive more than anything. But when I am going through these phases, how do I cope and improve my feelings?

1333,himank_w,1547756752,1,"Whatever I'm writing following this sentence is a thought that has been generated and evolved over a long period of time. 
Humans, as an individual species, have faced completely new issues to deal with every other century. Issues that seem way off the capabilities of the brain to imagine. The past two centuries saw us humans coming across new diseases that emerged out of nowhere in the human race. These diseases caused widespread fatalities before the humans were able to develop themselves to cure these diseases with the growing field of medicine. However, the more important part of this journey was the change in the thinking of the people of that era, from the day they came across the disease for the first time to the day when they were equipped with enough technology to handle it. This journey was a long period and in some cases even lasted for periods wherein the generations changed. And during this transition period, many people had to face the consequences of the disease because the society wasn't ready enough to help them with it. However insensitive it may sound, but these fatalities were inevitable because bringing about a radical change, both in terms of science and thought process in the mind of society comprising of millions of people, does take a lot of time. This time period was a dark phase where the residents of the period had to face the consequences without any catch. But after this transitional period, things did change and humans altogether were able to overcome the challenge faced by their older generations. Just like any such major issue or disease, the 21st-century humans have come across a new issue, the issue of mental illnesses. It might be wrong to call it new but since a major number of people are coming up and addressing their mental health in the past decade, it seems fairly new. People from all corners of the world have acknowledged these mental health issues but still, the majority of the world population is yet to comprehend the existence of such illnesses in a realistic manner. I personally have met a lot of people who've been facing severe anxiety issues and depression and are trying every other way to deal with it but are unable to heal themselves. People are committing suicides, getting involved in self-harm and other disturbing activities to deal with it because living a life with an unstable mind is really difficult of a task. My point is that I believe we, the current generation, have set up their clocks of the transition period. Mental illnesses are the challenge that our society as a whole has to deal with during this transition period. Every member of the society will have to transform themselves in order to understand the legitimacy of such illnesses and then develop ourselves to cure them. There will be fatalities, people will shatter emotionally and there will be pressure on everyone just like it has been in the past but this transition period will end after a certain time, leaving the human generation capable of overcoming mental illnesses. This doesn't mean that we just cross our arms and wait for time to do the work for us. The point is that every member of the society needs to understand and work for the cause without expecting quick and positive results. We might not even see a positive slope in the mental health charts of the affected community till the end of our lifetime but that shouldn't stop us from working for that bigger goal. I strongly believe that we all together will overcome this challenge in a timescale that might be larger than our lifetime, but we will get better. ",mentalhealth,A general yet vital observation.

I supported her in every which way I could (She has depression and dyslexia, I myself have ADHD and severe abandonment issues), she was the moon and stars and the entire universe to me. One night she was having a break down which she usually did (Because I didn't show her enough attention or any of the slew of excuses she had), she had been cutting herself in the bathroom as usual and would only talk to me until I apologised to her for her cutting herself or she would threaten me with suicide, grab my pills and try to O/D. One night I chose not to engage, I sat and played my favorite game to ignore the abuse, in an emotional frenzy she came up behind me and pulled me off my chair by my hair, I retaliated out of sheer panic and struck her on the nose once. She went into uncontrollable tears. Fast forward a few months later. She has told everyone; her therapist, family, friends, teachers you name it, that I beat her. I am not an abusive person, I have never had to ever raise a hand to any previous lovers, I know in my heart it is wrong to abuse people. She absolutely could not see that ever and still does not to this day. The next time I came over I wasnt comfortable with her friends as they all hated me, I wanted to leave, she refused to let me go and held onto my belongings so I couldnt get them, I tried to pry her away from them and she started to hit me hard, she pushed me onto the bed and tried to attack me, I then hit her a couple times to get her to just get off me on the side of the leg. She eventually let go. This wasn't the end of it, we paused for a few moments I tried to gain my breath again and retreat to the other end of the room away from her, she came at me flailing her around around and narrowly missing my face, ripping my shirt to pieces and I had to get out of there I was so damn scared I didn't even want to be in this situation, when she missed my face by a hair I had enough and hit her in the face causing her nose to bleed over her jumper. I was mortified, I had never had someone I loved so much try her best to start a fight with me. I'm a big guy and she's 6ft but she legitimately scared me to the point violence was my only option, I still feel immense regret to this day and guilt.

So backstory, I have severe PTSD driven anxiety that can be triggered by even seemingly small things. I also have depression which isn’t as bad, but lately has been a lot worse. On top of that I have chronic pain that really disrupts my sleeping. 

Problem: I’m am STRUGGLING to get out of bed in the morning. I set several alarms, but I just can’t get out of bed. I have thought about using those apps that force you to do puzzles or math equations before it turns off, but those have loud noises and scare people awake. If I set my phone too far away, I have to use a way louder sound that scares me awake or it doesn’t wake me. I can’t do that or I’m anxious all day. I also can’t have my boyfriend wake me up because my anxiety causes excessive irritability and that would be directed at him every morning. I’m at the end of my rope. I’m exhausted, I’m showing up late to work everyday, and I’m so frustrated with myself because no matter how much I say “I’m going to get out of bed in the morning” I just physically can’t remove myself until it is so late that I panic about being late to work and jump out of bed. Every. Morning. I need help, ideas, solutions, anything. Once I’m out of bed, I’m fine, but getting out of bed is quite literally the hardest thing for me to do each day.

1345,rivetingrosies,1547753283,1,"I’m in a toxic friendship where the person randomly gets bored or lonely or something I don’t know and starts fights. Very volatile fights where she tells me everything bad about myself and basically convinces me I am the worst person on this planet. She knows my secrets and insecurities and uses them against me. I have horrible social anxiety and a wide load of baggage myself and her episodes send me spiraling to dangerous lows. However, I have seen her hurt people in the end of other friendships. She does the absolute worst thing she can think of on her way out of a friendship so that she has the final upper hand. This includes ruining other relationships or actual physical assault. I desperately need out of this friendship but I am afraid of what she will do to me. I’m afraid she’s going to out me as lgbt to my family or tell my parents about some of the partying I’ve done. Or make up a lie that’s worse. I am so so afraid. She has told me she’s done being my friend today but she has done this many times and then returned with open arms and love a day or two later.

During my highs I stay caught up with my housework-laundry, dishes, tidying up; sleep well wake up at a normal time, overall happier/peaceful. During my lows I can't keep up with anything in my house, have trouble going to sleep(my mind goes through 100s of scenarios and I can't shut it off), wanting to sleep 12ish hours and just cranky. My zoloft was upped to 100mg in December and I was doing great but once the new year started I've been in a low phase. It seems like the meds are working anymore. I started off with 25mg in 2016 and have had to continuously up it at every follow up since then. I've described this to my provider but I'm at a loss.

Should I seek another provider? 
Could my issue be that zoloft isn't right for me?
Could I have another issue besides anxiety/depression?

1357,kidki11,1547738282,1,"Ok so I have tried to reach out on this with some other posts somewhere but maybe this is the more appropriate place.

I already have lots of people telling me to get therapy. I appreciate where their heart is at. 

But I really just feel like maybe I need some understanding and kindness about this issue. Like maybe so I dont feel like a disgusting monster. Like how can I have the courage to go talk to some doctor about this if I feel like I am so disgusting.

But anyway, here is my real issue. 

I am in love with my mom. I mean in a romantic way.

Like I have grown up in an environment that seems a bit unusual. See my mom dates all these rough characters and has been most of my life. Like she cycles through all these dudes, and I cant even keep track of it. She usually dates more than one guy at a time. Like I have gotten to where I try not even to notice who it is this week, because I know they will be gone soon. Its almost like a blur to me.

My mom has been the only consistent good thing in my whole life. Like she has always been good to me and make big sacrifices to take care of me. 

She usually works two jobs, and its like she almost never get any rest.

I am turning 16 next year and all i want to do is to quit school and get a full time job so i can help take care of her for a change.. Then maybe she wont need to work so much and we can be together more.

I guess the sexual desires come partly from the fact that I have grown up hearing her having sex all the time. Like the place we live right now, her bed is right up against the wall, so like when she is having sex, not only can i hear the whole thing, but like her bed bangs on my wall and i can kind of even feel it in my bed sometimes. But like even without that, she is real loud and yelling and she say like all this stuff i can hear, it leaves not much to the imagination sometimes.

What I really wish for deep inside is i could become the man in her life. 

I know this is all wrong, and i ain't ever going to be that for her.. but its what i feel deep inside and its what i daydream about all the time. 

And some people tell me not to think this way about hell, but i feel like i an going to hell.. like i deserve it, because i know i am messed up but i dont want my feelings to change

i have always been feeling like a sense of doom about my future my whole life. i dont know why that is exactly, but i think everyone else sees me that way too

i guess i just want to be able to say all this and not have someone tell me i am a bad person, even though i know i really am

I'm about to have a therapy session in a few hours that I'm 99% sure will end up with me being hospitalized. There are a few problems with this. 

1) I'm addicted to Kratom. I've been through the withdrawal already once before - I'm absolutely not going to try to get help if I'd have to do that again. 

2) I'm addicted to alcohol. My only withdrawal symptoms at the moment are insomnia and severe cravings. This will make kratom withdrawal that much worse. 

3) I'm prescribed a number of medications which help immensely when I'm not addicted to alcohol: effexor, wellbutrin, and vyvanse. Vyvanse helps with my emotional regulation more than anything, however, if I'm going through withdrawal, itd probably make me even more anxious and intensify my insomnia. Would I be allowed to abstain from it?

1363,MissFlameBoots,1547734961,1,"Hi, just wanted to see if anybody else had experienced something like this before. As a short summary;

* F/22 
* Had a job waitressing, got promoted to manager, got along well with boss &amp; co workers 
* Was good at the job and actively complimented by people higher up, really helped build up self esteem and confidence as well as social interactions 
* Got a job in a professional field through an internship programme as a first step towards getting a career 
* after I got through the initial anxiety of being in a new environment, eventually build up skills and worked my ass off to get noticed, eventually felt well liked and appreciated by team fell like i fit in well came out of my shell and felt comfortable and confident around others 
* A lot of team members left, new people joined and a new manager was introduced 
* manager was a good friend of mine at the time, all of a sudden started treating me like a stranger and speaking down to me referring to me as ""kid"" and just refused to treat me as an equal even in our personal time even though we talked all the time previously (keep in mind i had all the respect for them getting new responsibilities and did not try to take advantage of us being friends previously and spoke to them very politely just like any manager within work) 
* new people joined the team who were more experienced and a lot of my responsibilities were given to them, leaving me with no or very little work
* over time made me feel useless and a bit worthless, reduced all of my opportunities for progression 
* left out of many meetings further made me feel isolated, confidence was dropping now so I was finding it hard to make up the time with anybody else as I was getting nervous and anxious talking to people 
* add another couple of months, at that point my anxiety transferred into personal life, find it hard to talk to people and socialise and constantly criticise myself in my head during a conversations with others for not being funny or engaging enough
* Came back into my demons, fell back into depression started self harming for the first time again since my teens 

Trying to pull myself back together now, with hopefully a new job in the horizon but still confidence levels and self esteem are extremely low. As someone who was previously chatty and enjoyed being social to not be able to do that again because i literally feel as if my speech was taken away from me I can't really get a break even by going out or to bars or clubs. When talking to people the only thing I can think about is how much they are better than me in every way and how much of a piece of shit I am in the comparison. Mental health is very poor and really scared of the new job in case I fuck up or won't fit in.

1366,snoottheboop,1547732731,1,"Sorry this is a bit of an essay I've tried to split it into sections if you don't wanna read it all. I'm basically posting here because I'm at the end of my fucking tether and sometimes I feel like the only way i'm going to get any help is if I just try to kill myself. I've never been diagnosed with anything despite seeing the doctors for many years, and my father says I shouldn't pathologise everything but I would really just like to know what I'm working with, you know? I feel like my mood really fluctuates over a month, loosely following my menstrual cycle but i have quite an irregular one so I'm not sure it's just that. For a few weeks I'll feel generally really good, lots of energy and optimistic but with some not great days scattered around, and then for a few weeks I'll be having suicide ideations, sleep for hours and hours, cry a lot. I'm crying a lot these days anyway. I have family history of stuff, my father was a alcoholic most of his life and still struggles mentally but he  was raped when he was a boy at school and I've not had anything really terrible like that happen to me. I saw my parents arguing a lot when I was growing up and my dad drunk though.

 I've had some shit things happen to me recently, I cheated on my boyfriend (was trying to do an open relationship thing but he wasn't happy with it so I was a shit head) and we finally broke up 2 weeks ago after getting back together again for a few months after it happened.  It was not only the cheating, that was the finally nail in the coffin of my relationship really, what helped break it down really was that I would talk about my problems all the time with my boyfriend, I tried not to dump too much on him but it would just come out sometimes and I needed to speak to someone about it, then he wouldn't want to talk to me about his problems because he knew I was not feeling great. 

My cat is dying and I can't afford her treatment so I have to give her up to a shelter. I have absolutely no money, and I'm still trying to find some shitty job to do. I'm waiting to go back to uni in September, but have done no work. I did very badly at uni for second year, I feel like I shouldn't be there but I have to get a degree because I want to get a better job. I feel really shit about the art I make and I can't find the motivation or inspiration to do anything. I hate drawing now, but it's the only thing I can do. My tutor last year was incredibly demoralising and unhelpful.

I have been to several counselors before and have never found them to be much help, just someone to moan at and not have anything fixed, however the last one at my uni suggested to me to get a Dyslexia test and lo and behold I actually do have dyslexia. I don't know how bad because I can't understand my test results really and I need someone to go through them with me, but in bad moments my brain likes to tell me that it's not that bad, also when talking about it with other people they say 'Oh i have that too! i forget things sometimes!', when I'm over here just numbly accepting for the millionth time when I'm half an hour late for a hospital appointment and have shown up at the wrong place. 

I did some online cbt stuff last year for several months and it was somewhat helpful, and I don't feel quite as terrified at the prospect of going back to uni, but it doesn't help the shit feelings day to day. A few months ago when I had to take a bus to work it went by my uni and I had a massive freak out on the bus. I was sobbing and remembering all the shit times I had there, and that I still had to go back and finish it.

I had been taking antidepressants (Citalopram) for the past three years with a break of less than a year, but I came off them because they weren't really doing anything. It seemed they'd work a while at first but just fade. My boyfriend at the time said that I actually seemed happier generally when I cam off them, though that may have been because I came off them after the events in summer.

Should I write out everything that has been happening to me for a GP? I really just don't fucking know what to do anymore. I feel shit about myself and that there isn't any point in doing anything. I just want to be able to do shit and not feel like a piece of crap.  But then there's a voice in my head telling me that i'm just being pathetic, and in any case noone can really help me I have to help myself, but I literally just don't know what to do anymore because nothing seems to be changing, as time goes on it just gets worse.

1367,meandthedarkness,1547732633,1,"I am a 37F, wife and mother, who was diagnosed with ADHD at 15yo. I had one glorious high functioning month on Ritalin, and my mother never bothered to refill the prescription. Then, in my 20's in college a doctor put me on Adderrall, which made me feel ""high"" so I quit after two weeks (my therapist now thinks I wasn't ""high"" I was just thinking clearly and probably happy for the first time in my life and didn't realize the difference).

I recently have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression and generalized anxiety disorder which she suspects I have had since I was young (I had a v traumatic upbringing). I was shocked as I am high functioning, have a graduate degree and successful career and family life. My therapist explained that I have simply not ""noticed"" because I think it is my ""normal"". 

My ADHD and GAD has started disrupting my life, and my depression has caused me to withdraw from life and family and friends. I just thought I was tired, and didn't notice it until my husband pointed out I am in bed by 7pm every night, and hadn't been out with friends in six months. 

Anyways, I've finally accepted my diagnoses after months of apprehension, and am seeing a psychiatrist to get put on medication.

1368,KrAzZyG0d,1547731749,1,"Hi im a 22 year old guy from Portugal.

So i've been in depression medication since i was 16/17 and gradually got better but right now im on one of lowest points in life.

Im a freshmen in college and came to the city im studying at with a lot of expectations.

I lived in a super small village 30km away from the nearest city where i studied since my 5th grade. Since i lived so far away i couldnt go out or do stuff with my friends and at 16 i started to isolate myself playing videogames which i believe is what made me depressed. You know at that age you want to go out and meet new people but i couldnt do it.

I've always been really shy and had social anxiety so i decided that coming to this city would be perfect for me to change, open myself to people and meet a lot of new people. Which didnt happen because i kept being shy and having social anxiety and now i only know people from my class.
To make things worse i fell in love for a girl from my class and i think that i had a really really good chance but right now she doesnt care about me(we're still friends but its just a regular classmates friendship) and i think that she stopped trying because i didnt take actions with the fear of rejection.

So right now im thinking that i should ask my psychatrist for benzos or something like that so that i can overcome my social anxiety.
I dont know if its the best thing to do since i read that benzos give you suicidal behavior and i had/have problems with that without even taking benzos.
But on the other side i really feel the need to meet new people, mainly girls because i've never been in a real relationship and that crushes me inside.

I know its a long text and i really appreciate if you read the whole thing.

What is your advice?

1369,drellaxcvii,1547731326,1,"Hello, I just want to ask anyone who has ever experienced taking Sertraline/Zoloft since it was my first time being on antidepressants.

I was diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder last June 2018. My psychiatrist staryed me on Zoloft 50mg for 9 days, then it went up to 100mg, and now it's currently 150mg. 

I only saw my pschiatrist twice: (1) was when I went for consultation and diagnosis after my family doctor referred me and (2) on August, after 2 months of taking my medication. He asked me how I was and just continued to prescribe me my medication. Until now, I wasn't asked to go for another up-to-date check-up.

When I was taking my medication, the first few days were all nothing but the side effects until my body adpated to it. I've been sleeping too much or too little at random times of the day. I've been taking it consistently and still don't feel any change despite the change of dosage. Therapy, of course, was reccommended for the medication to be more effective. The thing is, I think therapy is a rip-off and I'm not comfortable talking to a therapist.

I stopped taking Zoloft on October when I started working for a late night shift, since my managers were giving comments about me being sleepy and sluggish which slows down my performance at work. I know it's wrong without the go signal from my psychiatrist. I experienced brain zaps for a period of two weeks and I just tried to tolerate whatever I am feeling. I didn't ask my family doctor or my psychiatrist if there's alternative for Zoloft that will make me less sleepy.

Ironically, though, I started overthinking less compared to when I was on medication. Or maybe it was just me who is trying to convince myself that I got better. Honestly speaking, I had  more breakdowns when I was on medication compared to when I am not on it. Although I still had thoughts of suicide and days when I am really at my worst self. Sometimes I still think I might be needing it still, sometimes I don't.

1370,Doveen,1547729821,1,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as i can remember, and... it kinda helps to imagine it as a 'person'. For example, i imagine my mental illness as a malicious, four legged demon made up of black, spikey crystals, with a long snout and red, glowing eyes.

And boooy does it help to separate it from myself! I am no longer struggling against myself, i no longer just scramble to hold a loose scaffolding together. I am fighting something, and each success is a victory not for normalcy, but AGAINST the bad things. And when i really think in to depression, i used to have a hard time climbing out, but now, i just close my eyes, imagine the demon and see them as an outside force i was not resisting, so i take up the fight. And it helps me struggle everyday

The thing is... is this a positive approach or will it have consequences later on i am not foreseeing?

1371,AlternativeBrain,1547726482,1,"Hi, I want to have 2nd opinion about the decision I am taking right now because honestly I am starting to feel like I am just (a)wasting my time, (b)wasting my money, (c) is being ridiculous ;\_\_\_;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I am booking an appointment with a licensed therapist near my city which has a good review(at least that's based on google review), I did make a phone call 3 months ago to talk in general and to grasp if I can like the therapist which I do. What prompts me to seek for a face to face session is because on the last internet counselling session, my (licensed)counselor are advising me to seek for a face to face session since the depressed check list he told me to fill in indicate that I might have a very severe depression, so I need to make sure if I'm depressed or not by having a face to face session since filling the check list only may not be 100% accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The problem:

As you have noticed it took me 3 months since the phone call to finally book an appointment because I need to create a time where I could skip work without my parents knowing and makes it all natural (I am a successor of family's business). The reason why I do this is because I do think my parents will either worry and not be supportive of my decision to seek for a psychologist(they think it's only for crazy people). In the length of 3 months I feel terrible mood swings and roller coaster feelings until I found an online friend I could talk to everyday that alleviate my loneliness and sometimes my anxiety because I can keep talking to someone non stop to distract my mind. Because of this, I started to think that maybe I am not depressed and maybe it's just me seeking for attention. My online friend kinda agree on this and agree too on my opinion that I could make my mind healthier myself without going to psychologist since it's kinda a waste of money(it's a bit expensive imo) because honestly I am just curious if I'm depressed or if I am just seeking for attention.

&amp;#x200B;

So I really want to understand how important it is to seek for mental help and how to differentiate if it's depression or not

Today I learned a distant friend ended his life when I went to settle a debt I was owed (one that was taking a toll on me). The person owing it was the best friend of the departed.

The last year has been one of the hardest of my life. My ex broke up with me in April, my relationship with my family has deteriorated to the point where I spent Christmas alone 200 miles away from anyone I care about, and I just don't what to do. I have very few friends - I'm always told that I'm a great person, but it takes me time to relax and open up with someone and i just find that people don't seem to give me a chance. I'm so lonely and for someone who spent 2 years in a beautiful relationship which of course wasn't perfect but was the happiest I've ever been, the lack of any form of physical contact with someone is crushing.
In December I had a day where I was very suicidal and if it wasn't for my ex talking to me and relaxing me then I wouldn't be writing this today. But then when I went to the hospital that night after 4 hours and 4 different appointments I was told that what I was feeling wasn't real.
To make things worse it's now exam season. I remember going through exams in June thinking how by now I'd hopefully be in a better place. But I'm not, I've got an exam in 7 hours time I'm so scared for, another 24 hours from now, and then 3 more in a weeks time.

Moving on; He referred me to a mental health group specialising in Depression and Anxiety. Which is weird because I'm not depressed, or at least I don't ever feel sad or hopeless.

When I spoke for like an hour or not about some of my stuff, I couldn't remember all of them. He immediately forwarded me onto a different group, a group that deals with other things like psychosis.

He told me that they aren't equipped to deal with hallucinations and delusions etc. As far as I'm aware, I'm not delusional but I have been having hallucinations. That's the main reason for asking help.

Now, I went to this new fella. I can't remember if he's a therapist or psychatrist. But, after our 2 hour session he told he's gonna go talk to a psychatrist. He never told me if he's going to call me back or anything.

I don't know if I should expect a call or not. I also don't know if they're the same group or building etc.

I've been moved around talking about the same shit and not getting any answers and it's starting to annoy me.

He asked why I sent there and if I went there for a diagnosis. I didn't really awnser.

I don't know why I went. I feel sick. I'm self aware enough to know something isn't right. I don't feel myself anymore. I know there's something wrong.

But it's it normal for this to happen? To be moved around a lot?

I've told him that I've been told by people that they think I'm schizophrenic, bipolar, depressed, etc literally everything at this point. I told him I haven't self diagnosed and I don't do drugs which he kept asking for some reason.

I was simply saying that's what done have asked if I am. Now I just want a fucking name to whatever is happening to me. I feel like it's been getting a lot worse since I opened up about it.

1383,theoddman92,1547710985,1,"So, my gf and I have been having a lot of issues for awhile. 

She feels that I talk to her like she’s stupid, don’t appreciate her, and that there is no spark. She wants to do couples counseling. I haven’t heard many good things about it and have heard that it ends more relationships than it saves.

I feel stressed out All. The. Time. Feel like I cannot have a serious conversation with her without her taking what I’m trying to say the wrong way. Feel like I’m always chasing something that is just barely out of reach.

I’ve been working 50-60, sometimes 70 hour weeks pretty consistently ever sense we moved out to pay the bills. This has led to a silent resentment towards her because she has basically stayed at home most of the time we’ve been together. She would hold jobs but after 2-3 months something would happen and she would quit, leaving me to be the sole income once again. It doesn’t bother me as much as it used to but it’s still there.

We had a son in June of last year and it feels like everything has turned up to 11. She is over protective over him to the point that it’s like her and him vs the world(including me sometimes, or at least I feel this way.) Take every typically first time parent cliche and then some.. like she barely lets my family hold him when there is more than a couple people around, she won’t let me take him anywhere by myself, yeah.

Today she tells me we have to move because he’s been sick and she thinks it’s black mold under the house even though we have lived here for almost 2 years and had no issues. 

I don’t have $1,500 to get us into a new place despite working 24/7, and missing all the time my son is a baby, sooooo she tells me I should get a title loan on our other car, even though I am barely keeping up on bills now.. then when I said no she said I should sell it and get another car later, effectively pushing the problem back another few months where we will be right back where we are now. No.

Before these options she tells me they’re gonna stay with her mom, and that I should stay with mine so we can save money to get a new place to stay. Her mom hates me because I called her a bad person 5 years ago because honestly, up until a year ago she was.. 

Her mom has a big problem with my family because my mom made one comment a couple years ago when my gf wanted us to move again after we had literally just moved in.. like I spent almost $2000, and my only day off for 2 weeks, moving us in completely by myself becuz she had class, and my mom made a comment about her needing to work a couple hours a week to help me and ever since there has been huge beef. To the point that she will make sneaky comments on facebook that are obviously aimed towards me/them.

I have thought about letting her leave many times. The only thing that keeps me from going through with it is this dream I have of us raising our little boy as a family, waking up with him every day, watching him grow up, going to parks, etc. and the thought of not getting to see him all the time makes me want to die.

I have thoughts all the time, almost to a daily level now about what if I just walked outside and in front of the next car that was coming, or a forklift at work, or even just buying a gun.

Scary thoughts, but calming in a way knowing if I really wanted to it could be done real quick. 

Now to be clear, I would never do it. My dad has always had issues and has been taking lithium as long as I can remember and his brother/my uncle shot himself when I was very young. I’ve seen first hand what that does to children, his daughter is a mess, and I could never do that to my little boy.

I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head for a minute because I am basically alone and just... tired.

I stopped using birth control in June (2018) in an attempt to see if it was causing my depression, and in September I felt like my depression was gone. I completely 100% blamed birth control for my depression. I have been feeling better than I have in the last 7 years. However, when something goes the wrong way (getting into an argument with a family member for example), I have an episode.

I don’t know what kind of episode. I feel embarrassed saying this, but I punch myself in the leg, throw whatever is in my hand, pull my hair, scream, etc. usually while crying at the same time. My heart beats extremely fast and I can’t catch my breath. I don’t know what’s going on with me, and I am so desperate to know what this is and if other people experience it. 

I also want to mention, I can barely remember what happened after. I have no control over my emotions while it is going on. I have control over my actions to an extent, I wouldn’t throw or punch something if I knew it would cause permanent damage.

She tried to equate what I told her to stuff she went through for a portion of time. When i told her I want to talk about me and the stuff I went through for over 15 years of my life she got pissed at me and let me know that a general physician would fix all this as she knows her kid will not need a therapist or psychologist.

I know she is disappointed in me. I can feel or how she talked to me. So much aggressiveness and she would jump on me when I would physically cringe at her talking. She promised not to tell my dad but I don't know. I know they talk about me behind my back. I wonder how it will be when a general physician sees me and realised who I am as they wont help me but they will join in with the making fun of me. I wish I could set up appointments on my own but all the contacting is daunting.

And i'm not sure if i'm this is normal or not. my opinion of these people doesn't shift randomly and doesn't go to extremes like ""Idealizing them"" and then directly switching over to hating them like they're the scum of the earth, and i've been told it's alright to change my opinion of some people after a while of hanging out with them.

I'm not asking for a diagnoses but i just want to know if you guys think this is normal behavior. if it helps : i'm 19, i have panic Disorder and i tend to worry about getting conditions like these, i've had depression a year ago, i'm not self harming/suicidal, my sense of self/identity has been the same for as long as i can remember and i've had the same goals and values for years, i have plenty of stable relationships that have been going on for a while and my opinion of the said people stopped ""changing"" after i spent some time with them, in fact, it would only get better after i hang out with them more.

Problem: My younger sister denies to acknowledge my mental health issues and seems to blame me for them (Diagnosed Depression and Anxiety, Highly suspected Autism*). 

Just tonight, she told me that I've been ""depressed, sad, angry, etc"" my whole life and I blame everything on that (as in, she seems to believe that I don't take responsibility for anything, I think?) She said, and I'm paraphrasing, ""You turned 26 and suddenly you have Autism"" in a very condescending and critical way.

1398,Langer2,1547702374,1,"so this is my first ever proper post on reddit, it's currently 0450 GMT. I haven't slept well for over a month and a half now.

i've gone through a lot of bad shit in my life, a lot of bullying, my dad left me when i was a child but i didn't know so I thought my stepdad was my actual dad, which they only told me when i was 7, i didn't understand why and got angry at everyone for keeping this from me and why my biological dad left. about a year after that my step-dad left me and my four siblings so it was just my mum and us kids for a few years, we struggled a lot.

I remember feeling starved a lot, constantly checking the cupboards for food but finding nothing, with my mum not noticing my decline in mental health because she had four other kids to take care of. I was so angry at the world, two father figures left me, for reasons no one told me, the kids at school saw me as a freak and so i got bullied, everyday, all day, without remorse because hey, when do nine and ten year old kids know when to stop.

I had a lot of resentment and anger issues and acted out a lot, swore so much that i'd be disgusted at it today. at one point my step-dad came back, asking to see his kids and he only meant his biological children - my three youngest siblings. this made me feel so unwanted, especially seeing them come back with privileges every week, like fast food and new toys and stuff that i couldn't have, why? because i wasn't wanted, again. three times i'd been left by a father figure. by the time i finished primary school (11 years old) i had no friends, no father figure, emotional resentment and hatred towards the world and my mother was falling apart too. 

secondary school was a mess, bullied everyday by the same kids for four years straight, again i was the freak, poor, dirty kid who was ostracised because his family didn't have enough money for the latest trends and he didn't understand how to get along with people because he had no one there to teach him. again, my siblings had all the privileges and nice treatment whilst i had to stand there and watch.

i fucked my GCSEs by getting kicked out of schools, i got 4 gcses out of a possible 8. my options for my future were limited. just before my gcses though, my biological dad came back, i was so confused and didn't know what to do. I didn't know what he looked like, sounded like, acted like or was like at all for my whole life! 15 whole years this man didn't want to be in my life and poof, he appears out of nowhere. craving some sort of father figure i got attached quickly, and sometimes he'd say stuff about my council house background that would hurt but i'd bite my tongue, especially since he came from the same place. 

my dad was in the army and i had a somewhat interest in them, so along with my failed gcses, i decided to join up. it took a while but i finally got in, everyone else i knew went into sixth form or college or whatever, i was the only one in the army. that made me feel alone, no one knew what i was going through, how i was feeling. i learned to have a thick skin whilst there and not to take people's shit. i was so used to just being abused and at the end of everyone's jokes. i'm not a big lad, i'm 6""2, 135 pounds and never had a fight before, despite my efforts in secondary school. sometimes i would fit in and sometimes i felt like no one whilst there, so i decided to leave, this brings us to december 2018. 

the consequences of me leaving were no job, which means no pay, going back to no routine, going back to a friendship group that knows i was struggling but still doesn't hold back on their ""jokes"".

this saturday just gone i stayed in whetherspoons (popular local pub) for five hours to drink with them, at the risk of me getting IDd (i'm 17) and i got absolutely smashed, and hateful, angry, sad, depressed and i didn't have the will to hold it back this time, like i could in front of my family and friends normally.

i got home at two in the morning, carried on drinking and wrote a jargon suicide letter, stating that i am sorry for being a burden on everyone and i hope life is better without me, i posted the paper under my mum's door, went downstairs and grabbed the biggest kitchen knife i could. poking into into my chest and pleading with myself to just push! push! push! if i just pushed then i wouldn't feel anything anymore and i'd be okay! but i didn't. i couldn't. i hate myself for not following through, and don't think it's long before i'll try again.

1401,FattyMayonaise,1547699572,1,"For those who have had to face this tough decision, what was your outcome or what would you recommend? 

Some background: Im fairly new to the workforce (first job out of college w no prior experience) so I’ve been struggling with the anxiety of not knowing if whatever task I’m doing is correct, and depressed because It feels like everyone else just ‘gets it’ and i don’t (i have ADHD if that provides context). I’m also constantly on edge from all the mistakes I’ve made at work and just feeling like I’m going to get called out for another mistake any second. 

I was put on a performance improvement plan (PIP) and while I thought I was improving, my managers said ‘my growth is not enough’ so that doesn’t sound like good news. My PIP will be over by the end of the month and again, it isn’t looking too well. Getting a PIP is like walking on eggshells because I feel like they are designed to make you do worse due to all the stress and anxiety you undergo. This just causes me to make more mistakes in the longrun. 

Should I resign while I’m somewhat ahead of it? I know those who say to ‘wait and get fired’ advise this for unemployment money purposes, but money aside, would that truly be worth it? The thought of getting fired would probably put me in a deeper depression because not only did I feel like a POS during work, but now i feel even more worthless with being fired. It just doesn’t sound like the viable choice for my mental health. So I guess the choice comes down to ‘feeling some sort of sanity from leaving on your own terms vs feeling like absolute shit but with a bit more money in your pocket’

How did you guys (who have a similar experience) handle this?

For the past 2 weeks, I've been having semi-stressful dreams that are so hyper realistic I can't tell the difference until about an hour after I've woken up, or unless the dream causes me to go into a panic and I realize that way through some kind of investigation. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe anxiety, slight agoraphobia, BPD, as well as several other things that I was diagnosed with when I was 17. I am 20 now, almost 21. I have not been on meds and have not been able to afford therapy for over 2 years.

Just a few moments ago I woke up from one where I was ""woken up"" by a call fdom my sister in hysterics saying my father had been in an accident, I then actually woke myself up by saying ""what?!"" And getting dressed out of bed only to realize my phone wasn't even in my hand. But I couldn't tell any difference. Nothing was out of place and it didn't feel like a dream of any sort. This sent me into a mear panic attack and I called my mom just to make sure everyone was okay. 

My other dreams have been more anxiety based, such as missing my job interview and getting a ride up there, chatting with my roomate and just walking around our apartment, going to my first day on the job nefore my first day even started, talking with coworkers, being a cashier, ect. Mundane things, but its getting to a point now Im not understanding whats been a dream and what isn't. Sometimes its nightmare esque, sometime I'm just having general anxiety and other times its just me living my life as normal with no way to see a difference. I can see myself in mirrors, I can read in the dreams, and theres no way for me to get out of them.

I'll keep talking about something that happened only for my finace or roomate to look at me funny and ask me what I'm talking about, trying to bring back up conversations that happened in my dreams but not reality. Its getting to the point I feel crazy and like I'm being lied to, or that my dreams are bleeding over so badly I cant see the lines anymore. I really want to know whats going on, is this normal??

1407,sTaTiiCz2,1547693789,1,"I’ve been diagnosed with both ADHD and depression.  I was diagnosed with depression about 6 months ago.  I tried antidepressants and they didn’t work.  I tried two therapists and they didn’t help.  I was diagnosed with ADHD about 3 months ago.  tried stimulants and they somewhat work; I’ll feel really happy, oddly (maybe overly) talkative, and energetic (maybe overly) for a few hours, but then crash during different periods and feel the worst I’ve ever felt in my life.  I can’t take these stupid medications anymore so I’m planning on quitting them, even if my grades suffer as a result of not taking the stimulants, I can’t feel those lows any longer.

All I want in my life is to be happy.  I don’t think I’ve ever been truly happy for an extended period of time for my entire life (this assumption is purely off of memory so it is possibly inaccurate).  My parents said I was a happy child and rarely cried so it’s kind of funny how I’ve been depressed for 2+ years (and that’s just the time I knew what depression was, so I could have had it for way longer).  Happiness is subjective, so I understand why many people cannot give quality advice to others on the subject.  That’s why I’m asking you guys because you’re likely to actually understand how I feel.  Most people just say, “You have to find what makes you happy.”  My response to that is I don’t want to rely on finding a “passion,” a pretty and sweet wife, etc. in order to become happy.  I just want to be genuinely happy with life in general.  I’m not expecting to be happy all the time, as that is impossible,  but I want to be happy more than I am depressed at the very least.  I know that genetics play a role in one’s happiness levels (happiness levels sounds really weird but that’s the best I could come up with 😂), but even if my genetics don’t favor happiness, I don’t want to give up and just be miserable my whole life and/or kill myself.
Disclaimer for the anxious people/over thinkers out there: There is no chance of me committing suicide at this point in my life.

I don’t think I’m like other people and I know that sounds selfish, and if I posted this on almost any other subreddit (with a few exceptions), I would be bombarded with hate comments (I might even get a few here but I understand 😂).  If you guys do think I truly am selfish or egotistical in saying that, I’d be glad to talk about it.

This world is full of jerks and it saddens me.  I want to help people while I’m on this earth, but why would I help jerks?  And there are some truly good people out there, and that’s who I want to help.  I’ve always gotten my feelings hurt easily and when I’m treated with hatred, I can’t stop thinking about why people could be so mean.  I’ve obviously been rude at times just like all people, but I try to be as kind as I can be.  I saw an article discussing research done that proved almost all people believe they are morally superior to their peers, so that’s kind of ironic looking back at my previous statement (delete laughing emoji here because they’re getting repetitive).  And just so you guys know, I’m not that person that laughs at his own jokes.

This paragraph is going to be controversial but here we go.  I can’t stand people that are fake.  For example, I used to be friends with this girl (I stay away from her to the best of my ability now) and 90% of her words were related to either gossip or complaining about small things.  She constantly talked bad about people (still does), and still hangs out with them a lot, pretends they’re friends, and they all have complaining sessions.  I know I’m technically complaining throughout this whole post, but my problem isn’t complaining.  It’s complaining about the most unimportant things.

This paragraph may also be controversial and is related to me feeling different.  The quote, “Ignorance is bliss” is what I’m discussing here.  Most people don’t think about the meaning of life multiple times a day.  Most people don’t consider the invalid proof of a supreme being/beings existing (being flexible with terminology to cover most religions).  Most people at 17 don’t fear looking back on their life at 50 and realizing they wasted.  I think about all of these all the time and many more, and I bet most of you do too.  Disclaimer: I’m sorry to any religious people who read this paragraph as you are completely entitled to your own beliefs.

Throughout my life, there have been times where I’ll get utterly obsessed with one hobby and can’t stop thinking about it and I build my whole life around the addiction.  All of a sudden I’ll just put it down and move on to something else.  Sadly, video games were a problem for a long time, even before my depression.  They’re starting to become a problem now too.  I’ll feel great in the moment but after taking a break from the addiction, I feel deep regret.  Maybe I think I’m wasting my time, I don’t know.

As of now I either want to be a psychiatrist or a music artist (I know, they’re quite different).  I have a new idea of my future “career” every two minutes so we will see how long those two “career” ideas last.  I’m interested in psychiatry because I want to help people who are going through what I’ve experienced.  And with the other career, I just love music and love the idea of making my own music.  I might have a heart attack performing live though.







1.  I’d prefer if you guys kind of respond to each of my paragraphs but you don’t have to.

2.  I know I said I get my feelings hurt easily but if you have any constructive criticism, please give it.  I need some critiquing because no one can improve without accepting criticism and using that criticism to make their lives better.

3.  If any of you want to dm me I’d love to talk personally to each and every one of you.

But I dont know, some days I'm barely able to function and some days I feel great, so it's confusing as to whether I need to go to the doctors or whether or not I should be making a post on here right now, because I go from fine to need help immediately within a day.

It just feels like I don't realize what I'm doing wrong, even if I'm looking directly at it, and it seems like things that I should be thinking of never even cross my mind.

1410,AlliGraz,1547691457,1,"Dear Doctors, 

I get it. I'm 20. I'm in college. You don't trust me.

I'm also the daughter of a pharmacist. I was raised in a pharmacy. I wanna work in pharmaceuticals one day.

So, when I tell you I know the dangers of benzodiazepines, *believe me.* I've seen what narcotics and controlled substances due to people. I interacted with them on a daily basis, I've seen the addiction and desperation. 

And when I tell you I don't want to have to take them, *believe me.* I dislike medication as much as the next guy. But Zoloft made me fat and anxious, Lexapro keeps me from killing myself, but when I'm not in a near comatose state from it - I'm having anxiety.

Three to five panic attacks a day to be specific. I've had a hell of a year. I just need to get back on my feet. 

Again, I'm educated in this, I know what I'm talking about and I know what I'm doing. But when I keep my boyfriend up all night because I'm having anxiety attacks *in my sleep*, I need a little help because that's out of my control.

I know you won't believe me when I say I never sleep alone, I spend every night with my boyfriend or my best friend, and they'll monitor my usage. I know saying I don't have an addictive personality and I'm not going to sell them is not enough.

But I am *so* close to getting my degree, if this anxiety does not get to me first.

I just want to stop being a burden on my friends. I want to be able to sleep at night. I want to go to class and therapy and not be forced to skip because I'm shaking so bad I can not stand.

I'm going to therapy on a weekly basis. I'm 2 for 3 on SSRI's, they're not working.  I've tried exercise, and yoga, I do not smoke or do drugs, I rarely drink.

But, I have panic disorder. I've had it since I was **six years old**. I started showing signs of anxiety at 5. How many six-year-olds do you know out there who get anxiety attacks? I was literally born this way. We've been trying treatment for 7 years. And for five of those, I was able to control it pretty well. But I've strayed from the path, and this time therapy is not enough. 

I have done all I can do, but I'm at my wit's end. I do not want to head down this path but I don't know where else to go.  I need to get a grip on myself so I can get back on this path and be off *all* medications and be my old self again.

So either you find a way to make my anxiety manageable overnight, or you create a non-addictive pill that actually works, or you start treating me as a patient in desperate need of some help - and not some kid looking for drugs.

Give me one solid treatment that I haven't tried and doesn't involve benzo's and I'll gladly take it. Again, I don't **want** to be on them just as much as you don't want me to. But, I've tried everything I know.

Just hear me out, please. I'm not just some kid. I'm a human being who is struggling to live a quality of life and frankly, I do not want to keep living if I'm living like this. 

Sincerely,

A patient who needs you to put their ageism aside and help.",mentalhealth,"You have no problem handing out narcotics, but won't give an anxious kid one prescription of Xanax?",2019-01-17 13:17:37

Fast forward to a year ago, I got extreme depression, I watched my cousin die in a car accident, I had bulimia, I lost 20 pounds, I couldn't get out of bed. I looked for a different way to kill my self every single day. I tried to kill myself, failed and never told anyone. 

Fast forward to the present, I feel nothing anymore, I hadn't felt joy for years but now I don't even fell sadness. I feel nothing. I feel like a 2d charecter in a video game, being controlled by somone else. Aimlessly wandering. I'm on anti deppresents, but they just make me tired and numb.

I have hallucinations and have been in the ward against my will before since I straight up told my doctors that I was a danger to myself. I have severe depression, severe OCD, and a dissociative disorder as well, which possibly get me put into the hospital, I guess.

My mom is angry at me and keeps threatening to call the cops on me and have me put into a mental hospital/treatment center for months even though she has no proof that I'm actively suicidal, which I make jokes about but wouldn't do because I have loved ones that I couldn't do that to. The only way I'm a danger to myself right now is because my OCD keeps me from eating foods that are ""contaminated""...which isn't an issue if I buy packaged things from a clean store and I'm not underweight right now or anything. 

I've been more depressed and haven't been leaving my room lately and I had a few small visual hallucinations, but that's because I'm a little more stressed out with her around and why would I leave my room much if she's just going to yell at me when I leave it? Every time I am away from her I do far better, so I just want to be allowed to live somewhere else (I can't afford it because I can't get a job).

&amp;#x200B;

If I haven't told my doctors of any actively suicidal thoughts and am not a danger to others right now and appear pretty calm and collected overall to them, and my mom has no proof of any of these, can I still be deemed incompetent and be put into a hospital if my mom claims I need to be or tells someone I'm threatening suicide?

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to go because every time I've gone to those, they don't help at all, they do those weak generalized treatments that can't do anything for me and having so many mentally ill people around me there makes me far worse and its crazy expensive, which I can't afford. There might be better centers that are more specialized, but those are even more expensive. I don't have much money and don't want to be in debt over something like that and won't get a good job any time soon to pay it off and if anyone else would be forced to pay for it, I would die of guilt.

1419,Doggo47,1547686358,1,"Good day. (19 year old male)

I'm *J*, and I'm writing in behalf of my girlfriend, who is unfortunately too afraid and doubtful to ask herself. 

Simply put, my girlfriend, *S*, has been suffering from a very hard and challenging depression for a long time. She hasn't been to any treatments and she has very little faith in the medical staff in general. 

The reason she's depressed is because of her body. She feels that she's trapped inside herself, she feels its surreal how much ""worse"" her female body is compared to any mans body. She basically hates, not dislikes, hates almost everything that comes with being a woman. 

Out of all these things, she has a few things she absolutely despises. 

Her larger hips compared to men trouble her very often, her inability to grow muscles as quickly as men do, she hates the fact that she can't run properly without putting on a sports bra. She often compares her own body to male bodies, and it makes her feel absolutely awful. 

Another thing she hates is the fact that ""she's made for reproduction"". 

She's convinced that the only thing she's capable of is giving birth. She absolutely despises the thought of reproduction and we've both agreed it's never going to happen with her. She even sometimes says hurtful things about people who choose to have children, but it's not her fault.

She hates everything that comes with her female parts, out of these things the worst things are period, discharge and other bodily fluids, and she's having a very hard time dealing with all of this. 

She's made it very clear she wants nothing to do with any of these things and she has collapsed and cried about this many times for hours on end. 

She feels upset about the fact that every time we try and find some closure about all of this on the internet, people tend to brush her off and tell her to love her body, which she simply cannot do, at least for now.

She feels the only solution to her problems would be the removal of her uterus, but we've found out not many doctors are willing or allowed to perform the surgery, even if the situation is very bad. 

She also feels that taking testosterone would help her with her other physical issues such as muscle gain and fat storage.

She feels that due to her age, 18, she won't be taken seriously by the medical staff, and that her issues will be brushed aside and her requests denied. She is very convinced there are no solutions to her problems. She has a very low self esteem and she holds a low self image. 

The mental impact this all combined has on her is very worrying and at times she feels very helpless and lost. Although I'm there to support her in any and all decision, I feel it's high time for medical staff to step in. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our questions to you are:

I've told her its possible to talk to a doctor by using for example paper to write on. This has given her some hope but she's still very doubtful about it. 

If possible, could you confirm this for her?

What's a good way to approach the situation as a whole?

What options does she have if we can't find/afford a surgery on her uterus?

Where should we look for help in her case? (she lives in Spain)

What effects and how strong would the effects of testosterone be on her? 

Where to go about getting testosterone, and is it a good idea?

***(she lives in Granada, Spain.)***

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I should mention, she's a very closed off person, even before depression, she's always had a hard time talking about negative things, especially things that concern her or upset her. She comes from a very cultural family that has a strong opinion on sexuality and how females should be. Due to all of this, she simply cannot find support through her family.

The last thing I want is for her to suffer any longer, and I'm willing to do anything in my power to help her for as long as it takes, so if we can find closure and advice here, we will be very grateful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read through our problem, I know it's a long and frustrating one. Any and all advice we receive is highly appreciated.

Tl:dr: Friend ran away from home and only told me. I told her family after lying to them and they threatened me with a lot of things, I now have uncontrollable anxiety over things that only relate to them. Want to know what I can do about it that doesn’t involve a therapist. 

Back in July (2018) One of my really close friends (19f) messaged me()  and said she was running away from home. Which I was expecting, because where she was living was in an insanely toxic environment. She told me she was leaving the following morning, and told me not to tell her little sister ( at the time,  now). Which I was confused on because the previous times she talked about running, she said she’d take her little sister with her. 

But she was waiting until little sister turned 18 so she couldn’t get charged with anything. But something happened and she just decided to leave by herself. And me, being also really close friends with the little sister, felt a little trapped. But I kept my promise. So the following morning, I know she’s gone. Everything is fine, and a few hours later the little sister messages me asking if I know where her big sister was.. And I panicked. I just said no and pretended to ask people around if they knew where she went. 

That’s when the initial anxiety set in. Please, before the keyboard warriors come at me, yes I know I should have been straight up and told her. But for my own selfish reasons I felt like I needed to keep the promise and pretend like I didn't know anything, at least until I knew my friend was out of state. 

So a day goes by, I have the little sister talking to me, worried and what not. And I never went to bed, didn’t eat. That cold anxiety feeling in my chest never went away. So I downloaded an app that gives you a free number that you can text real phones on, and texted the little sister anonymously and said ‘Big sister is on a bus going to this state, she is safe and fine” and then deleted the number and app when I knew she got the text. Which I quickly learned was terrible on my end, i kinda made it sound like she got kidnapped or whatever. 

Day three, anxiety still there. I have a full blown panic attack and call the little sister, telling her it was me who sent the text and that I knew everything. Because I was the only person that my friend told. Thus, ending a three year friendship. I talked to her dad on the phone, which he yelled at me and all that. Just like any other dad would. I gave them the passwords to her snap. 

Day four, and I didn’t hear from anyone. Day five, her dad suddenly thinks that she is at my house, even after explained that she was on a greyhound and all that. (I used to live in the same town with this friend but moved out of state a year ago.) So he’s screaming at me, calling me all these names, asking me where my address is. He told me what I did with the anonymous text was illegal. It’s not illegal, but at the time I was anxiety ridden and believed just about anything. 

Then he demanded my address. So I hung up the phone. He texted me, ‘give me your fing address.’ little sister texted me, asking me the same thing. Both of her dads girlfriend blew up my phone. So I finally had enough and got my parents involved. And that’s when I realized it wasnt illegal, and that’s the last time I had ever talked to that side of my friends family again. 

There is so much more things that were said. If i typed everything out, this post would be way, way too long. There were a lot of threats and hateful things that her dad just nailed into my brain. I had a week long anxiety attack and I only really had myself to blame. I didn’t hear from my friend until a month later where she got a new phone and everything. She didn’t understand why I was so upset.. So I just kind of stopped talking to her about it. 

Everytime I hear her little sisters name (its a common one) I instantly get a wave of anxiety that doesn’t stop. Everytime I see my friends name pop up on my phone, I get anxiety. Everytime I hear or think about her dads name I get a full blown anxiety attack. Every time someone yells are starts fighting around me, I get an anxiety attack. Whenever I see a car drive slower than usual past my house, I start thinking “Well, her dad finally found my address!” 

I don’t really know if this is some sort of ptsd, or if those events made me develop some sort of anxiety disorder. I don’t have health insurance, and I definitely dont have enough money to pay for a therapist out of pocket. Is there something I can do for myself to try and forget that this happened and moved on? Because I’m tired of being afraid.

I thought this sub might be better than r/relationshipsadvice. But it is a bit of both. 

My (33f ) boyfriend (30m) and I have been together for a little over two years. 
Back in May he called me at work saying he thought he was having a heart attack. I took him to the hospital (he didn’t want to take an ambulance/cab or get one of his coworkers to drive him) turns out he had a really bad panic attack.  Over the next couple of months he had more panic attacks but not as bad. At least from what he has told me.
Starting in the summer he started to be not as open with me. He normally isn’t super open to talking about feelings etc because of how he was raised but usually if I would ask him something he would answer.  He literally admitted to me last week that he had been crying on his lunch breaks sometimes because he hated his job and was getting made fun of by coworkers. 
In August he finally admitted he might be depressed and talked about trying to go to the doctor to get medications He initially couldn’t go because we live in Canada and he is Irish and didn’t have coverage.  He finally went in November but he said the doctor ran out of time for him to talk about it. 
At the end of December he returned to Ireland to visit his family. During a checkup his doctor told him he is depressed and really bad. My bf won’t tell me what he was prescribed but he was told to take 50mg of an antidepressant every day. He’s been on it for about a week and a half. Unfortunately he is not going to counselling. I am not sure if the doctor recommended it but he says 20 minutes is too far to drive to see a counsellor and he can’t afford it. (Even though many places near him do sliding scales — some are only 5 euros an hour)

The reason I am here is because he is becoming more of a giant jerk. Yesterday he told me I stress him out because all he can think about is past arguments we’ve had (one is from when we first started dating) and that he blames me for the way he is. I know him being a jerk, blaming me and pushing me away is part of depression. My question is - do most antidepressants really take 6 weeks to kick in? And if/when it does - will he realize he’s been a giant jerk or will he just feel better but forget? I’m worried without counselling he will not realize how he’s been acting and the role depression has played on it. 

Thanks for your advice!

I believe I suffer from a few symptoms and I fear I might be tilting toward the things mentioned in the title of this post.

School stresses me out so much (not academically but I don't like my classmates and other students), my flatmate is incredibly loud and disturbing, and I don't even enjoy time with my ""friends"".

I have had around 10 planned suicides, and got really close (seconds away) from acting on 3. I have also be struggling with self harm (12 current cuts on my arm).

I have the belief that I might act out one day and cause an issue, like I can't trust myself and that I could snap at any moment and might hurt other people. I have been struggling in school with grades and paying attention. I can get great grades in some classes (high 90s), while just barely pass in others.

As for the music, It goes on non-stop until I can get my full focus on something else, and I can get it to end when i listen to actual music.

There have been several diagnosis thrown around as neither my wife nor I live in the same state as her so we truly cannot say 100% but bipolar depression was mentioned as was paranoid schizophrenia, I wouldn’t hold water to either of these diagnosis but her behavior has been worrisome. 

About April of 2018 she began obsessing over leaving her hometown and on a whim taking a solo trip up the coast of California to the Pacific Northwest. She was unmoved in her determination. My wife speaks with her mother most days after work and after dinner. She had been able to sway her away from leaving for the time being but as weeks went on her obsession grew and grew. She “needed to do this”. 

It began every Friday, she would begin packing her car and then by Saturday my wife would talk her out of leaving. Her son lives there, her daughter in law, and she lived there with her partner/my father-in-law. My father in law endured much of the brunt of her anger and frustration, often being ridiculed endlessly from Thursday through Sunday...then Monday everything seemed fine. She was removed a little emotionally but she was a still very much herself. 

My wife began expressing fears that perhaps this medication wasn’t the right fit for her, she had become angry and removed and her will to move up north had continued to grow. When this was addressed she lashed out “the meds opened my eyes”. Well these cycles continued and before long September/October came and without a warning my wife received a text from her father stating “she packed her car and is leaving” 

There was no getting a hold of her as she had turned her phone off. 

She now is staying in and out of hotels, acting irrationally (lashing out, lying), and losing weight. She hasn’t been eating and sleeping right. She refuses to see a doctor. Obviously we are all out of our minds stressed out, hoping wishing and praying for her to be safe. I just don’t know what there is that we can do. She is not accepting communication anymore and hasn’t reached out to us outside of text in about a week. My wife is seeking someone to talk to as she has been worn thin.

What is it about modern society that causes us to continue to move farther from the ""tribe"" even though so many are unhappy and depressed? Bartlett stated on the podcast that when asked most people now day they have ZERO people they can rely on in a crisis.

So bassically I'm not one to talk about anything, but I feel the need to find answers. I'm concerned in the way I act, firstly a couple years ago me and my brother was fighting as brother do, but I got too annoyed and jumped on him and put a pillow over his face and pressed down real hard, he was laughing at first but when it went past the 20 second mark he began to cry. I told myself to stop but I argued with myself not to, just had a big urge to carry on, but it's my brother and it only when he started to panic and struggle whist crying I stopped. I felt horrible after felt like crying disgusted in myself. 

That's not the only thing, across the years I did things that I didn't want to do, but I did cause of a weird urge. Like I got annoyed the other day with my brother again and I bent his ID card for his work, I didn't want to but I just grit my teeth and did it knowing it would upset him, then I felt really bad after and it angered me so that ""urge"" just to do something came again so o grabbed a bottle and smashed it against my forehead like 7 time really hard, it made me abit giddy tbh, then I just went into a angry mood to started breathing heavy.

 Another major thing I done that I don't really want to share but I need the help, I was playing with my dog, 1 of 4, the youngest being his only 4 months old. Bassicaly I was playing then he nipped me and I held his mouth shut, now in this is bad and I'm by no means an animal abuser it makes me feel sick and it angers me if I see a video online of a animal getting hurt but that ""urge"" came again. So I held it tight but not too tight, I was telling my self to let go, like shouting but in my head, but I refused, and then I held it untill he struggled and started crying and scratching to the point he made my hands bleed, so obviously I let go, I started to stroke him and hug him saying I'm sorry and I felt horrible and yet again disgusted in myself and nearly cried.

I dont understand it tbh, like I'm telling myself not to post this cause there might be someone worried that I'm gonna become a murder or so.thing nd try send me to the Looney bin 😅 but I need to post this for some help, I dunno what it is, i can vaguely explain in a scenario, like let's say if my brother got a ice cream that he'd been exited about getting all day, and he had it in his hand and was dead chuffed and happy, if just smack it out his hand knowing it'll upset him and I hate seeing my brother upset, like it really upsets me and pissed me off. I don't know hopefully someone cam give me some info or someone can tell me they've heard of a similar thing from someone else or whatever. I've done a post similar to this about how I see life, and people said it's ADHD but I only can justify that by the fact I can't concentrate for 2 seconds, for example I'll be on my driving lesson sitting there while the instructor explains and I'll hear his first sentence then the next thing I hear is ""so do you understand"" and I'm like yeahh but I dunno what he just said but that's off topic.

1441,plzsendhelpthx,1547673011,1,"Hello all.  I will try to keep it short.

I'm M/27.  I live in my hometown where my parents and siblings still live, but we're not close.  All my friends have left in one way or another.  I have no support aside from my parents and the counselor I'm seeing.  Thank you in advance for reading this.

3 years ago I was diagnosed with dysthymia and general anxiety disorder.  My depression is manageable but the anxiety has taken control.

2 years ago my girlfriend left me in a pretty brutal breakup.  I should have tried to recover gracefully but I let myself fall pretty hard and haven't even begun to bounce back.

1 year ago my best friend hung himself in his parents' garage with a dog leash when he was drunk.

Throughout all of this I have tried to be optimistic, or at the very least I've tried to understand what failing to cope would mean for me in the long run.  Well, I haven't been able to cope, and my mental health issues have only grown exponentially.  Suicide is very much a daily thought, though I have never attempted anything.  It doesn't seem like an option after seeing the devastation my friend's suicide caused.  Admittedly, suicide not being an option makes me feel trapped.

My job performance has suffered more than anything else, and is definitely the biggest source of anxiety in my life right now.  I've tried for a couple years now but I simply cannot address my mental issues with such a demanding job on my plate (60 hour weeks loaded with meetings and big deadlines).

My boss has been insanely patient with me and has always had hope that I'd overcome all of this, but I think it's time I made the ethical choice and leave for his sake and the sake of my co-workers.

My biggest problem is that leaving will mean that others have to absorb my projects, all of which are half-finished and will require months of work to complete.  No overtime or bonuses for those who have to pick up my slack - just more work on their plate, and more stress in their lives, due purely to me.

I need advice as to how I can leave.  I can't stay here for another year.  I already spend most of my time at work devouring my nails and feeling sick over how far behind I'm falling.  I don't want to abandon my co-workers and give them all my work, but each day I stay is just one more day I'm putting off the inevitable.

Any advice would help.  Words of encouragement, harsh words to teach me a lesson, similar stories and results, anything.  I just need some direction and some amount of reassurance, if possible.

If nothing else, thank you for allowing me this small post to vent.  I love my parents but they are my parents and will never be straight with me if it means hurting me.  And my counselor is only available when I'm paying him.  So, if anyone read this, at least I've managed to ""talk"" to someone before things got even worse.

Good luck to you all.

Maybe 10 years ago he started showing signs of mental illness. The most notable signs of this are:
* Impaired thinking. He often has trouble telling fact from fiction, picks up a lot of sovereign citizens stuff online, has these ideas in his head about fictitious entitles, government jurisdiction not applying to him, etc.

* Legal altercations. He has been arrested several times because he freaks out in interactions with police and they don't know what to do with him. He lectures them on the law, tells them they don't have authority over him, etc. He has never been violent, it's just personality stuff.
* He is not independently functional: cannot really hold down a job because of the above.
* He has never had any auditory or visual hallucinations.

He has had inpatient psychiatric treatment and is on medication regularly, and when he's properly medicated, he comes across as almost completely normal, other than sometimes some of the sovereign citizens stuff slipping in or him believing some wacky theory about something.

Unfortunately, his mother died a few weeks ago. She left a healthy inheritance, life insurance, etc. to her sister in trust of him so he can be provided for. However, he is deteriorating a bit again and making life very difficult for everyone involved. For example, he:

* refused to sign a legal document provided by his mother's attorney because he wasn't familiar with some of the statutes it referenced;
* believes he is being deceived because he wasn't given an original copy of the will (which is because it had to be filed at the court);
* made a huge deal out of his name being printed in ALL CAPS on the will, thinking that it may invalidate it;
* made a huge deal out of the fact that the attorney signed a slight variation of his name (think Mike vs. Michael),
* now distrusts his step-father because after spending a long time explaining a document while a notary waited patiently, told him ""you just need to sign it."" (He feels now that he signed it under duress, so he asked the attorney to hold off on filing it.)

I am close with the family and my friend trusts me and knows I'm an attorney, so I want to try and help. However, I don't know what I can say to him or what types of arguments tend to be successful with someone who is relatively lucid but experiencing this level of thought disorder.

* Should I just tell him to trust the lawyer and/or his step-father no matter what?
* Ask him what he wants for his future, frame cooperating with these people as the best way to get what he wants?
* Bring legal documents to demonstrate that the principles he thinks he understands are bullshit?

He told his oldest brother that he might have feelings toward men at a young age and my uncle did not respond well to this at all. So he suppressed these feelings for most of his life. He married my mother and had 3 children including myself. He always seemed disconnected from life in general. The relationship with my mother was always strained. She’d also been through hell growing up. Abused in all sense of the word. I could tell something was not right with their relationship at a very young age. They were distant. I’d seen them embrace very few times. I discovered (browser history) of my dad’s interest in other men. This was also at a very young age. It was confusing, but I just pushed it out of my mind. This eventually ended in divorce. He was lying to himself and everyone else for his entire life. This has to have an immense toll on his mental state. He ended up moving out of state and living the life he wanted. He found a partner who introduced him to smoking marijuana after the age of 50. I smoke so it was a good way to relate to him after we’d become distant. Eventually his partner divulged that he was becoming paranoid and accused his partner of being part of a government investigation involving my dad. It caused them to split up and my dad has been telling myself and my siblings about an “agent” who’s been with him for years. He has made plans to move to different locations around the country to accommodate this “agent.” He blamed a car accident on this “investigation.” Saying, “whoever planned this accident must’ve been a gamer. How could this “agent” have maneuvered to only hit my car?” This is just an example of the statements made to myself and my siblings. My family (his siblings) seem to know something is not right with him, but continually ignore and push the issue off. He confides these things in me, and it scares the living shit out of me.

I’ve been supporting her for a number of years, but since she’s gone back to where we live, by herself, for a couple weeks (about 2 hours from where we were visiting family at Christmas), she’s taken a massive turn for the worse. She’s told me today that she cannot do anything. In the past she’s struggled with motivation but never to this extent. If I call she answers and won’t speak. She won’t take a sip of the water next to her, she hasn’t eaten in days, she won’t communicate and I think she’s in real danger. How can I help her? The only thing I can think to do is call her an ambulance but I would like to avoid escalating things to that level, tho I have down before and will do again. She’s told me twice that she wants to die over texts, which while not uncommon with the way she’s feeling, combined with everything else, is a massive concern. 

She has no one to look after her or that she can talk to locally and I cannot get back there until Friday, which I will be. What can I do to ensure her safety?

1449,Alexis_deTokeville,1547667293,1,"Before you read this, hear me out. I know that I am being cynical and that most people are just like me. I am not a hateful person, I genuinely have compassion for everybody and want to help people. But there's also this angry, paranoid side of me that has bothered me for a long time, probably because I didn't fit in well as a kid, and that's the side I want to get off my chest here and get some insight as to what I can do to lighten up.

\-

This is not how I act in real life, but this is how I *feel*.

I’m getting to a point where my thoughts and expressions are all logical and serious, where I’m finding myself resentful even of humor. I feel tense, guarded, and melancholy, with a chip on my shoulder. I look at friends having fun or people being relaxed and light and I feel immediately envious and judgmental. I look at people laughing at social media on their smartphone and some primal part of me can't stand it. I hate the innocence, or maybe the naivete of it. The way they seem unphased by life, carefree, happy in their own little bubble, undamaged by trauma, not paranoid about what all these screens are actually doing to us. Not filled with the anxiety and the foreboding sense of hostility that I feel. 

I wish they could see the world how I see it, to show them what life is, to bring them to my level so that they would see that laughing with your friends doesn’t do shit to ease the feeling that life is a harsh motherfucker where everyone and everything is trying to manipulate you, and you gotta be vigilant. Then maybe I wouldn’t feel so alone in it, like this alien creature that doesn’t know how to just lighten up and relax.  I wouldn’t feel like making new friends was this immense chore that involved disguising how I feel and going along with this bullshit vibe of fake  millenial happiness. It's like, don’t you get it? The planet is dying. We’re more disconnected from eachother than ever before. The suicide rate is skyrocketing and people want to talk about mental health but we’re too busy being outraged on twitter or curating our fucking instagram feeds, slathering on this veneer of social perfection so thick that we can no longer access our empathy for the human condition. 

Most of the time I try to stay light around people, but I feel like it comes off as goofy and try-hard. Because it’s not real. It’s me putting on a show. And so it’s this ever-present battle in my mind between just being stoic and logical, and realizing that I’m being too serious, and then trying to lighten the mood, but in the process coming off as incompetent or goofy, and then deciding that it’s better to be respected and taken seriously than to be treated like an idiot. I oscillate between the two constantly. 

It's like this I've absorbed this heaviness into my bones and nothing I can do will shake it off. I feel like the rest of the world has the wool pulled over their eyes and I'm wide awake and staring at *it*, the ugly truth of it all, and if I were to lighten up and relax then I'd get swept up in it too and *consume consume consume* until I'm 65 and retired and I spend my every waking moment watching TV and numbing myself into dementia.   

*-*

I know that my thinking here is very black and white and that I'm skeptical about my own sense of ""rightness"" about my beliefs. I just want to get some insight so I can ease up on my paranoia and resentment and relax enough to enjoy social interactions. Thank you so much.",mentalhealth,"Feeling really serious these days, any advice on how to lighten up?",2019-01-17 06:34:53
1450,Throwaway290908,1547666493,1,"I've been on prozac for about two weeks now. I know it probably hasn't started affecting me ""properly"" yet at all but I thought I'd mention it anyway. I'm not here for any big fixes or anything, I really just need to get this all off my chest, and maybe get some support.

For the past a bit less than a year I've been pretty content with life. Of course I've been dealing and struggling with depression every day for the past I don't even know how many years but I've been winning it. Ever since the holidays though things have started to look down, and even though it's all been mostly fixed afterwards it just seems like I can't stop falling down more and more.

The time before/around the holidays was really stressful for me, I don't have an exactly supportive or warm family and this year it just got to me extra much because of some things that weighed me down even more. I ended up spending the days feeling really lonely. To top this short period of time off I ended up going through a more severe breakdown and had a traumatic attack which left me shaken up for several days afterwards. I've had some rough times with my close relationships recently and we've started to work it all out, things are really turning out to be fine, but I can't shake the feeling like I'm horrible and unbearable and that everyone I try to trust secretly hates me or thinks awful things about me. It's been getting even worse since my partner got exhausted from personal things not related to me and took it out on me by ""losing themselves"" and telling me they were thinking of other people because I wasn't good along with a bunch of other shit that just made me feel so betrayed and hurt. We fixed it and we're relatively good now, we talked it all over, but I just feel so lost. 

I'm starting to get more frustrated and angry about everything, even small things. I can barely eat because of my eating problems, if I try to go to the store to buy something to eat I'll just end up leaving empty handed most of the time, because my brains just tell me it's all inedible to me. Either I borderline starve myself for several days on end or I go on to eat like hell for a few days straight, but there's never any in between. I rarely make proper home made food anymore both because of my eating problems and because I'm simply too depressed to get up the energy for that. I make home made food maybe once every three months right now, and I know it probably shouldn't be that big of a deal as long as I can survive on trash food but I honestly can't take noodles or other cheap food anymore, I've been eating that shit for so long my body is actually beginning to be repulsed by it. Whenever I go out to eat with people or visit someone I'm barely able to eat either, I just end up chewing and chewing for ages and not eating like 90% of whatever I had. My bmi is about 18.

Right now I live with absolutely unbearable people, and I haven't gotten any responses on my apartment seeking applications even though I'm classified as ""extremely urgent"" since I'm 18 and using studying as the reason I'm moving. I live in a super small village and I can't get a job because my mental health is way too messed. I'm shit with money and I end up spending most of the little money I have on impulse purchases and other stuff I really don't need at all, and then I constantly have to spend the later half of every month super carefully so I don't go broke.

I use escapism, sugar and other unhealthy coping mechanisms (like wasting all the little money I get, or self harming sometimes though I haven't had the urges recently) to feel better but of course none of it actually helps. I have several unresolved mental health issues such as the fact that I've had hallucinations for a couple years, I have paranoid and sometimes even straight-up delusional nonsensical thinking (which I try to hide even from close people but which I can't escape from), I get anxious over the littlest tiny triggers that my mind is more often than not just making up out of thin air, like on the level of me getting scared if I somehow perceive that a person sent me a text message that sounded not as excited as before. I have massive self esteem issues and I keep sliding end to end from feeling like I'm absolute trash and deserve no loving at all to thinking everyone else is absolute trash and I'm a queen. I constantly feel like I'm detached from the world, like I'm in my own little world and I'm unable to really focus or think of anything at all at least in the real world. I keep falling side to side from feeling horribly depressed and awful to feeling sunshiny and cheery and the transitions can literally happen in the span of a few minutes sometimes, and it's really rare for me to have a single day when I feel sort of consistent. 

I used to be suicidal for maybe a year and a half but in the past two weeks I feel like I've been shifting more and more into just ""nothing matters"" kind of depression. I no longer want to die or hurt myself, I just don't really feel like there's any reason to bother with anything anymore. I'm starting to get more angry and annoyed about everything because it just seems like none of it matters anymore, and I hate it. I don't know who to trust. I don't know what to do. I'm so confused about everything and it makes me so frustrated.

I feel like I want to isolate myself from everyone, just run away. But I also feel like I really really just want to fix myself, fix my life, I want to get rid of this frustration. I just feel like every time I fix things, I just fall down the stairs further right after. I don't want to lose the grip I have right now, on moving out, education, my relationships with people. I want to get better. I want to win this battle.",mentalhealth,Feeling like I'm slipping. Need something to continue getting better so I don't give up,2019-01-17 06:21:33

1455,SadonaSaturday,1547664189,1,"I’m just reaching out for advice and support as I’m feeling kind of alone right now. 

Some backstory: 
My boyfriend had a rough childhood. His mother was extremely controlling and emotionally abusive. She didn’t let them (4 kids total) attend school or make friends or get jobs. She screamed when she felt slighted or lied to and justified her actions because she is a “psychic medium” and talks to “spirits”. She tried to convince him he could talk to them too when he was a child. His father eventually left the family and that caused him even more trauma being left alone with his mother too depressed to leave bed. All of this and more and he didn’t get out of her house until he was 25 and moved in with me. She tried hard to stop that too. 

Since then he’s gotten a job and we got our own place and we have a really wonderful relationship (almost 9 months). We’re best friends and I try to make sure he knows how much I love and care for him. From time to time he’s mentioned life not feeling very real and/or having a hard time connecting with people at work. We’ve talked about it and then he doesn’t mention it again for awhile. 
With the new year we’ve both been thinking about ways to improve but he suddenly got obsessed with improving himself and finding himself and sent his mind into overdrive. 
I came home from work on Monday and he started talking to me about what he had been thinking about. Rambling about how he belived in God now (like, okay, but what? He’s never really been religious) and then “oh, huh... no, you know what, you just saw me become Buddhist.” (...??) Lots of “hmm”s and “oh”s like he was coming to realizations all of the sudden and he was shaking. All really out of character. I started to get scared because he was obviously not himself. I listen for a while about how the world is built to work on love and that’s how everything makes sense before I tell him that while I’m happy he’s talking to me about his thoughts that he’s not making a lot of sense and that I’m worried. It took him a few minutes to be coherent enough to realize I was scared and how he had been acting strangely and he calmed down some. The rest of the night was us talking and him having break downs about his past. 

This morning I wake up and he wants me to take him to a mental health crisis center because he said he needs his thoughts to be validated. I fully support him seeking help I just don’t know what’s going to happen next or what’s going on at all. I’m sure it’s even more scary being him not knowing.

I was making good money and had a stable job and marriage. Unfortunately, I was fired from that job for sending an unsecured email (I work in Finance and it was taken very seriously). That began my mental health spiral. Due to stress of not being able to find decent work for about 5 months I began being rude to my wife just to make her miserable as some sick pleasure by making life difficult. I became an asshole who thrives on making her upset so much that she hates being around me and ignores me when we are at home together. 

I luckily found a job after 5 months, making double what I made and well into the six figures. I convinced my wife to quit work and stay at home. She agreed and we were beginning to be happy again. I then went through another spout of instability where I thought life was going too well and intentionally got fired, leaving us both jobless and going quickly into debt. 

I quickly updated my resume, and against better judgement, put it on reddit for review in a subreddit dedicated to my profession. I left personal identifying information on there. Someone from the subreddit took my info and began applying to all of the major employers in my area with my resume, except by adding racist and vulgar things on the resume so as to get me essentially blackballed from these employers. Employers have called me to tell me of my resume and how offensive it was and that it can be considered harassment. 

I just keep spinning through these loops of negativity where I seem to intentionally make life hard if it’s going too well and taking it out on family and my wife. It’s like my brain tells me that things are going good and it’s time to mess things up. And it’s not fair especially to my wife that I go through these cycles. I wouldn’t say I’m bipolar (though I don’t know the true definition so it’s possible that’s it) but I know something is wrong.

Short story is that I have a problem with action and PvP strategy games; they make me feel extremely stressed, and I can't calm down even after I've stopped playing them. Here's an example:

I played a game called Town of Salem. It's basically a strategy game where you have to convince others. I played the first round, and I started feeling stressed. Then, I stupidly played 4 more rounds while under stress. That night I couldn't fall asleep, and, in the next evening, I called an ambulance for a wide range of terrifying mental symptoms including high body temperature (or a sense of it), dizziness, and others.

Throwaway account! I’m in my early 30s, have been married for 11 years and have a 3-year-old child. I consider myself a “normal person”, whatever that means. I had a normal childhood, a big family but I didn’t meet my dad till I was in college. 

When I was growing, I used to be religious. My main struggle when I was religious was the fact that I couldn’t “feel” or “believe” what other people were claiming to “feel” and “believe”. I found myself constantly trying to force myself to “feel” but I just couldn’t. 

I had girlfriends when I was growing, I can’t say I was ever “in love”. I am married, and I can’t say I’ve been “in love” with my wife. She doesn’t know it, I act like if I’m in love, but I don’t “feel” like I am. 

I heard many stories about new parents, seeing their child for the first time and it changing their lives. How much people “feel love” for their children. I thought that was going to be my cure. I had a child but didn’t feel anything. He is growing and I care a lot about him. I want him to succeed in life, but I don’t “feel” much for him. I honestly find him a bit boring and many times I want to put him to sleep earlier so I can watch TV without him. The times I’ve been away for a couple days, I don’t miss him.

1469,minustrack,1547657280,1,"I'm currently a senior in high school, and at my school seniors take a semester out of school to work on a big senior project that they present to everyone at the end of the year. Some examples that I've seen are learning to animate, getting a pilot's license, making an e.p., learning an instrument, whatever the student is interested in.

For me, I had a few interests- writing, psychology, and illustration, so I wanted to bring them together for my project.
I decided I wanted to create and self-publish an illustrated book about the experiences and stories of people with mental illnesses.
I'm not going to go into depth right now, but my mom has been diagnosed with multiple illnesses and has been ever since I was very young, and I have recently come to terms with my own mental illnesses. My experiences throughout this long process have brought a lot of things to my attention and also changed the way I thought about the world, my family, and myself.

I could name many times where people who didn't understand the conditions that my mom and I share, and were judgmental based on ignorance- or sometimes they simply just didn't quite understand what we were going through even if they weren't being judgmental. I wished that people would become more aware, not just based on some statistics, a brief definition, or very basic understanding, but on a more personal level.

That's how I came up with the idea to use my project to try and tackle some of these wishes.
I believe that by sharing the thoughts, feelings, and stories of a person with mental illness, it becomes easier for people who don't experience these things to understand on a deeper and more personal level than can be achieved through more statistic-focused advocacy efforts.

Which brings me here.

Although I have a handful of interviews from other sources, I was wondering if anyone would be willing to volunteer to submit a written interview that might make an anonymous appearance within the book. If so, I'll gladly post the questions for people to respond to! The way the interview would be formatted within the book would be using snippets of conversation and stories taken from the interviews followed by a visual that accompanies a snippet, similar to the style of Humans of New York / Brandon Stanton, but with artwork instead of photography.

If anyone is interested or has questions, please don't hesitate to let me know.

1473,genericreddaccount,1547655517,1,"So I’ll keep it short. 
I’ve had a therapist I’ve grown to trust for 8 months or so. I’m an adult. 
I have trust issues, commitment, ptsd, anxiety through the roof, whatever. The whole lot of it. 
Lots of loss in my life and face trauma after trauma. (Not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage). 

Anyway. Couple sessions ago we were talking about trying to find a routine and try to ease my way into making more or better friends and having some a healthier social circle. Something to get me going, a meetup group or some type of social engagement since I thrive on using intelligent and wit. I don’t get enough of that during my daily life. 

So my therapist recommends a “men’s retreat” and suggested the name and organization of Justin Sterling. The Justin sterling institute of relationship. 
This apparently could be all mine for the low, low price of 600 bucks. 

After a quick google search, I’m talking like 6 seconds of scrolling, it was evident this guy is a hack and preys on the weak minded. At the minimum. Goodie the name your mouth will be left agape. 
Sketch as can be. Total cult. Got goosebumps reading the (admittedly dated) reports of what has and continues to go on. Even the recent reports corroborate the type of stuff that transpires there. 

Even the FAQ on their OWN website essentially says (paraphrasing obviously)
“ya there’s news were a cult, we’re not. Trust us”. 

You have to put that on your own frequently asked questions page? Sweet Jesus. 

I have nothing to go on but the Internet reviews because his cult doesn’t divulge info on the weekend and you apparently sign your ability to talk about it? It’s absolutely terrifying for someone like me to even consider. This is in no way therapeutic, in my estimation. 


Question is: how in the hell can I trust my therapist even in the slightest after this kind of recommendation? I mean. What the hell is going on here? He knows I use independent thought and am not going to just assimilate for the sake of it. And this stuff seems downright abusive. Why suggest this kind of this to an abuse victim and anxiety issues up the ass. 


I would love any insight as to what the people think.

I'm 21 and I still live at home. I genuinely feel like I can't make a step without my parents' approval. They've always been controlling and strict, so maybe that's why. All my life I've been ordered around, been told what to do and how to do it... and all of the sudden I'm an adult and... they expect me to be ok? I'm supposed to know how to take care of myself? I don't have the skills to do that, because I was never let to do anything on my own!

I don't have a car and I don't have a job either. So I'm basically emotionally and financially dependent on them. It's terrible. I feel trapped, weak, and I don't have any idea how to be independent. 

I feel like a slave, always cleaning and helping with cooking without a single 'thanks' in return while my brother gets away without doing any chores cause he's a boy and he's younger.

I'm not close to any other relatives. And again, I don't have any money. But I can't stand the tension in this house anymore. The expectations. 

I hit a stage in my life where I can no longer fight mental illness on my own, but my mom dismissed me several times when I hinted at the fact that I might need to see a professional for my mental issues. They keep pushing me to get a degree and get a job and get a boyfriend and be ""normal"", but how am I supposed to do that on my own? I have no skills and I have no money. I have no one to turn to but to a couple of parents who aren't willing to listen. To REALLY listen. 

It's embarrassing tbh. I wish I just pull myself out of this ditch but...

I honestly have a really fucked up realationship with my parents. It's unhealthy. Idk what to do.

1497,pautherebel,1547625576,1,"If I gotta complain, it’s by the fact that my mental health deteriorated once I moved into a new city. I moved thinking that my life would start fresh, but in reality, it was just worse than being the only Toronto kid.

I moved to a small city in Ontario called Oakville. I think it’s a joke so I just call it Jokeville at times.

Once I arrive to my new school, I noticed that not many people wanted to be friends with me. My appearance was a little grotesque at the time (because of my crooked teeth), and I had a few problems maturing because I didn’t really want to grow up. And this was 6th grade so I thought still being a kid who wanted to play with teddy bears was fine.

I remember that the first few days I started school, the Spanish kids would call me “ugly”, “weird”, and some form of lingo that would remind me of a troll under a bridge. It didn’t bother me, but I remember I would go home wanting to not go back to school because of those Spanish kids.
I felt really lonely because I didn’t really exactly deserve to be treated like that. I was probably the only kid in the class who thought differently, preferred art than science, and didn’t really stick to pop culture because I wanted to diversify and expand my horizons.
I was basically that kid who preferred listening to synthwave and 80s Rock, than listening to One Direction and Justin Bieber. 
I also was the kid who watched a lot of anime, so I remembered that 7th-8th grade I watched a lot of them while not paying attention to class. Yeah, the “weird” card kept pitching in. I was considered the “weird” kid. 

I made probably around 5 friends that time, but I found out until high school that none of them except for one person, was fine with me. I also had to find out until my junior year (11th grade), that they always excluded me in everything because that would “degrade their reputation”. 


And this was all in 6th-8th grade. What the actual fuck-

If I have to say anything about what was good about elementary school, I think it might have to be the fact that I was in a dance group and it really built my confidence because I was better than those bitches who let me down.

High school was even worse for me. If anything, the good thing about it was that I got rid of all of those friends from elementary school. They acted even more fake and toxic than they were in high school, and I mean as in “they only stuck to societal standards to be popular” toxic. 

High school was also a time I noticed where my mental health was getting worse, as in, I became a little bit more of a perfectionist in terms of being good at things that I liked to do. I was an artist, but I also played the saxophone in my school’s concert band. I got constant panic attacks and I had to run to the bathroom every time I got a meltdown.
People there made me feel like a crippled kid because I had these meltdowns.
I’m not going to explain 4 years worth of highschool, but I am going to explain why it wasn’t worth it.
People liked to talk to me, but never really considered being friends with me. If anything, I had a hard time hanging out with people because either they couldn’t hangout, didn’t want to hangout, or had friends that they’d rather spend their time with. 
And I tried talking to some people in my classes but at that point I’d given up because I learned the hard way that I’m just not that kind of person people wanted to hangout with. 
I was also bullied in school, and it was a guy from my concert band rehearsals. I liked him before but I didn’t realize how much of an asshole he was until he picked on me in every class. It was to the point where he really made me feel suicidal because of how he made me feel worthless.

I’ve dated a few guys in highschool, but at this point to pathetically speak, some of them really broke me. 
One of them just really didn’t like me for who I am, and dated me for social status. And another questioned my intelligence because I preferred to take a career path in the arts rather than an “academic” path, such as science or business.

All of that got me depressed. I felt like garbage that entire time and I wanted to get out. I knew I didn’t belong, and I had high hopes for making new friends outside.

As hard as I didn’t want to admit, I attempted suicide at least 3 times during those 4 years. Feeling like that white shirt with a stain on it at the back of a clothing store really stuck to me. I never really belonged to anyone, and I was just never going to be able to make friends like that.

And the sad part came to when at my senior year, I was diagnosed with severe depression. I wasn’t shocked by the diagnosis, but rather at the fact that I never really thought that my life would conclude to a diagnosis. My doctor said that I should’ve come when I first felt loneliness, but 6 years of loneliness with hopes that I’d make friends wasn’t really what I expected. 
I also was told that there were some other diagnosis that can’t be fully clarified unless I go to a psychiatrist/psychologist (excuse me for my confusion), which gave me that awful anxiety that I could have something that made people not want to talk to me. As in, what if I had an omen aura that people had to avoid me for?

And yes, it did include instances of attachment issues. I just couldn’t talk to people for a long while without the continuing anxiety that people just never wanted to hangout with me.

I never ask people to hangout with me anymore, so I wait until they ask.
I never start texting people, I wait until they text first. And it’s not because I want to wait, it’s because I just needed to see if it was really worth talking to them or being friends with them.

And to be honest, I still have this anger rushing inside me to curse all of those people who let me down for the past 8 years of my life. I never wanted to associate myself with anyone who was from my high-school or from my elementary school. And if I did, a panic attack would arrive.

Right now I currently do have friends and I’m happy for it, but my mental health is just crushed to the point where I compare myself to trash. 
I just really hate how people say that “it’s not people who make you like that, it’s how you react to them treating you”, because I don’t have control about what people do to me.  And yes, the Sartre me is screaming out, “hell is other people”.

I was abused as a child. I wasn't hit, had plenty of fun little things when I was in my early teens but there was one thing I wasn't allowed after 11 and that was real life socialization. I was ""home-schooled"" after that point and have had to learn a lot of things on my own and I mean a lot. I wasn't taught anything by my parent. We barely spoke and when we did, we usually fought. Thankfully my parent was ignorant of all the things the internet could be used for. CPS was called a number of times by the dad of a friend I used to have and by me but it was Arizona so they didn't care because it wasn't blatantly visible. A lot of things I thought were normal, weren't and talking about my past has had some very bad reactions.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is friends. I've never been good at making them but I think I can socialize somewhat well considering. When I was 11 I was forced to give up my only real friend who I had known for over 3 years and was extremely close with which began this cycle. I talk to someone a few times and get to know them, they invite me to hang out with their other friends. In this group of other friends things seem to be going good for a few months. Someone, usually the most social one starts to dislike me. Usually a few weeks go by like this and suddenly everyone wants me to leave the group. Sometimes they say it's because of things I said that I never said and other times its been for things I've done that I didn't do. I try not to make a big deal out of this and leave peacefully but there's usually more to it and other times these aren't the expressed issues but I'm told it's personality clash and little things that add up. This is every group since I was a kid and I'm 26. Granted most of these are online but in real life it hasn't been any different. If anything it's been worse as I've actually been attacked. I was able to run away without really being  hurt thanks to a knife I had tucked away but it was extremely scary that it got to that point. I don't know why people don't like me and I don't know why some of these people are willing to hurt me, and lie about me because of it. If it was just some one off thing, it wouldn't keep happening and at least someone would stand up for me. If it isn't me that's the problem then why is everyone ok with me leaving? I'm to the point where I can't stand this anymore. I'm tired of trying to make friends with people. I'm used to being alone, I just don't want to be but maybe this is just what's best.

I'm a 26 years old male, teacher. Growing up, I've had few episodes of depression where I've self-harmed, I've had few other self-destructive behaviours. However, recently, I've realised that it had gotten worst. I started having dreams of jumping off from my window (I live on level 12 in an apartment complex, alone). Moreover, on last Saturday, when I was walking through my corridor, I felt so drawn towards the ledge. And I keep contemplating about suicide.  


I know what the trigger is -- it was Facebook and all the nasty comments against LGBTQ. Being raised in Malaysia and raised in a Muslim household, it has been extremely hard for me, especially since I'm in a committed relationship. I have been feeling strongly isolated and detached from everyone and everything. I've been feeling worthless and guilty and ashamed of myself. I couldn't focus on anything work or leisure. I tried to distract myself from the thoughts by going hiking with my colleagues but as soon as I got back, the thoughts of killing myself came back stronger and I felt worst. So I decided to go to the hospital. After being admitted for 1 night, I was discharged as the doctor believed that I pose no risk of self-harm at the moment.

1514,MHThrowaway314,1547612652,1,"TL;DR: I’m almost 40, have had a crapton of hospitalizations/diagnoses/treatment regimens and am terrified that I’m going to have this chaotic/panicked/failing mind and life for the rest of my life because it’s been so long since my brain was both reasonable quiet and mostly operational.  I feel I’m failing my family (and especially my kids) by taking up so much of everyone’s energy and giving so little back. 

Long version: I just need to talk. I hope that’s OK. Tonight is a bad night in a series of bad nights and I’m worn out.  It’s long and rambly but I am hoping that getting it out will at least let me sleep tonight. 

Once upon a time, I was proud of my brain. I did well in school, got a scholarship, went to college. It took a little longer than usual to finish undergrad, but I did it. 

I’m not proud of my mind any more. Things started to go weird when I was in my 20s. All of a sudden, the kid who’d flown through books and could remember just about anything was reading articles for class over and over without retaining information. I’d done a lot of public speaking in high school, but started freaking out over just answering a question in class.  I’d been a pretty happy and outgoing teenager, but became more introverted as the anxiety around social situations grew, so i had fewer and fewer friends and connections, which just increased the feeling of isolation. I remember having weird panic attacks sometimes as a kid, that gnawing cold panic that settles behind your breastbone and sort of sends tingles out from there.  Knowing for a stone cold fact that you’re going to die any second now. Maybe a weird feeling for an 8 year old, but I thought that’s how it was for everyone, since we’ve all got a sample size of 1 when it comes to knowing exactly what goes on inside a brain I thought it was normal. 

I’d had some problems with an eating disorder in high school, but was more or less in remission for a while, until I wasn’t. I grew up in a church that dismissed any treatment having to do with mental health as nonsense, and any evidence of depression or anxiety as a sign that you just didn’t have a strong enough faith, so I didn’t get help until I was about 25. That’s when the eating disorder landed me in the hospital. I was really in a bad way, but had family helping me and a precious toddler that served as motivation for reaching out and sticking with treatment. Things got better for a little while, with some therapy and minimal meds. 

Problem is, that was almost 15 years ago,and things are worse now than they ever were then.  Since that first time, I’ve been diagnosed with a bunch of different things as different doctors tried meds or treatments that didn’t work. Until the ACA passed (I’m in the U.S.), I had trouble getting treatments because we either couldn’t get approved for insurance because of pre-existing conditions or because we had insurance but mental health wasn’t covered so my care was spotty for a while. That’s been better for the last five or six years now but I feel like it’s been messed up for so long that I’m stuck. I don’t know what it feels like to have a day that doesn’t involve at least one bout of paralyzing existential dread and some amount of crying. 

Behavior wise, there’s been a lot of self-harm, taking pills or drinking to numb out, and failure after failure when it comes to normal stuff like living life or holding a job, which compounds the anxiety and the guilt and just turns into a feedback loop of bullshit that I don’t know how to break. I also have INTENSE panic around the idea of dying (more on this later in War and Peace, mental health edition!) that I don’t know how to shake. 

I tried applying for disability a few times when I went for months without being able to work (which is hard and more than a little humiliating), just to get told that while I certainly couldn’t do anything like I’d done before, I was capable of simple repetitive work and so there wasn’t any help I could get. I wasn’t capable of work at the time - which is embarrassing to admit - getting out of bed and getting the kids the bare minimum of what they needed took everything I had. To be THERE and be told that you’re really not that bad off is awful. That meant that it was my fault, that if I would just suck it up and try harder that everything would be OK.

Right now, I feel like life’s out of control - I’m obese (which affects what I can do on a daily basis), have a mountain of student loan debt that I can’t modify anymore because of so many deferrals in the past (which keeps us from making any financial progress and means our credit is shit), and just lost one of my jobs. I’m almost 40 and working full-time for the first time in about 8 years, and it’s a retail job that doesn’t pay the bills. I lost my other job, adjuncting, when classes didn’t make AGAIN at the third school I’ve taught at in 2 years. 

I’ve been hospitalized on emergency holds 10 or 11 times, done a shit-ton of therapy, done 4 months of daily intensive outpatient therapy. Hospitalizations have cost my husband jobs, led to me washing out of grad school before I could finish, kept interrupting attempts to GET a job....and still I am terrified. All the time. Mostly of dying, but sometimes really random stupid things. Like I’m afraid to drive because I think our whole family will die, or scared that our neighbor will break into our house.  Mostly I’m afraid that it will never be quiet in my mind.  That I will always be scared so much of death for always. It’s ironic because. I’ve been suicidal so many times - not because I want to die, it terrifies me, but because I am so tired. It’s been messed up for so long that I can’t imagine it being any different.  And it’s silly, I KNOW it’s silly, because I know if I went to a doctor tomorrow and they told me that I had a terminal illness I would be pissed and want to hang on with everything I have, but somehow I can’t work that up when it’s just me in my room. I don’t know what I believe about what happens when we die, and please PLEASE if you respond I’m not ready to have that discussion.  I just know that I’m really tired of being so scared all the time.  I’ve read lots of books (learning more about stuff, demystifying it, a nerd’s first line of defense) and done some specific guided meditations, but there is just terror. The death fixation is NOT the only problem.  Cognition, isolation, and anxiety are all affected and probably have more of an impact on daily life than the death thing.  

I have an awesome family. They are great, they are supportive, and I adore them. I feel really bad that I have put so much stress on our family through all the crap of the last 10 years. I have kids who are still little, and I hate that they’ve really only known me sick. I want them to have better than that. 

I’m currently on medication to help with what’s now being diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder (whole LOAD OF FEELINGS ON THAT ONE - no chemical imbalance? It’s really my fault?  I’ve put everyone through all this nonsense because I wouldn’t try harder?) and Bipolar 2.  I was going to therapy at least a couple of times a month, but quit that when I lost the job. Right now, it’s hard being told that the only thing that’s available treatment wise is higher doses of what I’m already taking when THOSE are literally 10x greater than the doses I was taking back when this all started. I’ve tried NOT taking meds at all - that was a dumb idea and how probably half of my hospitalizations happened.  I don’t know what the balance is, though.

I don’t know how to fight when it’s been like this so long. I just want to be able to enjoy the time I have, be a good mom and wife, and make some sort of little difference in the world. I feel like that’s beyond my capabilities, and I hate it. I’m trying to meditate, to work on mindfulness so I can ride the emotions instead of getting overwhelmed by them, but it’s not going so well. I would give up anything but my family if I could just snap my fingers and make it go away, or at least few like there was a reasonable chance that I could get there. It’s practical things that are hurting me now - how do I begin to build a useful life after a decade where I’ve done not much at all?  How do I soak up this precious time without spending it all scared? How do I get out of the physical and financial holes that I’m in when it seems so hopeless?

I just don’t know how to start. I’m scared that I can’t. And I’m mad that I’m wasting time.

For some background I’m in my third year of college and I’ve been dating my GF for a year and six months and I love her dearly. She is my favorite person, and the only one I could talk to and goof around with. I know that I love her and I know this bc of how she makes me feel and how she makes me laugh when I’m with her and forget these thoughts BC I’m just laughing with her instead. I hug her and I forget my problems, we kiss and I smile. She leaves and I miss her. I love my girlfriend dearly and I know she loves me but for the past week or so I’ve been having these random overbearing thoughts in my head saying you don’t love her breakup with her and things of that nature. I know I love my girlfriend and the furthest thing in this world I wanna do is breakup with her so why am I having these thoughts. The last thing I wanna do is give in and breakup

Lately I’ve had these thoughts for reasons unknown to me but they’ve really only been prevalent lately. I couldn’t sleep last night BC of these thoughts in my head so I called my girlfriend hoping she’d make me feel better and instantly that’s what happened. I called her and she made me laugh for the thirty minutes we were on the phone. The semester recently just started and I’m taking a couple of difficult classes like Physics 2 and Organic Chemistry 2 so maybe it’s stress but school hasn’t made me stress to this extent before. Recently my best friend broke up with her boyfriend and I had a crush on her in my second year of high school so maybe it has to do with that, but idk

I love my girlfriend and I want help. I don’t want these thoughts in my head BC they make me feel guilty BC I know they’re not true so why do I think them. I know I wanna be with my girlfriend and I know I jut want her to hug me and say it’s ok but if she hugs me and says it’s ok I don’t want to think to myself how much I suck for having these thoughts

1516,Thin_Wishes3,1547611545,1,"Quick background, I have a history of anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and an attempt, an eating disorder, slight substance abuse problems, trauma and suggested bipolar. (26F) 
These are all very long term issues.

I’ve been in and out of therapy, I’ve had a dietician as well but never psychiatrist or support group. 

I’ve been thru several therapists in my area, I’ve self paid and used insurance. I normally find self pay are better.. I also have great insurance thru work. My issue lately is, I can’t seem to find a therapist who tackles all of these issues, who takes my insurance, and who is taking new clients. 

I normally rely on psychtoday, are there any other sources anyone can suggest? 

Does anyone know what type of support groups I should try and look into, and how to find GOOD ones? I think at this point it’s most important I’m medicated, but I have very few psychiatrists in this area who take insurance. As I’ve gotten older my expenses have gone up and unfortunately I don’t know if I could afford to self pay anymore. Also it’s hard to get in quickly without a recommendation. My dietician was trying to make me see someone she worked with but that ended when she cut me off after my suicide attempt-lol. 

I’ve also considered a short term IP program, however in my area, one is catered towards the very wealthy and I’ve read reviews that’s I’ll somehow end up with a huge hospital bill even with insurance, the other one you have to be directly brought from  a certain hospital. I also don’t know if I’m bad enough to warrant that help right now. 

I’m just feeling very lost. I live in southern CT (Fairfield County) if anyone is geographically close and has suggestions. I’m really worried if I keep acting like things are ok, and not getting help that I won’t be around much longer. I just don’t know what to do and I could really use some guidance.

Every time I feel an intense emotion (not necessarily bad, sometimes it's excitement) I shake my hands in an aggressive way, think shaking hands after washing them if no paper towels. I also blink in aggressive and unnatural patterns, rub my eyes over and over again, and rock back and forth in similar situations. I start doing these things subconsciously, and can stop if I need to, but I'll feel unreasonably anxious if I do. Sometimes when the urge to do these things is very strong and I make myself stop, I'll have a full blown panic attack where I have to shut myself in a quiet dark place for about and hour to get control of myself. I've googled what this could be, and the two most common things I could find were autism and sensory processing issues, though I don't seem to perfectly fit either's symptoms. Is this normal?

1521,crazydevillady,1547606536,1,"After the diagnosis was confirmed I was angry. Angry at my past health professionals, angry at my previous teachers, but most of all I was  angry at myself for not detecting it sooner.  I should have conveyed my  struggles better, I was educated, I should have known. Why did I not  seek help until I was 31? I fit every damn textbook qualification for ADHD inattentive type. So why? Why did I have to struggle for so long?

I’ve  been compensating for my inability to pay-attention all my life.  Checking tasks 3-5 times in order to account for the times I would tune  out. Recording lectures or meetings, having to revisit them in order to  retain the same information as my peers. Constantly playing catch-up. I  had to face that paralyzing fear - knowing that you have to complete a  task but don’t want to. Actually, you can’t bring yourself to complete  it. So you try to ignore it, and it builds - snowballing into anxiety,  guilt and self-loathing. I learned to second guess myself even more,  because my memories weren’t all there. Memories felt like a dream-state,  foggy and unclear. You can’t trust a foggy memory, so how in the world  could I trust myself or have confidence in my skills?

For  every time I heard - “How could you forget? we just talked about it”,  “If you would just apply yourself”, “I know you’re not stupid” “Are you  paying attention? or “I’m just wasting my breath, you don’t even care”.  “Why do you keep losing your phone?”, “I swear you need to go to a  neurologist”…”Whats wrong with you?”

In  the first days following my diagnosis I cried. I grieved for lost time,  opportunities and difficulties. Despite this - I’m thankful, I have  begun to let go of the guilt and forgive myself for the times I wasn’t  able to complete a task or pay attention - no matter how hard I tried.

Looking  back, I did well with the hand I was given. Contrary to my previous  belief - it was my abilities and dedication that allowed me to succeed  and obtain my engineering degree. I did that, on my own, with no help.  Yes I struggled, yes - at times I took longer and sometimes I failed,  but I was determined, and when I was able to focus…I could match and  sometimes surpass my peers. For the first time in a long time, I feel  proud of myself. I was not slow, lazy or stupid. Although it would not  always translate, I had the ability to play on the same field as my  peers - even with a handicap.

I now  understand my Dr.’s first warning when she started me on medication.  “Its not a cure all, you will need to focus on the correct thing. I get  it now, medication isn’t a magical cure - its a tool. A helping hand in  focusing; however new habits/coping skills will need to be developed in  order to get you 100% there. Today I feel hope, and as silly as this  might sound - it’s under my control now. Its manageable with a little  bit of extra work…and that I can do.

If  any of this resonates, and you have not been diagnosed - please seek the  help of a trained professional. Unfortunately, many times ADHD  (inattentive type) goes undiagnosed, especially for woman - because we  do not fit the common stereo type, or we find ways to hid or cope with  it…and so it goes undetected.

To my Dr,  thank you for listening. Although I know there is work to come, I  somehow feel lighter. As if I had been trapped, and the door was finally  unlocked, revealing a glimpse of my potential. I feel as if I have been  given the key to that door, and now its up to me to see how far I will  go, and for that I am eternally grateful.

i kept smoking after this experience but the weed high was never the same i was always paranoid about things and problems in my life i had a break down twice where i would cry and just think my life is stupid, i also never talked i just sat there thinking.

a few months on about halfway into the school year i fell out with these people and it has taken a toll on me and my self confidence, i stopped smoking regularly but do it occasionally sometimes by myself or with some other people for the remainder of the year definitely not to the extent i was once smoking, as of recently i’ve stopped completely but i have an underlying feeling something isn’t right with my mental health, i always seem to have music stuck in my head and i can’t depict if i’m “hearing things” or if it’s just stuck in my head, i also get words stuck in my head and repeat them or spell them out etc. sometimes a random word or phrase will pop into my head and i just sit there like why am i thinking of this or why is this here, i just need some guidance on the situation as i don’t know what i am meant to do or feel i feel constantly drained and at the moment i am losing sleep i have been up for 2 hours because these songs are stuck in my head.

1530,pickleddaikon33,1547597869,1,"I'll try to make this as concise as possible. I have a bad history with my mother, who suffers from pretty bad borderline personality disorder and Crohn's disease. I moved out when I was 14 because she was emotionally and verbally abusive - she would scream at my brother and I about the house being a mess, having no groceries, having a relationship with our father (they were divorced), etc.    
After I moved out, it took me considerable time to talk to her again, maybe a year or so and as time went on I began to see her again and eventually spent a day or two a week staying over. Throughout college I would stay with her every Thursday and occasionally visit on other days, which she would constantly guilt me over since she didn't feel she was seeing me enough. If I posted on Facebook that I loved my dad or posted for Father's Day, she would explode into a rage over how I love him more, and that I've ""never said anything like that"" to her. When I started working full time, I couldn't go see her like I used to which became a huge problem for her.  I would still pick up groceries or things for her when she was sick and unable to get them. (She doesn't really have much contact with family other than my grandparents and has very few friends due to her behavior towards others and pushing them all away due to her BPD.) About 5 months ago her car broke down when she was out, she called me demanding I come get her and was saying how she had no food for herself, her dog, or her bird, and that I needed to help her. I was about to leave for an evening shift at work, so I mentioned I couldn't do anything for her and she became irritable and passive aggressive, hung up the phone on me and sent me texts throughout the evening saying things like ""It's fine, I'll get a taxi."" I called my social worker who reassured me I shouldn't feel responsible for taking care of her all the time so I went to work and left it at that. During this time she didn't have a car, and my job was so emotionally draining that I couldn't even fathom spending my time outside of work running her errands considering how she treated me. She never asked for help after this so I assumed she was fine since she had mentioned her friend was going to run her to the store. Suddenly a week or so later, she exploded on me about how I was a terrible daughter and a disgrace and that she ""didn't know me"" because I wouldn't help her and families make sacrifices for eachother. I tried to reason with her and point out that she wasn't treating me well and that just escalated her. Long story short, she was very verbally abusive and insulting, blaming me for not helping her and that ""I should be ashamed to be a nurse considering how I treat her"" among other really nasty comments. I ended up blocking her for months until the other day I decided to unblock her and she began texting me saying ""Congratulations, your grandparents didn't ask to see you when they were here because they are disgusted by you and your behavior. Good job alienating half of your family."" I ended up texting her out of anger back and forth (which went nowhere) to which she still sent me nasty text messages and saying things like ""I have 0 empathy, but that's how I was born."" I'm really considering just cutting her off entirely. I feel awful deep down because it's not something I would ever want to do, but I can't even have a normal conversation with her and she refuses to accept or take accountability for her actions. Sorry for the long post, I just thought maybe I could find someone that understands where I'm coming from or has some advice. I see a social worker every couple weeks and I talk about it to some family and friends.

It makes me feel like a coward. A loser. There's people out there with arthritis, cancer, limbs missing, people going through traumatic events and grief. And they manage. They push forward. Why can't I do that? There's no reason for me to be depressed.

1543,EpisodeAddict,1547588547,1,"Hey for a little background I’ll start with:

I’ve been having CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) for a few months and started antidepressants around 5 months ago as GP felt I was suffering with anxiety and depression.

(I’m based in England. I referred myself to the well-being team to see a therapist)

I’ve had my last session of CBT and my therapist was concerned that although I completed every task and achievements I set myself, I still feel the same as before even with the combination of therapy and medication. 

I saw the Gp today and explained that sometimes I’m not sure when things I feel or do is depression or just myself and I wanted a therapist I could really discuss things with and find out what is up. GP thought I would benefit from a referral to the community mental health team as she explained that the tablets won’t work if I’m not actually suffering with depression so there may be a personality disorder.  

That’s all fine by me but when I’m alone I think I do need help and when I speak to someone professional I feel like I’m just being a hypochondriac and “trying” to be diagnosed with something. I feel like I’m making a deal out of nothing. Does anyone else feel like that?

TLDR I saw gp to say tablets and therapy not working and I feel like I’m exaggerating or hypochondriac. Am I being paranoid?",mentalhealth,Went to doctors for review on depression. I feel paranoid,2019-01-16 08:42:27
1544,BootyFyre,1547588382,1,"A few years ago, I was an awful friend to the one person who cared about me the most. I said and did awful things, I allowed my ex and his friends to encourage it; and even though my best friend and I made amends, I still hate myself for it. 

I hate myself for the things I said, I hate myself for letting myself get so carried away with saying such spiteful things and airing out dirty laundry that should have never been told...

I almost lost my best friend because of it. And I almost lost myself, because I was building myself up for a potential suicide honestly. 

But at the time I thought, “nothing matters anymore, nothings going to change. Just throw it all to the wind and don’t look back.” And that’s what I tried to do. I numbed myself from the turmoil I was in, the depression and the nagging voices of loneliness and sadness. 

I hate myself for doing it all. I regret it, and I still hate myself. I will use it to beat myself up and remind myself of how shitty of a person I am, how so undeserving and how I distaste everything about myself. 

My best friend has forgiven me and we’ve moved past it all, but two years later I still use it to remind myself of how much of a shitty person I am, how I wish I could take it all back and do right, when everyone I hurt has forgiven me, but I am yet to forgive myself ",mentalhealth,I keep internalizing it...

I was recently watching a film where the Dr's are role playing with patients, experimenting with them.  It reminded me of my former detainment and they were role playing with me.  I was still self aware and not delusional, I thought those people were kind of sick f-cks.  I could see it as a useful tool to build on what you know of your patients delusions but it may be unethical next to reasoning with them.

These folks were trying to play along with me, it was a bit deranged.  It was a long long time ago and transpired over me joking about re-incarnation and religious stuff.  I was never trying to be literal, people took it literally though.  I mean, I surely didn't take religion seriously.  

That is one thing I would tell others, take it somewhat more seriously than I did, unless you want to burn in hell.  I've met numerous people that wanted to put me away, I was just joking.

Just posting here to see if anyone has suffered anything similar and can help me figure out if something is wrong.

I’m 21, female and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for about 6 years. I take medication for it and while I’ve had some bad times as a teenager I’m mostly stable now. However, within the last 6 months or so (it’s hard to tell exactly when it started) I’ve started feeling more tired and lethargic than usual. Everything centres around the next time I’ll be able to go home and lie down. In addition to this, I’ve been feeling increasingly demotivated to do anything, get distracted and bored very easily, and experience severe brain fog. This is a problem for me at university as I used to be extremely motivated to work hard and now I can hardly focus on anything or think about anything too complicated without the brain fog kicking in and muddling up my thoughts. As I said, I started noticing it around summer time and it’s gradually been getting worse since then, within the last month especially. Lately I’ve also been more confused and forgetful, like I’ll go into a trance and do something unintentionally and then be confused as to why I did it (kinda like going into a room and forgetting why you went in there but with pretty much everything). I’m not sure if any of these symptoms are linked to my depression and if I’m just having an episode, but as I’ve said I’ve been diagnosed for a long time and I’ve never experienced anything like this before, coupled with the fact that I feel any emotional symptoms like sadness. I’m worried it’s a sign of something more serious, especially since the symptoms are getting worse. It may not sound like that big a deal but I literally don’t want to do anything at the moment but it’s so debilitating to feel so tired and foggy all the time.

1549,Truthistheonlygod,1547586533,1,That's all I ever hear from my family. And they're right. I'm 30 and living in my parents garage unemployed for the last 3 years. I'm the loser everyone loves to hate. I don't like or want to be like this. I'm like this because I've had severe mental health problems since I was very young that went without help. Idk for sure but I have reason to believe I was molested at a very young age and I am very likely on the autism spectrum. I don't know if my family sees my mental health problems and doesn't care or if they just don't care enough to see them. I was pretty much neglected as a kid. My parents did what they had to do to keep me alive but never bothered to teach my anything. I did horrible in school because I was so anxious around everybody that I couldn't even walk past people without my muscles tensing up and walking very awkwardly because of it. I also pissed myself in class once because I was too shy to ask to go to the bathroom. I'm just saying that so you have an example of how severe my issues are. I've had jobs before and was good at them. Stocking shelves at retail stores and doing brainless factory work. I made some friends as a teenager while working but was always the odd guy out and I don't speak to anybody any more. I quit all my jobs because of my mental health. I feel guilty for quitting because idk if my reasons for quitting are justifiable. What stressed me out most about my jobs is they were all doing repetitive tasks daily/weekly with very little mental stimulation and eventually It would be too much for me to handle. I also have trouble relating with people so it's tough to be around people who always remain strangers even though you see them every day. I want a job and I need a job but Idk what to do about it. I've had like 2 interviews in these 3 years and one was at a place my friend worked at and had the boss give me an interview. Soon as I left the place the boss called my friend saying how weird I was. I'm too screwed up mentally to go out in the world and do what I need to do. Even when I had a job I was too unfit mentally to advance my life. I've been isolated in my room for the past 3 years with very little human interaction or even going outside. I live with my parents but most of the time I can't even stand to be in the same room as them or look in their direction. We have no relationship. I think about suicide a lot but idk if it'll actually happen. I tried finding hobbies like reading and exercise to improve myself but it's hard to keep it up when there's no improvement on my situation. I tried therapy once but they didn't seem to even listen and I didn't have enough money to shop around and find somebody that might actually help. I live in a small redneck town in florida with few resources and a mental health system that loves to create opioid addicts. Idk what to do with myself.

1550,stelioskali,1547585780,1,"So here’s what’s up. When I get really fuckin upset, I’m talking ballistic, it’s like I change as a person completely. I start having a completely different thought process and it’s as though my whole psyche changes. I generally love life. I love the little things and the big things. I love having fun basically. But when I have these states, I can’t seem to really remember what I felt like afterwords. I just recall myself feeling very depressed and angry. So some time ago when I got in my faze again, I decided to jot down my thoughts as though I was talking to my future self. This is the result: ( some context: this specific rage was caused by a huge but regular fight I had with my father where we almost ended up smashing each others heads in. Ps more context: I also talk about weight loss and xanax in my notes. Tbh I dunno where the weight loss thing comes from cause I’m in pretty good shape and feel good about it and as for the Xanax, there was a time in my life when I abused it) Don’t forget the kind of person he is. He throws these fights on purpose. He does it to punish you. He knows you hate yourself. I want it all to end but I’m too afraid to die. I am a fucking pussy but I want peace. I want to take all the drugs and be in a zone of utter mindlessness forever. I don’t want me anymore. I want the dimension where I can exist without having to know anyone or ever feel pain again. Coming to the actual conclusion that no one will ever understand you ever no fucking matter what because everyone is just going through their own shit is a tough realization. It really means we’re all alone. No one will ever understand us. No one will ever truly know the pain we felt. No matter the movie you portray it in, or the autobiographical book you write. At the end of the day. You live and die with your pain. And you never get to share it.i finally understand why people cut themselves. I never got it before. Why the fuck would anyone do that. What a pussy attention calling act. But I fucking get it now. It feels fucking amazing. Fucking Nirvana. When all you feel is fucking misery and wanting to die. To feel pain instead, real physical pain, feels like heaven on earth. I think I cracked a fucking smile in the mirror while I slit my wrist. And oh god how close I was to ending it. I wanted to so fucking bad but I’m too scared. I don’t want to cringe at the sight of my arm split down the middle.  I would be okay on passing with pills though. That’d be a fucking amazing way. Fuck me I need to try heroin. I fucking need it. I haven’t tried it yet but I’m craving it. I want to die to heroin mixed with fentynal. The perfect death.
Don’t forget this sadness tomorrow when you wake up. Read this and feel these feelings again. I’m tired of letting them go. It hurts more every time I have to get them again. If I’m always like this I can’t let anyone affect me. Read this and remind yourself that nothing will ever be good. You are destined for nothing. You will die young and everyone will have expected it. Your mother gave up on you. Your father HATES you. Your sister is the only one who gives a fuck AND YOU TREAT HER HOW THEY TREAT YOU. I DONT WANT TO BE THIS WAY. I DONT WANT TO BE LIKE THEM WHY AM I LIKE THEM WHY JESUS FUCK THIS IS THE ONLY THING I DONT WANT TO BE. IM EATING THEIR SHIT AND CRAMMING IT DOWN MY SISTERS THROAT AFTER ITS GONE THROUGH ME. IM JUST AS BAD AS THEM. what if she feels the same way as me. What if she feels no one will ever understand. I can understand. Atleast a part of it. She understands me too. She’s the only one. Read this everyday you stay living your worthless life. She is everything. Die to protect her. She is the only one who will ever truly love you. Don’t ruin it. Jesus fuck please don’t ruin it. I’m begging you.
From tomorrow stop fucking eating so much. Eat the essentials to stay alive for fucks sake and that’s it. I’ve packed on so fucking much. I need my fucking Xanax.

I've been depressed for a good 6/7 years and been suicidal several times during this period. My will to live is severely diminishing day by day. It's hard to picture myself living past 30 (i'm 21 right now). I just don't see it. There's versions of what could be, but I don't see how I'll ever get there the way I am right now. 

I'm nothing but a burden to everyone who loves me. My parents, my friends... they're all sick of it, sick of me. They're sick of dealing with me. And i don't blame them because i'm sick of dealing with me too. 

I want to get help. I want to be better. But it's so hard when I have school and I want to do things that normal kids my age do. I know drinking and getting high is the last thing I should be doing in this state of mind but everything is just so overwhelming and I feel like I'm running out of time to make things right. I feel like, I already fucked up my chances at having a normal life.

This is not a pity party just stating some general facts: I was bullied for the majority of my adolescences, starting in maybe 5th grade and gradually getting worse, and worse, and worse. Home wasn't a safe place for me either with my parents fighting all day everyday, and me fighting with them as well. I was 14 when I first started smoking weed, and by 15/16 I was smoking more and more daily. I'm 21 and still smoking daily. So my brain is basically fried at this point. 

Anyways, yeah. That's all, I just wanted to vent. I probably won't kill myself because i'm too scared but I really just don't want to exist anymore.

The purpose of FC Not Alone is to use Football/Soccer to open up the conversation around mental health. The reason for us using football is because we are passionate about it and because in the UK it's probably the biggest form of escapism that exists.

It's common to be sat at a pub with your mate chatting about football and you could possibly not talk about anything else in life that's actually important.

Anyways fast forward to July and her best male friend who I fucking hated at the time (Tristan, My best friend now) tells me to watch out and that mia is manipulating people and talking bullshit about people but anyways a few days later I get on overwatch and ask her what the go with Tristan is and she says god knows what bullshit but the next day I get on she was ignoring me or some shit so her cousin tells me it was that I called her a bitch and she hates me. So I did whatever but the next day all the Titanfall friends I made are talking shit. So I don't remember the in between but I when on to my mates account (acting like him) and asked her some questions she said that she never even liked me and that we were never even friends and I don't know why but that cut me fucking deep also what Tristan was referring to was she told everyone that he was desperate for her (he is 2 years older than us) and that he was a pedo and asked her out via Facebook (lies). She also sent me a random insta pic of some anime bitch Then a few months later I invited her to a party to try and clear the air and I used an unnecessary insult after I found out her father was unemployed and played a lot of her ps4 and had read our chat (with nothing inappropriate) but anyways she then told me that I was an asshole and that her dad was dying of cancer. I told her that I was so sorry and that if she was lying I would know because I was still in contact with Trevor who I had just found is her only male cousin but she swore. That night I found out how deep she had hurt me. I drank 2L of coke and played UNO on ps4 until 8 am crying myself to sleep with a broken controller (and I don't ever cry). One day I catch with Trevor and ask him if his uncle was dying and he said no and left. fast forward two months into easter time 2018 after I had just lost my ps4 for 2 months (that story is in another Reddit post) and I get a random Friend request from let's call him Gabe. So Gabe (i later found out gabe was her older brother) joins the party and immediately goes off his fucking nut and yells ""listen cunt stay the fuck away from my family and stop spreading shit you pathetic cunt, Trevor had a fucking panic attack because of you"" he leaves and I put the pieces together and realize Trevor had a panic attack after he thought his uncle was fucking dying and it wasn't even my fault but I wasn't gonna tell him that so I just took it. No bullshit 15 minutes later he joins back and goes ""hold on were you friends with (Mia's PSN account), oh sorry mate, just coming to check if you are all good I went pretty fucking crazy, anyways catcha"" so then I thought some more Trevor must have mentioned that I said to him that she had told me that and then it must have bitten her in the ass. (That is just a theory though) anyways yesterday I checked on her account she had made everything private but the one thing I could see was the music that she was listening to the album was The Matchbox Twenty Collection and the song was unwell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WziA88-n02k) and another song in the album was my name when i listened to the song I don't know if it was just 4 am me but I felt like it was her talking to me directly this line in particular ""But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell I know right now you can't tell But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see A different side of me""

It made sense her parents never paid attention to her she was always online and she lied about everyone she was friends with to get the attention of her cousins and other strangers.

I have no clue why but I miss her so fucking much and some nights even though this all went down last year I just think about her when I know she is a liar like most of my other posts this is just to get it off my chest but if you made it the end of this text wall have a good night.",mentalhealth,I really miss someone but I know they're bad for me,2019-01-16 03:59:11

The point is that after an history of self harm, not dealing with trauma, abandoning therapy after that appointment a few years ago and suicidal threats (including a few days ago) she seeks help by talking to me, she feels horrible because she got drunk and did tell her boyfriend she will kill herself and not tell anyone, and in general, she doesn't react well to regection and now she is super obsessed with the keto diet, to a point she doesn't eat if there's no food like that counts as keto (has eating issues not treated too, like she told me and her current boyfriend), and now she feels rage and gets really really mad about the pharmaceutical industry and doesn't trust doctors. I suggested psychotherapy because it works for me and as a future health profesional is something i believe in.
Today, after crying and telling me how hopeless she was, how crazy and undeserving of love she felt, she tells me that she sees no point of getting treatment and I'm kind of tired of trying, because I can't be her therapist, and she has many many issues and she gets mad at me very easily and I'm very worried for her, but she is an adult and she is free to decide, but after she threatened her boyfriend of killing herself and ""jokingly"" told me when we were dating, if I would care if she died, a little often.

Only after I typed them out did I realize I might be suffering from something that is actively causing hurdles in my personal and academic life. So, I decided to search for an online forum before I consulted a doc. 

Here are the points I came up with:
1) Excessive daydreaming: 
 - 4-5 hours per day. 
 - Compulsion (sometimes in-between work).
2) Procrastination:
 - Simple tasks feel like a burden.
 - Hard to commit to a routine.
3) Anxiety: 
 - Suffered Androgenic alopecia since the age of 18. Anxiety over hair-loss. Wasted hours for months analysing my hair during treatment (Good hair maintenance with a strict regimen of medicines now).
 - Anxiety over hair loss in the future. Sometimes can’t control the thought loops once they start.
 - Always worried about something.
4) Forgetfulness.
 - Tasks to do, discussions, and new information are forgotten quickly. 
 - Remember much less information than my peers.
5) Feeling less intelligent than before.
 - Less to offer in a discussion.
 - Sometimes failing to make simple associations.
6) Hard to maintain diverse interests. 
 - New and interesting tasks keep me focussed.
 - Lose interest fairly quickly.
7) Impulsive:
 - Jumping from one task to another before completion. 
 - Impulsive buying and going over budget.
8) Sleep:
 - Don’t feel completely refreshed in the morning. 
 - Sleep durations ranging from 6 – 12 hours, yet not fully refreshed.

1584,Conura,1547557882,1," Hi all,  


I'm looking for advice as to how to manage my life with my girlfriend of 18 months. We moved in together after 16 months of seeing each other and I am struggling a lot.  


Though I had an abusive and violent childhood, and have suffered bouts of depression in the past, at 32 I've largely (through therapy, reading a lot, and being good to myself) moved past it. I'd consider myself a happy and positive person these days. I say this because I'd like to think I can empathise with feelings of depression, but this is beyond what I have experience in my life.   


My girlfriend seemed to have a fairly relaxed and positive upbringing, with no negative influences from what she tells me. She has increasingly been making me feel anxious, miserable and stressed. She is never happy - she's either neutral or miserable. She will have ourbursts of negative emotion, tears, sulking and misery that last days and usually have no reason.   


When she gets into these moods there is no talking to her, she becomes self pitying, and says she can't control her feelings. In addition, there is a huge emphasis on 'her feelings' and how important they are. She can cry for hours and often I'm not sure why. This happens 3 times a week or so, or, more accurately, 50% of the time. She will very often then go completely back to normal and wonder why I am still angry, distant and hurt. I am expected to very quickly return to a happy state, otherwise she will say she feels too guilty, is sick of hurting me, and the process begins anew.  


The pressure on me is immense. If I'm not in a very happy mood and willing to spend all of my free time with her, her mood will quickly slip and I'll feel like I'm living with a grumpy child. Some days I will feel sick with anxiety from all the emotion and misery, and upon reflection realise there's absolutely no reason for it. Our life is comfortable, we have good jobs and so on.  


I've offered to pay for her therapy which starts Thursday, though she was very, very reluctant to go. In addition, I believe throughout her childhood she spent most of her time discussing feelings with her friends, all of whom also seem to be depressed.  


There have been quite a few worrying situations too. For example doing grocery shopping will result in a meltdown because she can't pick between things, getting a parking ticket can result in 6 hours of absolute emotional chaos (including driving like a maniac due to resultant anger).  


Other scenarios include a full blown 24 hour meltdown following me having dinner with her and a female friend, because she hates seeing me get on so easily with another woman. This also happened when I once met one of her (male friends) and we got on. Both times resulted in situations so exhausting I am beginning to not want to see other people with her.  


I've previously had a narcissistic partner and so have become quite good at boundaries and keeping my own self worth separate to this situation, but living in such close proximity is taking a toll. I'm doing everything I can to help, however it's starting to impact my work.  


Could anybody advise me on how to manage this situation? Is breaking up the only choice? Is it likely therapy could help with such significant symptoms?

Some are as simple as checking if I turned off the light even tho I know I did, and others are things that could be more serious.
For example- ""the plug for the lamp or my charger isn't fully plugged in and the power point is gonna blow"" (plugs not being in properly is a common one) (that's what just came into my head and I'm struggling to convince myself it's fine without checking)
I have to click clear on a calculator a few times in case it didn't actually clear. 
""There's a spider under my pillow"" more than likely isnt but i still have to check once I've thought it. 
I see my cat sleeping soundly and think ""what if shes dead"" and even tho I know it's not true i still have to poke her to check.
I make sure my phone's volume is all the way down. And if I'm going into somewhere important I make sure it's all the way down about 3 times. Even tho I know it literally already is silent.

1588,TheProfessor_Reddit,1547550541,1,"TL;DR: Basically I’m just asking about what’s normal about hallucinations and what’s not.

So I’d like to ask some questions about hallucinations. I guess you could say that I’ve been in kinda denial because see things that aren’t there is one of the last things that I ever thought that’d I’d experience. Basically occasionally (Maybe a few times a month but not too often. I can’t really tell you how often or when this happens. I’m yet to identify a cause) I’ll see something. Most of the time it’s like a spider or other creature except it’s very vague. I never quite see it but it’ll say run across a wall or the floor or just be in the corner of my room or on a wall. I’m fully aware that this doesn’t exist and I never clearly see it. Is this normal to experience this? Could this just be me overthinking stuff?

That type of stuff I can live with but what confuses and concerns me is other stuff that’s happened very rarely. In terms of visual stuff, sometimes I’ll think I’ll see the outline of a figure. This I’d presume is just again overthinking. As far as I know it’s mostly normal but I still feel like I should mention it. Another time I sort of saw a claw or a hand morph through a wall. This was very, very strange. It was weird. Kinda like you know in a dream how you see stuff but it’s kinda vague so in your dream you sort of tell yourself what you’re seeing. It was like that except I was fully awake and t was the middle of the day. That’s really all I can think in terms of visual stuff.

In terms of audio, asides from normal stuff like occasionally hearing your name. Sometimes I’ll hear random words. This is very very rare though so it may be normal. Other times I’ll hear stuff that just sounds off. Like a door closing or a tap dripping. I can hear it, bit for long but I’d assume that it’s really but it just doesn’t sound quite right. I’m not sure if that makes any sense. The last thing but most obvious sign that I’ve encountered (Which I should note has only happened once) was very clearly hearing a voice saying I’ll die if I stay home alone. It was weird to say the least and scared me quite a bit but that was a while ago.

What I want to know is how much of this is actually normal and what not? I understand that our brains are very complex so experiencing hallucinations does happen to everyone but I honestly don’t know what’s normal and what’s not normal. I’m not sure if age is a factor but I’m in my late teens and I have never taken drugs in my life.

1591,Crazed_n_confused,1547549574,1,"Hi. Nutcase here. Been having a major depressive episode these last few days, pushing me to make an account and vent about it. I'm not a writer, and poor at organizing my thoughts, so this is going to be all over the place. I'm sorry. 

I'm 27, and I've been dealing with this shit for most of my life. Unfortunately, I haven't done a damn thing about it, and it just gets worse. Every single day goes by and it feels more hopeless, like I'm destined to a life of misery. I want out. I so badly want to be better - to feel like a normal person - but I have immense difficulty helping myself. I am not a fan of myself, so I don't like doing things for myself. I just grit my teeth and let things fester, and lately it feels like I'm running out of strength, or running on fumes. I can't ignore it anymore. I think about death a lot, but I don't have suicidal thoughts. I want to live, but like, actually live. This isn't living. 

I don't know what to do, or where to even start. I want a life - friends, a girlfriend, a career - things most capable people should have by now. Instead, I'm here - an art degree and my parent's house, 50k student debt, working very part-time at a pharmacy for dirt money, and working on a second Bachelor's online for IT. My parents aren't even hugely successful. They struggle financially and I can't help them. I'm a drain on them. I don't even have a driver's license due to an intense fear of being behind the wheel. My life has been a series of bad decisions, heavily influenced by my depression, anxiety, and lack of care. Art degree in video game design at a private school? Solid decision. Employers are gonna love that one. I'll worry about the loans later. 

I've tried medication. Currently on one. I'm tired of playing musical pills. None have helped. I've also tried counseling to no avail. Never been able to find one that I could connect with. I always stop going because their questions are generic and do nothing to help me. I know my problems - I just don't know what to do about them. 

I'm socially isolated and experience soul-crushing loneliness daily. We live in the middle of nowhere. I need to escape but I can't. The only socialization I get is talking to my friends online via Discord (it's like Skype) and online video games. I find second-hand socialization watching streamers on Twitch playing games. I live vicariously through them. Some are funny. Laughing helps me forget about everything. 

I'm reclusive, socially awkward, and anxious. I don't want to be. I've had love interests that I've completely ignored, unwilling to process it mentally, ignoring advances. I go days at a time not speaking to my friends, making up excuses as to why I can't hop into a game with them. Too tired, not feeling well, busy, etc. My heart pounds in situations where I need to speak to strangers. I almost failed Public Speaking. The only reason I get by working at a pharmacy is some sort of miraculous numbing that my brain does to itself, allowing me to power through the day, almost robotically. I hate it immensely, but I'm damn good at customer service. 

I'm emotionally stunted and easily damaged. I'm jealous of everything. Too attached to everything. The success of others is absolute torture for me. Happy relationships rip at my heart strings. Why can't I have these things? How am I supposed to form relationships when my emotions are still that of an overly-emotional middle-schooler? I don't want to put that kind of baggage on people. I also have this fragile pride that prevents me from doing things that I consider myself better than. I'd rather be jobless than apply for another position in retail or minimum wage. I'd feel pathetic seeking career help via unemployment agencies or utilizing government assistance like food stamps or welfare. I don't know why. 

Confident, outgoing people scare the shit out of me. Their ability to take what they want makes me upset and angry. It's not their fault - it's mine. I feel inferior, and wish I could do the same. I feel pathetic compared to them. I feel small next to them. Comparison is the thief of joy - I know - But that doesn't make me feel any better. They feel like a threat - like any success or happiness I could ever find might be stripped away or stolen by them. Ridiculous thought steeped in jealousy, but it's there and it festers and eats at me. 

I wear a very heavy mask made of apathy and nihilism, if that makes any sense. I'm so used to this that I don't even know what my real personality is. How do I help myself if I don't even know myself? This is how I act with my friends - emotionless, uncaring, etc. I want them to have fun, and I want to have fun with them, but I feel like I can't. I don't want to drag them down. 

I'm constantly on edge. Even now, I'm frantically clicking my mouse while thinking of what to write. I shake my leg, tap things, bite my lip, grind my teeth, pick my nails, etc. It never stops and I can't relax. Everything is so loud. 

I feel like this one is important, so embarrassingly I need to mention it. I'm hypersexual and absolutely addicted to adult content. I surround myself with it. I don't know why. Filling a void? Yet another form of escapism? I don't know, but it has a pretty firm grasp on me, and has for most of my adult life.

I'm out of shape and unhealthy. I'm not wildly overweight or anything, but I've been sedentary for my entire adult life and eat like shit. I can feel it catching up to me. It scares me. 

I'm a perfectionist. Nothing I do will ever be good enough. I'll probably reread this post fifty times before finally submitting it, terrified that there might be a mistake - terrified that something might be unclear. 

I feel like a child - like I stopped growing after high school. It terrifies me that I could be 30 years old and be in the same place. Thirty. That's only 3 years away and I haven't even started to become an adult yet. I understand that life isn't a race, but that's just unacceptable. I'm beyond the definition of late bloomer. 

I feel like there are multiple versions of me. A very \*very\* rare ""normal"" version of me, where I can manage to schedule an appointment that I should've scheduled for myself months prior. A me that can get my coursework done in a reasonable manner. Then there's this escapist me, ignoring all of life's demands and drowning them out with video games, YouTube, talking to friends - anything that takes my mind off of life. Finally there's this reclusive version of me that drowns out not only life's demands, but even family and my own friends. I'm scared of this one, and currently dealing with it. I won't eat. I'll sleep all day and night. I'll spontaneously cry. I can't even stomach playing video games or listening to music. It makes me physically weak. My arms shake and my legs tremble. 

Depression killed my aspirations. I used to love drawing, and was great at it. I have a natural talent for it. I wanted to be a digital artist and do digital 3D modeling. I had goals but no drive to succeed in them, no motivation to practice and build a portfolio. Instead I played games, ignored my surroundings, watched time pass by. I don't even know what I'm going to do once I finish this second degree. I have no plan, no dreams, no goals, nothing. 

How did this even happen? Military family? Lack of discipline? Is it my fault? We moved a lot - been to many schools. Had to make new friends repeatedly, making less each time, depression gripping a little more each time. Parents never gave me chores, never grounded or punished me, never taught me discipline. Coupled with my lifelong, growing depression, maybe that's why? I wish I knew. 

There's so much more that I could mention. I could make this post ten times longer if I wanted to, but I'll cut it here. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't expect a solution or some sort of miracle fix. I know life is going to be difficult for me. I guess I'm just venting, but if you read through everything, thanks for listening. I really do appreciate it.

1592,twilightramblings,1547548462,1,"My psychiatrist diagnosed me as ADHD (which I self-dx'd and sought help for), Bipolar III (cyclothemia?) and ""a little OCD"" and ""some symptoms of Generalised Anxiety"". I'm sure the quote marks give it away but I disagree with the OCD and Generalised Anxiety parts of the diagnosis. 

My psychiatrist seems to not understand ADHD and it's symptoms and I think this is why he has labelled me as OCD and anxious rather than realising it falls under my ADHD diagnosis. I have had to explain the reason I self-medicated with coffee and energy drinks before being diagnosed and he blatantly ignores the symptoms of my ADHD when he does a check-in, only asking about my ""anxiety"" and whether I'm feeling depressed or manic. I have to offer the information that I'm being able to organise things better now that I'm on meds, or focus better, or control my emotions better. He doesn't ask about any of these in order to gauge whether my medication is working properly. He also seems to be against me being on stimulants, saying that I had to try Staterra before being prescribed the Dexedrine I had successfully been on before. 

What he has interpreted as anxiety or OCD compulsions is what I'm describing as hyperfixation, aka my ADHD brain attaches to something like a dog with an old bone and I can't redirect my thoughts from it. This can be about a positive thing, like knowledge I need for work or school, a new video game or a new hobby; it can also manifest in a negative way by making it extremely hard to put aside what start out as a reasonable concerns or indecision. Medicating my ADHD has given me more control over these and I find it much easier to redirect now. 

In the past, this inability to redirect did lead to a few panic attacks. Possibly about 10 in as many years, though at least three were caused by a negative reaction to the preservatives in alcohol. I have self-harmed in the past, though even before I went onto mood stabilisers I was working on reducing it through DBT. Now that I'm stabilised, it's been years since I have. 

I have consulted the DSM-V criteria for both Generalised Anxiety and OCD and I've also spoken to my friends who suffer from these conditions and my experience is nothing like their own. I also don't meet the DSM criteria, which my psychiatrist never consulted while diagnosing me. I feel it's not possible to be ""a little OCD"", just like it's not possible to be ""a little ADHD"" or ""a little autistic"". You either are or you aren't. I fully intend on bringing my disagreement with his diagnosis to his attention now that I've been able to actually read the criteria. For reference, any anxiety symptoms I have shown have been situational; I do not have a general feeling of dread, I do not fear that something's bad going to happen in general or to a person if I don't fulfil some unrelated criteria etc.

**TL;DR My psychiatrist diagnosed me as ""a little OCD"" and ""showing symptoms of Generalised Anxiety"" without consulting the DSM criteria because he is misinterpreting my ADHD hyperfixation as compulsions. ELI5 the difference between hyperfixation/special interests and OCD compulsions/Generalised Anxiety so I can best word my disagreement?**",mentalhealth,Can you help me explain to my psychiatrist the difference between ADHD hyperfixation and OCD or anxiety?,2019-01-15 21:34:22

the more and more signs i have pop up, the more it reminds me that I can't get the help i need. My parents refuse to take me to a therapist, even if I've been pleading for a while now. They're just used to being around ill people and leave help to the last minute, and that really sucks. 

When i started logging my blackouts, and had a really freaky experience with what i think is some sort of other personality talking to me via computer, my first thought was that i was malingering. But that doesn't make sense, i sure as hell don't want my people in my personal life to know this. 

Whether this is DID or not, i really don't know. DID is trauma based, i don't think i have any traumas? And if something did happen to me, i don't have any proof, nor would i want to falsely accuse someone, i really despise those who purposely pin horrible things onto people.

When i was a kid, i used to wear multiple pairs of bras and panties, in fact, i started wearing bras when i was 8 years old. the most i think i'd have on would be about 6 or maybe seven, it was like my own chastity belt. My mother never really knew why i did that, i don't even know why.  

I don't know, I've been thinking about that alot lately.

I can't see a thearapist, and i'd rather not have people on Reddit diagnose me, so i'll just have to do alot of the dirty work by myself. I have been talking to online counsellors, but they don't really help much with stuff like this, I'm considering telling my boyfriend, he know's a little about whats been going on, but nothing about me talking to ""myself"", i don't know if it'll be too much on him.

Week 8 had a bit of crying, though. I am quoting the weeks here because I read that the estimated length of a phase is 13 weeks. By week 9, her irritability had mellowed out and she has been seeking alternative treatments. For one, her TCM cocktail routine (which are for the slew of things/problems she faces, like phantom pains in heel, in chest, like congestion, etc. many of which are psychological). And for another, being overly reliant on YouTuber new age advice about her life. I cannot be certain, but she has been taking more water and going to the loo more often, which I briefly took as a hopeful sign that she has been on some form of mood stabilizers, maybe lithium. If anything, I think someone in her family should mix stabilizers into her TCM concoction, knowing how stubborn she is to even admit her condition or seek legit help, other than YouTuber advice which are continuing to feed her delusions.

She harbors several strange metaphysical theories which she shares with me, that was when we were closer. Today I saw her behaving strangely (this to do with sun energy and vibes) and bam! I instantly knew her thoughts and have an explanation. She noticed my presence and attempted to behave normally but I just feel like telling her to forget the act and just be herself. I know what she's thinking, she can't hide much more from me.

I like to think that I lost a friendship and I should feel sorry towards myself but I don't. I see the way her bipolar condition is deeply affecting every part of her life, coupled with her stubbornness, her avoidance of social interactions toward anyone, her pained acting to put up a front that everything is ok. But to us people who care for her, we know better. I see how much sorry of a state she is in and I can no longer just think of myself. Her dreams and aspirations crushed two-fold because for one, her condition is deeply affecting her life, and for another, her work is too much to clear and she can hardly even go for 3-hour night classes to improve herself. There is no way she can even achieve her dreams (which she shared with me) at this rate. It is crippling her. Her face today was more blank than usual. Creepy and disturbing too. I really wish it does not be this way and there can be some form of improvement. But the thing is to wait for the phase to end, right? 4 more weeks. Time does not heal, it just evolves the progression.

I had been dealing with depression since I was 14 and I finally went out and found a great doctor who gave me the things I needed to cope and understand what was causing my depression and anxiety.  But tonight, I had a series of bad things happen and I finally broke down and fell back into some bad habits.  I haven't been to my doctor in a long time because after I started feeling okay I just stopped scheduling appointments.  Is that normal?

I feel there is so much more wrong with me because my head is just a big jumble of thoughts. Constantly i have suicidal thoughts (which my parents and doctor knows about) but they think it has decreased a little bit and honestly they have but now they are back more often. The suicidal thoughts yeah suck but i wont give into them  because i cannot hurt my family like that and i am too scared to go through with it. I feel like in the future i will though. Like just say whatever and let go. Im turning 18 this year and that makes everything worse. Past that i feel so messed up i DO NOT know myself enough to explain myself. My mind is like always screaming at me i can never focus on anything because im trapped in my head. I never try anymore in school well i have good grades in all but one class but still i cant escape my mind. I can be fine one minute and for no reason want to die or have terrible anxiety. I feel as if i am not connected with the world. Like one time i was walking with my friends in school and i was so deep in my head i forgot where i was. I always feel as if i was someone else for a second and then back to like feeling again. Now i want to admit myself to a psychiatric hospital but i just cant have my parents worry more than they do and also the cost. I also need a therapist but i feel since my parents found like nobody that covered their insurance that they gave up. They ask me randomly if i think i still need to talk to someone and each time i say yes. Because i really do.

They have actually gotten so worried that they are now writing my therapist letters to essentially tell him how bad it seems from the outside. I got angry at myself because instead of going out and telling them that they don't need to do this or that I'm ok I let them help me. Now I know that sounds kind of weird but allow me to explain that in the past when people have tried to help me it always ends up bad because to be honest I don't really want help. I want people to talk to but I don't really want a solution so I decided a long time ago instead of burdening my friends with my unproductive sadness I would just talk to a professional.

1626,worldlyExit,1547519656,1,"Short version: Overcame my fear of intimacy and asked and got a first date but later on got rejected but still proud of myself.  
  
Long version: quick background; for the first ten years of my life i grew up in a messed up abusive environment. Like when I cried the people who watched over me would stick a kitchen tongue in my mouth and threaten to cut off my tongue to get me to stop crying. Beatings and other punishments were daily. Fast forward, second decade of my life there was no physical abuse and i was just pretty much left alone as long as I did well in school, although I developed severe depression for all of high school and came really close ending it a few times. As a result I had almost no friends in high school and I was even too anxious to appear in public. Now that I'm on my own in college I've finally made some really good friends, for the first time in my life, with whom i've even managed to discuss my probs and in addition the college psychiatrist prescribed me paxil so that’s been helping.  
  
So eventually I developed feelings for this really nice shy girl, and slowly over few months time i've built up the courage to ask her out. I lost weight and I'd wake up nauseous and vomit soon after and go to bed with a migraine every other day because of the stress, so it wasn’t an easy experience. Initially I couldn't even approach her, but eventually I asked her out and we had a date that I believe went well. Unfortunately later on she told me she didn't wish to lead me on and that she'd prefer us to just be friends. I took it well because I was kinda proud that I got that far. Also i feel that I played my cards as best as I can in my situation, so yeah. We’re still friends to this day, and I guess I still have feelings for her, but i'm gonna respect her decision and not pursue her romantically. Since then I've asked a few others out and also got rejected but I am not at all upset about that. I guess right now im slightly worried about whether I'll ever find anyone who I would like as much, since because of her I managed to overcome my fear. But we'll see. Worst comes to worst, if I spend my life alone at least I'll be able to say I tried.

When i was younger (idk when) i was diagnosed with adhd.. severe adhd.. i was prescribed a low dose adhd medicine and eventually moved up to adderall. I remember when i first started taking adderall.. and honestly i can't remember 8+ years of my life after that because the adderall had brainwashed me to a point of, i wasn't who i wanted to be, i was what the adderall made me… a fucking creature. Fast Forward to 7-8th grade i had stopped taking them bc real they were to expensive and honestly didn't do much for my adhd other than make me brain dead.i had gained a lot of weight and am still overweight because of the sudden stop of taking the pills i had put on almost 100 lbs by freshman year. being ultimately controlled by adderall most of my life and it caused me to isolate myself from friends and family so its all i knew… to be honest all i can remember. I never did well in school bc of my lack of attention, so my parents were always angry with me, so my mom specifically began almost hating me because i’m not like my brother (straight A’s kid) shed always belittle me and unfortunately still does to this day but i've been able to just accept it, my father never belittled he was honestly the only person who ever stood up for me even tho he only did it very rarely he still wss the only one. Moving to within the last 4 years… i graduated highschool in 2016… im 21 now (its 2019). I feel have begun noticing the more or less feelings of being mentally and emotionally abused … (i am by no way saying i have it hard or saying i have it harder than anyone else this is just my story) i pretty much don't trust anything i do, i have had such a mind set of “ your a fucking failure so do what you do best” beaten into my mind i feel as tho i can't escape that feeling, constantly crushing my fucking chest to the point i have developed panic attacks, i have constant mental breakdowns and have even considered suicide many times, (no i am in no way saying i am going to commit suicide but it was a thought at one point) here's where things get a little weird for me i have considered going to a psychiatrist but if i'm being honest…. Iv never told a single person about the way i feel… none i've never even spoken the words of how i feel out loud … i'm really good at hiding my feelings at times i feel to good 

Iv always been horrified at the idea of suddenly not being what everyone thought i was i always played the guy who laughs everything off and can usually take a punch of criticism. So to suddenly be broken down scares me and i don't know why. Not even my parents know how i feel. The only person i have ever come close to speaking with about my feeling was my ex girlfriend even then only mentioned a little of how i feel and even only that over text.. something in me just feels as tho it wants nothing and everything to change at once and i guess i'm making this as kind of a sort of … hello this is the real me and i'm sorry i hid this for so long but i just can't seem to hide it anymore i don't know what to do now…

The meds I'm on are good, they don't make me feel void of emotion of zombie-like or anything, but if I ever forget to take them for a few days I get extremely overemotional and it shows.  I'll sob at songs that make me feel nostalgic, or movie and TV scenes with any hint of emotion in them.  It's like I feel everything amplified to a million percent.

On the one hand it sucks because it makes me very oversensitive and that in turn makes me testy and I've gotten into some bad situations with friends because of it.  On the other hand...it's nice just to ***feel*** things so deeply sometimes, to be really profoundly emotionally impacted by things.

I haven't been on medications since I was ~16, because the ones I was on were messing me up *big time*. An antidepressant I was on had such a bad reaction that I have a two-week blank spot in my memory. Apparently I did little more than sleep that whole time.

Anyway, so the current struggle right now is that my depression is kind of ruling my life. The anxiety more or less faded away and only really flares back up in places with a lot of people.

I'm *incredibly* stressed out, though. It's been so bad I.. I guess you can say attempted(?) suicide back in September. I was going to jump off an overpass but decided against it after a brief mental breakdown. I don't know if that falls more under 'attempt' or 'choosing not to follow through'.

Anyway.

I'm unemployed, which is a huge factor of my stress. I haven't been able to get a job since I got my GED, which was a bit over 2 years ago now. I had one, but I had such a massive anxiety attack on my first day that I quit by lunch time. That was back in July. It's been nothing since, not for my lack of trying.

So, I figured I'd kind of lay low and work on myself before I throw myself back out there again. Maybe fixing some other issues, or at least patching them up in a decent fashion, will boost my confidence enough to help me land a decent job, y'know? So I'm trying to work out and get myself in shape, get my driver's license, that kinda thing.

But my grandma doesn't really understand that, no matter how many times I lay it out. I've told her about my problems, and how my issues work. Many times.

I learned that she thinks I've been faking it all this whole time, as some long-con plot to be a freeloader for the rest of my life. It frustrates me, quite a bit. It's like she never listened to anything I said, like my fucking dad.

Also I’m 13

ok where the fuck do I even start? 
I’ll just do some explanation and some point form.

•when I was little I made these imaginary friends. Now it’s like they never go away, I feel like people are here constantly. I even feel uncomfortable while using the bathroom because of it.
I know that aren’t their but I constantly feel a presence around me. I think I’m going crazy.....

•I’m stressed about everything. I haven’t done any work at school in like 3 weeks. I constantly just tell myself that I can’t do it.

• Kicked doctor at 4


•Called mom a bitch and cunt at 5

•I’m depressed, I can’t sleep, I dread the next day, I cry every second night.

•I’m obsessed with how I look, I feel like I’m ugly and horrible. I beat myself up constantly for being so skinny. I want to gain weight but I can’t and it’s fucking torturing me.

•I’m jealous of everyone I see, I’m jealous of my friends, I’m jealous of my mom.  I was never like this before

•I did horrible things as a child such as kicking doctors and calling my mom horrible names at 7 years old.

•I did fucked up things with my toys as a little kid. I would make my stuffys “fight to the death” and “mate” or even “rape each other” I was obsessed with sexual things involving animals at 7 years old as well. (IM NOT ANYMORE) but my friend was too so I thought it was normal. I am an animal lover and can’t see myself doing this. 


• I use different personalities in every situation to benefit myself. And I mean completely fucking different person between school, home, and different friends/teachers.

•I use charm and “becoming friends” with certain people who I want on my good side to benefit me in the future.

•I suffered horrible night terrors when I was younger to the point where the second I closed my eyes I was dying or seeing someone smothering my pet cat with a pillow.

•I make up strategic plans on how I would kill or harm someone. I HAVE NO INTENTIONS ON ACTUALLY DOING IT

•I take no responsibility for anything and will attempt to lie my way out of anything and everything.

•no matter what I do to someone I still make up reasons that I’m better than them.

• I used to constantly study others at school and mimic what they do to fit in.
Now I’ve basically trained my brain to know how to act when I walk in to the schoolyard

•I’m constantly looking for ways to get blackmail and revenge on people 

•I use people’s emotions and strong feelings against them when I’m angry

•I have no guilt after doing anything to anyone, Most of the time it’s their fault. Even if I started it.

•I don’t learn much of anything from my actions. I’ll do the same thing to people 10 times before I even start to learn shit.

•consequences don’t effect or deter me.  I honestly couldn’t care less if you keep me indoors for recess and don’t let me see my friends. And if I’m given detention I will just find something to do. I get upset when given the consequences but once they are happening I don’t give a shit.

•I go on violent screaming crying rages 
And have week long mental breakdowns 

•I pretend to like people to get better grades. Including teachers, I study how the good kids act towards the teachers so I can learn to do it myself.

•I try to find ways to pursuade or manipulate teachers in to giving me better grades,Even blaming them.

•I try to make myself cry and breakdown by torturing myself with sad music.

•I have no excitement for things like Christmas.  Even though I’m only 13.

•I tell myself that I’m lying about my mental issues and exaggerating it.

• I stare off in to space all the time 

•I can’t focus anymore on anything for long periods of time

• I lose all motivation for everything and just want to sleep all day.


The last thing is hard to describe. I basically turn certain emotions on when I go to school and then turn them off when i go home. At home I have this feeling of no emotions and extreme sadness and anger. Sometimes I experience what feels like no emotions at all. While at school I’m laughing and generally experience very strong emotions.


And I know I just sound like an asshole but I need help. I’m seriously begging someone to help me. My family doctor has laughed at me before so I don’t feel comfortable speaking to her. My school counsellor will tell my mom and teachers behind my back (everyone I know who has seen her in 3 different schools has experienced this) she also twists things to make us all seem suicidal or something.

1635,ShittyMemes2305,1547511097,1," there's only one thing that makes me cry. For some time now i've been afraid of not finding love, i feel like nobody loves me. I get filled with sadness and anger just thinking that people chose looks and not the personality, i began wondering if it's worth living a life where i feel that nobody loves me. But i was a bit more complicated i didn't want anybody i didn't want some girl with a face full of makeup, i wanted someone who would be funny, be silly, act like a human with emotions. Basically someone who would not pretend to be someone they're not. And eventually i got afraid that people like that don't exist, well at least not in this shithole i live in. That fear developed in to depression. Maybe it's an effect of my parents always wanting me to marry and have children. But i grew sadder and sadder, eventually suicidal thought entered my brain, and everyday i wanted to meet that perfect someone. I am not a man of looks, but i am also not a man looking for looks like i said i wanted someone who wouldn't hide their emotions someone kind and pure. I cried, and cried, still wondering if this life is worth living. But while crying i look in the mirror, i see what i was doing just by thinking about suicide i was kiling myself very slowly. But that day in the mirror i saw myself and finally realised what i've done i've become the exact opposite of the person i want to meet, i became sad i didn't want to go out. It was truly hell. Then i started to i guess care more about myself. And what i thought about while looking at myself is if i completly lose hope and commit suicide, and the person i am looking for truly exists that i wouldn't get to meet her. IF i killed myself i couldn't meet anyone especially  not the person i imagined. So for my entire search for love the thing that kept me going was the thought that if i killed myself i would never get to meet that special person. 

 If you feel like crying, cry then take a good long look in the mirror think about why you're crying how you can fix it and if it's something you can't change how you can forget about it or make it just a little better. Imagine it as talking to a friend who's sad what you would tell them then all of the things you think of or say, you have to do, you have to succed because staying determined and having hope is what keeps you going and when you keep going nothing can hold you back. Stay strong never think that emotions are weak. Sometimes it's the emotions of other is the thing that makes us feel emotions. Never give up hope and most importantly never give up on life.﻿ ",mentalhealth,My experience with developing and dealing with depression,2019-01-15 11:11:37

Has anyone had any experiences they could share regarding this? Any professional opinions out there? (I've of course talked with my doc but I just wanted to get some other opinions).

Also, I wanted to ask if anyone else is a fairly standard social drinker and see how they were able completely stop drinking while taking Celexa or if they were able to have a beer or two with no issues, as I've heard that even drinking a little bit while on Celexa can prove to have terrible, if not fatal, side effects. (I'm okay to not drink at all while taking, just curious though because I am in the process of starting a home brewing hobby and this would obviously affect this) Not sure if this is against the rules to discuss and I apologize if so.

Thanks in advance!

1644,iamhoneycomb,1547504941,1,"Hi all, just wondering if anyone here can relate to this experience.

I suffer from depression, and recently it has got a lot worse. So now, I'm finding that in social situations, because I'm so zoned out, and my mind is so blank, I have to force out conversation (because ironically it's less tiring than being honest all the time and saying you're depressed and don't give a f\*ck). So as a result, the things I say are often quite misjudged or feel inauthentic, because really I'm just saying things that come to me, rather than really processing things and having any real feelings or thoughts about it (because I really just don't care to, and/or I'm not feeling anything anyway).

And not only does it feel inauthentic to me, but I'm quite sure the people I'm talking with sense it too, even if they don't realise or understand the reason. I can just tell by the looks on their faces/their subsequent silence that they don't know what to say to, or make of, what I've said. This just makes me feel worse - especially because I know I'm not really like this when I'm feeling mentally well, and I would much rather they see me like that before making any judgements of me. Because I'm a much more self-assured and socially savvy person to be around when I'm not depressed, and perhaps even fun and engaging too (so I'd like to think).

As a result of these changes, I get this huge feeling of my identity shifting when I change between the two states of depressed and not depressed, or at least in the way other people see me.

I'm a final year undergrad, and when I was home from uni for Christmas and just with my family, I was free to be me, but now I'm back and having to share company with those who may not understand, it's a totally different ball game. And it just really sucks.

Has anyone else found a similar issue with depression to this? And if so, how do you deal with it?

Anyway, thanks in advance, and for reading if you got this far. Hope that all made at least some sense.",mentalhealth,Anyone find that depression makes you inept in social situations?,2019-01-15 09:29:01

One of my best friends died in a car wreck a year ago and it barely affected me. I do feel bad, but it's equivalent to if I were to read that someone died in the paper.

&amp;#x200B;

Less than three months ago, a friend of mine was assaulted by a federal park ranger after being pulled over for a routine traffic stop. We fell out of touch around that time, and I figured things just came up and she was going on with her life. I'm just finding out now that this is the reason why she became distant during this time. She was hospitalized after the incident and was kept there for nearly 6 weeks. I'm trying to get more details about what she was treated for and if it was her intention to seek further treatment, or if this was done for her safety or for psychological reasons. She said she was 'committed' so I'm assuming that means she was brought in and kept there beyond her control. She also claims the hospital attempted to cover up the assault and they did nothing to document any physical bruising or injuries. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know how to ask her about these things or even how to help without having her revisit the trauma of being assaulted. Is there somewhere she can go, some public resource that can help her through this process? She doesn't trust the hospital, I'm not sure she has too many close friends or family in the area, and I'm honestly worried about her dealing with this on her own. I suggested the possibility of going through local law enforcement, but still, that's a lot for her to handle right now. Please help and thanks so much in advance for any thoughts or advice...

I wake up feeling more confident and comfortable. I don’t feel so unstable and on edge. I can talk to myself more compassionately after something like 7 straight days of completely berating myself for being who I am.

I’m just in a little bit of a better place and it feels really good to get that all out of the way, like I had to shed this skin of shame I was wearing and start to realize how much contempt I held for myself and the way I was acting, reacting, and refusing to take action in the places I needed to. I no longer look at this period of time like I needed to play the martyr. Now, I see that the goodness in me has been fighting with my inner chaos and is disappointed in how much I let that chaos consume and rule me. 

I liken this to giving up cigarettes. It was so uncomfortable at first, really unbearable and made me feel like I was going to be a monster to everyone around me. Now, the gunk is coming up but I can call it what it is. I needed to put down the habit and stop lighting up my own negativity. No longer a depression junkie.

So yeah, as the title suggests I've been repeating the same thing in my head over and over. It started maybe a year ago and it's not voluntary. It just pops into my head every so often. Its driving me insane. I have to listen to calming music at night and take sleeping pills (prescribed) to get to sleep so I'm not thinking about it. 
I also hallucinate at night. Very vivid where I need to get out of bed to prove to myself it's not real. 

It started as me thinking *my name* has collapsed. Just popping into my head and said in the 3rd person like it's someone else saying it to someone. This continued for about the last year but now the phrase has changed and it's proper concerning me. 
It's now changed the past few weeks to *my name's* hung herself.

I've already been to the doctor who sent me to a CPN. They only concentrated on my confidence...... I have no problem with confidence.

I come across as a hard working confident person. So saying my confidence needs boosting is a joke.

1654,kaay_laa,1547494130,1,"I  have diagnosed depression, anxiety and adhd. All of which I take medications for daily. I try not to take ativan and the vyvanse if I can help it, just because I don’t like to heavily rely on the drugs. But if ever I stop taking them all together, I just cry constantly. 
The medications do help in some sense but they don’t get rid of the overwhelming ache that I am unfulfilled with myself. 

I have taken legitimate actions to improve my quality of life, mental health, etc. For example:
-I was in a shit relationship so I broke it off and after years I was able to forgive myself and forget him. 
-I didn’t enjoy my job, I kept getting panic attacks from the stress. So I went back to school. Finished school. I now work in a dental office as a receptionist. Been there for almost a year now. 
-I used to have a lot of family drama and I have learned to distance myself from the toxicity of it all without feeling too guilty or responsible for my families state of being. 

My problem is: 
-The people at work seem like they mean well, but I feel like I’m stuck in a box whenever I’m there. Especially since my boss never gives me the chance to prove I’m worthy. When I try to take initiative I end up getting on her nerves because I apparently did something she has to ‘fix.’ So she actually just takes over and doesn’t teach me any new things. Her being a very passive aggressive manager makes me crumble and feel like a complete idiot.
-Even when I’m not at work though, I feel like garbage anyways. I overthink and over analyze, I feel every emotion to the extreme, but then I worry it’s just me being crazy and paranoid and over sensitive. 
-My home life is comfortable. My boyfriend and I have been together over 2 years. We have an awesome dog 7 months old. We have a cozy main floor home with garage and yard and day-to-day we just live life. 

Overall I have no real reason to be sad. 
I have nightmares whenever I sleep. I wake up and I don’t remember them but feel too emotionally crippled to move. So I am usually late for work.

I do my best to keep the house tidy. To eat healthy and eat enough. To be open with my boyfriend about how I feel day to day. To show others I care about them and to not space out and sink into my own issues. 

But after all that I really just don’t want to exist. Even after reinventing myself, upgrading my quality of life,  work environment, relationship, etc. It sounds so dramatic but I just don’t see anything ever feeling consistently good because I’ve never been able to feel fulfilled. 

I have felt this way since I can remember. It’s just developed into something that I have been slightly more able to cope with and put into words. But probably since I was 14 at least. Sometimes I honestly think I’m just making it up and over reacting. It’s like I can be happy and some days I am. But overall I just tingle with insecurity and lack of motivation. 

I am not looking for pity or criticism. I’m just curious...

1656,tinavons,1547490842,1," So, I went to the therapist today for the first time. I was nervous enough because things I haven’t experienced before put me in a really really stressful situation. 

A little backstory: for the past few years I’ve been experiencing little to no motivation for work and study, which made me fail the same class for three years. I want to succeed and even if I do sit down and try to study, my mind wanders off in about 5-10 minutes. The same concentration levels are seen when I work or even when I work on something I consider my hobby. Not to mention my hobbies change every two weeks because of the switch of interest. I sleep a lot, am always tired and most importantly I can’t get up in the morning no matter where I put my alarm clock. There are some shaking and heavy breathing occurring in new and social situations, but long story short, based on my extensive googling over the past few years if I may say so, I figured I should go see a therapist for potential diagnosis of ADD or depression as I thought I was showing some signs. Long story short, I thought I had problems and sought help. 

I wrote a forum like counseling site here in our country and got an answer from some therapist and he said I should message him and we could do it in person. Of course, we made the appointment for yesterday and without extensive story concluded I am grossly lazy and that he would disown me if I was his daughter. He also mentioned that it’s my own life and I should chase the goals I have, even after I told him I don’t have any goals in the long term as I don’t see myself living past 30. He added that it’s my life and if I want to commit suicide, it’s me who makes a decision. As I am a really sensitive person and cry a lot in my average day (and am trying to solve that as well), I started crying to which he commented I should suck it up and save my tears for sad opportunities.

Now I am wondering if every first visit is like that? I do have an appointment next week, but I am already dreading to go and have cried the whole day yesterday. Is this the ‘harsh’ reality I have to face with therapy or will I feel better if I go for a few times and/or will I toughen up? I am really considering canceling, but I know/hope this could help me in the long term, I am just in doubts how?

1658,throwawayadvice102,1547489027,1,"Since about summer 2017 after experiencing severe marijuana withdrawals, I developed a bad case of anxiety that manifested partly through obsessive thoughts and compulsions.

Off and on since then I have experienced obsessions around being physically attacked, being punched, people picking fights with me, or me doing those things to other people. At its worst, this obsession, which involves multiple scenarios and thoughts (although usually the same handful or very similar in nature) will consume my entire waking day and lasting for weeks. In the past three months or so I have been unable to figure it out or get out of it.

This cycle has been taking place for roughly 85 - 90% of the last three months.

Prior to that I experienced constant OCD over a relationship that lasted two months over summer 2018.

I want to think this is fighting OCD and not indicitive that I am going to find myself in a real life situation involving a physical altercation. At times I find myself fighting (in my mind) the content of the obsession, which of course means trying to stop the people who may want to attack me, be aggressive, etc. I'm unsure if I'm genuinely upset over aggressive people and want to stop them, or I am mistaking struggling against the obsessions (which are laced with extreme anxiety and feel real) with trying to stop the thoughts themselves regardless of the content.

I am almost certain this is OCD, I guess I just want certainty before finally overcoming it through exposure and response prevention (ERP). Can OCD manifest in this form?

I feel so many number of things about this. For the most part, I am almost certain this is OCD. It is always accompanied by extreme anxiety. I am unable to control it. When it happens my brain feels locked up on it as is characteristic of OCD. It causes brain fog. I feel mild guilt and shame from getting caught up in an episode.

1659,CantSeeShit,1547488768,1,"So back in November I checked into a mental health crisis center for persistant suicidal thoughts. Was suffering with them for a few years but from August-September. Then in October on a vacation I got raped by someone I thought I trusted and considered a friend and when I got back to work, the suicidal thoughts got scary to the point where I was scared I'd actually follow through with the thoughts. They were so bad that I was having depressive breakdowns almost daily and fucking up my job. I'm a mechanic so concentration is key as I deal with people's safety.

So I call the suicide hotline and they tell me to check out this health crisis center so I go immediately. After an assessment they find out I'm bipolar which made a lot sense. So after I find out I'm ready to tackle this diagnosis and get into treatment while I'm still working and I was good for a few days but after that, it jsut got worse. The depressive breakdowns were happening nearly everyday and I was making mistakes at work that could compromise people's safety which I never would want to happen. I decided to do what everyone would encourage and take my mental health seriously so I put in a medical leave and checked myself into an outpatient facility.

The treatment was great and I'm discharged now as of Friday and made amazing improvements to my life. The suicidal thoughts are gone, I cleaned up a lot of mental stress and no longer feel worthless, and I got sober from drugs and alcohol and am 15 days clean, and I even hit the gym everyday. My parents are insanely proud of me and I have a whole new relationship with them and my friends are also just as proud. Everyone in my life for once is talking about how great I'm doing and have been a constant source of encouragement. I feel like a new man, it's amazing. While I still have some obstacles and stresses Ih my life I now have the mental capacity to finally take action on them especially now that I'm sober. My dreams in life are actually a possibility now.

That said my job is making it very difficult to come back and it's really shitty and it's almost making me question if I should have taken this step in my life. I hate it so much, I finally wake up and become an adult and do what I think is the right thing but now I'm being thrown into a state of regret. I feel so great right now as a person and am so proud of myself.

I don't get society. Everyone tells you how much you need to take your mental health seriously and that people will be supportive of you but as soon as you do, then everything changes and you become a risk. It's really fucked up. My work is asking for paperwork the facility cannot provide and refuses to talk to the facility while telling me they can't wait for me to come back.

Its so shitty because if I try and find a new job I'll lose my insurance, my fmla benefits, and possibly need to make a career change which would devastate me since I finally found a career I enjoy with every ounce of me.

1664,nikschled,1547486219,1,"I am a 29 year old female who has struggled my entire life with figuring out what is ""wrong"" with me. I changed my career path and have a masters in psychology and I still don't comprehend what is going on inside my brain. I feel as though I have some sort of a personality disorder or am possibly bipolar. I go through phases of ""manic"" episodes, I think. These times consist of sudden urges to start a big project or spend money. I will reorganize during these times. It's impossible for me to sit down or relax. Then the OCD kicks in. This is every day and really confuses me. Certain things set me off. For example, backtracking or retracing my steps. If I drive to point A and have to go out of my way to go to point B I am very uncomfortable and it makes me very anxious. If my husband (or myself) forget something and we have to go back home before going to our destination the same feeling occurs. Certain sounds are my triggers as well. I cannot stand when pots or pans, what have you, are pushed around and noisy in a cabinet. Loudness.  


I believe that I have delusions of grandeur. For example.. sometimes I feel as though I become characters in TV/Movies I am watching. Not that I am them but just almost imagine to an uncomfortable point like I have their life. In the same token, I am painfully nice and put myself in situations that are extremely uncomfortable to me just to avoid conflict/be liked by people.  


I have sought professional help twice. Neither psychiatrist felt as though my issues were fit into a category and did not feel comfortable making a diagnosis.  


My point is: my mania is a serious issue. I am incredibly responsible/ able to manage money but in the same token, during my episodes I have put my husband and I in $20K worth of credit card debt. This is over the span of the 10 years that we've been together. Yet I am a money hoarder and save save save. We have $10K sitting in a savings account saved for putting an addition on our house.

1669,Stupefyer,1547484890,1,"I’ll try to make this short and sweet but for the past 6 months I feel like I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety. I promised myself for 2019 that I would take better care of myself mentally and seek help. 

Anyways, a little background about myself....I’m 24 years old and currently serving active duty in the military as well as going to school. I have lived a perfectly normal life and never had any encounters with depression or anxiety til recently. In fact, growing up my parents raised me with the “suck it up” mentality and to be honest I never really believed depression or anxiety was a real thing. (Yes I know I was very ignorant) I always had a positive outlook on life until recently. 

I know this may sound stupid and make no sense but I honestly feel like I forgot how to have fun and enjoy myself again. My whole life for the past 6 months has been working 5,6 and even 7 days a week on top of going to a university. When I’m at work I feel fine for the most part but the problems seem to become overwhelming when I’m not at work. 

I try so hard to make sure that when I’m off that I don’t think about my job or the military in general but it’s so hard for me. It’s gotten to the point where I feel that I’m doing bad by being off. this alone has caused a bunch of problems in my life. I literally have no desire to go out and have fun besides run errands. It seems like I find more fun in just staying inside my apartment all day than going out and I have no idea why. I feel bad not only for myself but for my wife as well because it’s so hard for me to get out of the house and have fun and do stuff with her. It kills me cause I know she knows I’m going through something but she’s tried again and again to talk to me about my situation but I just have such a hard time talking about it. And then I get frustrated about trying to speak my mind I end up just giving up and just saying I’m fine or nothing wrong with me. 

I have noticed that it has become very difficult for me to focus on my studies. Luckily I was able to past this semester but it took all I had to pass these classes. I know working a lot probably explains this one but I never have any issues with focusing before and it seemed all semester my mind would just be foggy and I could only focus on an assignment or reading for minutes at a time before becoming distracted by something. 

My sleep is almost nonexistent because I wake up and I feel tired all the time. I probably haven’t gotten a good nights sleep in a couple months. I have trouble sleeping almost every night because my mind is just racing with thoughts about work or just life. I’ve had nightmares for the past couple of days just about bad things happening to me and I never really dream to begin with.  Since I’m so tired all the time I have to drink coffee or energy drinks to even function and this has just become a very disastrous cycle. 

I have become a very negative person in the past couple of months. I always expect something bad to happen to me whether it be with my job or just in life in general. When good things start to happen in my life I almost always brush it off cause I expect something bad to happen to me soon. And when something good or exciting happens I tend to question it and always think “why did this happen to me?” Or “what did I do to deserve this?” Etc. 

I have never tried to commit suicide and I don’t think I’d ever let it get that far but I have had thoughts about how life would be so much easier if my life just ended right now. And this is the reason why I’m seeking help. 

I really don’t know why I have gotten to this point in my life. I know I should have reached out sooner but I’ve always been the type of person to deal with my problems internally. It’s also just really hard for me to explain my feelings without it getting confusing.

When I think about the big picture, I really don’t feel like I have any reason to be depressed or have anxiety. I have a beautiful, caring and loving wife, we live in a nice apartment, have a cute cat and I have a stable career. But after looking into depression, there isn’t ever a set reason for someone to be depressed right ? 

After proofreading this thread, I realize how much of a mess I am right now. 

I’m hoping to see a psychiatrist this week and hopefully get some help. 

Any thoughts, suggestions or opinions on my situation are welcomed. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

My family consists of my older sister who is also adopted from Korea (not my bio sister), and my brother who is the middle child who is my parents bio son.

I recently have had a hard time feeling genuinely happy or seeing people being happy. It gives me an unsettling feeling which turns to anger. 

I entertained the possibly of maybe having undiagnosed bipolar disorder.

1674,mcking765,1547476329,1,"I was sexually abused as a child by my cousin. I am 27 now. Male.  
I have kept this a secret from everyone for about 20 years I think. Two weeks ago I told my therapist and at first it was heavy but then it was over I had told someone and then it was cathartic.  
NOW, I am starting to get a little out of control.   
I can't stop reading about the effects, it feels nice to have an explanation for all these weird eccentricities and emotional outbursts. But from focusing on it I am also starting to get near panic attacks.  


In my past a big coping mechanism of mine was dissociation.   
I even went to a single therapy session 5 years ago for a 2 week bout of depersonalization.   
At the same time I also had lots of panic attacks, first bad one I thought was a heart attack.  
I would get panicky and have my mind racing, anxious thoughts, images of violence and terror, resulting in controlled outbursts of destruction and screaming.  
But then it all kind of stopped when I found my career passion. I focused on this and started grad school last year.

  
Now with all the stress of grad school that lingering thought that I was sexually abused kept coming back up.  
I probably would have just pushed it down again like all the years before but my mother who was also abused physically and sexually recently had a nervous breakdown in her 60s because of new memories resurfacing in therapy.   
It was so bad she started self harming, lost weight, she was a shell of a person.   
Fortunately she is a lot better now but it scared me into stepping up and handling my problems now.  


**Why am I making this post?**   
Now with the panic and terror revisiting me with beginning the healing process I need some help and advice.  
I still don't have a very good memory of the event, I believe I dissociated. When this memory returns, if it will, in therapy could it be devastating/incapacitating? Has anyone had this happen, what was it like?

How will the healing process change me? Ironically i've become so comfortable with the chaos and emotional problems that i've grown fond of them. Will they go away? Will I become a normie? ha... fuck. 

Is there any literature on personal stories through the healing process? Also if they are catered towards men that could be nice, in all the literature i've read so far there seems to be some notable differences in therapy and coping skills.

I still don't want to tell anyone else about this, like the gf I live with, is this stupid? It's just that, I need to feel in control of this. It's one of my coping strategies, I need control and I have a hard time trusting in terms of emotional needs like this.

How long did the healing process take? I kinda need to **not** be taking time off in grad school right now... I know it's dumb right but I'm at a very important stage of my schooling and if I could just put off a mental breakdown until summer I'd be safe to have time to breakdown without the compounding anxiety of ""I need to be working on research!""

Also sorry if things I say don’t make sense words get very jumbled in my head and I’m really bad at punctuation.

I am currently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, severe depression and PTSD but haven’t been to a therapist or anything since I was like 14. I’m 21 now.

Basically I am always confused,  nothing in this world seems to make any sense to me, like it will take me an hour to find a bathroom in a restaurant that everyone else can just find in one second. I’ll just walk around like a moron. I don’t understand math at all, like I know some addition, can barely understand money. (Thank god for cards) even though I’ve had countless tutors and tired my absolute hardest. My brain is just like NOPE. I can’t remember anything, like if someone is explaining something to me, no matter how hard I try I will forget it in a matter of minutes and have to write it down. things just don’t stick in my head. I can’t remember my own phone number of zip code, I can’t remember my social security number. And it’s so embarrassing. Basically I am completely unable to work right now unless someone else could work alongside me constantly helping me to remember what to do. It takes me months to memorize something ridiculously simple. Now onto the more emotional side of things, I am extremely paranoid, with horrible delusions that the world isn’t real, people aren’t real, I’m in a coma somewhere and this is all a dream. (Anything my mind can think of to scare the living shit out of me basically) I fly into violent rages, self harm occasionally, binge eat and restrict, I am very suicidal from how much agony this all puts on me. I can’t make eye contact with people, every little sound is horrible to me, like the dial of the world is turned up to 100% I can’t handle lights. I don’t understand how to communicate with other people like everyone else does. I just don’t get it. I have thought of autism but I just don’t feel like that’s what it is besides the sensory part of things maybe. I suffer from severe depersonalization and derealism, (I’m so detached from my mind and body it’s hard to even pick something up because my hand doesn’t look like my own) and my speech is slurred because of how our of sync everything is. I slammed my head into a pole when I was like 6 from not paying attention to what was in front of me on my bike and had my entire face swell up and a concussion. But I’m thinking it may have given me some kind of brain damage they weren’t able to see. I’ve also had numerous ugly falls from years of horseback riding.

I cannot hold down a job. They just never stick. Of my last few jobs one closed down, one stopped giving me shifts after 5 months and another employed me but I never get accepted for shifts I apply to. I constantly worry about money. Today I blew a trial for a new job, despite preparing so hard to do it well.

Relationships are painful. I enjoy being with someone but freak out and worry that I’m doing everything wrong when I am not with them. I try to find the balance between being honest and open but also not being “too much” because I know I have a lot of emotions. I never get it right. Today my boyfriend broke up with me because he thought I’d become too distant, but I thought he wanted space because he had said that I was too emotional and invested in him. Another wrong decision. 

After suffering from undiagnosed chronic illness for 10 years, since I was 12, this last month my health has declined rapidly. Doctors are unsure of what it is and only treat the symptoms. Most of the time the medications don’t work. It is exhausting being constantly unwell and feeling like there’s no way it can be fixed.

I work to my absolute capacity but I’m still bottom of my class. I have no close friends, never have, and all my social initiations fall flat if I try to be proactive.  I am my mum’s main confidant and have to keep secrets from my siblings such as my dad losing his job within the next month. I do my best to be kind to everyone I meet but am constantly screwed over and hurt.

When my depression gets unbearable I can’t help but stay in bed all day. The pressures of life and the world moving on without me make me anxious but I still can’t find the motivation to stay awake some days. I feel like I am letting everyone down.

I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this. It’s been so long since my last win. My heart hurts and feels heavy. I’ve lost interest in anything that used to make me happy. I can’t take any more knock backs or rejections. I’m sick of trying and failing every time.

Earlier tonight I had a panic attack, due to some drama related stress with my ex.

I was hyperventilating and crying, while walking home from work. Then, I started to hear... different voices internally. Talking, and arguing with each other. I'm... having trouble remembering the event. It feels like it was a dream, almost. They were arguing about how to calm ourselves down. One voice was stern, and pragmatic. It was talking with another voice, that was pretty steely, and said ""This is your fault. If you hadn't been driving for the last week we wouldn't be in this situation"" and the steely voice replied ""I know, I know. But, I felt I chose the right path and I still think I did, so you can't really fault me for that.""  


One... part that really stuck out was that whenever... me? The one being told I was currently driving? The conscious, blubbering stuttery mess (I don't normally have a stutter) started to hyperventilate or cry again, a soft voice would pipe up and say ""Its ok little bee, you're ok..."" repeatedly, behind the other voices trying to work out calming us down and getting to the root of our problem. No one has ever called me little bee in my life, let alone myself.  


I finally got home, and got calmed down... while i was making dinner the pragmatic voice was talking with a flippant one that was complaining it felt left out of the conversation. The pragmatic voice said ""Well, yeah, you're the eternal optimist and thats not really relevant right now"", to which the flippant one replied ""Really? You don't think optimism will help right now? Look, its not worth worrying about. What can you really do about it? Worst case scenario, your friends don't like you for a bit. Then its all good again.""  


That's all I remember. As I was writing this, it got sort of easier to remember what happened but its still hazy at best. Was this some stress induced hallucinations? I have been under a lot of it the last few weeks and I sorta just popped... And I can't sleep.  


\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Super stress panic attack walking home, different sounding voices were arguing about calming me down and getting me stable again, while asking me questions.

I spent my teenage years from age 12 taking all the drugs i could find. I had done most drugs including meth by 16. I went to rehab and now i'm a bit better, i've only done hard drugs about 10 or 20 times since rehab. I smoke weed every day and am starting to develop a taste for alcohol. I am a double agent, i work full time for one of the worlds most successful TV production companies (in a production role). Not one of my coworkers would guess that this is my past. I am 20 years old by the way.

Recently i went to Cambodia with my best friend. He nearly died on the first night from inhaling too much dodgy nitrous and smoking opium. The next day i woke up with the most intense anxiety ever. I orchestrated a very early departure from Cambodia as it was not a safe place for either of us. 

I could not stop these ridiculous, irrational thoughts I was having. I saw an article about paedophiles and suddenly I thought ""why would anyone do that to a child? Am I capable of this?"" and i convinced myself that I was. Same thing with the Judge Kavanaugh debacle. I was convinced that the loving, consensual sex that i have had might have been rape and that i was some awful sexual predator who needed to be castrated. I had repeated thoughts of mutilating my genitals and cutting my hands off.

Not once have i ever had a sexually deviant thought about harming or forcing myself upoj children or women and I ALWAYS KNEW THIS WAS TRUE. 

I just couldn't shut off the voice. 

Fast forward four weeks, i'm back at home, an absolute shell of who i once was, unable to leave the house because of the irrational fears that i would be arrested and held to trial for things i had only accused myself of doing in my head. I forced myself to the doctor and he took one look at me, heard my story and said bro, you are having sexual obsessions, you have OCD. Here's some Zoloft. 

I haven't touched it. I want to beat this on my own. 

I have been really quite depressed for the last few years. Everything has failed. School, all the loves of my adolescant life, my relationships with family, my dreams and goals, all gone. Down the toilet like a junkies stash when he hears a siren. I have suicidal thoughts every other day, but my mum means way too much to me. What a fucking cliche I am.

People dont like me. I go out of my way to be really nice to everyone but i just cant seem to make new friends. All the friends i have just expect me to let them smoke weed at my house (yeah i was that kid, my parents were those parents) and never invite me to do normal human shit. 

Can anyone relate? Is there any advice for me? I feel so lost, i have no motivation, my room right now would make the 4chan alltime top ten most absolutely disgusting, im basically laying in my own filth, i'm 99 percent sure i have HIV from a dodgy tinder date in Bali (an actual free.of charge tinder date yes but my dick and my rectum is burning and unpleasant and i am too much of a pussy to go get a test because i am so sure that if i get diagnosed i will just go straight to somewhere high up and very seriously contemplate you know what) i have absolutely fuck all interest in what would be considered by most to be a golden career opportunity handed to me on a silver platter and i generally just cruise through life trying not to hurt anyone and thinking about ways i could be happier, about all my regrets and about what i could have been if i applied myself in school. Fuck i hate myself. 

Can anyone relate? What do i do? Im a desperate pedantic hopeless young man and i am asking you, begging you, pleading with you to help me, please internet stranger, please help.me, and so help me god if you tell me to go and exercise... You think i dont want to do that? You think i dont want muscles? You think its as easy as ""oh im gonna suddenly stary excercising?"" it's not man. I'm constantly at war with my own head. I can't even get myself into the shower some mornings. How in fuck am i supposed to motivate myself to exercise when i cant even motivate myself to clean this utter pigsty of a room that i live in once a day? 

Im sad. Im broken. Im over it. Im sorry i put you through that tragic text wall. If anything i am self aware that i am utterly pathetic, ill give myself that. I hope wherever you are you are happy because sometimes i like to think that someone else somewhere has my happiness because they need it more than i do. And im ok with that idea.

1681,yugertasew,1547466482,1,"I'm 24 and an introvert, so I've always appeared pretty normal albeit very quiet especially in group settings. I've improved a bit since my teenage years but it's still there. I'm likeable because I think I'm what you call a 'nice guy'. A big fear of mine is creating any kind of conflict with people, so I usually never say what I really feel. And I don't really know what I feel because I've suppressed my emotions for so long. So I feel like I have a mask on all the time, but what's under the mask is kind of unknown to even me. I don't know what I really want, and I'm a people pleaser.

 I live at home still along with 5 younger siblings, don't have a job currently and have never had a girlfriend. I'm scared of intimacy for fear of being 'found out' yet I don't even know what exactly there is to find out, except that I know I wouldn't want to date me so who would? My life is a dysfunctional mess, I have addictive and compulsive tendencies and it's like I'll do anything but be productive because my depression and anxiety makes everything feel pointless and hopeless. I pointlessly scroll through my phone, play games, porn (I've realized it's very bad for me, I have internalized shame from it) basically nothing fulfilling except spending time with my family and little siblings. I'm told I'm a great brother, my 6 and 2 year old brothers always want to spend time with me and get more excited to see me than anyone else, even their own dad. He's emotionally distant and keeps to himself completely which I can't understand..its his fucking family. He doesnt try at all like I do.

 I feel like my logical brain is always trying to fight thoughts of insecurity but doubt always wins. I've resorted to escapism in order to get out of my 'uncomfortable in my own skin' type feeling because honestly I hate myself. I can't let go of all my past mistakes because there's just too many of them and I feel like a failure. I started using weed at 21 and life was finally fascinating again; however I abused it and couldn't stop even when I could see myself digging deeper and deeper into a hole. Negative thought loops would run through my mind every day yet I still acted like everything was fine. My family had no idea that I was smoking and feeling like I was losing my mind and I couldn't stop.. it was bad. I was a zombie. I was then introduced to psychedelics and it opened a whole new world to me, I couldn't believe an experience like that was possible and I was hooked. Even though taking them revealed to me how much of an addictive and destructive person I was, it didn't matter because I felt reborn by the end of the trip and I felt like I could finally move on in life. But instead of integrating my revelations and getting helpI always went back to my old habits and was back at square one. My solution? More psychedelics, just so I could temporarily get out of my head and feel inner peace and oneness. It feels like a crime to ignore such powerful experiences, i just could never commit to true change. I've always kept my problems to myself so when I told my dad how fucked up I felt his mind was blown and he couldn't believe it. He thought I was just fine, living at home and doing jack shit with my life. He said he sees me as better than himself because I'm so good at being there for the family. But I barely do anything else and it's so unhealthy. I have an adventure type friend group but I've never been authentic with them, so the relationships feel empty. I haven't had a true close friend since high school.

My family just doesn't talk about real shit. Ever. My mom's solution to everything is Mormonism and I just can't relate, and it kills me to have her see me as her son that 'strayed away' from the church and her only solution in her mind is for me to go back, otherwise I'll never be truly happy. My parents relationship is going downhill fast because they never talk about their feelings with each other, mainly my dad's at fault though. Feels terrible to say but he really only thinks about himself, I've come to realize. And then there's me, constantly overthinking everything and trying to help everyone with their problems. Meanwhile I'm sinking because I don't know how to take care of myself and meet my own needs. That coupled with my addictions and I know my mental health isn't good. I then feel worse during the times where I'm very depressed and not fully present with the kids because I love them to death but I'll have zero energy. I've gone through periods where I actually felt like I was going insane due to my dysfunctional thoughts and behaviors..doing the same pointless shit day in day out. I've become obsessed with philosophy and the nature of reality, feeling like I'm missing something and to figure out what's really going on is the solution. And I've felt that 'solution' on psychedelics but of course its fleeting. And I forget. By chasing the metaphysical dragon I've had 3 psychosis episodes by combining psychs with weed, and the first time a year and a half ago I felt stuck in time and at the time felt like the only way to get out was to kill myself. Keep in mind I've never truly felt suicidal, my reality was just fucked at the time and I was truly terrified out of my mind. I ran head first into doors, smashed a mirror, ect..blood everywhere and a terrified family. I couldn't believe I had done something like that, I became terrified that I was capable of something like that in a drug induced state..yet nothing changed and I convinced myself it wouldn't happen again. My parents were worried obviously but outside of talking to them the next day it was never even brought up again. I never went to therapy and changed nothing. And life went on like nothing ever happened. It's like I'm in limbo where i feel stuck unless I'm under the influence of something, so that's all I think about. When can I get outside of myself again. Feel that peace for a while.

  I went into psychosis again a week ago on acid, mdma, and weed (it was great until the weed, I'm so fucking wreckless). This time I wasnt violent or anything, but my brain convinced me I had done something terrible, so terrible, that when I thought I had a hole in my chest and felt blood bleeding out I tried to let myself die. I took my hand off my chest to let the blood flow out when I thought i heard the ambulance arrive, because I couldn't live with what I thought I had done. Literally felt like I was fading away, but it kept looping so I kept experiencing my death over and over. Turns out it was all in my mind but at the time it felt completely real. I felt like the biggest monster on the planet and didn't know it was possible to feel that horrible. That scared me straight so I'm going to therapy in a couple weeks, yet I still can't let go of the desire to seek out different states to experience some kind of liberating feeling. I'm just never content. Stuck. Almost like I'm a robot in a way, but these states (besides the psychosis) break me free and I feel human again, whole. I know this is all very unhealthy and I'm making changes because anything is better than what I'm doing now, or lack of. This is long as hell and I don't really expect anyone to read this, i just had to get my thoughts out. I feel fucked up in the back of my mind, like there must be something terribly off about me, yet no one ever seems to think I have any problems and just see me as a good person. I know I definitely dwell on the bad and I do have good qualities.. but the bad is all I can dwell on. I feel like overthinking my paranoid weed thoughts for 2 years straight has disconnected me from who I really am, who ever that is. I just want to feel normal, content,and fulfilled, that's all I want.",mentalhealth,How fucked up am I really?,2019-01-14 22:48:02

Sorry English isn't mother tongue so there could be some inconvenient expressions.

I got the problem that there are many things I can hardly remember. Very common problem, right? But I got the feeling that it's really different for me.

Yesterday I had friends here and I asked ""How was Silvester?"". They told me we already talked about that topic via phone. We also talked about Silvester last year. My gf said it was very cozy last year, we had our best friends here. But I didn't remember. She said we went out on the balcony to see the fireworks. Still didn't remember. She said we saw the neighbors kid on the other balcony. Then I remembered. But the rest of the day is still under shadow.

When I am at work, sometimes I need to visit coworkers I don't know (I'm in IT Support). So I look their names up in the phone list because there are pictures of everyone, so that I know who to speak with. When I arrive the department I completely forgot the face of the person's I just looked up.

It sucks because often I give promises in my company and don't keep them because I just forget about them. Also I do the same mistakes again and again.

But other of things I can memorize completely. It seems pretty random which things I forget and what keeps in mind.

I did some checks for my short-term memory and I was always average or better... 

I have a lot of bad memories of my childhood. Some strange shit happened there, won't go into detail. I don't know if that is connected with it.

Do you think it is a mental health issue or am I just dumber as I think?

I've been with my bf for 4 years now and he is aware that I have PTSD. He is amazing and he is my hero. He has kept me alive and going. I ask this even after 4 years because this is a new development and I don't know how to go about this.


I'm just going to say that my mental state is in complete chaos due to going off of a med that I shouldn't of took for this long and I didn't need. I feel like I'm waking up out of a daze and I am now confronted with severe emotional instability and my PTSD is kicking up. 

I have been experiencing severe lows that will last for up to 3 weeks due to withdrawal of the med (a Benzodiazepine). With each drop of the dose, the worse the lows get, and the worse the suicidal urges get. I was pretty close to an attempt before Christmas, but I didn't tell my boyfriend. By the time I thought about telling him, it felt irrelevant. I am scheduled to drop the dose in a couple months and to be honest, I think I might not make it. An actual attempt is a high probability and I need to tell my bf.

Between my PTSD type symptoms such as dissociation and these lows, I am just surviving or existing. Almost everyday is a fight and I feel myself on the edge of my breaking point.

I just don't know how or when I should tell my boyfriend. I have almost told him a couple times in the past month, but the timing felt inappropriate, he was having a good day, or I was feeling good for once. 

I'm unsure how I should start the conversation. I am unsure how to tell him that I was close to attempts in the past and how bad the suicidal urges are.

I try not to think about them and i write them off as silly paranoid or maybe even false memories.

Heres a little background:
Early childhood: 
-lived in a very religious household.i have a older -sister is 7 years older than me
-my dad has always had trouble controlling his temper and disciplined me a 3 year old toddler,and my older sister until one day he went too far with my sisted and hit her with a metal bar.After that he swore never to lay a hand on us again.
-at some point child services was called,i thought it was all my fault and was scared to death,before they came.I was instructed by my mother to not say anything about the ""disciplines""
Middle childhood:
I discovered porn at age 8 ,and from there on had a very unhealthy look at sex for my age to the point i tried to come unto our 15 year old neighbor.My dad found out and got extremely mad then everything else from that moments a blur like most of my childhood.
 My parents were constantly fighting for 12 years and when i was 9 got divorced.
Shortly after, my mother decided she wanted to start over somewhere fresh and moved  to the USA. I didn't want to leave my friends behind and opted to stay with him at my grandmother's house,my older sister(not the same dads) was starting college and was barely home. Eventually(about 1 year) i moved to the states with my mother.
I was NOT raped, he never did anything to me,but i remember from a very young age just wierd things he would do. For example he was obsessed with my feet and used to kiss them to an extent that was wierd even as i got older,and always gave me ""foot massages"" that extended to more than just my feet. Also from a very young age my dad used to always slap my ass but as i got older it got more uncomfortable for me.When i was living with him in my grandmother's house i slept in the same bed as him ,he woud give me ""back rubs"" so i would fall asleep and sometimes extended it to inside my underwear ,but he wouldnt touch me in that way.He would barely go inside my underwear.
This has all been very hard for me to write because i have a really good relationship with him and the thought of him ever seeing my in that way makes me want to cry.
I try to push these memories away om the daily because maybe im just remembering wrong ,i want to be wrong.

I dealt with depression in middleschool and highschool and almost killed myself on several occasions, but nothing ever really came of it because I'm a really good liar and that helped convince my family I was okay even after my mom walked into my room at 1am with several knives on my nightstand. I think I honestly have several issues many of which have to do what my upbringing and the very isolated and controlling life I lived in under my mother. I realized in the last year they I really need therapy. Like, I believe I'm a good person and overall in life I do very well, but that's because I keep all of my sadness and sorrow inside myself. I don't tell anyone or do anything as far as healthy coping. I want to recieve therapy but I absolutely will not risk the next several years of my contract screwing myself because as some people know, mental health is treated like the plague and your life is essentially over if you admit you have a problem.

So my wife has diagnosed anxiety and depression. Every now and again, she encounters something which reminds her of her late parents, and she has a panic attack, which is understandable. There are times where she brings up an idea for a plan for a date and she knows full well that this will bring up the possibility of panic attack due to memory of her parents, but she's all for it anyways, which includes an after-event meal.

For example, last week she brought up the idea of watching Gone With the Wind at a local theater (the local theater does classic movie nights sometimes). I said sure, and the plan was to go to dinner afterwards. The dinner didn't happen, because as the movie was ending, she was developing a panic attack due to the fact that her mother loved the movie.

1716,Shameofthepast08,1547440271,1," Hello Reddit…hope you’re all well.

Here  I am…it is around 4am where I am in the United Kingdom. I should be  sleeping and looking forward to the day, but I am ruminating about my  past CHOICES that I made.

Things that I  usually deeply regret in my life are all human/relationship related.  There are bad choices that I have made in other parts of my life, but I  don’t really dwell on it because I know that I can turn these around.

Anyway,  one of these relationship regrets is about something that occurred over  10 years ago (around August 2008 when I was 16). I lived in Germany  back then and it was my last day there at school.  What happened on that  day is that I got caught out in a lie(s) in front of my whole class on  my final day.

My English teacher  (ironically) asked me…”what have you seen there in London/UK whilst you  were there over the summer”? And I went on and on and on!!! Some of the  things I said were true; but a lot were also lies. Pretty much made it  up whilst talking (probably because my classmates were cheering me up at  that moment).

After I answered the  question I looked at my teacher and saw ‘that look’ she gave me. She  pretty much asked the whole class…”Do you remember what this specific  place is?” “Nooo”, they all said. She then asked me “Could you please  tell your fellow students what this place is”? There was pretty much  silence for ten seconds or something like that. She answered the  question and wished me good luck.

I am  glad she humiliated me in front of all of them, but what hurts/confuses  me so many years later is why did I betray all of them? They are/were  great people and accepted me, yet I still felt the need to do something  so unnecessary.  The shame and guilt is eating me…I am feeling better as  I write this, but just an hour ago I was crippling with shame and  abusing myself.

Since I have been in the  UK I have experienced a lot of failure and I put it down to my anxiety,  OCD, mild depression, social isolation and the above mentioned event.  Lying is something that I rarely do nowadays. I have vowed to change to a  better person and I know how to, but what I did back then is not  allowing me to move on. I always ask myself “why did I betray them” and  what they were thinking of me at that specific moment.

There is slightly more to this but the most important things have been written…can you please help me?",mentalhealth,Caught in a lie and humiliated by my teacher a decade ago...still can't let go.,2019-01-14 15:31:11

That's the difficult part, tho; it's the knowledgeof what needs to be done looming over me that creates the anxiety. I don't have a lot of debt when you compare it to most, sure but to pay off this 5500k deficit will still take 8 months  of sacrificing £200 a week from a 260 a week pay-check. that little left over is for food, phone contract, fun, clothes, living expenses and everything in between.

I know I can do all that but - my problem is the acceptance of the 8 months of not just frugal living but; breadline budgeting that is to come.

It had been awhile since I'd gotten a step better, but after watching this movie I took another step up. There's this beautiful scene with the sun rising and rain falling and Bulgarian singing that's maybe my favorite scene in any movie ever. That's likely what did it for me.


Another one that helped me is a documentary called ""Child of Rage,"" about a little girl who was abused when she was a baby, and that kind of turned her into an emotionless psychopath. It's very disturbing. But then in the documentary shows her going through therapy, and by the end she talks and cries like a normal kid. I saw this in a phase of my mental problem where I was unable to meditate as I was doing before to help my problem, and watching this put me in a mental state of being able to. I think it just gave me hope of possibly being a therapist and helping to fix horrible psychological problems like this, which kind of gave me a drive to get better I guess (hard to explain).

1733,NightmareNasty_,1547435114,1,"I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 8 years old, so I've dealt with intrusive thoughts all my life. I am used to most of them and can brush them off pretty well. Violent intrusive thoughts are the easiest to brush off. So are twisted ones.

Racist and Pedophilic intrusive thoughts are ultimately the hardest for me because they sicken me so much that it's harder to get them away. I am by no means a pedophile. Even having to say that makes me sick. OCD just shoves these horrible thoughts in my mind that are so bad sometimes I cant even be around my little cousins because they're a trigger and it's so fucking sickening. It seriously makes me feel nauseated. I feel guilt but guilt from intrusive thoughts has lessened over time because i'm so well aware I cannot help it, and I know that it does not reflect what I really think. 

Though pedophilic thoughts are the most horrendous and haunting, racist thoughts are the most anxiety-inducing.
If you did not know, turrets and OCD are strikingly similar because you get these intrusive urges or sensations or thoughts that make you want to do something. Intrusive thoughts for OCD people are kind of like people with turrets shouting curse words and other offensive thing.

My racist intrusive thoughts come to me more often than anything else and come in a deafening whirlwind. It is so much worse now because a couple years ago I was in a very abusive relationship with an EXTREMELY racist neo-nazi. (To get an idea of how abusive it was: I'm a flaming lesbian and was in this relationship for 3 years. When he broke up with me, it was the happiest I've ever been.) For an idea of how racist he was: When ever we would pass a group of black people,hed whispers monkey noises in my ear or make jokes about stereotypical racist things like fried chicken, watermelons, basketball etc. Some of it was 4chan dark humor but he was actually a racist person. For 3 years, he was openly racist with me. He frequently used the N word in derogatory ways beyond offensive internet humor, he used slurs for Mexicans frequently. I'm life long friends with the workers at a local Mexican restaurant and have known them since I was a toddler. We went on a date there once and my ex would make a racist comment every time the waiter left. Basically, I know the ins and outs of how a racist thinks and what they think because he was so open around me despite how much I tried to change him. 

Having this perspective of real racism has made me afraid of actually being racist so much more. And because I was exposed to constant horrible comments, those horrible comments replay in my head when around ethnicities other than my own! It's so hard! At work (i'm a cashier) I talk less around other ethnicities because I have this compulsive fear that I'll say a slur or something really racist. On the inside, I have all these really offensive thoughts rushing at me. Things I dont believe and it's so bad I cannot concentrate. I zone out, act really weird, my eyes twitch, and sometimes I cannot make eye contact with the individual because it's a trigger. There is nothing I can do to stop it

I guess I wanted to vent because I feel so guilty about many of my thoughts. The racist ones affect me the most in my day to day life.

The gross pedophilic thoughts are just as hard but i'm rarely around kids. I hate those thoughts because I care about children a lot. I'm a very nurturing person. I care so much about their safety, and I love children. Instead of being able to play with my younger cousins, tell stories, talk to them, hold them, I just have to feel anxious and awkward with really nauseating intrusive thoughts that make me want to stab my head.

Two years ago she moved out to another country and I refused to go with her, then I was sent to live with my father. Although I was much better not being in the same place as her, my father were always absent since I was born and so, even when I was living with him, I sometimes felt like I was living with a stranger.

So, I decided to move out again and went to live with my aunt, who I believed was a really good person, just to find out she points every little wrong thing I've done (plus, I have anxiety) and I really try to do literally everything she asks me to, but she always picks up something to complain about, to the point she would say I am useless and lazy, or treat me like I'm just a burden to her, or lash at me almost everyday for every small thing, just like my mother did. 

Well, my conclusion is basically... I don't have a place I can call home, where I can feel comfortable and where I feel respected and people don't try to hurt me all the time. I don't have the confidence to go live alone right now, so I know I need to wait a couple of years to get my own place, but still...

I'm an upperclassman in highschool, and help construct sets for the school's theater department. I'm also Lesbian and am closeted to most of my family. When I was younger, I was diagnosed with ASD, more commonly known as Asperger's, along with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Later on down the line I was diagnosed with PTSD due to a particularly traumatic car accident. Normally, I would talk to my friends or an adult I trust about things like this, but at this point I need an outsider's perspective and calling the hotlines hasn't been helping. In short, the past couple years of my life have contained some of the most painful moments of my existence. First, I had many people I cared about die in quick succession. Then, I needed to be transferred to a new school for a semester, and was subsequently bullied so harshly that I was forced to sit in an entirely different classroom by myself while the perpetuators got off the hook. Fast forward to my sophomore year, and I get my first girlfriend, who proceeded to break up with me over text and never spoke to me again, though the breakup was mutual. I then found out I developed heart problems, then discovered the heart problems were caused by stress and carbon monoxide poisoning. Now, my parents are getting divorced, my mom is barely at home and instead opts to either work or stay with her new boyfriend. I've attempted suicide a handful of times up to this point. I want to tell my friends how much I'm hurting, hell I HAVE told some of my friends how much I'm hurting. I know that they can't take the time out of their day to help me because they have problems of their own to deal with. Though at times, it feels like my existence as a being is being ignored. I'm never the first choice to approach for a conversation, I'm never the one that anyone ever notices missing, and at times I feel like the one person that everyone keeps around solely because they feel bad. I've told them what's been going on, and at this point it feels like they don't believe me when I say that I'm suffering. I've been downright miserable for the past 2 months and I've been trying to reach out for help but nobody wants to provide it. I feel abandoned by everyone. I feel like I've become inconsquential in the grand scheme of anyone's life. I feel like I don't even matter anymore. I feel so alone and I need help. I know my friends care about me but I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm not going to work tomorrow. I haven't been back to work since we broke up for Christmas on Christmas Eve. I had a bad bought of depression/anxiety and I decided that I would return to work on Monday after going into work on Friday to talk to my boss just to get my foot in the door.

It was all going great until this evening and now I feel like really pressured and stressed again and I know when it gets to tomorrow morning I'll run away and hide from my life and responsibilities like I always do. I always do the same thing, get ready for work and drive somewhere far away and turn my phone off and get horrible thoughts going through my brain.

Work is really supportive and has told me not to worry in the past and everything seemed great on Friday but I have a feeling that they are eventually going to get sick and tired of the same thing happening over and over, this is the longest period I have had off of work so far, I just don't want to go to work I just want everyone to piss off and leave me alone. I just want to sit and do what I want but at the same time that makes me so angry that I feel like crashing my car every time I get in it.

I'm so angry, confused and upset, I've been suffering for almost 4 years now and it's to the point that I don't look forward to anything. I've been on and off medication but it keeps feeling like an uphill battle. I don't want to hurt myself but I'm always thinking that I want to die and that I'm not worth the effort it takes to keep me alive. Why should I be happy when there are others around me suffering. I just wish I could spend my life making others happy.

I'm sick of the struggle I just want to live a normal life, how do other people do it. I often people watch and am just so self aware of the fact that all of these people are living their lives like I'm supposed to except they're actually going about their daily lives and not sitting in a pit wondering how to get out. 

Anyway, I'm not sure how much longer my job will take this from me, it wouldn't be the first job I've lost because of my condition but the stakes are a lot higher this time as I have a lot more responsibility now. Which really stacks on the pressure and makes the boiling point that much worse.

If anyone actually reads this, thanks for listening to my struggles. I haven't really posted this for any reason except to get it out there. This is a private account so I'm not too worried about anyone seeing it, maybe it will help getting my words out into the public without the fear of it coming back to me like speaking to a real person would.

1749,MalKnoxx,1547422549,1,"I need to get this out. I’m going to write all the times in my life I’ve been sexually abused that I can remember. 
The first one is a bit of a blurry mess. To be honest im not 100% sure what happened and I don’t even know who it was for sure. When I was around 4-5 I started showing signs of having been sexually abused. I told my mum I was having nightmares about her boyfriends private parts. I constantly spoke about private parts and sex and I knew way too much for my age. I was asked my social work let’s if anything happened to me but i always said no because I couldn’t remember anything having happened. To this day I don’t know what happened but I still feel sick when I think about it and sometimes when someone holds my head or puts something in my mouth or I’m having oral sex with my boyfriend I get a weird heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach. 
The next two are both when I was about 6-7. 
One was my cousin who kept taking me into my mums room when he came to our house. He would get his little penis out and ask me if I thought it was big and make me touch it. One day I went and told on him for being gross and my mum never let him take me anywhere alone again. Nothing else happened. 
The other one was Andrew, a 14 year old boy who went to the same school as me for mental struggling children. He wasn’t stupid or anything but he clearly had autism or something, he was a little odd and had tantrums a lot. One day he came to my house. I don’t know how he knew where I lived but he showed up when me and My sister who was a year younger than me were playing outside. He wanted us to come play with him so we did. We were very stupid girls and we used to sneak away from our street a lot even though we weren’t allowed. We snuck away with him sometimes after that day. One day he took us farther away than ever and we met up with a group of his friends who were all teenage boys. They pinned us down and held our jaws open and poured blue wkd down our throats. Then we went to a play park and Andrew took me into the woods by myself and pulled my trousers down and touched me. He made me touch and lick his penis and I remember thinking what is wrong with him this is gross, he pees out of that. I got my sister and went home. I didn’t tell anybody and Andrew never came to play with us again. The next time was when I was 12. It was my mums friend Richard. He was a creepy old man. Every time I was alone with him he was say how beautiful and attractive I was and how good my figure was. He always asked if I had a boyfriend and hugged me really close. He never actually molested or raped me apart from a few times he grabbed my bum and “boobs” but he gave me a phone once and said I could keep it if I didn’t tell anyone I had it. It was just a cheap one but I was happy to be given because now I had a secret phone for when my gran (who I lived with at this point after she took me out of the care home) took my normal phone off me at night. But I was horrified when I got home and switched it on and found on it about 40 pictures of his naked body and penis, with selfies of him smiling creepily. I only told one person and that was my friends Mum who was blind and she told me not to tell anyone else because he probably just forgot to delete them and it would be embarrassing for him. 
The next one is when I was 15 and I lived with my mum who was a heroin addict at the time and her boyfriend who was getting it for her. When she was out it he would come in the living room with me and we would smoke joints and drink cans or beer and watch the tv. Sometimes he would sit really close and one day he asked me to put my legs on his lap. I said no at first but he said he would have to stop buying me cigarettes and food if I didn’t. So I done it and we done that for a week or so. I got used to it but it was still a bit creepy. Then he started feeling my legs and he went further and further up until he was touching me in private areas. He would also tickle my feet so that I moved my legs around on his lap. I don’t know why I let him do these things. I feel disgusted now. One day my mum went into hospital with pneumonia and I had to stay with him alone. Social workers came to ask if I was alright with that but they asked me right in from of him so I had to say yes. During this time we slept in the same bed and had sex. When my mum came back i had a massive rage. I threw things around and broke things. I screamed and shouted and swore. I can’t even remember what it was supposed to be about. I couldn’t control myself at all. I screamed that I was going to tell someone what happened and he held my room door shut so I couldn’t get out. I picked up my electric guitar and whacked it right through the door where the handle was and it broke his wrist. I ran past him and out the front door. I picked up a brick and smashed his van window with it. The police happened to be driving by and witnessed my uncontrollable rage. They got out and pressed me down on the glass covered hood of the van and arrested me for vandalism while he stood and laughed. All I could do was scream at him. No one believed at the station about what he had done. One blond woman said I was being a little manipulative bitch who was clearly just looking for attention. Andrew didn’t want to charge me for damaging his van so I was let out. I didn’t go back home. I spent a few nights just wondering around and sleeping in closes in flats and In back gardens until I’d spent all the change I had in my pocket at the time I was arrested. It wasn’t much but I’d been drinking tap water from the bathroom at Morrison’s and buying loaves of bread To eat throughout the day. I couldn’t take the cold anymore and I went to social work begging them not to tell my mum where I was but just to find me somewhere to live. They told my mum where I was and I had to go back there for one night until they asked my biological father who I had only met twice to take me in for two weeks until I was sixteen and old enough to go into a homeless unit. In the homeless unit I was abused by 3 men. 
I was a complete mess in there. I couldn’t do anything for myself and I only had about £37 pounds per week by the time I’d paid for heating and electricity. It always just went on drugs and drink. I tried desperately to find someone to be close to and help me cope with this because I was feeling so alone and scared. But it was mostly men in there and the two girls were best pals and kept to themselves and usually spent all day in one of the flats down the road. So I was stuck with the boys. Most of them were between the ages of 18-25. They seemed nice enough and always helped me out with stuff like buying me pot noodles and letting me sit in their rooms to play their play station and for a month I was basically just one of the guys. It was good. Then one day Keiran of them said he liked me and we agreed to try being in a relationship. He got really clingy really fast and he took my virginity. I know id already had sex but this was the first time I consented. Then one day he wouldn’t stop when I told him he was hurting me. And he stopped wearing condoms and spoke about how he wanted me to get pregnant so we could get a house really quick. He was 23. I broke up with him and he hit me and raped me. I pretended like it didn’t happen. Then one day I was in Michaels room using his Ps2 which he said was fine even if he wasn’t there. He came in drunk and coked up. He forced himself on top of me and tried to rape me. But unlike Kieran he wasn’t strong enough and he only managed to touch me down there before I pushed him off and ran away. The last one was mark ferri. He was my weed guy. He had schizophrenia and lived in one of the flats near the homeless unit. I was at his flat one day to pick up some weed and we smoked a joint together. He gave me my first bong and it made me so stoned. I’d never been that stoned in my life. The floor and ceiling were spinning and I couldn’t move properly. I lay on the couch and asked him for some water and if I could just lie there for a while because I didn’t feel well. He said that’s fine and I shut my eyes and sort of half slept for a little while, just wishing for this to be over. Next thing I know he’s on top of me and he’s pulling my clothes off. I was very weak and couldn’t do anything. I did tell him no but then I was sick and I just let it happen. It went on for what felt like all night. I stood up afterwards all shaky and was sick again before I stumbled back to the homeless unit. That was the last time I have been sexually abused so far. It feels so good to get them all out at once. I am literally shaking writing this. ",mentalhealth,Just got to get this out. It’s a bit graphic but I had to do it.,2019-01-14 10:35:49

Second bit of bad news was that when receiving the rota for my job next week I've been given no shifts and don't know if I've lost my job. Still waiting for a reply from my manager on why I have no shifts. I know january is very quiet there (in a restaurant) but why am I the only person with 0 shifts ???

Third thing is that the guy i was talking to who works where i work (slept with last week and was gonna go to his again next week) has not replied for most of today which is very odd

TLDR: Advice on getting back to life after getting out of the hospital. What I should expect in the future. Should I tell my employer the real reason I was in the hospital? Thank you. 

I just got out of a mandatory 72-hour hold on Friday. I can't afford to take time off work and am expected to return on Monday ""I have a commission based income"". My husband has gotten more time off work than I have to recover. I overdosed on medication and am pretty much symptom free. My major concern is I feel pretty apathetic about my attempt. I feel like I should be more upset. I've lived with anxiety and ptsd for many years. I finally just snapped. The worst thing is I'm no longer allowed to have fire arms which sucks because my one of favorite hobbies is long range shooting. 

Anyway, back to the original question how am I supposed to return to life? I'm afraid I'm going to end up crumbling because I didn't get the opportunity to process what I went through. Isn't moving on this quickly a form of repression? I have an appointment with a therapist in a few days, and they raised up my antidepressants to the maximum dose. So in the meantime I'm very confused about my emotions. Is it healthy to move on like this? Is it a good sign that I can function so highly or should I be more concerned with how empty I feel about it? My husband doesn't seem phased in the slightest and is going about his business as normal I'm worried he is just repressing to. Any advice ? Or should I just continue to pretend like nothing has happened. Sorry for the rant I just can't really talk to anyone about this.

1756,squid971,1547420132,1,"Hi, im posting this today ti see if anyone cqn relate with me or even provide me with some helpful advice. My story starts off when I was 13 I was fairly overweight, and weighed around 240lbs for me height. I dealt with a mentally abusive father who degraded me for years, and I know many people have had much worse experiences than myself. I was always told Id never amount to anything, I was fat, useless, you name it. I evevtually told myself Id lose weight go get him off my back. Over the period of about a year and 2 months later I lost over 120lbs. And at this time I found a great love for fitness. I chased this for years and I still do today and im now 22. I got largely invested into bodybuilding through out highschool and I was always known as  the big guy and lifting weights was my escape I suppose. I took upon training fellow students and friends and found fun this but no matter how strong, big, or inshape I was I was just never mentally happy or physically happy. I always wanted more, meanwhile I had my dad telling me I was too muscualr or I worked out too much which is totally contradictory to what he told me before I got into fitness. Fast foward, to this point in my life, Im 22 and out of highdchool for 2 years at this point. I was fortunate to find a job outside of highschool which Im no longer at but Im at a better place. Ive been with my bank for nearly 2 years now. I started as a teller and wanted to evetually become a financial advisor because as  child I always saw the people in banks with offices and nice clothing and wanted to be like them. I started part time, hustled, became full-time, kept on hustling became the lead teller, vault and atm teller. And as of december I made it to my financial adviosr position. Im entirely fortunate to have an awesome set of co-workers who support me, I love my management and my co-workers unlike any other work family ive had. And im fortunate to have moved through posistions to quickly and get to where I wanted to be. I persoanlly feel that I make grest money for a 22 year old, and I drive one of my dream cars already. Where my unhappiness comes into play is it seems im just empty. I get my car and its not enough, im not satusfied and I want more or something to curb that want. I get my job that Ive wanted since I was a kid, and I love it but I dont really feel to happy about it. Its like no matter what I do I feel empty and it seems like theres a void in my that needs to be filled. I always feel petty to talk with myself about these things. And I feel that Ive done good for myself, but I just dont value it like I feel I should. I cant express excitement for getting the job or the car I wanted. I cant show excitement about my sister, having gave birth to a beautiful daughter, and I feel so disgusting because I feel like such an empty emotionless person. Most people would generally describe me as a happy fun uplifting person. And I typically am, I get more enjoyment out of making others happy and wish I could find that happiness that I can distill in others and find it for myself. I just want to somehow come to terms with myself that I need to be thankful for all I have and be satusfied because my ways are mentally destructive. And I wish I could find whats missing in me so I dont feel like such a dead person, who doesnt get excited about birthdays, get togethers, new children to the family. And I have deslt with strong depression and anxiety from a young age and take some medicines but they never seem to fully help it just masks the problem. If theres anyone out there who takes the time to read all of this im thankfuk for you. And if you have any advice or help at all I greatly appreciate it.

1759,kitz-ash,1547417666,1,"So I’ve got this slight paranoia that my ex that I broke up with may become a stalker or obsessive. 
So long story short, he seems to have a lot of trust issues and tied in with that he has communication issues especially when confronted with conflicts regarding our relationship. He doesn’t try to make things work but claims that he wants it to work out. He doesn’t put in the work and no matter who is at fault from an argument, I always found myself in the position trying to fix what’s broken. Even when he is the huge reason/problem. He doesn’t give. He shows signs that he doesn’t trust me when I haven’t given him reasons to. I just don’t get trusted for nothing. Anyway, we have been broken up for months now and he constantly reaches out to me trying to be friendly. I finally gave in and responded back to him and allowed him a chance to be friends. He says that he really wants to be friends and I wasn’t ready for it yet but he convinced me to give him a chance. So i gave him a chance and we got into yet another conflict where he shuts down and doesn’t play his part in mending. 
I feel like if he is the one that wanted this friendship he should be putting way more effort into it. 
With history of his behaviors and him not putting in enough effort but requesting we have a cordial relationship, I feel a bit paranoid that he could be a threat to my safety in the future. I’ve decided after our final conflict, that I am seriously done with him and not interested in mending a friendship. I told him I don’t hate him, he should leave me alone moving forward and I don’t want to ever be in contact with him. I’m not well experienced in dumping people so a part of me feels guilty for being the dumper and having to say all those things. But to be honest, that’s how I feel because he doesn’t serve any good purpose in my life, he aggravated me and exhausts me every time I try to make it work with him. It’s really irritating and I can not do it anymore.  He doesn’t talk about his issues that he has since we broke up and doesn’t show signs that he truly wants a friendship with me. He just wastes my time consistently. 
So my concern is, he knows where I live, still has photos of me (he told me this during our attempt to be friends post breakup) I feel uncomfortable about that. But the good thing is, we don’t have any mutual friends and I’ve blocked all means of contact and social media from him. Logically, he shouldn’t be able to contact me but I’m concerned that he could lash out from me leaving him. 
How do I deal with this paranoia because obviously not everyone thinks their exes become psychos at the end of every relationship.

1- I sit down, and I pour my heart out to this woman. It took everything I had to open up this much and to feel that vulnerable. I feel like she gave me some decent insight about some of my thinking progress, but nothing to deep or anything that I had not acknowledged myself. 

Then literally, 45 minutes after our session ends. This woman puts out her iPhone with her Square card reader and asks how I will be paying. What the absolute fuck?. First, I'm a fierce proponent of Capitalism and paying people for their time and effort. But, Jesus fucking Christ, Lady. Is there a more tactful way to do this? I felt dirty, I felt how one would feel after visiting a prostitute and realizing they have no love or understanding for you, they just want your money.  Send me a bill, or refer me to your receptionist, wait 5 more minutes before bringing the subject of payment up. My god. This left a sour taste, and I decided I was not going back.

2- I make another appointment with a therapist who is also a Psychiatrist. Again, I spend a grueling hour holding back tears as I tell her what the fuck is wrong with me.

1762,roccat-mid-size,1547416212,1,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering what exactly the issue here is. Hopefully y'all can provide some insight.

&amp;#x200B;

I am deciding to make this post after eating dinner with my family. Throughout the whole meal, I was too afraid to talk / add to the conversation. My family were chit chatting with one another, but when someone started to tell a story, I got very uneasy that somehow they might start to get nervous (like I would). While this was happening, I also thought to myself, wow, I would never be tell a story without shitting myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of the meal, someone asked me a question. I immediately begin to panic, but luckily it could be answered with just a one word reply. I answered awkwardly; mumbling and clenching my toes.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just one example of many awkward feelings and interactions I have. In work, whenever we have a meeting, I feeling like running out of the room before its my turn to speak. When it is my turn to speak, on a good day I can get by ok, but as soon as someone has a question, I begin to get very nervous and cannot articulate myself very well. Which leads to a poor meeting, as I cannot communicate properly, we cannot properly sort out any issues at hand.

&amp;#x200B;

On the train to and from work, I cannot sit down and relax without thinking people are looking at me. I am always dreading that I bump into someone that I know, because I would be way too awkward and might even have a panic attack if someone started talking to me with so many other people in close proximity. I can only put my head down and look at my phone as I travel.

&amp;#x200B;

When I go out to restaurants, I get very nervous when the waiter comes to take my order. When I go to the bar, I can barely order a drink.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't seen my friends in over a year because I am too afraid I will panic..

Most of the time I don’t even deserve this. For example, this morning my mom told me she was going to braid my hair, and told me to take the tangles out. I wasn’t able to take out all the tangles because I didn’t have a mirror, and she told me I didn’t need one. Then, she started to tell me that I’m so dumb I can’t even take the tangles out of my hair. Then, she started to tell me that I’m going to struggle all my life and she wasn’t going to help me if I need her and completely abandon me. My mom told me I was going to be nothing in life. She began to dig the comb into my scalp, and it hurt. I asked her why she was doing that, and she hit me on the head and called me fat sh*t. Moving on to my Dad. He’s just completely abusive. When time he hit me so much in 6th grade that I had bruises and marks all over my arms. He even hit my head and I felt dizzy and got a headache. He constantly physically and emotionally abuses myself and my little brother and sister. He hits us for stupid things. When time he got mad because I was using his phone and I didn’t put it on charge. He hit me enough to make me cry. My mom doesn’t even do anything when he hits us. I’m usually the one who tries to protect my brother and sister. My dad even cusses at us and tells us we are useless and garbage. To be honest, I’m so used to the verbal abuse and name calling from him, it only sometimes affects me. Moving on to my brother and sister. My mom and dad started to telling my brother and sister to call me names. My sister is three years younger than me, and my brother is six years younger than me. They just completely hate me for no reason when I love them whole heartedly. They verbally and physically abuse me just like my parents. I just don’t know what I did to deserve all this.

1766,rajamohsin-haq,1547415041,1,"Hi,

Long story short, the suffering started two years ago in January 2017 about these days. And I remember how it struck me and I was in shock that I'd be facing all these weird and stupid thoughts I never thought would even occur. 

I did used to have a slightly OCD manner before that but it got WORST after that event. Months went by, I learnt tricks to prevent all these thoughts from entering. Like for example, I wouldn't do something until I have a positive thought or image in my mind beforehand. It was like an obligatory act. Otherwise, I thought I'm stupid or dumb!

I know this is already sounding weird and dumb, but it's the reality. Time went on, and I learnt to block these stupid thoughts, like mainly acting NATURAL and that really helped me. And what also helped me alot was, that I thought to myself, why won't I think about the days I wasn't like this at all? I was fine then!? Nothing ate me! So that encouraged me to throw these thoughts and images out the window. 2017 had been a year of trials and tribulations for me. And for 2018, it slightly got better as I mentioned. And now for the pasted few months, thanks God, I am coping very well. 

However, whenever I do fear something the most, and that appears for too long, I do fight it for a while, few hours, the I'm good again. Mostly anxiety and OCD when you are imprisoned by your brain to think like so and so. You feel it cringed and compressed. Until you rationalise it. That's another worst part.

There are times when I'm all clean and natural, I do something, it goes fine, but slowly if I do fear a thought or an image, it would just come in mind making me do something several times until done without such a thought or Image (naturally) (and also I hope you know what I mean by 'something')

Please help me out!

1768,TheCorrectAyhZad,1547414544,1,"I want to state right off from the start: I have no idea what I'm writing. I have no end-goal with writing this,I just want to vent to someone. Thank you in advance for reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had this unshakable feeling of anxiety and pressure constantly for the last 2-3 years. It's best to start with the fact that I spent most of my time closed off in my flat, that is in my room which is kept constantly dark other than this laptop I'm writing on. I love social interaction,I WANT to have social interaction, but every time I do have a good time with someone,I can't do it again for a long amount of time because I feel like it'll be too much. I'm too scared to speak to anyone, even if I'm having a big problem, I'll just feel like I'm embarrassing myself and they'll hate me for anything I say.

&amp;#x200B;

It's totally confusing to me. There's no reason for me to be like this, I grew up with a loving family, mostly my mother (my father has never lived with us) and I've had friends during my childhood. Even today I have a small group of 'friends' , but every time I try to get help from them I'm straight up denied and laughed at. I've thought of harming myself before , but I'm too much of a bitch to take the pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next I want to talk about how easily my pressure spikes and how easily irritated I am. Even someone speaking in a relatively quiet environment will make me irritated to the point where I want to beat the shit out of them. I've lashed out at inanimate objects before (I've thrown chairs across the room,broke my lamp,phone etc. ) and I'm scared, more for others than myself, that one day I'll just break and hurt somebody when I can't take anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I've become the absolute opposite of myself, I've always been a nice person who's always up to help in any way,but on the other side I'm violent and hateful. I feel like I have 2 personalities that are polar opposites, though I've never been diagnosed with any disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

To weave onto the last sentence: I've never even been to counseling. I'm too scared. For one, I don't want my family finding out about my problems because I think they won't love me like they used to and that'd kill me. Second, I'm too scared to interact with a counselor, I don't know how to express my feelings well enough for anyone to understand me, even if they tried their best. Third, I'm scared that I may come off as too violent and be considered almost too dangerous and be isolated even further if anyone found out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All I've ever wanted in my life was a friend or someone to love,which I've never had. Every attempt to connect with someone failed,and it's all my fault. It's not that I cannot connect to people,I absolutely can,but I cannot do it when facing them. I love some things with all my heart: games,space,music and I'm passionate about all of it, but even if someone too likes those things I just CANNOT connect to them because I'm scared of letting them down or making them angry and I hate myself for it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've tried everything I can do alone: I took to exercising to fix my looks, I spoke to people and went out a lot, but nothing of it worked permanently. Nothing makes me feel happy in my life anymore and I don't know how to continue anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I've bottled everything up in myself, all my violence and hate, I've put all responsibility on myself and I covered it up with a goofy-ass personality so people think I'm joking even when I'm sending signals that I want help and, even when I'm absolutely 100% serious, everyone writes it off.

I've searched, I've tried sports, gone to various events, consumed as much information, gone on a bunch of vacations, even tried cannabis, none of it made me feel any different than i always do, cannabis surprised me since i assumed it would make me feel happy or elated, it just made me feel disconnected but i was still bored, nothing was funny or interesting, i've tried it a couple times and it's the same thing, sometimes i take too much and i do feel bad, but more like a weight on my heart and my brain is slowed, not a paranoid feeling. what is this, how do i go back to feeling normal emotions. i've tried everything, i watch inspirational videos, try to have an active social life, do school events, etc, but it's all so uninteresting, i can't even do any of it well because i can't focus on it enough, i just stare off into space thinking about nothing because it has the same level interest but i use less energy. i'm thinking about dying, there's no point, even though i don't really feel sad i don't think i'll ever really feel fulfilled or happy per say",mentalhealth,fuck this bullshit,2019-01-14 07:17:02

i feel so fucking ungrateful. i have a boyfriend of 2 and a half years, a little puppy that i adore, we live in a lovely little cottage in the countryside and yet.. nothing. no happiness, no excitement... nothing. am i wrong? am i ungrateful? my boyfriend is amazing in most ways but in this situation he has the - i don't know the word - but he's not helpful at all. he's grown up with his dad and all they know is getting on with it and just doing it but i cant do that. i need to be asked if i'm okay.. how's my antidepressants doing.. shit like that. 

i keep deleting and re-writing this. the worst part is, i don't feel sad, i don't feel upset.. i just don't care. I've read a few posts on here and i feel if i can get into it, it'll help me as i don't keep a diary or notes or anything.  there's no structure to this post but i'm just going for it, i'm not thinking story mode - and i'm sorry but it might be quite long, but whether people choose to read it - whatever. 

it started when i got raped at my uncles wedding by the brides best friends son, and ofc if you aren't beaten black and blue, people choose to ignore it. even at 11yo i found it easier to brush it under the carpet rather than address the situation and i'm sat here at 22yo in the same position. i mean, people know but i never did anything about it - which again, makes people not believe you. 

since i i assumed that's what guys wanted from 13yo i was putting out. i assumed that's what i had to do to get them to like me and obviously word gets around. i got onto drugs and drinking, smoking and whatever else, but i got over it eventually at 17yo and decided that all the drugs needed to stop. i still smoke weed, fags and drink booze but the hard drugs stopped, and i felt great that i managed to boot all of that but now im STILL sat here like craving it. maybe it never goes away? 

i aways felt maybe a blog or something might help but you always assume noone wants to hear it because thats sort of the whole vibe ive had my whole life. nobodys really that interested. i enjoy typing and id quite like it if people reached out and i could maybe help them.. idk . i just knew that when i was 14+ years id of loved it if i could just write to someone who i knew would reply from an outsiders point of view because i live in a very very small town so as you can imagine theres not much you can say or do without people finding out. even if you only trust your closest friends. 

idk if this has helped me or what but i feel slightly better. if you've read the whole thing - sorry for all the grammar mistakes but beed to go through and sort it but thanks for reading it - and im sorry if its too long. ",mentalhealth,just need to get it out,2019-01-14 06:24:29

I recently started seeing a psychologist for some of my own mental health issues (this is my third go around). Found a doctor on ZocDoc. It is convenient for my location but did not have a great score compared to others in the area. Because of my time and location constraints, I booked anyways (maybe they had one or two bad reviews). So I meet them, they seem okay. Comes off as slightly pretentious to me, but maybe that's their style. But I did ask how many clients they see per week; I want to understand if the psychologist has a solid background or not and I thought clients per week is a decent proxy. They said they would not answer that question, so I backed off. Is this a red flag? or is this an inappropriate question.

I have minor trauma exposure due to parents divorcing when I was 8 and being bullied growing up. All my life I’ve been concerned with my weight and now I’m more in the average/curvy body type range. I still feel I’m huge and unattractive. I have a hard time maintaining relationships. I don’t talk to my family and do not open up to potential friends (current acquaintances). I have a fear of being betrayed by people in my life, which is why I’m generally very closed off and stay to myself. I am always single. Only dated someone short term and the WHOLE TIME I was with him, I accused him of cheating when there was generally no evidence. I typically am paranoid of people in general as previously discussed, especially around guys. Not to mention, I don’t ever make the first move with a guy and play very hard to get, hence a result of my low self esteem and feeling they’re playing me/ not interested. I was not noticed by guys in HS (a vulnerable stage), which is why I tend to use online to talk to guys and avoid socializing in person. My psychiatrist thinks I’m very dramatic and just anxious, the extent of his opinion towards my mental health. I always fear the worst in life (failure and cancer) and worry about things that haven’t happened yet. I self sabotage. My mood swings are all over the place because I think of something negative and believe it is my reality, altering my behavior until something else distracts me.

Things used to be very different, but now after spending all day, she is again my best friend and lover.. until late at night.. then it is like she turns into a different person.. agitated, ruthless verbally, she says she is hurt by this cheating - but I don't see sadness .. it is anger.my questions really go to: Late at night is when things go really wrong. I say controlled rage below - she basically from a sound decides she wants a divorce, doesn't trust me at all.. and she treats me like dog $hit.

The problem is she came from an abusive relationship, and she likes to use that against me as well.. she transfers the prior relationship to this one - meaning she threatens me verbally, then threatens to use against me. that part puts me in danger and I can't have that.

Last night this controlled rage response happened without the clicking.. supposedly. I can't get her / her phycologist to even listen to my perspective - she refuses to listen.

1802,Karaethon22,1547388568,1,"I'm not at an all-time low compared to previous time periods, but I'm still in bad shape.

I feel so alone and hopeless. I have a wonderful husband, but no one else. No friends and my family stresses me out worse. I've historically relied on an online support group, but things got ugly toward another member around thanksgiving. I saw so much gaslighting and bullying from people I'd trusted that I just quietly left. And I know I'll never trust that group again, but I find myself wanting to go back. Without those people I'm adrift.

And my husband is great. But no one's perfect and he really upset me the other day by the way he reacted to me having a self esteem episode. It was definitely not a recurring issue and he's apologised. We talked it out and are mostly okay, but my trust issues don't make it particularly possible to move on. I've started hiding my emotions from him a bit.

I'm lonely and I feel like a burden. I am a burden, objectively. I don't work (waiting on a decision from disability) and I don't help around the house. I have no energy and stress out too much over tiny things. So my husband does everything, including taking care of me when I have a flashback, panic attack, or suicidal spiral. I feel like I'm giving him nothing in return. I can barely listen to him talk about his day at work, because I start stressing about his problems, even the ones he doesn't really care about.

I'm a waste of space and energy and money. Like a black hole sucking in everything and giving nothing back. We don't even have a sex life anymore because my trauma history gets in the way. Any time we try I end up sobbing and panicky and he feels responsible. But he didn't't do anything wrong, it was my step dad. 

He's been dead more than a year now and it's not fair he's still torturing me. It's not fair that my family expects me to get over it. It's not fair that they talk about missing him to me. Especially my mom. I get it, she's a widow who lost her husband but she knows how he treated me. Just to be clear, I was an adult. My step dad was great, but then he changed after his stroke. And it went on for several years of helping my mom take care of him. He needed 24/7 supervision to stay safe. I'm expected to just brush it off because he was disabled both physically and mentally so he wasn't responsible for his actions. And he really wasn't coherent enough to understand, so I get it, but damn it he still tormented me for years. He crossed every line there is. And it's bullshit my mom thinks ""he didn't mean to hurt you"" is enough. Even if it's true it's not enough.

I'm never going to be okay. Everyone says it gets better. And I can see improvement, objectively. But I've been a useless mess of anxiety and depression for years. The meds aren't enough. The therapy isn't enough. My service dog isn't enough. What else can I even do? I still am always afraid and always hurting. I just want to die, but that would hurt my husband even more.

I love being outside doing lawn work on my own, so my first job was landscaping, and having to do it on a routine everyday depressed me. I did it for a few months before I became a basket case. I then got a simple job as a grocery bagger during college for a great company with great coworkers, and even though I enjoyed it, I got depressed a month into it once the newness wore off. 

Post-college, I needed initial financial experience, so I just a job as a Universal Banker (bank teller, but also gave out small loans) and I loved it... at first. I felt like a finally had a job to take pride in and to focus on excelling in... but a month into it, it became routine/boring and I kept thinking “what now?” What is there to look forward to now. I ended up depressed for the next 9 months I worked there.

I got tired of doing that job and needed something new, so I started working as a financial analysis for a Broker-Dealer firm. I was so amped to get this job. I make excellent money for my age, and I get to be alone all day just listening to music and looking over data. The first few weeks were amazing. Now, I’m starting to get used to it after a month, and now my depression is coming back again.

Even though I have a great job that actually interests me, I just can’t stick to anything. I love stock trading on my personal time, but I can’t even enjoy it long for work. It just seems like I need something different everyday or I’ll go insane. 

I see my coworkers coming in everyday actually excited to tackle the day, and I have never been excited for a work day in my life. They come in with great moods and can actually see they are just “ok” with life. While halfway through day, EVERYDAY, I have a breakdown in the bathroom just because I want to be at home. It’s depressing thinking this is all I have to look forward to... especially since I feel that I have plateaued in life. Yea, I can make more money later and get a better position, but then what?   

I wish I was like the normal person that could just ignore emotions and just work. I’m already trying to figure out a plan on what to do next, even though most would kill for my current situation.

I spend 40-60% of my waking time daydreaming. I tend to think in bed too much that it interferes with my goals for the day. I do it on commute and pretty much every time I'm alone. Even a phrase in a book or a song triggers me to wander off, thinking about alternate futures and obsessing over mundane ideas. 

The only time I stop daydreaming is in early mornings when I haven't thought of anything yet or when I'm in a classroom, which is a fortunate thing. My days end with a speedy reel of images and random thoughts of no value which are quickly forgotten. 

When I try to communicate this to my friends, they think I'm joking or trying to be clever. I remember watching The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and thinking about how 'painfully honest' it was.

i am and 18 years old college student and I have very big depression for now over 5 months. It all started when my high school ended, about a month after that. I have various reason to be depressed, for example fucked up childhood. But my depression kicked in random. There was no explicit event or reason to be depressed. Everything was roughly the same for the last 3 years. So I thought about the reason for it and I saw some articles about depression and a routine in life. Than the idea came in my mind: After my school ended, my sleep patterns where all over the place. I mean during school time I would wake up everyday at the same time. I wasn't sleeping much because I was staying up too long every night but I woke up early and was tired so I could sleep easily the same night. For the last 5 months I was waking up everyday in different times. My college classes start late so I don't have to wake up early.

1809,cook-a-coo-coo,1547373943,1,"Never been the full ‘norm’ but there’s things that bother me greatly the older I’m becoming. (21F)

Instead of a long backstory, I’ll just jump to the ‘issues’ present today. (Some have always been present)


For some time now, well over a year, I’m having trouble staying connected to myself. I’ve mistaken imagination/dreams with memories since I was young but it seems like I can’t be wrong about that surely? I have been though.

I’m not implying I have some sort of split because I know that’s a lot different but I do seem to go through phases of different ‘versions’ of myself which makes things so much harder.. trying to summarise best I can.. quite often I just don’t feel connected to myself. My mind, my body and myself seem like different beings, I feel me and my mind are 2 not 1..

I’ve recently started working and while it’s simple enough, I have breakdowns out of nowhere and when I can feel it happening sometimes, can’t do anything to stop it, having a breakdown in the middle of dealing with customers isn’t great, which adds more pressure and makes everything worst. Luckily my employers dealt with this very kindly but I’m sure if it keeps happening, I’ll just get kicked in the sense that they’d feel it weren’t good for me to be in that industry.

I can’t switch off my mind either, I go home and constantly go through my entire day and conversations over and over, which stresses me out as I want to come home, chill and forget about my day, doesn’t happen.

I just don’t even know, I’m so out of touch with myself, I don’t know. I get so confused easily over the simplest of things, e.g. you could ask me to clean a window and I’ll get confused of how to clean it when I know deep down and it’s not that I worry cause believe it or not, there’s very little I give a shit about, I’ve been called a ‘hard hearted person’ many times especially since empathy isn’t really my thing either. On the other hand, I get distraught af and idek, when I have random thoughts in my head like, you ain’t spending enough time with mum, time could be up tomorrow and look at the lack of time you’ve spent, you’re gonna miss out, you’re gonna regret it and I get hella upset, it’s a little traumatic, my mum is my world, can’t explain.. 

I’m sick of forgetting everything, ask me to get a drink, I’ll turn around, take 2 steps and think, I’m sure I’ve been asked to do something.
I got the job to try giving normal life a good go and all but I just feel it’s knocked me off balance even more. I’m not a social person, I hate communicating with people 90% of the time, in work I deal with them 100% and it does kill me, to force a smile and conversation being all customer friendly, it makes me die inside.

My day has to be closest to how I imagine it should, if it doesn’t, it gets me overwhelmed and I can’t cope. The smallest thing can knock me off and change my mood completely.

I just don’t know what I’m meant to do, is this normal? Being dramatic? I’m being genuine though, I’m just stuck, I look at everyone and I feel the world is structured like robots and I’m just here on the wrong planet, I feel like I’m a lot different compared to most people, seeing everyone go to work, have food, watch tv, go to sleep etc, a lot of you do and it freaks me tf out.
Over the years, I’ve transformed into like 3 different people to get where I am now, all so different.
I can’t go on like this, I don’t have a clue about myself, I’m a contradiction, literally. I constantly feel one way then the full opposite.. I just wanna know what I can do, if there is a chance of me being more normal or something.

Other times I can feel rather superior compared to a lot of people, a slight feeling of entitlement(nothing ridiculous) etc, I contradict myself, who I am. everything


I was in the process of being assessed/diagnosed with BPD a few years back, but I moved and changed hospital etc, and they basically threw my case out saying that I was perfectly normal, regardless of what I went for, I still don’t feel normal but they wouldn’t listen. I don’t even think I have that, or anything majorly serious, but something isn’t right:/ so, again just a little help or guidance would mean the world to me rn.

1811,DrKahal,1547370232,1,"So I’ve struggled with my mental health since I was a teen. I dropped out of High School because of Anxiety (Thankfully, I went back and finished later on in life). I am no stranger to seeking help from professionals and when I began feeling this incredible hopelessness I decided it was time to start seeing a therapist. Our conversation began with me admitting I feel “stuck” in life and have so far been unable to make changes. After a couple month of reliving the past without really finding any “reason” for why it would lead to me feeling the way I do now, I decided it was time to pursue medication for the first time to help me handle whatever the hell I’m dealing with. 

Next doctor was a family doctor at a lovely LGBTQ clinic in the city I live. For the first time ever, I felt like my doctor was listening and understanding me. He was due to retire in a couple months and I felt lucky that I had met him before his time as a doctor was up. I ended up having to go back a couple times so we could chat/do blood tests/ determine the right course of action. He was very honest that he had not had enough experience with mental health issues and so referred me to the specialist in my city for a “psych analysis” to confirm his diagnoses of Moderate Depression, Social Anxiety, and an Eating Disorder. In the meantime, he casually suggested smoking pot to temporarily treat the way I had been feeling. I’ve smoked weed since I was a young teen so the idea was not too shocking ... especially seeing as weed was to be legalized in Canada the following week!

Fast forward 3 months and here I am wide awake at 2:46 am sharing my experience because I’m out of pot and thusly overthinking everything. I just want time to just fly the f^$% by in a dazed high so I can finally meet with someone and get this under control. I still have another month of waiting for my appointment and it’s proven much harder the past couple month knowing /hoping what my life might be like after I’ve been seen by these new doctors. When I’m high things are manageable... but when I’m sober ... nearly unbearable. I’ve progressed to the point of walking around and noticing hard objects like a table leg and thinking to myself “If only I could slip and hit my head on that.” I feel like I’m in a race to see who’s going to get to me first? Mental breakdown or medical attention!?

Anyway, anyone else find themselves in a similar situation? I know I just have to wait a couple more weeks but it feels like a lifetime away. 

P.S : I got in contact with my therapist to do some “maintenance venting” until my appointment date is here so I’m remaining in contact with my support system.

I believe in the monotony of life, some of us grow complacent and become content with the routines in our life.

These routines stopped me from recognizing how much potential I have and limited my growth as a human.

1828,mthrowawayasdfghjkl,1547354036,1,"Hi, I’m 15 and I haven’t been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness, and I don’t want to be self-diagnosing myself since that isn’t a healthy thing to do. For a little less than a year now I’ve always been having to reassure myself over and over, every single day and every hour, that “I’m not dead, I’m not dying, I’m never going to die”.  This sort of all stemmed from me always being anxious about death, and so I went to my guidance counsellor about something unrelated to this and she told me about something called a self-fulfilling prophecy, where if you think something will happen it will.  I took it the wrong way and thought as a way to deal with my anxiety I’d just tell myself that “I’m not dead, I’m not dying, I’m never going to die”. Which I also understand isn’t in the case because I know at some point we all do, since it’s inevitable. But I really just can’t stop having to reassure myself and it’s become extremely tiring for awhile now. I haven’t been to the doctors despite wanting to mainly because I’m afraid. I’m so scared that there isn’t anything wrong with me at all and I’d feel embarrassed, and not only that, I won’t have an explanation to why I’ve had to keep reassuring myself or feeling anxious over death for so long. I don’t know, I feel like I have OCD magical thinking, but again I don’t want to self-diagnose myself and I talked to a teacher about this and she told me I was just “quirky” lol. I just feel so tired and unhappy every single day having to constantly reassure myself over something I know is stupid, but I still have to do it. I hate how it’s so hard for me to have a conversation with people because I have to pause and reassure myself over and over. I have to keep reassuring myself in multiples of 3 or 5 over and over until it feels right, which I hate having to do. I just feel bad because not only do I have to reassure myself, I have to ask my friends to reassure me too and tell me that “I’m not dead, I’m not dying, I’m never going to die” which I hate having to do because I’m sure it gets tiring for them as well. I just want to feel happy and not have to worry about this all the time. I just don’t know if this is worth going to the doctors about, because my parents tell me I’m fine, and my teacher told me that she’s seen a lot of teenagers with mental health issues and she also thinks I’m fine. So I guess I’m just afraid they’re right and it’ll be embarrassing if I go to the doctors and nothing will be wrong with me, because I also think if there is something wrong with me, maybe I’d want to go to the doctors despite what they say but I’m not putting in any effort to get help?

1830,Yernanwasgoodlike,1547352841,1,"As some of you may know, aerosols are hallucinogens. Inhaling a 330ml can of aerosol is like experiencing a 12h LSD trip condensed into 20-30 minutes.  Now, for me this was a form of escapism. I suffered with depression and would use hallucinogens to escape for a breif time. Due to the nature of hallucinogens, this half hour trip felt like 4-6 hours. I abused solvents every single day, never missing a day from the age of 12-16. 

There were times when I was trapped in a BT commercial, times when my bedroom was a beach and a squid-like mermaid attacked my face. Then there were darker times.

One of these times causes a lot of damage to my perception of reality. I woke up and walked to school. I did my day to day stuff in school and at 1pm went for lunch. I blinked and I was laid in my bed staring at the wall. The 5 hours from being awake to lunch had only been 7 minutes. Everything was vividly real, it was a shock to the system. 

My mum absolutely hates animals. I have never been allowed a pet because of this. I have frequently hallucinated my mum violently throwing cats at my wall, screaming ""CATS, CATS, CATS, CATS, CATS"" getting faster and faster as it happened. As comedic as this sounds, it was traumatising at the time.

Another time my bed turned into a giant wasp that wrapped its legs around me and starting biting into my shoulder. Everything felt real. I could hear its wings buzzing, getting more and more distressed in sound. I could feel the warmth of its body on my back. I could feel the pain of its pincers in my shoulder and blood pouring down my chest. Horrifying.

When I first started taking it, I had a good trip every time.  Then I had my first bad trip, transparent spiders with wings flying under my eyelids. The only way to permanently get rid of them was to grab their wings handing out of my eyelids and slide their giant wings out of my eye and snap them in half. I'm aware this is all fake, but the experience was real, that is what's important.

Then when I experienced my first bad trip, they got more prevalent. Then it was a 50/50 chance of getting a bad trip. Now I cannot take aerosols without having a bad trip and that's the worst part. I didn't willingly choose to stop abusing solvents, I'm too scared to take it anymore. I have been clean for 5 years and I'm still mentally dependant on it. I still crave it. I still can't have a can of deodorant or hairspray in sight of me and not have a craving to take it and be out of touch with reality for 30 minutes. It was an escape. 


My counsellor doesn't see this though. She only understands that I have seen things and that it was imaginary. She doesn't understand how real it was to me at the time or how much it's traumatised me. She doesn't understand the damage it has done to me. Only that I was an addict and now ""I'm not"". She doesn't get that despite not taking the drug for 5 years I am still dependant.",mentalhealth,My counsellor doesn't take my past solvent abuse seriously,2019-01-13 15:14:01
1831,dykening,1547352572,1,"So, I went through a lot of sexual abuse from ages 15-17, but I'm pretty sure something happened before then too, as I'm having a lot of reactions as if it had happened physically (while the aforementioned years of sexual abuse were from online predators). I find it near impossible to eat anything white, especially if it's liquidy (I gag eating anything with whipped cream on it, and have an anxiety attack when any of it falls out of my mouth, and I can't even stand to look at most things like ranch and mayo). Human sexual anatomy wholly and truly disgusts me, and though I try to get better about it, I end up dissociating severely if I think about human penises for too long (especially semen). Even mentions of rape and sexual abuse, if I'm not expecting them, are *severe* triggers for me, often sending me into a state of paranoia, twitchiness, and self-loathing for the rest of the day. When I get this way, I sometimes end up reading rape fanfiction as a form of self-harm. It always makes me miserable.

I have *a lot* of trouble with repressed memories; I'm only now remembering some of the things that were done to me in childhood. Most notably, my best friend when I was 7-9 (1st-3rd grade), Ryan, severely abused me emotionally, and I don't know if he may have done anything to me sexually. People around me say that I changed very much in third grade, becoming more quiet, insecure, and depressed, and other bad signs. It seemed like I got slightly better after that, but the same thing happened in sixth grade where I suddenly developed extreme dysphoria and dysmorphia, anorexia, depression, anxiety, and intense self-esteem issues, seemingly overnight.

I don't have memories of anything sexual happening to me physically. These are the only cases of abuse I remember (in chronological order from when they started):

\- My father severely neglected and emotionally abused me and my younger siblings, and I often had to caretake him due to how unstable he was  
\- My mother was (and still is) convinced that there is no way she could be a bad parent, as my father is ""so much worse."" I still live with her due to my inability to be self-sufficient because of my trauma, and the daily emotional manipulation is tiring. She's only gotten worse with the years, and she'll never admit she's messed up.  
\- Ryan was a friend (though he did establish that we were going to get married and murder people together) who verbally and emotionally abused and manipulated me for three years at a very young age, gaslighted and guilt tripped me, degraded me, threatened me, and I think at times physically hurt me, though I can't recount examples. Against my better judgement, I talked to him recently, and he hasn't changed.  
\- Maddy was a friend who degraded and emotionally manipulated me for three years as well, but she was probably the least bad of the bunch. She was the first one I ever recognized as an abuser, despite having gone through abuse before (albeit unrecognized).  
\- Dominique was an online acquaintance (I was about 15, while she was 20+) who constantly coerced and guilt tripped me into sexual roleplays, and constantly forced them on me while I was at school, roleplaying herself crying and hurting herself when I told her I needed to pay attention to class. We only talked for a couple weeks.  
\- Eden was a long-distance boyfriend who, over the course of 6 months, constantly sexually and emotionally abused me, manipulating me for nudes and saying the most awful things that ensured I would stay with him and conform to what *he* liked in a person. It took me 2 tries to break up with him, and he threatened suicide both times. He did more than what I've listed, but it's a lot to go into.  
\- Lauren was a long-distance girlfriend (she was almost 19, I was barely 16) who constantly threatened suicide and guilt tripped me into sexual roleplays. She confessed to me by venting about how I would never like her back, and when I told her that I ""did like her, but didn't want to date right now"" she seemed to accept it, but the next day was telling our whole friend group that we were dating. She lied and manipulated using fabricated stories of abuse happening to her, and often called me her ""pet"" without my consent. When I broke up with her, she talked about how her only use was helping people learn more about themselves and then being disposed. She IP tracked me and was planning to move into my house without my consent.

That's all I can recount at the moment. But I'm sure there things I'm not remembering, notably people, and experiences with Ryan.

When I talked to Ryan, as gaslighting and guilt trippy as he was, he denied doing anything sexual to me. And I'm almost inclined to believe him, but I'm also terrified to believe him. I don't think he was the source of *all* my sexual trauma (some of the triggers don't make sense, as he was transgender \[FtM\]), but I have a slight feeling he might be. I have dreadful feelings surrounding the one night he slept over at my house when I was 9. We slept in the same bed, and I could barely stay awake, but he kept trying to talk to me. My memory of the night is very hazy, as I was barely conscious, but I have many, many intrusive thoughts and nightmares about that night, and thinking about it makes my chest hurt. I don't know if there was any case of COCSA on that night, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was; and at the same time, I'm terrified to find out if there wasn't, as I already worry that maybe I'm just making all this up for attention (I don't think I am, but I get paranoia like that). I have vague memories of feelings of hands touching me, though they don't feel securely connected to any chronological memories; I also have memories, with no real surrounding setting, of Ryan being uncomfortably close to me.

Another case is sixth grade, where I have some vague memories of distress in a classroom, though no memory of what people may have done to me. I believe it was a couple of boys, if it was anyone, but I only really remember the desks and classroom. And the fear, though it's vague.

I don't know if this is a sign of anything, but from ages 8-10, I would play a game with my friends called ""Vagina, Butt, Butt."" We would get naked and pelvic thrust our crotches together, then our butts, while chanting ""vagina, butt, butt."" This may have just been something normal; it definitely seemed normal at the time.

Thoughts on whether anything really happened to me that I'm repressing? I can't really have much of a view on it myself given how biased I am, with my fear of nothing having happened, but my girlfriend does believe something happened, though neither of us know exactly what.",mentalhealth,"Repressed memories + sexual trauma?

1832,kambere,1547349325,1,"I have GAD. I haven’t formally been diagnosed with ADHD but I have always suspected I have it. I have a symptom that I’m curious about.

Whenever I get interested in something, I get super obsessive and feel compelled to know all the parameters and dive in immediately. The logical thing to do is slowly immerse myself and build up knowledge over time. But instead, I get anxious and feel like I need to do it all at once. Often I get so hyper focused and hyper involved that I burn myself out and ultimately lose interest. It also burns me out financially.

Some examples:

* I am very into houseplants, and rapidly accumulated 70 plants, so many that I had to buy a greenhouse. It sounds very innocent but it really is an insane amount of plants and they aren’t cheap.
* I decided I needed to read the news more. I felt that print media was the right path. I spent hours researching every possibility and ended up subscribing to several magazines and The NY Times. It took me so much time to read all the material every day that I barely had time to do anything else. It was all I did. I felt like I HAD to get through all the material every day.
* My boyfriend got me a Nintendo Switch and during my winter break I got super involved with a couple of games. I played Stardew Valley and then later Zelda:BOTW all day, every day. And I mean it; that is ALL I did. I was up far later than normal at night, and would wake up early to play (and I’m very obsessive about my sleep. I use the sleep cycle app to track my sleep quality and get very anxious and upset about anything that interferes with my 8-9 hours of sleep per night. I also have trouble getting out of bed). Since finishing those games I haven’t even touched the Switch. -I binge watch TV shows -Online shopping is a burden. I feel like I need to explore EVERY option and will spend hours deliberating. Often I end up buying far more than I need. -Tea, wine, skincare products, hair care products, etc anything I get interested in, causes the aforementioned online shopping problem, which leads to impulsive over spending and an accumulation of whatever I have become infatuated with. -These are symptoms I have experienced my whole life- when I was a child it was dogs and horses. I was active in dog training and horseback riding, and spent so much time doing each that I surpassed my peers abilities very quickly, and easily won competitions. Eventually my interested waned. I have managed to keep myself involved in horseback riding by seeking out new, stimulating experiences- playing polo in college, joining a new stable that teaches eventing (which is NOT an easy discipline, so it has stimulated me for now)

TLDR; super intense hyper focus with new interests and hobbies that causes financial strain, stress, feeling like I can’t stop which triggers anxiety, and inevitably ends in burnout.

I am being tested for ADHD later this year. I have been diagnosed with GAD and my former therapist said I have symptoms of OCD. The symptoms I am describing I have always associated with ADHD- the hyper focus, obsessions, diminishing interest.

I would like to work toward lessening the severity of my problem and thought that determining its source would be a good starting point.

Do these symptoms correlate more with ADHD, GAD or OCD?

1833,ratscatsnbats,1547349223,1,"I’m 17 years old and I’m feeling like shit so to help myself I’m going to just vent about EVERYTHING. I might have spelling mistakes and grammar problems I’m sorry. I haven’t been to school since my 16th birthday.  (Trigger warning : cancer, rape, sexual abuse, child abuse, abandonment, drug abuse)

Technically my moms pregnancy was statutory rape due to my parents age difference she was 17 but nothing was held against my dad. They split up early on because although my mom had pretty much stopped doing drugs my dad hadn’t. He would get high on crack cocaine and stalk my mom at night threw her window. Eventually my crack head father left state because some people where trying to kill him so I was brought into this world basically without a father. Not that big of a problem, a lot of little girls don’t have dads now a days. 

 When I was in elementary school we went to visit family and I was sexually touched. Kept silent for years, I think during that same year was the year my mom got cancer. Her fiancé left her and we were almost homeless so out of desperation we moved in with my papa who I don’t remember being in my life much before then. We moved to the middle of nowhere and had almost nothing. I remember eating half alive worms still moving in my chili. 

 My mom got with a guy who was like a family friend for a while. I’d already met him and he was really cool he was so nice to me and gave me everything I wanted, candy, chocolates, he would download movies, he had a house and my own room. We moved in with him and things were cool for a little while until my mom started hitting me.....a lot. They both started drinking more and my mom started smoking cigarettes. Every weekend they would get drunk and my mom would pass out in bed and he would try and be sexual with me almost every single weekend. 

 I got my first ever iPod touch. I vented online a lot about how things where at home. I had no therapy and social anxiety from years of abuse took hold of me and I had no real friends. My mom found my texts of me telling someone I trusted I was being sexually abused by a family member and she slapped my face and threw me in the bed and called me a stupid whore. She told me our family member wouldn’t do that and she will call and tell everyone. I cried so much and begged and told her it was true but she was in so much denial. 


 My mom used to hold my hair in a pony tail and smash my head against the wall over and over and the wooden dresser we had in our closet. She used to pick me up by my hands so I couldn’t run and beat me with a wooden ruler for not eating food due to depression. I told her and her boyfriend once that I was suicidal and my first symptoms of psychosis but they IGNORED ME and looked me in my eyes and told me I wouldn’t have the balls to kill myself and if I ever wanted to they’d give me the gun. 


  My mom had kicked me out at 13 with nothing not even shoes on my feet. Abuse at home was so bad I walked about 5 miles in the Arizona summer barefoot to get to the nearest friends house. By the time I got there my feet were blistered and I couldn’t walk properly for about three straight days. I stayed for three days until her mom was worried they’d be charged with harboring a run away and they made me go home..... at home my mom was pissed off. Not happy to see me or anything. I ended up living with my grandma who had cancer at the time and taking care of her. 


  My mom got ahold of My dad who I didn’t know at the time and told them I was a troubled teen and that she doesn’t want me and within three days I packed up everything I owned and said goodbye to everything I knew to move across the United States to be with people I’ve never met before. The first year was good other then my dad being an alcoholic and us losing the house and going foreclosure. My mental health dropped a lot during my second year. I was hospitalized multiple times and was taking abilify (antipsychotic) at 15 years old. I was extremely homicidal, doing cocaine and mdma almost every day, and self harming constantly and excessively. 


  I cheated on my boyfriend at the time with my drug dealer and word got out I was selling myself for drugs which wasn’t true at all. The school got involved and wanted to open a cps investigation on my parents for neglect which I thought was fucked up because cps never disturbed my actually abusive mom, even after trying to tell teachers. I ended up moving back with my mom because I forgave her. She told me she changed, that her and my step dad stopped drinking and I wanted to just get clean. 


 Back at my moms I did good. I got my permit, my ged, two jobs I kept for over a year and everything was amazing until my step dad started drinking again and abusing me. One night while my mom was out working my step dad grabbed me by my choker (it was a thick belt like collar I’m into alternative fashion) and he pushed me over the bathtub. I was scared and locked my bedroom door. I told my mom and nothing happened about it. She’s so stupid. She’s caught him watching step daughter step dad porn, me AND my little sister had told her multiple times he’s tried to TOUCH us, he’s cheated on her, he lies and drinks behind her back, they fight, I don’t know why she’s still with him.


I ended up living with my bestfriend and her mom since they saw my bruises and told them what happened. My bestfriend is also a first hand look at what happened to me. She’s watched my mom chase me with a frying pan, watched my step dad climb on top of me with his fists in the air about to punch me, I stayed with her until early of last year until she left to another state to see her boyfriend.


When I came back to my house I started talking to this really nice man. Has a job, a car, has his shit together just like me. He was afew states away tho but he was willing to wait for me and date online. He visited me last summer for the first time and we hit it off so good and I stayed with him for a week. I ended up visiting him aswell in his home state and it was really really good. 


  After my 17th birthday my mom got mad he was a Mexican out of the blue and we got in a fight she ended up kicking me out and I couch hoped a lot. Sometimes I wasn’t sure if I’d have to sleep at a park or not. It was very very hard. But I kept working until I had enough money to get a plane ticket to be with my boyfriend.


I’m here now and safer, my bestfriend who’s now pregnant doesn’t want to talk to me because I’m always “negative” and she doesn’t need negativity when she’s having a baby but I haven’t talked to my family in almost over 80 straight days now. It’s so hard to be happy. My sister says my mom doesn’t even ask about me or talk about me. I relapsed today and now need stitches but I am too poor to afford anything health related. I have no friends and I’m mentally ill with psychosis ptsd and depression. Last time I was hospitalized and was in outpatient it was end of 2017.  Right before I left to go live back with my mom

I’ve lost everyone and everything other then my boyfriend who doesn’t even deserve to have to be with someone like me. I feel like a burden on everyone. Even my old friends from Washington are saying it’s my fault because I made the choice to come back to get clean and a job.

In Jan 2018 I started work at a new call center, where a very attractive (for her age) 40 year old female member of the training staff quickly took a liking to me and became flirtatious. She would compliment my hair and outfit, call me sexy, touch me, and dropped a few overtly sexual bombs on me that I had literally no reply for.  She was very intelligent, super social, and a brilliant conversationalist with a wicked wit—the exact opposite of my personality. She was smarter and wittier than me to the point I was intimidated by her, so rather than flirt back, I ignored her and shut her down. I felt like it was the only card I had to play. She seemed to take it as a challenge at kept going hard. I feigned disinterest, but in reality I was always very attracted to her, and over the months, this developed into the biggest crush of my life.  
I should note she wasn’t completely unprofessional. We had a fantastic working relationship, she was an amazing mentor, and she gave me the skills to be successful.  
This pattern of her flirting and me shutting her down continued for about five months until one night she added me of Facebook and came onto me hard with a serious proposition to get together outside of work. She didn’t say exactly what she wanted, but she was very sexual. She said she had been celebate for several years, and clearly wanted to end that streak with me. I wanted her so bad, but I shut her down again, because I knew we weren’t a match. During the course of that conversation, I did admit my attraction to her. That was all the permission she needed to keep working on me, and two weeks later, I finally agreed to go out with her.  
We dated casually for five weeks. It was a combination of fun and awkwardness. I absolutely loved her and loved spending time with her, but I had no idea what I was doing and made constant mistakes in dealing with her. The worst of which was that I was sexually timid and afraid to admit what I wanted… afraid to show any form of sexual interest… and I acted like a platonic friend most of the time. There was an opportunity to have sex with her one night and I didn’t do it because the date hadn’t gone well prior to that and I just wanted it to end. I made tons of other mistakes. I dated like a 14 year old.  Over time I showed her that I had no confidence, no self-esteem, no ability to deal with women. By July I had developed a deep attachment to her. I dd my damndest to hide my feelings because I knew she was the less interested party. She just wanted to have fun, I was in love with her.  
In mid-july, she went cold on me literally overnight. Like a switch flipped and the lights just went out, she shut down on me. She never explicitly said we were done, but she stopped texting first, stopped flirting, ignored me at work, stopped inviting me to hang out after, and only socialized with me in a group setting with our mutual friends.  If I texted first she would reply, but otherwise I’d never hear from her. She started sending signals like referring to us as “friends” and saying other things in front of me, but not directly to me. I tried to play it off like I was unbothered and agreed that we should just be friends… inside I was distraught that I was losing her and tried to garner up the balls to talk to her, but the writing on the wall was so clear that I never did. She had lost interest and was delivering her rejection in a passive-aggressive way.  
This phase of platonic contact lasted for three weeks. Then one night she dropped the bomb in our group text that she was planning to hook up with someone else that night. What really fucked me up about this was, four weeks prior, she had made plans to spend that weekend with me. So she blew me off, replaced me in her sex plans with someone else, and texted it where she knew I would read it. I don’t think she did it as an intentional slight aimed at me. She was just being herself, sharing her personal life with friends, which I had acted like I was fine with being.  
But I couldn’t keep up the bullshit fake friendship any longer. I was absolutely devastated and fucked up beyond anything. At that point I cut contact and unfriended her on FB. I quit my job at the call center and was unemployed for six fuckng weeks. I only saw her once and communicated with her a few times after that. Each time things went downhill. The last time we talked, she called to tell me she could get me re-hired (normally you have to wait 6 weeks to re apply after quitting suddenly). I accepted the offer, but told her I’d be looking for something else and that “I’d rather smash my nuts with a hammer for 40 hours a week than keep working there.” She rescinded the offer and told me not to come even after I apologized profusely. That was the last time we talked.  
It’s been five months since I’ve seen or talked to her. I got a new job, one that pays two-third as much (due to fewer hours offered), and the commute is three times as long. She’s out of sight, but not out of mind. I think about her every day. I tell myself it’s over, she rejected me, I have no chance with her ever again, and I need to act like she doesn’t exist. But I can’t because she fucking does exist and I know this for a fact because the other day I was trying to move on and found her on tinder.  
This shit with her cuts so deep and hurts so bad. The only woman I ever had mutual attraction with, who chased me for months, decided I was unfuckable and unlovable and lost interest once she got to know me better. I have such strong feelings for her, I could never just be friends with her. But she doesn’t even want me as a friend. She doesn’t even care enough about me to hate me. She probably doesn’t even think of me. Just acts like I don’t exist.  
If I could do it over again I would do everything so much different. That night she made an excuse to bring me home, led me to her bedroom and invited me to lay down on her bed with her? I would have fucked her and cum on her face and taken pictures instead of saying I was comfortable in the recliner and pretending to pass out. Little things like that.My six month exile from the old call center is up in three weeks and I have to go back... I just dropped $30,000 on an offstore stem cell treatment and then crashed my car the week after, now I’m broke af and I need the overtime money. The old place is the only place I know where I can pull $3500-4000 a month. I can’t spend 3-4 hours a day commuting for $14/hr anymore. I have to go back to where she is. And I know the real reason I want to go back isn’t even for the fucking money I need so desperately, but to let her see me ignoring the fuck out of her again in the far-fetched hope it will re-attract her.

1838,brokenmindfulness,1547344080,1,"This last week and a half has been hell.  I started hitting my mental health journey really hard — choosing to do it during my last trimester of pregnancy is absolutely ridiculous but I guess when it’s right, it’s right. I started by seeing a woman who acted almost like a hub for psych resources. After I pretty much vomited my whole past to her and every issue I think I have, she was really helpful and worked with me to develop a few first steps...

Step 1) Get back into counseling and start a more honest routine

Step 2) Wait 13 more weeks, until after I’ve given birth, to get back on my meds that worked and to start investigating whether or not I have 
        • CPTSD/PTSD
        • Bipolar, I think type 2? 
        • Major depression
        • Some yet undefined anxiety disorder.

They also want to monitor me a lot for postpartum, just in case.

Ok, so... Good. I have a plan.
I also feel like a complete freak. I know that prior to my pregnancy we had just started navigating through whether or not my ADD survived into adulthood. We started Strattera, it completely changed everything for 3 months (I was *free!*), then I stopped taking it when we found out about Baby Willow... I’ve just been waiting around for March to come so I can resume loving my life again, no pregnancy and no major mental health issues... Just a happy family and a happy life that I get to look forward to. This is great!

Except... Once I started going back to counseling, we agreed (and I do think it’s really wise) to do group sessions 3x a week and a 1 on 1 session every Monday at 3. So, this looks like:
        
      Monday @ 3: 1/1
      Tuesday @ 1: DBT group
      Wednesday: Women’s group
      Thursday: Mindfulness

Each session is an hour so it’s 4 hours/week of really hitting it. The downside: since I started, I cannot relax. I’m so damn anxious; I’m having these really constant anxiety attacks that come over me at the weirdest times. I can’t enjoy anything and that makes me even more anxious, like I’m a big burden to try to entertain or to get to snap out of it. My poor boyfriend... he’s been so above and beyond during all of this. He’s so positive and ready to help me. This just seems so stupid, why can I not refocus and try to see the positive in anything? For me, for him, for our son and for the baby we’re expecting, I am so done being this sadness junky. That’s the best way I can put it, it’s like I thrive on sadness and depression...

My brain is 24/7 worry, panic, sadness, anger. On the outside I’m so bubbly and trying to help others, trying to appear really upbeat and like nothing is wrong but I sincerely think that people can see through it way better than I think they can. They definitely can when I crack and it all comes pouring out of me... then the jig is up and I let my mask fall off. It’s everything in me that does *not* want to be this person. But, time and time again, that’s just who I am.

In my head, I’m replaying everything that I’ve ever done wrong, all the people I’ve ever pissed off, convincing myself that I’m the worst partner and I’m going to be too much for my kids to want a relationship with... the other alternative is constantly replaying the stuff others have done to me and being mad as hell at them. It just doesn’t stop.

I know why I do this, I mean I’ve been writing that list up for myself, mentally, for years. And it’s so weird, it’s like somehow in all of this I finally just saw it for the first time and understood why I’m this extremely negative person to be around and why I completely flip out every time I’m slightly stressed. 

I am a *sadness junky* so wrapped up in having to feel depressed in order to feel like life is normal. I think it’s easier for me to believe that I’m going to live and die this way than it is to *get real* and realize that I’m a freaking badass who survived through *a lot* of bad crap that nobody should have to go through. I don’t want to be this person at all anymore. I want to be the person who sees somebody else who’s like the current me, and can teach them and show them that they’re just as capable of moving mountains and reaching their goals. I want to *smash life* and watch myself turn into this supernova person I know I am on the inside. If I die tomorrow and this is the way I let myself spend my final years... just, no way. I couldn’t rest easy, this is probably my new biggest fear.

I think I’m really ready to do this right. It took me almost until I reached 30 to do it, and I’m really mad at myself for letting that much time go by, but if I get just 20 more years of happiness, surrounded by my family, watching everything go up and up from here... I’ll pick that over watching another 20 years go by without ever tackling anything on my bucket list because I was too damn afraid to let myself do it, for fear that I may actually have to learn how to be happy and healthy. 

I don’t know why I felt so determined to write this here. I know this isn’t a blog or my personal soap box, but maybe somebody else needed to see someone going through what they’re going through. Maybe somebody else can tell me that they made it and that it’s just as possible as my mind is set to believe it is, at this moment at least. I’m thinking of writing about this journey more, like a record of the before and after. Wouldn’t it be cool if, by the time Willow is here, I could tell you all that the positive won and my life wasn’t lived for nothing?

I think it would be the greatest gift to be able to at least say that to my anxious, depressed, angry, critical self. I am so ready to live. I am so ready to conquer this and let the real me shine out. I’m ready to show people who I truly am and that they made the right decision by not giving up on me. I want to leave something really good behind, and to say that I did it because I chose to be strong in my weakest moments — even when I felt like a freak, and a stranger to myself. I want this, I need this, and, damnit, I’m really going to do this. Wish me luck!


PS: For the love of god, can somebody please help me come up with a middle name for Willow?! Help me solve some of my anxiety (haha!) because we can’t think of a single name that seems right!

Tomorrow will be my 14th day I’ve worked in a row averaging 11-12 hours a day.

1842,FrodoNabbins,1547342188,1,"I know this title sounds strange but I'll try and explain it.
I recently went through a very difficult and very traumatic event that consisted of manic and depressive episodes, full on delusional and dissociative days, ending with multiple consecutive mental breaks. This lasted for about a year and I was in an inpatient clinic 2 or 3 times during all of this.

Prior to this I went through an ECT (Electroconvulsive  Therapy) treatment and I experienced many, many gaps in short and long term memory....My diagnosis was PTSD, Bipolar 2, and a few other things but the bipolar diagnosis was recently changed to borderline personality disorder. In the aftermath of my psychotic episode I slept a LOT... I mean a LOOTT ... And I kept telling myself that it was my mind's way of healing itself. 

After what I would call 'waking up' from this nightmare I consulted my mental health doctor and asked if he thought it would be wise to be taken off my meds, he asked why and I explained that my symptoms have been gone for months. He agreed and I have been off my meds ever since.

Now, I have been taking mental health meds my entire life..and not just a pill or two, but handfulls. So to go from all of that to nothing but multivitamins is a little jarring. Bit I accept it. I have been without my medication for 4 or so months now, and my family and friends say that I'm completely different in a very good way. Bit ever since this all happened it's like my emotions have been turned on. Everything I see around me moves me like it never has before...it feels like gaining something I never had. Like my empathy was ""broken"" or something, and now it works.

This leads to my question/ concern.

 Has anyone ever experienced this before? Does this make any sense to any of you? Is there cause for concern or does this happen sometimes? Is this possibly the cause of my ECT finally working?

I dont know if I am in denial to this stuff being issues though. When I would think of help, I just think this is probably normal stuff. From what I have looked at I dont think this stuff lines up with the diseases I have looked up. And I know if I would ask or go get help and this stuff be normal then I will be ridiculed by my family and the doctors. They will talk about it forever.

Background: So I am 22 year old man living at my parents home in the United States I take some classes online for Business Administration (as I didnt know what else to) In grade school I was always bullied. this took place from 4th grade until 12th grade. I have had some issues the whole time and still do today but I believe it's normal behavior depending on my mood. It has took me a few weeks to get this post how I want it

So here is just a couple things from my daily Journal I started a month ago when I finally started to question my ways

 1. Every person I see outside my parents and grandparents I feel like they are going to bully or belittle me. I just know it's what is running through there head. Everyone, no matter what does this to me. Some even act on it by approaching me or 

 2. I cant make eye contact or speak to people without feeling like I am going to jump out of my skin from panic/anxiety

 3. I have little to no short term memory. I'm not sure when this started even.

 4. I hurt internally when I hear loud noises like dropping something on floor (anything from salt shaker to a spoon), loud music, dogs barking, setting items down on glass tables, pretty much anything that is considered like those. I cant describe

 5. I pick at bumps on my face, arms, underarms, private area. When I do it it's like, for lack of a better word, a drug high. Time passes so fast and it feels so good. I do this whenever I'm in front of a mirror or in good lighting. This is usually after I freak out over something

 6. Anxiety over other people driving. Especially when they park. I end up cringing and saying some form of watch out

 7. I go through these weird periods about every other day of a feeling I dont know how to describe as emptiness. 

 8. I have turned down trips to places I know may have a bit of people. Similarly if I am going to a plaxd and I see people inside the windows near the door (like a gym) I run back to my truck and dont go.

 9. When driving everyone seems to want to try to hit me. Also while driving I find myself daydreaming of other cars crashing and how it would happen. 

 10. If I am with my family at a store I find myself going to the isles that isnt crowded. When they go to the register I usually go outside to the vehicle. I know the camera watcher is watching me making fun of how I am alone but I can be a little more okay with that then see them face to face. 

 11. I have a constant feeling I am going to get kicked out of the house. My parents haven't ever mention it at all but i know they will kick me out one day and i will end up on the street or under a bridge for the rest of my life. I have expressed this worry to my mom and she says I have nothing to worry about but I know she probably ran to my dad and told him I am onto them.

 12. I am quite. I am always asked if something is wrong by family members. I say nothing but I dont want to interrupt anyone and get them mad at me. 

 13. If I do stuff it must be perfect. I have been jumped on at every job I have had as I am not fast enough. I have this issue everywhere. In test, washing dishes, doing clothes. My mom has jumped on me for wasting water as it took me a hour and 20 minutes to watch 23 utinsels and plates and put them on a towel to dry. O get told that I will get faster as I learn to do stuff but I have done this stuff for a while. I must make sure everything is done right or I will have screwed up. And will think of it forever

 14. I have reoccurring nightmares of being bullied in school. It's always 1 of two different bullying events in school. These dreams happen once or twice a week.

The being perfect thing is probably the biggest thing I struggle with

A job is the worst thing for me in the world as I know when I am hired by HR they tell my soon to be co workers how I am and make my life hell. HR just hires me as they know how it will get my hopes up that maybe I can do something right. I usually end up leaving after 2 or 3 months after I get sat down by a boss for being too slow or not working well with a team. Or I am legit sick and miss a day. At that point I stay out that day thinking of all they are talking about me and I cant bring myself to go in and be harassed for being sick. I come up with stories to tell my family that I was let go for budget cuts or stuff. I've got to the point to where in this rural beach town I have ruined every job opportunity with these franchises/corporations. Those 2 to 3 months of my life at a job are always the worst for me mentally.

My family says everyone goes through this stuff regarding jobs and I don't understand. They say after a month I will feel normal and it doesnt.

I am sorry for the long post as I know that people hate long post but I need to get this stuff out. I have been trying to get this message done correctly for a bit. Edited it a few times as I worry that some stuff may sound embarrassing. Originally I had a list of 25 things.

1851,destroyer6991,1547335935,1,"I’m a 23 year old college student. I’ve always struggled with social anxiety, and grew up as extremely sheltered and away from normal social interaction. I also struggled with depression until I was 20. When I turned twenty I left a lot of that behind me, and have been in a much better place mentally. Right now, I’m the best I’ve ever been. I feel wonderfully mentally. I’m at the least stressed point I’ve been since I was 10. 

I’ve never really struggled with speech. I have 1-2 words that I struggle to say, but other than that I don’t have any issue that I know of.  Over the past few months I’ve started to struggle more and more to speak or even start sentences. It started out gradually, and I thought it was because of social anxiety. I had started working a job where I was doing a massive amount of customer service, so I just pinned it on the stress. But as time passed, I started wondering if that might not be the cause. I’ve gone from having infrequent issues at work, to frequently struggling to talk to friends, family, and even my girlfriend. I quit the job, and while it’s not a big factor in why I quit working there, this issue played a role. 

I don’t have a clue as to what is wrong with me. It’s all in my head. If I think about what I’m going to say, I wind up stumbling over my words. I’ve even started having a slight  stutter when I’m starting a sentence. It feels just like social anxiety, except I’m not having any issue with it anymore.

1852,Defekton,1547335525,1,"Hello,

I have been having a problem at the government counseling office. I live in British Columbia, Canada and the local psychologist has been moved to a new office.

Previously, i reported to her that I could hear the Secretary in the adjacent room talking. I said that If I could hear her, she could probably hear me.

More recently I was waiting in the room next to the secretary's office. The psychologist was in the other room on the phone. I could hear virtually every detail of their conversation. Specific details about the other patient, including his name and diagnosis.

I brought this up to the psychologist at our next meeting. She look stunned and admitted that people could hear what was going on in the room if the rear door was open. She said she would keep the door closed and ""turn on the radio"".

I did not find this satisfactory, so I brought it up to the local government psychiatrist. He immediately tried to downplay the issue and this is the first time anyone claimed that it was a hallucination.

The psychiatrist admitted that if I had the details on the other patient this would be a big deal. But I am not willing to give him that information since he said the issue was a hallucination, even when the psychologist was in the middle of explaining how people could hear the room from the second door.

If you have information for reporting these issues in British Columbia, PM me.

Thank you.",mentalhealth,Problems at the government mental health office.,2019-01-13 10:25:25
1853,PainlessMe,1547334820,1,"So my dad can be very annoying and rude, especially about political/human rights subjects. So today I was at a party and he started repeating the same shit he’s been saying for years, most notably: 
- “sex reassignment/transitioning is obviously not the correct solution to the problem in trans people’s heads”  and 
- “the gender pay gap doesn’t exist bc if it did nobody would hire men bc we live in a capitalist society” 
and I have been arguing with him about these things for EVER, and I keep getting really upset, because he doesn’t really listen to my points etc

But today, when he said that again, (the gender pay gap comment being totally unnecessary [*conversation about something idek what*, 
my dad: “well at least that’s real, unlike the gender pay gap”] like shut the fuck up why was that necessary???) this time my mother almost immediately told him that his comment was fucking useless and that he only did it to get a rise out of me. So she told him to shut up because it was making me upset, and I didn’t want to cry about it in front of people so thanks mum :)

But yeah my dad knows how I feel about this stuff and still tries to constantly argue about it. Like one time I cried about that transgender argument and he asked me if I’m trans and I was like “???? No?? It just really frustrates me that you’re calling them mentally ill??” 

Like they’re just people trying to do what they need to live a happy life, I just want them to be as happy as can and people calling trans ppl mentally ill is quite a step backwards on the road to accepting and normalizing non-cis people

1855,ForealTho0803,1547333004,1,"Hi, I just made this account so if the formatting is off or my writing is rambly or something please be patient. I just had to write this down or talk about it.

So I recently started highschool in a different school than I would feed into because my parents and I thought t would be best for me to complete the IB diploma program so I can have that on my uni application. This was not them forcing me, I also wanted to do it to have an easier time getting into uni. Now, I'm only 3 months in but I'm starting to have a weird feeling.

I thought I should be happy. I had good grades, I had the time to box and play other school sports, I had many hobbies such as music and video games. My life should be great, no? 

  
As I said I moved to a different high school to complete the program and left all my elementary friends (some of which I've known since we were 5) for school. Now I barely see them and don't have much time to sit down and call or text them because I have so much work to keep up with and after that I need to go to the gym to train. I have quite a large group of friends that I genuinely like at my school but I don't feel close to them, I don't feel connected to them at all if that makes sense. I really miss my friends from the other school but I know I can't just bail on my academics to be with them. I really want to continue working hard to be successful in school and sports but I really don't know if my 'motivation' is helping my mental health. My life has devolved into the commute to school, homework, the commute back and the gym + a bit of guitar when I have time. I really don't know what makes me happy anymore. What was driving me was thinking that if I work hard in school and in the gym that I'd be happy once I got good grades and became a good fighter and I do have 90s in every subject right now AND am making leaps and bounds as a fighter but right now I don't feel as happy as I thought I would. I don't want to let my parents and myself down but sometimes I just feel like dropping everything, transferring schools and having fun with my friends, and just 'being a teenager'. I wonder am I missing out on 'being a teenager' by having so much on my plate? I think I should ease up on myself but whenever I think of that I just think that no, I should work hard because my parents do so everyday to support me. That's how a good son should think right? 

I really don't know guys, I've spoken to my parents about maybe transferring but they have had a firm no because I dedicated to the program and should follow through. Am I being unreasonable and should just put my head down and work or am I burning out from the stress, anxiety and sleep deprivation of doing so much. I only get like 6 hours max of sleep now so that may be an issue? I really don't know. I knownothing about mental health and am just feeling really lost with all of this. Does anyone have some advice?

I remember my mom coming home at around 11 pm almost every night and I don’t remember much about my dad but I do know my siblings always cleaned buildings with him. My siblings were teenagers when I was around 5-8 and they never really paid attention to me. 

They were also very mean to me and would always say hurtful things to me regarding my appearance. My oldest brother would bully me and when I would cry about it nothing would really be done. I remember crying so hard one night about the hurtful things he said when I was 12-13 and my mom got annoyed by me crying and told me to stop because she was trying to sleep. 

The bullying would continue from my brothers and no one did anything about it, it’s as if my feelings didn’t matter. Throughout my entire life I was constantly invalidated and ignored and as a result I grew to be very lonely and to this day I’m numb to invalidation but it still pains me inside. 

Growing up I also remember having very poor hygiene. I didn’t actually start brushing my teeth until *freshman year* of high school. I didn’t start wearing deodorant until 8th grade. I didn’t really take care of myself because no one taught me how to make a habit out of doing it. No one has ever taught me girly stuff like when to put on lotion, or what to do during my periods (I learned how to at school).

I don’t feel right calling it that when my mom is very worried about mental health right now and she does care about me, she makes sure to give me my medication everyday and calls me on the phone when I’m at different places to check on me.

I'm in my mid 40's and I literally have zero friends or family that I can get emotional support from if ANYTHING bad (or good) happens in my life. Because of this I finally realized after many many years that I just shut down because I can't afford to risk getting emotional about anything.
I work for myself and can literally spend days at home not even seeing people at all.  

Anyway, I've been way overweight up and down my whole life. Got up to 280lb last time
but started keto 2 years ago and I currently weigh 184lb. I obviously feel 100x better 
and realize I can actually maintain this for the rest of my life and intend to. 

Only problem is  I'm more depressed than ever since my ultimate goal was to finally get more interest from women and actually have the confidence to meet them. 

Well now I can get an occasional woman's interest who I really like on dating apps..
but if they ask  to meet up I have to act like a coward and vanish. Why?
Because now that I lost the weight I have terrible loose skin on my upper thighs and mid section.
I feel horrible about myself and honestly can't even look at it in the mirror (I hate everything about the way I look that I literally can go many days without looking in a mirror) so could
hardly let someone else. 

You're going to say.. tell the women..what do you have to lose.. maybe they won't care.
Well remember.. I have zero support network if I get rejected. It's not like I have women
beating down my door. I occasionally match up with someone. There is no way I could handle the rejection of someone hating my body that I already hate when I have no one that
I can even hug that would say ""everything's going to be alright"".


It kills me. There i nothing I can do so I just crawl into a ball even more.


I've tried and tried to make friends at my age which is near impossible and the very few
I have (mostly work acquaintances) I realize we just dont have that type of relationship to let them in on my personal life.

Today I apparently had two anxiety attacks one after the other. I felt very faint and almost hungry, but much more than I've ever felt. I began seeing spots and my head felt like it was being squeezed, at this point I told my uncle. 

I blacked out and at some point I started seeing something. The image was blurred cause everything was spinning at a tremendous speed. It felt like sleep paralysis (I used to get this constantly so I know the feeling) and it felt like I was going insane. So I started screaming and saying ""No"" and ""Stop"".  I woke up on the floor with my uncle holding me and he helped me up so we could walk back to the car.

As we walked out the shop it happened again. Again I blacked out and I felt like I was being thrown around. I woke up with my uncle holding me again and we went to the car. I was okay after that. 

He said i really was screaming and my muscles pulled stiff and i scratched him and scratched myself. We went to a doctor and she told me its anxiety attacks. 

I researched those and nothing came up with fainting or anything. I'd just like to know if it really is that or if there could be something else. I don't have funds for a proper doctor right now.

Oh and I'm not under weight, I had eaten well throughout the day and had plenty of fluids. It was quite hot but I've been in worse and I've been fine.

I don't blame them because in my country mentall illness is seen in a negative way and we don't have enough awarness of it. However, their responses were stupid. They said that its in ""my head"" and its okay to feel shy. I told them its not shyness since I experience it every time I go out. They laughed and said that its not a problem and they know more than me(because ofc the person who is not sick knows more than the sick person). They also asked if my friends suffer from it(they compare me to other teens)

Me and him have been together for 4 years more or less, a year after we met his dad kicked him out of his grandma's house where he lived (his dad is a violent alcoholic) he had just quit his job therefore he had no money, he's had a really rocky past in general but that threw him into a really dark place, he was forced to move in into a friend's house for around four months until we finally found a place, during that time I provided for anything he could need, money, food, emotional support, the idea was for him to find a new job and move in into a new place. He found a really shitty job in a call center and it made his anxiety and depression worse as he was in constant pressure, eventually I realized that if I didn't move in with him he wouldn't be able to do it because of tight money was for him. We moved in, we struggled with money, his job situation got worse and then better, we lived together for 2 years, during that time he fucked up many times, abused alcohol, came home high many times, lied to me, intended to cheat, hid things from me. I broke up with him cause I couldn't take it anymore, and I knew it would throw him into a dark place but I had enough of being hurt. I helped him move into a new place, stuck by his side to make sure he was okay, he wasn't. His life spiraled until the point I stepped in and took control, helped clean his house, get sober, get back on his meds, managed to stop with the cuts. I week after this he had mental meltdown at a concert while he was with me, he mixed his prescribed xanax with alcohol without me knowing and I spent around 3 hours struggling with him on the floor because he wasn't able to reason, he passed out 5 or 6 times, bit me, hit me. As I waited for an ambulance I was told there was no psychiatric ambulance  available and that a regular one would come in but the cops had to be involved in order for that to happen, I had to say yes and I watched as they forced him into the ambulance against his will, I rode with him and had to force him into place as he kicked everything, I had to look into his eyes as I grabbed him in a headlock while on the for him not to hurt himself and so that the police wouldn't hurt him. I immediately got in touch with his phycologist and psychiatric after the episode, got his medicine changed and is doing better but recently he mixed again and ended up with another episode, he finally understood that he can't drink again until after he's finished with treatment and is working on it. He's tired of pills, he's tired of feeling like shit, he's tired of not being to sleep, he's tired of everything, he's just tired. 

He's a really nice person, loving, sweet, he means well but he's been struggling his whole life with all kinds of problems. I stuck by his side all this time and will keep doing it cause I know we can get through this together, I'll never give up on him because he deserves happiness. An hour ago he called me crying, telling me he can't sleep, telling me the pills aren't cutting it, that he doesn't know what to do, I wanted to go to his house but he said he wanted to be alone and I want to respect his decisions but time and time again I realize that when I trust in him I end up regretting it.

1899,AllTheMoose,1547285631,1,"Ever since high school, or even before that, I have been absolutely terrified of people judging me, or thinking I'm boring, or annoying, or embarrassing myself. It got in the way of my grades at times, with stage fright affecting the quality of my presentations, and even more mandatory class discussions that some of my classes had. I took an AP english class my senior year, and half the class revolved around discussing the book we were reading at the time. I remember having so many good ideas, but I never once shared them because I was afraid that my teacher might look down on me for a dumb idea, my classmates might think I'm stupid or boring, and I didn't want to somehow offend somebody by contradicting what someone said or making a comment that others might think I may be saying just to show off. If not for the writing portion of the class, I most definitely would have failed because up until we had to turn in our work, socratic discussion was our only grade because it was the only thing showing that we actually read the book aside from small quizzes that were not worth as much of our grade.

I was a shy kid growing up, and when I moved in 8th grade, it was no different. I was able to make friends quickly and warmed up to everyone in the school pretty fast. Now I didn't talk to everyone, nor did I know everyone, but I wasn't afraid to have a conversation. Hesitant, yes, but did I dread it? No. Not until high school.

In middle school and the start of my freshman year I went to go to different social gatherings. I went to my local teen center and did some events, joined some clubs, joined sports, went to summer camps. All sorts of stuff. By high school however I wasn't able to do those things. Only went to 3 dances, homecoming twice and prom once, mostly because I had a really hard time telling my friends I didn't want to go. I never went to any other dances, never went to a bonfire, never went to see any sports except the ones I had to go to for pep band. I wanted to go to these things really bad, but I dreaded what people might think of me if I had to talk to them, or what they'd think of me if I was alone, or seemed a little confused because I didn't understand the sport, or seemed nervous because I was constantly think about all of these things. So I didn't. I was having such a hard time being so afraid of being judged that I never bought a year book because of what the student selling it might think of me buying a year book when I never talk. I never really participated in school spirit days because I thought people might think it's weird that I was participating and didn't have any friends doing it either, as I juggled friend groups a lot thought the years.

Skip to college and things seemed to be affecting my life outside of school. I rarely ever spoke, much less than I did in high school. I made no friends, not even acquaintances, or even just someone I could talk to when we were asked to discuss something. My grades, again, were affected massively because of these issues. I had a group project in my writing class where we had to write about a community within our community, and had to do a certain number of interviews, and shadow a certain number of meetings. I, being the non-talkative person that I am, unsurprisingly got paired with all the other quiet kids who had no clue what they were doing. I had to set up an interview with a professor and shadow one of the university's clubs for my group's project, and didn't do either. I really wanted to do them, for the sake of my groups grade at the very least but, like a lot of things I have shared, I couldn't. Luckily one of the group members was an over achiever who took control of the whole project, so it wasn't as big of an issue to the group, but it was a huge problem for myself. 

Since I lived with my family, I had to help out with things. One of those things included shopping from time to time. I was asked by my mom to go pick up some dog food at Costco because we were very low and couldn't afford it until then, and try to see if I could get in using her membership card. I told her that they wouldn't let me, when in reality, I parked across the street, thought about all the bad interactions that could happen, and left. I didn't even get out of my car. I took a break after 1 semester (and still haven't gone back a year later) because of the stress taking care of the family was putting on me while my dad lived out of town to finish up his career and retire, and to earn some money to pay off the tuition that hadn't been paid (my parents have a college fund for me but decided not to use it for a whole other story). I got a job but haven't been able to pay off my tuition yet because I have been too afraid that the school councilor I need to talk to in order to start paying for it because I fear he might judge me, or belittle me for not paying it yet, or think I pathetic. I work retail so I see a lot of customers everyday (not so much in the winter but definitely in the spring and summer), and have a hard time interacting. Most of the time if I'm not being asked a question, I get too nervous and just laugh instead of talking. I have had a couple panic attacks from being embarrassed by something I said to a customer, or on the overhead speakers. Not to mention the amount of times I have gone to lunch almost too late because I was to afraid to call up front, or a different department to cover my lunch ( I worked in the garden section, and we had registers back there and doors, so somebody had to be near the registers as long as the doors were open, and I was usually there alone), or because I took too long rehearsing what I was going to say, and any follow up responses I may need to use. The whole reason I even got the job, which was not my first choice, was because I was too afraid to tell the interviewer that I was in the process of applying to other jobs, and wasn't sure where I'd work yet, and got hired on the spot.

And now here I am. Nearly 2 years out of high school with only a semester of college, no friends aside from a few from high school who I never talk to, telling a really long, probably boring story about how I can't handle what others MAY, but probably don't, think of me. Maybe I'm just shy and I need to get over it, IDK. Guess I just needed to rant a little bit. Thank you anyone who read the whole thing, means a lot.",mentalhealth,Why am I so afraid of people?,2019-01-12 20:33:51
1900,intoxicatedpotato18,1547284042,1,"Okay this is sort of my story and my journey with depression. Not really meant to be an inspirational story, but I do hope it pushes you to fight a little bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in a broken family, with my father leaving us for another woman when I was 5 years old. For about 6 years, he did not contact us at all. Times when he did pick up our calls, he would just scold us and hang up the phone. Of course, eventually we (mom, sist and I) stopped. Fortunately, my mom was a strong woman who managed to brought both of us up. But yes, with her working, we barely spent time as a family. I grew up on the reliance of a domestic worker. It was fine. I turn out still pretty okay except for going through the rebellion stage around 11 to 12 years old. But also, when I reached 11, my father decided to come back into our life. Only after fighting the court case when he was then ordered to pay maintenance fees to my mother. So my sister and I would see him once a week. My mom forbid any meeting with his new wife. I was fine with that. I saw her as a homewrecker, I did not want anything to do with him either. Weeks and weeks just pass on with our weekly lunch. It was always the same conversation at the start. ""How's school? How's your results? Are you coping?"". There was still hatred in me towards him at this point. Towards later, the bond with him started strengthening. I would tell him about my (then) boyfriend and also talk abit more about my social life. 

However in August 2017, he passed away suddenly of a heart attack. Part of me regretted not forgiving earlier and rebuilding that bond earlier. But a huge part of me was also filled with hatred and anger. For him leaving us. I remember as I was sending him off, I was constantly scolding him and spewing out all my hatred towards him. Telling him that he deserved it. Seeing his wife did not help it either. Of course the hatred finally died down. But I was filled with guilt for months for saying that to him. Did not really dare to go visit him either. In the midst of these chaotic part of my life, my then boyfriend also decided to break up with me, saying that he could not handle me. That of course catalyzed my situation on top of my upcoming examinations. 

Lost my motivation to do work, was sleeping more than I should have, stopped playing the guitar. Having outbursts randomly at times. Feeling so empty. Having suicide thoughts. Planning, but never executed them because I was too scared.  The once cheerful me died. But part of me kept pushing this issue away. Telling myself that it will be temporary. That it would not really affect my daily life. But it did. In the mid of September, during my examinations, my mom decided to ask me to go see a psychologist as I skipped my last paper. I was showing signs of depression, she said. We started just having therapy session, in hopes that talking out would make me feel much better. It was weird at first. To open up to a total stranger. But it helped a little to get these negativity out.  There was a little progress at first. Up to December, when we decided that we should meet up again in one months instead of our fortnightly session. 

But that was when it started going downhill again. With a whole month of holiday and an upcoming examination in January again, I still had not truly found my motivation to study. My mind wondered a lot. And you know how they say, a quiet mind is a devil's workshop. But I found comfort in helping people. Which happened to be my distraction at that point of time. Constantly consoling my friends who were also going through a bit of a tough time. But I gave and gave that I continued losing myself. I took their pain too, to the point I couldn't take it anymore as well. I did not tell them. I just helped whenever I could. Because I thought that was better for me. But I started surviving from day to day.

&amp;#x200B;

One day it hit me really hard how numb I've become. I went for one of my favourite's band concert. But I felt like I was forcing myself so much to enjoy it when clearly I did not. It killed me so many times to know that I had truly lost myself. I spent the whole day wailing and crying out loud. I decided to then confide into one of my friend. This friend then introduced me to another friend (who is now my boyfriend) who had depression as well. He helped me so far. He recommended me his psychiatrist, who put me on medicine. I started feeling again (not saying that anti-depressant is the miracle to curing depression but also of course other positive things). And it was great for me. Though there are still episodes here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

I think one thing that many of us who gets stuck in our own hell hole, we don't dare to seek help. Something that I faced earlier on, with the stigma of mental illness. One of my friend once told me this ""If you want to live your life like this, it will be a pity"". It may seem harsh and insensitive. But it is true. It will be a pity that you would not be able to live life to its fullest.

There should not be any shame in seeking help. Don't keep denying the issue. Any issue, big or small, is still an issue. If it bothers you, it is an issue. Talk it out with anyone, your parents, your friends, or maybe even me.

I know that there are some who truly are not able to afford it. But if you can, please go seek help. Otherwise, I will be willing to share a listening ear. And I do hope that people subscribe to these subreddit would also help one another. 

Also, parents, do be there to support your children. You are their greatest pillar of support. Don't undermine their issues. My mom had constantly told me to just ""be happy"" and that I was ""thinking too much"". It constantly made me feel so awful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Friends, look out for the signs. Help your friends. You may not know how impactful your actions can be.

my boyfriend of six months is so kind and sweet, but he went through a lot during his childhood (and even goes through a lot of stuff now) that messed him up emotionally. to deal with the pain, he repressed a lot of his bad memories and bad emotions. it has gotten so severe that now he has this ""switch"" (that's what we call it) that turns off and on, controlling whether he feels anything or not. He has no control of it, and it has caused a lot of problems. his switch has been mostly off for months at a time before.

sometimes, i'll be upset but he won't be able to comfort me the way i need because he just can't feel anything - whether that be because me being upset made his switch turn off or because it was off in the first place. we could even be having a great time laughing and all of the sudden it just turns off - there isn't even a clear reason for it to happen all the time.

there is obviously a deep issue here that needs to be addressed with a therapist and maybe even a psychiatrist. he used to be on antidepressants but isn't now for various reasons.

he's going to get professional help (hopefully very soon), but i would like to know both what i can do for him and what he can do for himself. healthy coping mechanisms, etc. where should we start? anything would be helpful.

i apologize for keeping this so general; i wanted to ensure his privacy and even asked him for permission to post this. i only want to help him and be there for him, but neither of us know how to handle it well. if you have any questions or need me to elaborate on something, feel free. thank y'all so much.",mentalhealth,help with emotional repression,2019-01-12 18:25:58
1904,missamandajones,1547277482,1,"Right now I’m in a residential mental health program. I willing came here, and am willingly spending $20k a month just to be stuck in a situation that is making matters worse. 
The program involves “groups” in the morning, regular therapy sessions, lame ass outings and extreme social isolation. The other clients here are very cliquey so I have no people to regularly hang with. I spent Christmas alone, as I do my nights and weekends. 

Another huge drawback is that it is a sober program (though I never had issues with substances) so a strict curfew is enforced as well as daily breathalyzers and random drug tests. Honestly even though I don’t even like drinking all that much I miss going to the bars just to relax and listen to music and mingle. 

Yet another drawback is that I am in a city where I don’t know a soul. My car is back home so getting around is tough, and because I don’t have any friends here (and honestly I don’t have too many in general) I am not only incredibly bored and lonely but I am also not independent as I have been for the last decade of my life.  

A final issue is that I was transitioning MtF in 2017 and have a female name, though I now present as male. I am in a conservative area and as part of the community integration aspect I am supposed to find a job. That’s fine with me as I want a job, but I don’t think my trans past is going to make it easy for me. I am very visibly someone who went through changes . Changing my name in Texas will be difficult due to various reasons I won’t go into here. I’m a California resident and if I went back there I could change my name back without a fuss, or not. I could be trans and get a job there too (though I am not going in that direction). I really want to be in a liberal area again.

I am here because I had a breakdown in LA and my uncle, the executor of my trust I inherited from my father after his passing, suggested I come for a “few months,” and I decided to take the risk to see if it would help. It has helped in certain ways but being in isolated in a city where I don’t know anybody is taking a huge toll on me. 

Should I dip out of here or not? My plan is to get my car and drive back to LA but that seems rather impulsive and dicey. I really don’t want to leave only to go home to Iowa, but now my trust is dwindling I need to take action.

MY STORY

I never had anxiety until I turned 17. It got worse and worse until I had my first panic attack soon after my 18th birthday. After the panic attack I felt spacey, out of control of my body, just living in autopilot which lasted 3 days before suddenly. Poof. My memory was just gone. I had no idea who I was, what I was, where I was, didn’t recognize anyone in my own family... it was absolutely insane and I felt like I was losing my mind. It comes back in bits and pieces when I try to remember the 3 weeks living with dissociative amnesia. A lot of this is just what I was told I did but some of it is foggy first hand memories. 

I told my dad I felt like everything was a dream and he just accused me of doing drugs which I had never even done aside from smoking weed with friends on the weekends. He said it would wear off and I’d be fine soon. 2 days later I was still obviously confused and had no idea what was going on around me, what day it was, I was basically insane. $13,000 for a 36 hour stay in the hospital later and the doctor diagnosed me with dissociative amnesia and said I was in a fugue state. 

I was insane in the hospital. Apparently I pulled an IV out of my arm bc I didn’t know why it was in there, I called an ex gf thinking she was my girlfriend for some reason and she came and visited at some point. I was told at one point they rolled my wheelchair over to a window and I said to the nurse “one of these days my dads going to visit me”. I thought I had been there for weeks and was checked into a psyche ward when really I was only there for 12 hours at that point.  My dad had never left the side of my hospital bed and I had no fucking idea what was going on. It was like my brain invented a backstory as to why I was there. I had no idea if I was dreaming or awake. It was like a psychotic episode. 

They flew out a specialist for this who did some weird ass tests. One thing I specifically remember was him saying 10 words and after each word jabbing my foot with something sharp. They released me shortly after and I had to go back to the hospital to see the specialist again in 2 weeks.

I basically laid in bed for 2 weeks and have no memories at all. I missed school and I think I only got out of bed to eat and go to the bathroom and shower. 

When we went back to the specialist he asked me what the 10 words were and apparently I remembered them. He declared that it wasn’t any brain issue and that he thought it was brought on my severe anxiety and that eventually I’d snap out of it more than likely. 

My parents put me back in school and my friends kinda took care of me and drove me to and from school. Some thought I was faking it so people were fucking with me a lot. Someone went as far as to say I owed them money and I guess I believed them right away and gave it to them (when I came back to reality they apologized profusely and gave it back to me). 

Randomly I came to at my friends birthday party at some water park in The Dells. And everyone was shocked. I couldn’t believe where I was and was immediately so happy but confused. It was the oddest thing but I just snapped out of it over the course of about 2 hours and was entirely normal. 

Unfortunately it happened again 6 months later after another panic attack, lasted 2 weeks, and I came really close to hanging myself because I couldn’t take it anymore. 

When I snapped out of it the second time I made a commitment to solving the problem and saw my doctor. He was great and helped me begin to get things under control. They got me Xanax and he said when I feel the panic attacks coming on to just take them as needed. After my first time stopping a panic attack a month later, just having the pills on me was like a security blanket and I went years without panic attacks and just dealt with some anxiety, depression, and occasional hour or two DP moment when my anxiety got severe. 

When I graduated college at 22 I made a huge move and had a temporary stay with my mom for 2 weeks. The change was big and because of that I had a panic attack and after that had about a week of DP and anxiety where I spent a lot of the time nauseous and throwing up and shaking. I didn’t lose my memory though because every time the anxiety got horrible I took a a Xanax to calm down. 

I started smoking weed everyday after this somehow which greatly helped my anxiety and slowed my brain down from overthinking and kept my headspace positive. I got into meditation, eating better, stretching, and self care. Pretty quickly I stopped carrying my Xanax everywhere and I felt fine. The past 4 years have been amazing. 

Randomly a week and a half ago I had a panic attack on a train in Chicago after I almost puked on the passengers, poured water all over myself like a crazy person because I was so hot and nauseous, and got off the train to almost not make it to a bathroom and shit my pants bc I was sick. I felt humiliated and suddenly had a fear of public transportation. 

It was one of the most challenging weeks of my life fighting DP recently after thinking I was cured of it but I beat it again and I have some tips for how I do it each time. 

Each episode I’ve had has been shorter than the last and I feel so powerful for having beaten it again. 
____________________

TIPS

1. Get your anxiety under control. Find a psychiatrist and if you’re frequently anxious get on some kind of antidepressant/anti anxiety medication or if you’re episodic like me get something like Xanax and don’t abuse it. 

2. Meditate and reframe your mind. This was a huge one for me. Accept the moment you are in as perfect. There is no before, there is no after, there is just this moment. Focus on your breath, your body, and this single moment. Accept it for what it is and live with it. Make it sacred. This is all a part of the masterpiece that is your life and it will shape you. 

3. Let it be known how you feel. Your true friends will be accepting and help you through it. My wife just made sure I was eating and sleeping and meditating and helped calm me down when I got upset or worked myself up with the weird DP/DR anxiety thoughts and emotional numbness. Crying felt so good and much better than the emotional void. 

4. Try to work out. It’s good for your brain chemicals, your body, keeps you busy, and also stimulates your appetite. Leading me to the next tip

5. Eat good foods and try to cook. Cooking is another activity that helps keep your mind off things and only allows you to think in the moment. Good calorie dense meals will fuel your brain. 

6. ACCEPT THAT DP/DR IS A PART OF YOUR LIFE! It’s not going to go away forever, it’s a part of you even if you don’t have a full on episode ever again it will still creep on you once in a while. The most important thing is to not give it power. The idea of DP/DR is so panic inducing to me on its own. Obsessing over it and reading about it isn’t helping you. Accept it, forget about it, and try to relax. Get off this sub if you’re currently dealing with it. You’re just working yourself up and prolonging your episode. 

7. Stay busy and don’t stay home the entire time. Going for mindfulness walks and volunteering  at an animal shelter really helped me. It feels good to do good things.

     * I can’t wake up / fall asleep , I’m always in my bed , my mum has to force me to shower ( very embarrassing but oh well ..) I HAVE BEEN SEEING PSYCHIATRISTS since idk 2014 and it’s clearly not helping. NO I am not refusing to be treated , I hate being like this , I know that it’s not who I really am that I am a cheerful I just want to be as happy as I use to be ;  but 2  different psychiatrists basically told me « well sorry I can’t do anything for you just  stop the treatment I’ve been giving u byyye » 

     * (Some backstory might help ) my dad left when i turned 2 y.o so I don’t remember how it felt. Since my parents were married, they had to get a divorce which stated that he had to visit 1 weekend out of 2 and  half of school breaks ... never really the case and last time I saw / talk to him was in 2011 . I think he just doesn’t want to have anything to do with me ( me , my sister and mum ) But I think I’ve been living this pretty ok since it’s the norm for me . At least he has never been physically violent. 

     * I was a Super cheerful happy kid until ~11yo .  I was sexually assaulted by a « « « « « « « friend « « « « « « « «  ( I thought he was ) and since it was the very beginning of puberty, it completely messed up my relationship with men in general ( I see them as a threat no matter what ) and most importantly with my body I absolutely HATE IT 

     * I can’t look into mirror , or even seeing my reflection when my screen turns black , passing in front of windows makes me wanna throw up. Even now just thinking about my discusting body makes me want to puke or cry. I recently went ( was forced )to the hairdresser . Long story short I cried all the way home and broke a mirror. 

     * I’ve been dealing with anorexia and bulimia since ~ end of 2014 I basically didn’t eat until late summer 2015 ( I weighted 36 kg for 160cm / 79 lbs for 5ft 25 ) never taken to a hospital to teach me how to eat so my eating pattern is catastrophic . I fell right after into pretty serious bulimia for ~ 7 months. This time got admitted in a hospital, literally wasn’t able to eat for 3 weeks, they left me out like «  it’s your problem now &lt;3 take care of it on your own “

     * Then we moved far away with my family but I couldn’t even go to school and stayed in my bed for a year , only going out to see psychiatrists/ therapists

     * I was able to go to school from sept 2017 to July 2018 ( a whole year yeah ! ) but only managed to do sept 2018 to mid November 2018 ..... 

     * Right now , what I m thinking is that I got NO future ( I can’t go to to scientific - ish university, I have no talent, I am not pretty , I have absolutely nothing for me, so what’s the point of continuing to suffer , I see no exit but death but I know my mum and sis will be sad but just for a bit and then all their problems will be gone. Because I am the problem . I hurt everyone close to me by being something that I hate being but I can’t help it. My mum keeps saying that she can’t take it anymore she’s getting old and we don’t know what could happen to her . I am tired of hurting people around me. And dying is the only way to relieve them. Yeah they might be sad at first but it will improve their life not having me in theirs. But I am a coward 

     * I have no passion except music it has been part of my life even before I knew how to read, today I just came out of my first singing lesson and it was hell, I cried , I can’t sing ( because I have never with my chest voice) And my heart is crushed. I feel like shit.Music was the only thing I had left keeping me sane. I couldn’t count on my academic skills to find a career so why not ... pursue my wildest dream .. performing on stage, writing albums. But Know I realize I have no future so what’s the point. I can’t do anything, why should I keep on suffering, I don’t even know if it’ll ever get better. Dying at least will make all my thought disappear

1924,ah-breezy,1547256749,1,"***Hello, I'm new here. I wanted to post this because I wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience. It's also important to note that I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I've also struggled with insomnia and sleep before in the past.***

Whenever I attempt to fall asleep at night, I always get the same feeling. I'm worried that I'll end up scaring myself and end up not being able to fall asleep. I do this almost every night. I'll get in bed, wish my girlfriend a good night's sleep, and then try to close my eyes. Then, out of nowhere, I'll start having thoughts running through my head, thoughts that don't even make sense but I'll be almost convinced that it could actually happen.

This rarely happens but, if I'm just starting to fall asleep, I'll hear conversations. Voices out of nowhere that don't make sense because I can't understand. Sometimes it won't even be voices, it'll be a loud noise or bang. But even after that, I'll just fall back asleep and remember it the next morning.

The one thought that always scares me is the thought that if I don't have my body completely covered by the blankets, then someone or something will be able to hurt whatever part of my body that is not covered. It's like a horror film or something, I'll be terrified that someone could be in the room, waiting for a chance to strike at an uncovered limb. So, I'll cover my whole body with a blanket and make a tiny hole so that I can stick my nose in it and breathe in cold air, otherwise, I'll just sweat and it'll just get harder and harder to breathe.

I don't want to wake my girlfriend up, so, I just lay there until I eventually fall asleep. It's really scary and it happens very frequently. I'm not sure why.

1930,superstarcola,1547250851,1,"First of all, hi! I'm a looooooong time lurker, first time poster. I decided it was finally time to join when I was seeking communities of people who share my various quirks.

Like many people who suffer from major depression, this spiral started some time ago and continues to get progressively worse over time. I'm feeling very out of sorts and helpless... I've been seeking help from literally every outlet I can think of-- from my family doctor- to a new therapist- to medication- to self help books, and nothing seems to help. My depression is negatively impacting everything in my life. My social circle in the city I live in minuscule at best, my depression is taking a toll on my partner and our relationship, I'm finding work increasingly stressful, less enjoyable, and aggravating the issue. 

I started regularly seeing my GP again when I started having (very scary) thoughts of suicide. I was very open with her, as she was with me. We started trying new medications, but my GP fairly admitted that a psychiatrist may be a better judge. She referred me off, noting that I was having suicidal thoughts, in an effort to rush the referral. Seven weeks later, I was finally contacted, and an appointment was made for three weeks after that. I was off-put by the wait time, in the meantime I met with some new therapists to work with.
I finally met with the psychiatrist, and to put it bluntly, he was awful. He spent the entire appointment discussing how terrible he thinks men are, prescribed me a family of medications I have documented issues with (spoiler alert: it didn't help) and sent me on my way, never to be seen again. I met with my GP immediately after, expressed my disappointment, and my fears of self harm. She put me on another waitlist for a comprehensive program in my area. They were very up front about their long waits (9 months +) so I needed to do something in the meantime. No suggestion as to what, however.
Long story short, while i wait in limbo, feeling very failed by Canada's mental health system, my mental state is steadily declining. I've been trying to mitigate this with therapy for myself, and couples therapy with my partner, working with a personal trainer for fitness, being diligent about my medication, regular visits to my GP, etc... but I'm still getting worse. The other day I came up with a plan, and that really scared me. I need help, I've been asking for help from every outlet I know of, and I'm feeling forgotten or ignored.
My boyfriend and I have talked about taking me to emergency, and I'm honestly scared of either outcome. If they think I'm ""not bad enough"" and send me home, I will leave feeling more worthless than ever. If they think I should stay, I haven't stayed overnight in a hospital, and I dont know what to expect.
Have any of you done inpatient at a hospital? What can I expect? Is it worth going, or will I just be shoved aside?

TLDR; I'm struggling more than I am capable of handling with my depression and am seeking thoughts/experience/ advice on seeking inpatient therapy.

Thanks in advance. I know this is hard to talk about.

1931,mirko869,1547250224,1,"Hello all. 27/M here, lifelong moderate to severe depression and anxiety sufferer.


I'll cut to the chase - March 2018, after resisting medication for so long, I began taking 25mg of Valdoxan (Agomelatine) - and the results were life changing. 


I got up each day with bountiful energy, stopped playing video games every night and became a social butterfly. Went on so many good dates, became great at my jobs. Life was what it was supposed to be, and I couldn't believe how much time I had wasted needlessly suffering in the past.


Around 4 months in, I began noticing rapid hair loss. I never thought hair loss would bother me at much as it has, but it caused enough anxiety to make the medication redundant. I only found ONE reported case of alopecia induced by agomelatine use  [HERE](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750573.2017.1338821). Other than the one reported case, it seems to be a rare side effect.  I am not taking any other prescription medications.


I discontinued the medication in September, and my hair seemed to return slowly. I managed to enjoy October and some of November without depressive symptoms, yet I now find myself at the bottom of the black hole again. The classic symptoms are back - social withdrawal, complete lack of energy, feeling like everyone hates me (even though I know it to not be true, logically at least). The only time I feel relatively normal is without a decent amount of alcohol in my system.


I reached a low point last night, and took a Valdoxan pill out of desperation. Although the medicine takes a while to build up in your system, I can already notice a difference in my energy. Hell, it's 7:30am and here I am rapidly typing this.


Has anyone else had this side effect? Is there anyway around it? I can't continue my life suffering this much for no good reason.


The other option was to begin taking Venlafaxine. The patient in the study I linked above discontinued Valdoxan and started Venlafaxine without hair loss. I've always been resistant to the idea of taking SSRIs or anything similar, but if anyone has experience with this medication I'd love to have your input.


Thank you everyone, stay strong.

17 Male

Ever since my late childhood/ early adolescent years I have suffered with depression and anxiety but over the last couple months my mental state has started to deteriorate rapidly I'm worried that I may be on the cusp of developing a more severe mental disorder. Recently I have noticed that I am experiencing extremely paranoid delusions. Delusions where I am always thinking people are going to start fighting me at any moment. Whenever I walk past someone I don't know on the street I tense up and get ready to fight them and I vividly imagine defending myself against an attack and planning where I would run to. I am aware that this is delusional but I can't seem to stop doing it. I can never put my guard down until I become comfortable with a person and even then I am suspicious that something is going on. Even my close friends, who I meet up with regularly and have done so for four years, are becoming objects of my paranoia. I always think the worst of them, I think that they are trying to steal from me and I think that they aren't really my friends, they don't like me, and that they are pretending to be friendly so they can manipulate me and take advantage of me. I truly think everyone is fake most of the time and I never trust anyone at all so I always prepare myself for the worst case scenarios. I have also started to notice that I am making extravagant links to random matters that are completely unrelated whatsoever. For example my teacher may be teaching a specific topic like the human biological response to physical attraction to another person and I'll believe that it's because she can tell that I ""fancy"" another member of the class, so I will watch the teachers eye contact to see whether she looks at me or another when saying specific words like ""attraction"". I also think things like my mood has an effect on the weather or I will count the  amount of white vans that pass me in case they are undercover police. I know sounds crazy as fuck but I'm always in a paranoid bubble that I can't break out of. However, I have tried to diagnose these delusions by looking at aspects that might be causing them other than mental illness. Firstly I stopped cannabis and drug consumption for a month just to clear my mind but the delusions still persisted through that month and in fact continued to further increase in frequency as they have been doing for months. ( I know it is possible that drugs may have caused all this to begin and the damage is probably irreversible due to my frequent abuse of weed and infrequent abuse of several other drugs including but not exclusively LSD, MDMA, 2C-B, Codeine, Benzos, Nitrous Oxide, Inhalants, Morphine, Pregabalin.)  Secondly I just attributed this all to the vivid imagination that I've always had but I'm pretty sure that most people, even those that are heavily creative, don't believe figments of their imaginations to be reality as I have started doing. Thirdly a reason for my paranoia around people may be because of a mugging that happened to me a few months back where my friends ran off and left me alone to deal with it myself but this doesn't explain the non-violent delusions I am experiencing as well as the violent ones. This has lead me into researching causes and a close friend of mine suggested I might be experiencing the early symptoms of something like psychosis. 

Other things that I have started experiencing more often are: Auditory hallucinations before I sleep (but I'm still completely awake and aware of them. Also, they don't say much they just sound like abstracted human voices), visual hallucinations when I smoke weed that none of my friends seem to get when smoking the same buds, visual and tactile hallucinations when waking up (once I saw a hand on my pillow for a brief second and it scared the shit out of me then I realised it wasn't there), constant visual static at all times (what once were solid colours are now objects constructed of sporadically changing tiny pixel like things that sometimes flash quite bright, incoherent thoughts and thought patterns (regularly forgetting topics of conversations and blanking out when people are speaking to me, lack of motivation, slight lack of coordination (some days I walk like Jack Sparrow and crash into things even when I'm completely sober lol), night terrors (being trapped in dreams that are truly terrifying. I'm pretty sure I sold my soul to the devil in one because he trapped me in a cycle of being asleep and being awake for a few hours. (I'm not even religious but it was a bad night)), inconsistent sleep schedule (recently I've sleeping alright, I just wake up really early which is unusual because I usually sleep till 11-12am if I'm left alone), manic and depressive episodes, confusion, suicidal thoughts (this has been the average for a while so nothings changed with that lol).

A lot of these things don't really affect me at all apart from the paranoia and delusions which really distract me from school and have caused me to fight with many of my friends. All other hallucinations are kinda minor but are becoming more frequent, I'm just scared what will happen if they get worse. I don't think this shit will mix well with my severe depression and all that other crap. I just need someone to tell me what they experienced as they developed psychosis or something similar just so I can judge whether I should get this checked out or not. Also if anyone can give advice or anything it will be great and I appreciate it. Also sorry if this is the wrong place to post, idk, just need to get this shit of my chest idk who to talk about it to.

I'm a 16 year old student in the UK sitting GCSEs (interrnational exams) and preparing for SATs (I am a US citizen and plan to move there for uni) at a highly competitive, high level private school. However, I have recently started to get to a point where I feel like I almost cannot continue: my sleep schedule has been thrown off (if lucky I get 6 hours a day), I have feelings of worthlessness, swings in hunger and I have started snacking regularly, leading me to put on weight. I have also started developing what Google tells me are stress-related tics: random spasms of my upper eyelid and the muscles in my left arm.

I start to cry, and if nobody comforts me, it slowly escalates until I am screaming and 100% convinced that everyone is out to get me and that I need to divorce my husband. It sucks for everyone involved, and we have an action plan in place for when they do happen. The action plan is for my husband and it is a set of instructions for him to follow, like give me a hug and tell me we are a team when he sees me starting to cry. We developed this plan with our therapists, and my husband agreed to use it. Only, he almost never does. A few times he has done it and it absolutely worked - we did not escalate the fight and I was able to apologize, take responsibility,, and remedy my actions. Usually, though when I start to get upset, he completely ignores the plan and engages in the fight with me. I know that it is really hard to follow the plan in the moment, but he did agree to do it. Afterwards, when I finally calm down, I ask him why he ignored the plan, and he basically just tells me I get so crazy that he gets too upset and does not want to hug me or talk to me. I am at a loss.

I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, although I do not currently meet all of the criteria to qualify for the disorder (usually you need to have at least 5 qualifying factors for a diagnosis) but I still just go through life as though I always have BPD and it always needs monitoring. I don’t self-harm or threaten suicide or even really freak out anymore, and I do a lot of self care. I still recognize that I can be hard to be with. I have been released from therapy because my therapist felt that I had rehabilitated and now possess all the tools I need to cope with normal struggles, but the door is still open if I feel like I need to go back. I have not felt the need to go back and nobody has suggested that I do. So, except for these nuclear fights, I am doing really well.

The fights always start over something minor (last night it was that my husband did not put up the baby gate so our son got into an off-limits area) and ends up with us screaming in each other’s faces. I always feel like I start off calm, I express myself, my husband will debate with me about my issue and then I feel unheard, I start crying, my husband won’t reach out to me because he thinks I am crying for attention, I get angry and resentful, I start yelling, he yells back, I tell him I don’t know why we are even married, one of us says we are leaving, then my husband hears this and suddenly decides to be nice, at which point I am at nuclear meltdown level and will just push him away and tell him he is too late.

None of this feels fair. It is unfair for him to have a wife who is mentally broken. It is unfair for me to have to deal with this illness. It is unfair for him to agree to follow a specific set of guidelines and then fail to do that in the moment. It is unfair for me to expect that to be easy when I am screaming and/or crying.

When we talk calmly about it, my husband says that he can see how just reaching out to me would absolutely help. It has worked in the past, on the few occasions he was able to try it. He says he knows it will work but that it feels like he is just rewarding me for bad behavior. I said that it is not fair for him to take on a parental role for me, and reminded him that the roles have been reversed before with his mental illnesses (he has bipolar and adhd) and that stance only created conflict then, too. I pointed out that this stance also consistently escalates our fights, so it also does not even work to curb my “bad behavior.” He agreed, but he also said that he shouldn’t have to deal with me when I “fly off the handle.” 

I finally said that if he cannot accept all of me, he gets none of me. I know I am not easy to be with but I am not begging him to stick around or be with me, either. I have been clear about my limits and my needs to the point that two therapists agreed that the action plan was a healthy and acceptable course of action for me, and my husband signed off on it. I don’t want to split up, but I also can’t keep doing this. I understand my own limits and needs, and if he is unable to agree to them, we don’t need to keep doing this. I don’t want to make him suffer through my episodes but I also don’t deserve to be treated like a burden when I am doing everything I can to reduce the emotional load of my problems. 

Thanks for reading. My husband is at a dental appointment and then I am sure we will talk again, but now I have little hope that the words will be anything but hollow promises.",mentalhealth,Mental Illness vs. My Marriage,2019-01-12 08:24:35

I won’t go into too much detail but if I return to London I will end up committing suicide.

In my hometown I’m being treated with the home team (they come to your house and check up on you)

The goal is to get me back to London so I can continue with university.

I think the only way that will effectively aid my transition back to London is if I was taken there by someone straight into an inpatient facility so I can experience the fear of returning and be helped through it without being a danger to myself. 

Is it okay to ask for this kind of help? I understand that I am demonstrating a strange amount of rational thinking for someone who is experiencing very strong suicidal inclinations but that is also partially what has caused alarm to my situation, because I’ve ‘rationally’ decided to take my life if I go back to London.

1947,Chingo_Rodrigo,1547235931,1,"Hi Reddit,

To start, he is clinically diagnosed with depression. He's a 22 year old male.

I've been friends with him for 10 years now and he's always had a hard life and struggled with depression. He went to college after high school but dropped out in the middle of his second year. He married and lived off of family money to get started and they both worked minimum wage jobs to get by. He was able to save some money and maintain his life, but after things went bad he wasn't able to work enough to pay his bills. He ended up in debt and lost the apartment he lived in. He was going to go back to live with his grandmother, but she lived in a rural area with barely any job opportunities. He also had resentment towards her for how bad his childhood was, so I offered my house to him so he could get on his feet.

I offered no rent so he could pay his debt, he just had to handle the chores in the home. I told him he needed an education so if life throws another curve ball then he would have a safety net. I work in IT with job experience and only certifications, and I do well enough. I told him he didn't need college and that a cert could get him into a good field like welding or IT. I even offered to pay for the test. He told me before moving here that he would study for one and get a job. It's been 3 months and he has made no progress on his education and he works a part time job with only 10-20 hours per week. He watches TV and plays games and he has made little effort to better himself even when he has free time at home for 90% of the time.

I have confronted him and he always says he's depressed and unmotivated and that he's off his meds. I asked what he was going to do then, because if you're working a job that makes no money and you aren't raising your employment level, then you're gonna be stuck in a rut forever. He says he'll just die if he has no where to live. We can't get him social security for another 5 months and he says he can't afford a doctor visit to get the meds. I understand depression can be crippling, but I see no drive from him to get better and I'm not sure if the meds will help. If I wait 5 months and he doesn't get that motivation from the meds then would I have just been used? Is it all the depression or is he being lazy too? I can't get into his head but it's crazy to me that your friend would be fully supporting you and you wouldn't be determined to get a least a second part time job.

Are there any counselors he can go to before he gets his social security? Am I giving him too much so he doesn't have a reason to try? I want to tell him that he's either gonna get a full time job/education or he has to leave, but I'm scared because he has this mindset that he'll just lay down and die, or is he saying all that to hold me emotionally hostage? I don't want to assume anything, but he doesn't act like a depressed man. He acts like a lazy man. He talks about laying down and dying and how he doesn't enjoy life, but he still laughs and smiles and he's always down to go out and do stuff. He says it's just how he reacts but he doesn't actually feel the emotion of joy. Is that something that can happen with depression?

1948,Jomppasaurus,1547235236,1,"Sorry

A couple of months before christmas I noticed that I wasn't feeling like myself. Like, I was panicking over everything and crying and feeling awful.

I literally got a panick attack or something when I raised my hand in class when we were having a discussion. Like, I WANTED to say my opinion, and once the teacher pointed at me, I couldn't get a word out of my mouth and started sweating and shaking and my face went red.
The same thing happened when I got to school one day and noticed that my period had started and I had blood on my light grey pants,so ot was very visible. Like, I was literally crying in the bathroom, even though I could have just gotten my bike and went home to change my pants (which I eventually did, but was late to class and shaking again when I got there).

I've also been feeling like I'm just a waste of space and will never be anything useful. I don't know what I want to do after high school, I have no idea what career I would want, everything I might be interested in is very difficult and I don't think I could even get the education for,and my grades suck even though I really try my best. And that makes my oarents really mad at me, which makes me even more stressed.
Even in the school subjects where I thought I was good or ok at, my grades suck. Even in art (not saying that I ahould be getting the best grades from art or anything or that I'm some master artist blah blah blah, was just dissapointed when I saw my grades) 

I constantly feel like everyone hates me and just pretends to like me because they'd feel bad if they didn't, even the people I've been friends with for over 9 years (almost 10) and who have always been there for me, no matter what.

Also my mom is mad at me and I have no idea what I did wrong, she hasn't spoken to me all day, except when she came to yell at me when I didn't come eat the second she told me to.

And I've been eating very little and have no appetite at all, which I hate because I'm already skinny enough and feel gross because my arms are so unnaturally skinny and my spine ia so visible and one girls told me once that it lookes gross. And I'm super hairy everywhere, eacpecially on my arms so I can't wear a T-shirt, and my mom is like ""No you can't shave your arms, it's a pain in the ass! And I've seen people with more hair than you and your's is barely visible (which is a lie, btw, the hair on my arms is very much visible and dark)"" 

I tried to talk to my parents about the panick attacks I keep having almost every day, but they just started making jokes and laughing, and then got mad at me when I got upset. So now I don't want to even talk to yhem about it.
And my best friend is telling me to go to our school nurse to talk about this stuff, but I CAN'T talk to a stranger, it just feels so weird and I'm scared she'll just be like ""oh it's ok, you're a teenager and this is normal, just eat healthily and get some sleep and you'll be fine"". I mean, sure, if that's really all I need then that's great! But at the same time, I try my best to be healthy, but after a sy or two I just lose all motivation because I don't have an appetite and just can't sleep.

I want to fucking kill myself but I'm a coward and just can't bring myself to do it so I'm just waiting for SOMETHING to happen. ",mentalhealth,"Sorry, just gotta vent somewhere.",2019-01-12 06:33:56

I (28F) have been dating my partner (29M) for over a year, and we have a great, healthy relationship. He admitted to me early on that he had a history of mental illness, and I chose not to pry because it didn't seem like he was quite ready to talk about it. I too have struggled with mental illness, and it has never been a deterrent for me in relationships.

A few weeks ago, he confessed to me that he has Primarily Obsessional OCD. I was familiar with OCD (it runs in my family) but I had never heard of PO OCD before, and quickly did research to try to understand what he'd been going through. As far as I understand, it wouldn't be helpful to either of us for him to share his intrusive thoughts with me, but I do wonder if it would be helpful for me to be able to identify when he's having them, or if he's having an episode (I don't think it has ever happened in my presence, but I could just be totally ignorant - I am very new to this).

I am so happy that he was open about it with me, and I feel like I now understand some of his behaviours a bit better. This is also one of the best relationships I have ever been in, and I want to put in the work to ensure that I'm being as supportive as I can be without being triggering or giving him reassurance.

1951,C00kiemonstaar,1547233524,1,"Like many people here I struggle with depression and a laundry list of addictions. 

However, I’ve recently learned that I engage in these unhealthy behaviors whenever I’m active in addiction of some sort. 

When I’m sober, I do not engage in those behaviors because I am not trying to run away from my adult responsibilities and I’m not drained from the addiction. 

So how do I admit I’m in addiction, I’m powerless over it, and my life is unmanageable? 

Well after pulling another late night at a massage parlor at 1230am for the third day in a row, I finally admitted I had a problem. I was powerless over my lust and my life was totally unmanageable. 

I mean what “normal” person goes out to a massage parlor after midnight? Exactly. No one. I just couldn’t accept that I had a problem. 

But now that I have, I am out of the depression. I’m out of the addiction. But just for today. I have to admit this powerlessness each day or else I will go back to the addiction and thus the depression.

I love my new position. It’s challenging, the pay and benefits are good, and I’m good at it. However, my new co-workers are ALWAYS talking bad about me. When I say talking bad, I mean, they make fun of my hair or my outfits or the few words I do say. 

There is another new person there and we have sort of been confiding in each other because we understand the struggles of being new.

I got laid off from work on 12/19/18. This obviously triggered my depression even more. The last two weeks have been some of the absolute worse of my life. I had no motivation to get a new job because my previous one was my dream position and I was planning on staying with the company for over 20 years, but didn’t even last 4 months since they outsourced my position (they were a very new start up apartment management company). 

Last night I did what I basically always do, lay down on my extremely uncomfortable couch, eat food that is not good for me, and watch Netflix until I doze off. I woke up a couple hours later, feeling just as awful as always and made my way to my bed for the remaining hours of the night.

I am unsure if this is relevant but I had a strange dream last night (after I had made my way to my bed). It was my 10 year high school reunion but there were only people there that I haven’t spoke to since high school in attendance and we were in a shopping mall cafeteria. I saw my very first ex girlfriend who I dated my freshmen year (and to this day my longest relationship, mostly by choice) and I was going to speak with her. 

Just as I was going to walk over to her, my late best friend, who died senior year three days after graduation from a drinking and driving accident suddenly appeared next to me and walked over to her first and I just remember thinking, “oh, that’s okay”.  Which is strange. I have had dreams on betrayal before and the dream usually intensifies my emotional response.

Have you ever seen a movie and someone is dancing by themselves? I think that is the most annoying fucking thing in the world. As I stated earlier, I am currently unemployed but I was awake at 7:00 AM and I was dancing along with music in my head as I was getting ready, completely conscious of this new feeling of happiness. 

I keep thinking “why the fuck am I so happy right now”? Is this a temporary relief from depression or could this be permanent? I don’t ever want to lose this feeling because I know how awful it is to live with depression.",mentalhealth,My depression mysteriously disappeared. Not an inspirational story.,2019-01-12 04:31:00
1963,JimCookie222,1547227850,1,"  I really wanted to get this off my chest for some time now, I really don't know if this is the best place but I've realised that I have so many issues with my mental health that are affecting my personality and my performance with school and other things I have to do.

  I'm a procrastinator for as long as I remember. I never succeeded to get things done in time because I was couch potato and that's not the ending, I also got a thing called RMD(rhytmic movement disorder) and I'm addicted to rocking my body to help myself sleep, without it I wouldn't be able to sleep. But I also do it while I got home from school, when I'm bored etc. 75% of my day is spent doing this.

  I was abused by my father when I was little and that went on for 3 or 4 years. After some time I was diagnosed with ADHD, and I was expelled from 2 teachers during primary school. And since I started school in total I switched over 3 schools in total and 7 classes. So I wasn't a favorite between students, neither I am now. 

  During 8 grade I have fallen into a depression from which I haven't recovered from yet. But sometimes is a hard thing to cope with, I have some dark hours. I'm a really shy person, I'm not feeling very smart, I get really anxious sometimes, but in public I manage to hide it because I use some walls to protect me from people getting involved in my shit. I feel like I shouldn't live, but at the same time I feel like I'm the chosen one, and I'll change the world someway. There are many moments when I feel I'm trapped in this body of mine, and I should have been someone else. To boost my confidence I tend to copy and make myself believe I'm another person.

  I had and I still have a lot of friends, but sometimes I feel like their friendship it's not real. I'm a very loyal person, and I need all the attention I could get from a friend else I feel they are not my friend. Loneliness is my all time fear. But still I tend to spend my time alone, I created a comfortable yet a painful private hell. And it's killing me. But I'm helpless. I'm in love with music and I get very creative but because of my procrastination I'm getting nowhere.

  I'm lonely and disperate, I wish I could find a girl, but I tend to get bored or feel very bad because I feel like I could be replaced in a second. And because of my ego, I always say the last word during break up. I always try to do in a way I am in the brighter side of the story. It matters a lot for me what others think about me.

  Since I discovered drugs and alcohol my life changed, I was who I wanted, all the anxiety went away, I felt free from my fears without inhibitions and I loved being able to do whatever I wanted. And soon got addicted. From then my mental health is falling apart more and more every day and I can't help it. ",mentalhealth,I lost myself,2019-01-12 04:30:50
1964,rebecca91099,1547227623,1,"does anyone else feel like your illness is a competition? 

It’s hard to explain, so i’ll give an example:

Me and sally both have depression. I have a good few months, and am not feeling depressed anymore. Sally then tells me that she is slipping again and getting into depression, she maybe says that she’s self harmed. 
Now that I know that sally is slipping, I feel like it’s a competition, and that I need to slip also, so I can be “more depressed” than her. 

The same can be for recovery, say Sally is doing amazing but i’m not, I feel like I need to get ahead of her and do better in my recovery.

It’s so stupid, but please tell me i’m not the only one who feels like mental illnesses are competitive, in recovery and also in who’s suffering more.

1965,mahtabalam93,1547227571,1," 

Addiction is a biological, psychological, social, environmental inefficiency and inability to stop the consumption of any chemical, drugs, medication, activity, or substance abuse, even if it is causing physical and psychological problems in the body and mind.

The addictive disorder is a group of disorders that can cause psychological and physical harm. When a person suffers from addictive disorders, they do not understand how they use any substances and cannot control how they stop his critical conditions and take part in any activity, and they become reliant on it to cope with daily life problems. It is necessary to get treatment to break the cycle of addiction.

1968,R6E6D6,1547219620,1,"It is day 23 coming in to see my sick grandma now. She is now in the intensive care unit.   
Why is it socially acceptable to shame people for wanting to vent about this on Facebook?  
When she goes, she said DNR - do not resuscitate.   
She has no power of attorney.   
She just has word of mouth of what she wants done if she goes.  
She has no insurance on her stuff.  
It is 4 a.m.   
I can't count how many nights I've stayed here.  
She's my last living grandparent. I've lost two. I've lost two foster grandparents, too. I never met the one who abused this one.  
It's now 5 a.m.  
Took a break to keep her company while they did more bloodwork, checked her blood pressure, and sugar level. She has diabetes, heart problems, and high blood pressure, among many other things that has happened over the past couple of months as to why she is here and shit keeps happening, extending her stay.  
My 17 year old sister told me that she hates me  
As if I never do anything around the house or for her  
Told me that taking care of grandma is not a real job and to get a real job  
Even though I get and earned EI and she doesn't even understand what that is  
She told me the only reason i am back home is because I have nowhere else to go

Yes. I am thirty   
I am half vietnamese half native

When somebody was watching me change, I wouldn't know if it was my dad, or my native grandma's partner  
When I tried speaking up about my grandmas partner touching my little sister, nobody believed me  
When my dad did that thing to my mom's little sister for several years, from the age of 11-13, everyone shunned my \*aunty.\*  
When i told my dad to stop speaking vietnamese to me and i wanted nothing to do with the language or culture because of what he did to her, my whole family and i are now outcasts for not being able to speak the language. It haunts me every time some asshole asks and judges, ""why don't you guys speak vietnamese? Your dad should have taught you""  
Years later, in my adult years, I tried going back to Vietnam to regain my language, culture, and family ties. I wanted to give back to my community by teaching english. I couldn't find work. Even though I told english speaking cousins to tell everyone for 1.5 years of my plans, I was barely welcomed. People didnt understand or care or try understand my poor accent as to why i was there. My dad's relatives (my aunts and uncles, cousins, and cousin's kids) shunned me, locked me in my room, locked me away from washroom access forcing me to piss in a bag in my own bedroom.   
I went to a hotel to take a break from the bullshit where I was drugged and raped by two hotel workers. I dealt with the canadian consulate and corrupt cops who laughed in my face. Again, even western family shunned me when I needed them most.  
I hate being associated with negative stereotypes, including being a so called drunk indian or dumb asian.

She has taught me to be strong  
The fact that she went to residential school   
She got strapped and bullied and whatever else. Kept away from her dying grandma. Stripped from her small family, language, culture. We have no language or culture either on that side either because of this  
Colonization  
I am more than a fucking loser  
And I rarely tell myself that  
I just dont understand  
And always feel like  
why me  
What now  
You think you hit rock bottom and it goes on  
My husband and I were in $80,000 in debt. $20,000 alone just by dealing with Vietnam, thousands of dollars in counselling, medical, and self care. We didnt touch our banking cards since December 15, and in interest alone, owed $1000.  
How in the fuck is anybody supposed to make it? By keeping their mouths shut  
I haven'tseen a counselor in a month and waiting another month for my new one because of money, moving, and helping grandma  
Last year  
I missed  a shit ton of work because my husbands father got cancer  
And the day of surgery, after waiting all day and him fasting for two, at 5 pm, they had go reachedule hos surgery.  
We already rescheduled our trip, hotels, work, and so on just to be there for him. Even though he did that to me. I set aside my differences   
So we went on our trip  
He had surgery  
He went straight from the airport to his moms hotel then his dads hospital room anand missed more work  
He supposedly was supposed to take 5days to heal, he took 17 days  
17 days of dealing with both of his shitty toxic parents.  
His mom was and is a horrible alcoholic  
Okay  
She has a horrible alcohol addiction to be PC  
And so she would literally drink and wake up all hours of the night and slam the hotel doors just to get up and check to see if he was still sleeping, in and out. Fucjing drinking beers in a coffee mug starting at least at 5 a.m.  as if we wouldn't know.  
When Vietnam happened and I told her, the first thing she said was ""get over it. We all get raped.""  
Last year when I admitted ""on Facebook "" and had my rants, that o was suicidal, and I had a hard time admitting to my husbands family about being suicidal, she started drunk ranting about her dad  
My husband is also half native half Irish with a clusterfuck of mental health, addictions, and so on in his family   
His first memory is of his 16 year old brother shooting himself in the head when he was 3.  
The year we started dating, 2006, just before that, his other brother died drinking and driving  
One day my husband drew something for me. He always draws. He is an artist...  
He drew something that looked like a hand and a scrunched up paper bag...  
He was upset as if I should have realized that it was his brothers nloody hand, grabbing his moms shirt after his cad slammed into the pole and his body flung from his car. That's his last living memory of that brother who I also never met.  
He was in the military for 6.5 years. And only recently, he finally admitted some of the shit he held in and saw. He hides some of it because hes trying to protect me  
He hides some of it because his dad used to beat the shit out of him if he cried for not being a ""real man""  
His dad went to residential school and so did several others in his family. His dad is homophobic and i dont doubt it's because of residential school   
One of his uncles has his tongue cut out from being in residential school   
I can go on and on and on  
.  
I try empathize , understand, and forgive, but it's too much to hold in  
I'm tired of these secrets  
I think that's why people get sick  
Cancer  
Mental health, obviously  
Addictions, obviously  
Etc  
These seem obvious to me, but my family, his family is in denial   
Ugh  
Just  
Let  
Me  
Go  
I've brought myself in to the hospital to admit I was suicidal twice in the last year.  
That's it  
And if I kept quiet, nobody would have any idea why  
And I usually do  
Bite my tongue.  
the quiet observer  
The peace keeper  
But i am exhausted  
I am tired of staying strong  
And my husband is finally getting professional help  
But its bullshit  
I know theres bullshit about keeping professional life and relationships separate  
But that'z bullshit  
Anybody should empathize and understand when family is sick and fucking dying  
I dont understand such privileged little shits like my sister. Same parents. Just a weird shit geneation/age gap  
It scares me  
The future   
It's why I never wanted kids  
But colonialism/colonization wont win  
It wont ""kill the indian inside us""  
I want my shit straightened before having kids  
I am excited to try help build a better future by teaching right from wrong  
Respect  
Empathy  
Understanding   
Love  
To give  
This can be seen as weakness  
But i dont give a fuck   
Lifes to fucjing short to take take take  
Nobody will give a shit about you when you die. You will die feeling empty and alone  
Anyways  
Its 547 a.m.  
 I should eat and try go back to sleep

1971,veryuncertain,1547214624,1,"Recently I've been having overwhelming, paralyzing feelings of fear and anxiety. My brain gets into a loop of everything that can go wrong and I can see no hope or positive resolution. I lose all motivation and just want to stay home and hide.

I can obsess about somewhat plausible, yet manageable difficulties, such as getting stuck in traffic and running late, saying the wrong thing to people at work, getting sick at an inopportune time, etc.

It tends to be worse when I'm low on energy, either from being tired or hungry.

During these periods I am highly agitated and irrational. It can take several hours or a day for me to calm down, and then I'm always embarrassed about the way I acted.

I didn't used to be this fearful and affected by risk. Throughout my life I've welcomed new challenges, taken on stretch assignments, and been happy to try new things.

And I'm not all that certain what I'm so freaked out about!

My marriage is healthy. If my job disintegrated, I have other options and nearly a year of living expenses saved. I'm actually on track for retirement. I'm healthy and exercise and spend time with good friends whom I love and respect.

Last year when I admitted ""on Facebook "" and had my rants, that o was suicidal, and I had a hard time admitting to my husbands family about being suicidal, she started drunk ranting about her dad

&amp;#x200B;

My husband is also half native half Irish with a clusterfuck of mental health, addictions, and so on in his family 

&amp;#x200B;

His first memory is of his 16 year old brother shooting himself in the head when he was 3.

&amp;#x200B;

The year we started dating, 2006, just before that, his other brother died drinking and driving

&amp;#x200B;

One day my husband drew something for me. He always draws. He is an artist...

&amp;#x200B;

He drew something that looked like a hand and a scrunched up paper bag...

&amp;#x200B;

He was upset as if I should have realized that it was his brothers nloody hand, grabbing his moms shirt after his cad slammed into the pole and his body flung from his car. That's his last living memory of that brother who I also never met.

&amp;#x200B;

He was in the military for 6.5 years. And only recently, he finally admitted some of the shit he held in and saw. He hides some of it because hes trying to protect me

&amp;#x200B;

He hides some of it because his dad used to beat the shit out of him if he cried for not being a ""real man""

&amp;#x200B;

His dad went to residential school and so did several others in his family. His dad is homophobic and i dont doubt it's because of residential school 

&amp;#x200B;

One of his uncles has his tongue cut out from being in residential school 

&amp;#x200B;

I can go on and on and on

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I try empathize , understand, and forgive, but it's too much to hold in

I'm tired of these secrets

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's why people get sick

Cancer

Mental health, obviously

Addictions, obviously

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh

&amp;#x200B;

Just

Let

Me

Go

&amp;#x200B;

I've brought myself in to the hospital to admit I was suicidal twice in the last year.

That's it

And if I kept quiet, nobody would have any idea why

&amp;#x200B;

And I usually do

Bite my tongue.

&amp;#x200B;

But i am exhausted

&amp;#x200B;

I am tired of staying strong

And my husband is finally getting professional help

&amp;#x200B;

But its bullshit

I know theres bullshit about keeping professional life and relationships separate

&amp;#x200B;

But that'z bullshit

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody should empathize and understand when family is sick and fucking dying

&amp;#x200B;

I dont understand such privileged little shits like my sister. Same parents. Just a weird shit geneation/age gap

It scares me

The future 

It's why I never wanted kids

&amp;#x200B;

But colonialism/colonization wont win

It wont ""kill the indian inside us""

&amp;#x200B;

I want my shit straightened before having kids

&amp;#x200B;

I am excited to try help build a better future by teaching right from wrong

Respect

Empathy

Understanding 

Love

To give

1975,devilgata,1547210133,1,"Since I have been a small child I have always been very hyperactive and could never focus on anything. I was a naturally bright child so it never occurred to my parents to get me checked for anything as my grades were excellent and the stigma around ADHD kids being ‘dumb’ made them sure I did not have it. I was always getting in trouble in class and sometimes leading other kids astray too. It is not until recent years where this has affected my studies and my relationship with people as I am considered ‘annoying’ by people who don’t know me well and even more annoying by those who do. I am a very out going person and when meeting people i get excited and want to become friends. I’m always the last one up on sleepovers (i get on average 4 hours of sleep a night) and it drives my friends crazy. For these reasons above I have made up to my friends that I am taking ADHD medication and they question why it doesn’t work sometimes but other times it ‘works too well’ to quote a friend of mine. I’m either bouncing off walls or i am deep inside my own head trying to keep these negative thoughts at bay. I don’t know if the group I have surrounded myself with are toxic or I am delusional but i always see things other persons don’t see in people. 


I also have been a person who needs to be in charge and when people don’t like me it upsets me, I act like an angel when in reality I am playing games with everyone telling everyone lies even those closest to me. It has always been this way, I keep trying to change that but I can’t stop lying. I am stuck in this lie of me taking medication for ADHD when in reality I have never actually seen a psychiatrist.

I do NOT blame her in part. I understand her and she's right I think, it always happen in a friendship where one have a mental illness and needs his friend more than the friend needs him. She told me some months ago again, that I couldn't be so needy from her, because she's tired and wants that someone that can do more than her to help me and truly I see that she really cares for me and I appreciate her to the moon and back, that's why this situation is tough.
I'm not good making new friends and being friend with he I'm more than comfortable being his close friend, tbh I consider her as my little sister but it hurts me A LOT A LOT the moment that she has chosen to tell me this, my dad has die and I need her that's all I know BUT I think that is normal to her, she's tired of me, of every single night I cry to her through WhatsApp, she has life(work, studies...)

1984,projectstyx,1547191297,1,"First post on Reddit so here we go...

I've been with my boyfriend for what will be a decade this year. We met when we were 17 and 18, and shortly after we met he told me he suffered from Tourrette's Syndrome, ADHD, and OCD which didn't bother me at all. I thought it made him special because he had become such a strong and amazing person despite his adversity, if anything it made me love him more.

Since then, we've overcome a long distance relationship, the death of his father, the murder of my uncle, losing my aunt to cancer, etc but at least we had eachother. Then, a little over a year ago I got a call when I was out of town that my boyfriend had attempted suicide. Once he was hospitalized, he was diagnosed with Bipolar I and PTSD, and that's when everything changed.

We've been struggling for over a year to find him adequate therapy, the right medication, and support. At the time of his first depressive episode he had just lost his job, was uninsured, and to this day I struggle to support us financially and emotionally.

With every episode, it feels like he is slipping further and further away. Away from the person he was, from the life we've made and worse, from the future we've worked so hard to build.

This last month it seems like everything has come to a head. We've suffered through some of the worst episodes he's ever had, and I don't know how much more I can take. His disease makes him numb, disconnected, cruel, violent, delusional, and reckless, but when he comes out of it he's so regretful and remorseful and it's absolutely devestating to watch him go through it. I can't imagine the pain and suffering he's going through, but I'm also hurting so deeply and it's ruining our relationship. 

I'm trying my best not to feel resentment or anger at the thought that he is being taken away from me by his illness. I want to marry this person, have children, and grow old together. I love him so much, but sometimes question if I have the strength to stay.

I have been institutionalized in psychiatric facilities many times, did outpatient rehab for 2 years as a teenager, I was sexually assaulted twice as a young teen, and I was last hospitalized in October of 2018 for suicidal ideations and psychosis, as documented by my local E.R. 

I suffered from PTSD after many years of physical, mental, emotional, verbal, and financial abuse at the hands of my father. The last straw that broke the camel’s back was when I was diagnosed with Complex PTSD after my first boyfriend committed suicide by firearm on January 27th, 2015. I was never the same after that. I am a different person now. 

There is an alarm bell going off in my head, and it won’t stop. It never stops. That is the reality of living with Complex Trauma. 

My current situation is that I am dealing with the loss of my grandmother who passed away last August, and then I was physically assaulted by my father the same night she died. I realize this is a delayed response to my loss, however I deal with bereavement in a very strange way after losing my boyfriend, and I also lost an uncle from suicide by firearm the previous year. What sets him apart is that like me, he also dealt with PTSD but instead it was because he was a sharp shooter in Vietnam. Like me he also was bipolar and suffered from addiction, specifically alcoholism. I never was the kind of person to use drugs, but I have been using hard substances since the beginning of October. I feel as though the suicide of my Uncle Don set a precedent for what my future may look like. I am holding on for dear life, and taking it one day at a time. I refuse to let my illness swallow me whole. 

I am just feeling very haunted right now. Absolutely haunted. When I found out my grandmother was slipping away, my family and I drove over 2,000 miles from the west coast to Rochester, New York so we could be there for her final moments. The drive was tense and nerve wracking, because we were unsure if we would make it there in time. We completed our drive in about 3 days, and when we got there, she was still alive, but barely. 

I walked into my grandparent’s living room, and she laid in a hospital bed. Her lungs had filled with fluid, and she had the death rattle in her chest. It was such a loud, jarring noise. I am still haunted by the sound. 

I grabbed her hand and leaned in close to her. I said, “Grandma, it’s Mary Margaret.” Her eyes were closed and her chest was rattling very loud. I do not remember what I said next. I do realize this may be a sign of a mental breakdown. However, I do remember that I said exactly what I needed to say, and I find peace in that. After I said it, she raised her eyebrows and furrowed them together. She opened her mouth very wide but could not speak. 

What did she mean to say? I want to know what she said. When I see her in my dreams I ask her, but I haven’t gotten an answer yet. 

I was taking turns with my cousins holding her hand, and when my turn was up, I went outside and broke down in hysterics. It was extremely hard for me to keep my composure when I was holding my grandmother’s hand, but I did. I didn’t want her to be sad or afraid. 

About 30 minutes passed and it was my turn again to hold my grandmother’s hand. When I came back in I realized that she had an accident in her bed, and I called my mother in to clean her up (she is an Registered Nurse and used to work in an elderly home). She gave her fresh bedding and a gown, fluffed her pillow and put lotion on her arms and legs. I knew the end was near. 

I sat with her and held her hand. I wanted to talk to her but I was lost for words. I wonder if she could feel me holding her hand. I wanted her to know I was there. I had to use the bathroom which was only the next room over, so I walked away and took about two minutes to do that. Her chest was still rattling, even louder now. 

When I returned to my grandmother, the air was so thick, it could be sliced with a butterknife. I had a very odd feeling, it was very strange. 

The room was completely silent. 

I approached my grandmother and touched her wrist. 

She was gone. 

I imagine her choking and reaching for me. But I wasn’t there. She suffocated and died alone. This weighs on me heavily to this day.

I went outside to break the news to my family who were all seated at the picnic table. Everyone gasped, cried, and scattered, some of them tried to head into the house to pay their final respects. They were stopped by my father, who is my grandmother’s eldest child and also the primary abuser in my household. He told everyone to get lost, and that only my grandmother’s children were welcome to pay their final respects. I was heartbroken. My cousins and my brother and I walked over to the pond. We sat there and sobbed. I felt so empty and lost. Not only was I lost, I felt as though I lost something very dear to me. I still feel like that, even in this moment. We sat at the pond with teary eyes and gazed emptily over the water. After sitting there for about a half hour, we collected ourselves and headed to the bar. We got drunk, barely ate the food we ordered, and we didn’t have a lot to say to each other. We headed back to my grandparents house after dark. 

I am still traumatized by this next event so I will try to keep this short and simple. After getting back and walking up the patio, I saw my mother, father and aunt were all seated at the table. My aunt seemed sober but my parents were absolutely fucking plastered. I realized in all the commotion before leaving, I had misplaced my phone. I asked my mother to call it. I heard it ringing in the house and I went inside to grab it. 

I answered my phone to tell my mom I had found it. In the background I heard my father talking to my aunt. He said, “She is completely fucking brain dead.” My father often likes to tell people how stupid I am, although I consider myself to be at least semi intelligent. I was seething with rage. Hatred boiled up inside of me and it began to overflow. I hung up the phone and stormed out of the house. 

I walked out onto the patio to confront my father. This is something I never do. 

I said, “What are you doing, talking shit about me?” I was very angry. I do not recall what he said next, but he was very angry too. He stood up and came at me. My mother, who is complicit in the abuse, went inside as my aunt watched the ordeal. He grabbed me by the arms and dragged me down the patio towards the driveway. 

“You need to leave,” he snarled, “get the fuck out. Nobody wants you here.” I told him to let go of me but he didn’t. I had bruises on my arms the next day, which I photographed. I included this assault in the police report I filed against him a month later for domestic violence. He said, “You do realize my mother just died today?” I told him that my grandmother died today as well. I told him to let go of me. Things were about to go from bad to worse. But then my aunt quickly stood up and started walking towards us. My father let go of me and walked away. 

After that happened I had a great discussion with my aunt about the abuse I was putting up with. To this day, she my only family member to acknowledge that I am being abused. Next I tried talking to my mother about it. I repeatedly told her that she was complicit and that it needs to end. She said that I provoked him. I take it that she was implying that I deserved it. She was far too drunk for me to reason with, so I dropped the subject and went to bed. 

I am still living under my parent’s roof and the things I have dealt with have consumed me and taken over my life. I have no job, no money, no car, no driver’s license, no friends, and nowhere to go to escape. I rarely leave my room, and I rarely leave my house. This is due in part to the fact that there was a false imprisonment scenario many years ago, where I was being held against my will by my father and forbidden to leave my home. I spent many years in isolation completely cut off from the outside world. I have become quiet and reclusive because of this. My father has not assaulted me since that day, which may be because he is aware that I now own pepper spray. Because he cannot physically abuse me, he has escalated every other form of abuse. I am so torn up inside. I don’t even have anyone to talk to right now, so I am reaching out to all of you on here, 

TLDR: what are some good ways to overcome great feelings of loss in addition to being assaulted by my father the same day my grandmother died?

To those that read this, thank you and my heart goes out to all of you who are also struggling. Much love to all of you and take care of yourselves, because you are worth it.

It starts with repeated, intrusive thoughts about one person. This person can be anyone. Thankfully, a lot of times it's a famous person who I can only have contact with via social media. But sometimes it happens with people that are involved in my life, and when it does, it's much scarier. The thoughts turn into trying to ask them personal questions whilst trying to not scare them off. I will follow said person everywhere I can; I will talk to their friends, follow them on social media...And sometimes I will obsess on their social media for hours. When it's at it's worst, I will use any means I can find to find the people that are closest to them. Not as in showing up to their homes or anything, usually just trying to get as much information as possible without breaking the law. But I will waste hours and hours in my life doing this. Sometimes, it's all I can think about. If i do manage to find something that upsets me, i.e this person has a girlfriend/boyfriend/etc, instead of going away it just makes my obsession worse and bitter.Suddenly the thought of what said person would think about me controls my whole life and emotions. I am scared that one day I will resort to breaking the law(going on someone's property,mail,etc.). I have harmed myself over people who have hardly spoken to me other than light conversation.I try to distract myself. I am aware that my behavior is fucking insane. The thoughts refuse to go away. From what I've researched this could be a symptom of OCD or BPD, but a rare one, which is why I'm so scared of sharing this.

1993,Bad_Wulph,1547183108,1,"I've been seeing my PCP for panic attacks and general pain (which is caused by a combination of scoliosis and anxiety). The scoliosis causes pain in my back, left shoulder, left arm, and chest, which sets off my anxiety. The location of the pain itself always makes me think of a heart attack, and the anxiety symptoms that follow (paired with and amplifying the scoliosis pain) make that fear feel much more real, which often sends me into a panic attack. It's an awful combination.

 I've been cleared as healthy, I know I'm healthy in my logical, conscious mind, but my lizard brain is much harder to convince. The panic attacks and patterns of irrational thinking and fear happen anyway, and I feel helpless. Today my PCP asked me if I'd be open to the idea of cognitive behavioral therapy. I enthusiastically said I would love it, but then remembered it's out of the question for me. I explained to him that I am a pre-dental student who is in school too much to work, so I do not have the means to seek treatment on my own. All treatment I receive is through my parents, and they don't want me to receive CBT.

The first time I mentioned CBT to them, my father said that's for schizophrenics and crazy people, and my mother said she doesn't want anyone ""brainwashing"" me. My mother would rather I take herbal supplements (unregulated by the FDA, I refuse them because I do not trust them) or talk to a church official for ""Christian counseling"" (basically to pray the anxiety away). Now please, don't go bashing my parents, that isn't what I'm here for. But for some reason, they attach some stigma to CBT and dismiss it as a treatment option.

How can I present CBT to them as a safe, reliable, effective, and perfectly normal treatment option? I really want treatment, I really want to get better.

1995,PatheticThrowaway420,1547182947,1,"Hey all. Throwaway account here, hoping for advice.

I am a 29 years old. I've struggled with anxiety since a traumatic experience when I was a child. I have allowed it to dictate my life and for the most part kill my potential. I dropped out of college when I was 19 because I could not do it. There were so many people and so much pressure and I could not handle it. I dropped out and moved to a new state where I started delivering for Dominoes. The Dominoes job was a blessing and a curse. My anxiety is such that when I have a stable job surrounded by people I know, I can be fine and healthy. Sure when a new hire came around I would slam my walls back up, but gradually they'd lower, and I could cope with such small changes. So my life was going no where, but at least I was supporting myself and was for the most part, happy.

That went on for a few years. My younger brother graduated college, my parents were pursuing new things, and I was still doing a job that a monkey could be trained to do. Eventually, my glorious state legalized cannabis. I had used the stuff a few times, but had never really gotten into it. Alcohol was always my drug of choice. Over time, I started using cannabis (in the form of edibles) and really started to enjoy them. But what was more amazing, was that after a night of taking a few edibles I would notice that I was damn near immune to the anxiety the following day.

That was huge. With some pressure from my brother and my own new found willingness to give my nightmare (college) another try, I enrolled. And honestly, it was great. With weed keeping my anxiety down I could actually focus on school. I kept that up for a couple years.   semesters off graduating and my GPA is higher than it has ever been.

Of course, anybody who has used weed (or most drugs) knows that tolerance is a bitch. I won't go over my entire tolerance timeline, but I will give the start and end point. My first time taking an edible was 5mg THC and it fucked me up for a few hours. Last night I took 150mg of THC. 

Now, the anxiety is not kept at bay. In fact it bites harder than ever. For the last month or so, my stomach has dropped 50+ times a day. I almost always wake up before my alarm so that my body can express its anxiety and ruin my sleep. Thinking about anything remotely stressful seems to trigger me 3 times harder. I don't get hungry and tired anymore on my own, because weed has taken over as the play caller. My secret weapon (thc), which resulted in the best 2 years of my life, is now a liability.

So when my current vial of oil runs out in a couple days, I will stop. And frankly, I am terrified. I am terrified to see how it will affect my grades, I am terrified to spend all night staring at the ceiling, I am terrified to feeling starving one minute and nauseous the next. I am terrified because anxiety has ran almost my entire life, and I am giving it the reins again.",mentalhealth,I don't know what to do,2019-01-11 16:02:27

My son is 7 years old. He is a sensitive, compassionate, kind kid and I really do not think he was just trying to avoid bed time but he said something that shook me. As I put him to bed he said ""daddy, I don't think I can sleep. I keep hearing the voice in my head"".  I asked him what the voice said and he said that he knew it was in his head and it didn't say anything he could understand but it was so loud.

The instant he said that I knew exactly what voice he meant. I heard it too, from the age of 6 to my mid twenties I would hear a unintelligible yelling in my own head. It was worse when the house was quiet but it was always there. It is hard to explain but the best I can do is to ask you to imagine a very large angry man shouting at the top of his voice through a very thin pillow. The words are indistinguishable but the tone is rage. I don't know how to describe it better than that. The only other analogy I can come up with is sitting in a room with someone shouting through the window at you: you can't understand what they are saying but you can tell from the tone that they are angry.

I knew (and my son knew) that the voice was not real. The voice never told me to do anything, it never even said words that could be understood. Something about it makes it clear that the voice is inside my head. Has anyone else experienced a hallucination like this? 

I managed to grow out of hearing the voice but I have had other mental health issues as well. My only hope is to figure out if my son inherited my issues or if this is a common experience in boys his age.

I used to share my room with my older sister. She has her own issues that I won't get into, but one of them was that she would get up from her bed at night to hit me in my face while I'm sleeping if I breath too loudly. She did that so regularly that it created this weird complex in my brain. And I didn't tell anyone because I was just super irritated and sleepy when she did that and my parents were still asleep.

Growing up, I would always avoid getting out of breath when people are around, so I loved cycling, rollerscating, swimming in big bodies of water or hiking by myself, but I hated PE, any group activity or going to the gym. I never have both headphones in if I'm somewhere where people could potentially hear me breathing, one is always out to keep my breath under control. The only time I can breath the way I need to in front of someone is during sex, really.

This has always caused me to be out of breath easily because I keep my breath frequency and intensity lower than I'd need it to be. I'm excellent at keeping my breath under water which is a plus, I guess, but it's not really a great swap against the constant paranoia that someone could notice me breathing.

The thing is that I want this to stop, but I find it immensely difficult. I was wondering, maybe someone else here has experienced something similar and could give me some advice? It would be very welcome.

Thank you!

When I wake up, according to my mom I start talking gibberish, or just about random general topics, like today was apparently about horses, which I cannot recall. So to start off, my mom says that I started arguing with her about taking my contacts out (sometimes I accidentally fall asleep with them on mid day, but always take them out at night.) I cannot recall ANYTHING happening, as I just remember waking up to my mom yelling that she was done. I didn’t know what I did and she said “you know what you did” or something along the lines of that. She proceeds to tell me that she is no buying me any more contacts because I can’t be responsible enough to take them out (I cannot stand being seen without contacts in. Woo social anxiety &amp; bdd.) Then my grandma decides to chime in and say that I am the most disobedient child that she has ever seen.

So I try to explain to my mom that after I wake up, I literally cannot remember anything that I say or do, and cannot control that behavior. She and I then argue for 10 minutes about me not apologizing for something that I cannot help. She compared this to her example: I trip somebody and say “oops, sorry. I wasn’t fully awake.” In my opinion that is not a fair comparison. One person has no clue what they have done or said until somebody tells them, and the other person has to be aware of themselves tripping another person. I’m rambling, but I’m freaking out.

When the school starts again, im gonna try my best to just smile and laugh along with others. Even if it hurts on the inside. Cause no one wants to see that shit. I just hope people will even consider hanging out with me after i was a depressed shit for months. And I hope i learn to act soon, cause im not the best at faking emotions.   


I guess i just needed to vent because it hurts when you realise your life is shit because of yourself.. but i'm gonna try my best to turn things around this year. I've decided my new years resolution is to become a likeable person. I'll be less depressed when i actually have friends.

Things on the outside (or to the outside)  are looking up but I'm plagued with thoughts every day about how I got to that point in my life. I'm looking back at every point in my life and how it led to that decision. I cant sleep, I can barely think about anything else.

2021,vh1classicvapor,1547163638,1,"Hi all!  I've been getting TMS therapy (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) for the past couple of weeks.  I never thought I'd say this after struggling so hard for the past couple of years, but I'm starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.

Short bio:  Bipolar disorder took EVERYTHING from me.  I lost my house, car, and credit in a mania-fueled bankruptcy, lost my girlfriend after moving in with my mom in a different state, and lost my self-employment business in the midst of the chaos.  I've attempted suicide twice.  I've been hospitalized several times.  I've been unable to work and am on SSDI disability.  I've gained close to 60 pounds, mostly from Seroquel.

**After eight sessions of TMS, I'm able to do things I've never thought possible, and weren't possible with a large variety of medications and various methods of therapy.**  

My current medications are 300 mg Wellbutrin (bupropion) and 10 mg Abilify (aripiprazole).  I've also been doing DBT therapy which has made a huge difference.  But nothing like what TMS is doing for me.

Here's my journal entries for my journey.

**Day 2:** I've had my first two treatments of TMS these past couple of days. I won't be feeling a ""difference"" for a couple of weeks but these treatments have been a great start. It's an odd feeling, kind of like having a woodpecker poking at your skull (but it's not painful).

**Day 4:** They're slowly dialing up the power. We started at 80%, now up to 90%, going up to 95% tomorrow I believe. More power means a more intense magnetic treatment, which also means a bit more discomfort during the treatment. It's like a mildly annoying scalp massage. It can be painful if they go up too fast, so I'm on a slow taper up.

I'm starting to set some goals as to what I want to do after treatment. I'd love to stop taking medications, get back to exercising and lose 30 pounds (TMS revenge body waddup), and eventually get back to work. I'm thinking I will work some short-term contracts to ease back into work.

It's important to remember these are long-term goals, they don't have to be done now or as soon as the treatment is over, or be done all at one time. Missing a goal doesn't mean complete failure either, it only means there is another opportunity to try again or try something different. Being on disability has been such a blessing, it has allowed me to live a good life while recovering, but at the same time, I'm more than ready to move on!

**Day 6:** 110% treatment. Getting up in the morning is becoming a lot easier. I'm also able to take on more activities in the day without getting tired or taking a nap.

I got up at 7:15 am this morning (normally an unthinkable time for me), made breakfast, went to TMS, went to volunteer, and am going to therapy next. The days are definitely getting fuller.

I've also noticed a decrease in anxiety. I'm able to handle public places like loud bars and grocery stores easier.

Looking forward to more results with more treatments!

**Day 8:** First session at full 120% power. I almost got up at 5:30 am today and felt fully rested, but decided to sleep some more. I made it through the afternoon with no nap! Naps were often a method of checking out for me because I didn’t have the energy or desire to do anything else. It may not sound like much but that’s progress for me!

This is never a fun topic to discuss but it’s the honest truth. They asked today if I had any thoughts of self-harm. After struggling with this on a daily/hourly basis for nearly a decade, I’m happy to report they have disappeared. What a relief!

I took my first trip to Walmart today since starting TMS. Walmart was almost a guaranteed panic attack for me, because it's so busy. No anxiety this time though!",mentalhealth,My experience with TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) has been great! [USA],2019-01-11 10:40:38

2024,Gwintissimo,1547159657,1,"I went to university in 2013 completing my first year, i attempted to retake my second  year but eventually dropped out due to several traumatic events and bad choices I made.

This year I've applied again. I'm now 24 and it feels like the last chance ill get. Not just for a job, but my last chance to get out of my life. Currently I have no friends. It's been this way since I left university, I had friends there but they all stopped contacting me, my old school friends all went to university and did the same. I had a partner but she found someone else.

Right now I live in my home town, go to work, come home, repeat. That is my life. I've lost interest in a lot of things because I simply don't see the point anymore. It's all meaningless when I'm alone.

I've lost hope about having friends and a career. Honestly if I don't get into university (which may happen because of financial reasons) then I am out of options. I don't know what other careers I can pursue. And the thought of another year here fills me with dread. My only company is from YouTube videos that feel as close to a conversation with a friend as I can get right now. I've even started taking myself out as I would with a friend or partner. Just to feel like I have some substance in my life.

I suppose I'm better than before. I had a mental breakdown at university after being mugged, losing my partner, and witnessing a freak accident resulting in a death of a child, all within a year. And I've slowly recovered. But I'm not who I used to be anymore. As though I was an intricate drawing but slowly all the details disappeared until I was just a blank page. Blowing in the wind.

2026,screwygrapes,1547158762,1,"I mean the question is pretty much in the title but to elaborate, my mental health state has been getting exponentially worse by the day. I’ve been having delusions, difficulty separating dreams from hallucinations from reality, strong self destructive urges that I’ve been strong enough to get through but I don’t think I will be for much longer, memory loss, etc. I’ve been diagnosed with several things by several people over the years and nothing’s come out of it or really lined up accurately. I’m currently on lexapro for my mood swings and Wellbutrin for my depression and they’re helping those but everything else is getting worse and has pretty much bypassed the stuff I’m medicated for in terms of function impairment. 

So that brings me to now. Move in for my first semester is a week from today and I don’t know realistically if I’ll be functional or safe by then but I’m going to try to hold out until then so I can at least meet my teachers and talk to the school health department. I am definitely going to admit myself to a psychiatric facility in the next three weeks because I am not going to be able to hold it together for much longer and my current health team isn’t able to help out much here because of scheduling, in fact if I told them what was happening they’d probably admit me on the spot and I need the freedom to admit myself. At the very least I want a plan in place so that if I can’t admit myself my parents and girlfriend can make sure I’m okay. 

So my question is how do I go about dealing with possibly missing my school orientation and first week or if I do make it past that how to deal with absences and missed work? I also don’t know if it’s going to affect my financial aid or other benefits I qualified for? If I end up missing an entire semester I don’t know what that means for me. I know some of it is up to the discretion of the school and I’ll be contacting their health and admissions services individually tomorrow but in general I just want to know if and how this may affect my education.

2029,Na_Tilly,1547155693,1,"I'm not sure where go post this as there is a lot of different things happening in my life right now. Apologies its so long... A lot has happened in 3 weeks. 

To start at the beginning..
Last July(2018) I suffered a 12 week miscarriage (scan showing only 6 week development). Which completely broke me. I spent at least 5 months after just in my own world, not really taking any notice of myself, my fiancée, friends or family. I started getting help and it did help. But the damage was already done. 

Fast forward to December and things are strange between me and my fiancée(been together for nearly 4 years, lived together for 2).Not talking or just talking about general day to day stuff. Nothing like we were prior miscarriage. I notice. I started to change I made more of an effort (make up, new clothes, going out more with other half). But that wasn't enough. I found he was talking to a woman who he works with and told her he loved her. Ouch. Tried to work past that. One week went by, it was good. Told me he stopped talking to her. Nope he hadn't. Had another heated debate about it. Then told me he didn't want kids anymore and that the last miscarriage cemented that he didn't. Double ouch. We had to end it as we could not compromise on what we both want. I want kids, he doesn't. So, that's it. He moved out for 5 days, and I was fine on my own. House was clean and tidy all the time, just enjoyed time on my own. 

Started talking to a guy from Tinder. Was going to go on a date, but ex found out and was not happy at all. I had a massive panic about it all and ended up cancelling. Sitting on the sofa and watching films with my ex instead. Ex is still talking to this woman from before. Ego is bruised. 

Fast forward a week and it's the new year. Yippee... Everything was going okay, me and my ex are talking (not about getting back together but just as friends), house is on the market, he's got a flat ready to move into once house is sold, I'm moving into a friend's house. But then, bombshell... I find out I'm pregnant. Great. Just what I need. Tell my ex, he doesn't take it too well. Tries to plan what I need to do etc before I even have the chance to think about it. A lot of stuff is said and actions made, which cannot be taken back now. I know everyone has their opinions on this next subject, but I'm doing what is best for myself and my mental health. But I have decided I can't go through with the pregnancy. I don't want to be living in my friends house whilst raising a child. I don't have any money. I don't want to have benefits or anything like that, not beigg snobby, but I'm more independent than that. Others can do that, and that's great for them if that's what they want. But I don't.

So I'm just sitting thinking this is my life. Crying. Over everything. I'm selling my beautiful house and most of my possessions. I lost a relationship that I was starting to plan a wedding for. I've got no engagement ring now that I got so used to wearing for 6months (got engaged in June 2018). I'm not getting the family life I want just yet,.. Which means I have to wait even longer for that now. I've been doing well, everyone has said how well I'm handling it etc. 
Where I look at my ex and I see him getting his own place, talking to this woman still that may blossom into something quickly I don't know and just.. Yeah.

I'm just in a bad spot right now and reality is just hitting me right now like a bus. It's a lot to take on and just don't know what to do... I just needed to vent, but any comments of support would be great as I don't think I know how I'm gonna get through all of this now... Just a dark place, which I didn't want to end back in.

2032,ExcitingFalcon,1547155132,1,"Iv'e struggled with anxiety my whole life. Iv'e been diagnosed with multiple anxiety disorders over the years. I find day to day life extremely difficult, I exhibit behaviors that someone who is, I speculate depressed, would feel. I don't want to wake up in the morning, don't want to go anywhere and find it difficult to want to talk to people. I have no idea how to combat these feelings. I felt the need to quit my old job because I consistently needed to go into the bathroom because of a panic attack. One day at work it got so bad that I was in the bathroom for around half an hour, shaking, sobbing and rolling on the floor flailing around, I ended up leaving work and running into the woods for hours on end. That, to me, is when I said ""I can't take this job anymore, I need to quit"". Quitting my job caused a lot of problems with my parents. I tried to explain to them that I wasn't healthy enough to have a job and that staying any further would cause severe mental health problems for me.

One of my goals for this year is to be more open about my own personal mental health, in order to try to do my part in eradicating the stigma associated and the fear of judgment that follows. I have made a YouTube video going into a bit more detail, but I would love to hear some of your stories as well if anyone is comfortable to share.

when i was 16 we drove to my parents rv property in florida for a week, then spent 2 days in disney world because my mom works for disney and gets free tickets and hotel discounts. about 3 days the trip i had a breakdown, asking if i could fly home by myself but my parents wouldn’t let me and it ruined the whole trip for me. 

this week i visited my sister in ohio and i was supposed to be there from monday to friday (1/7-1/11). we planned this for 3 months and i was on board and excited, i even initially brought up the idea of visiting. 2 days after i got there i had another meltdown/panic attack and decided to fly home two days early. it cost me over 300$ to rebook my flight short notice but i did not care at all i would have paid any amount of money just to get out of there. 

why do i do that? do i just hate traveling or is there an underlying issue i don’t know about. we’re planning a 2 week trip to germany for next summer (2020) to visit my other sister who is moving there with her family for her husbands air force assignment and i just don’t know if i can go. i never have anxiety before trips, i’m always excited to go but inevitably i break down and feel like i might die if i don’t go home right at that moment. what’s wrong with me?

I've my whole life in school basically been outcasted for the most part and instead of living like my brothers and all the kids in school outside, i only spent my time inside, because of severe bullying and mistreatment going on in school i just had no desire to really face what's outside or had any friends to even spend time outside with. I've always felt different and indifferent about myself and it was definitely noticeable, so i was a pretty easy target to attack and when i finished school and my parents divorced, i lived with my mom, making the discovery of transitioning and the possiblity of something i've basically dreamt of my whole youth and childhood. When i was 19 i seeked a psychologist for the first time in my life to undergo the whole process of getting hormones and being able to legally change my name, going through all that was a long and hard journey itself, i've had agoraphobia and several social phobias during that time, leaving the house and facing judgement of people outside, definitely was a challenge, but i've learned to overcome my agoraphobia and as i progressed in my transition, i've learned to be myself openly and freely and talk to people and accepting things easier. It sounds like my life turned out to get better, but in all honesty in all these years i've been at home not doing anything business wise or study wise and the image of having to find a job and working day for day really scares me to the point i suffer from panic attacks everytime, i feel anxious and uncertain everyday and i feel so filled with fright and fear, that it literally consumes me everyday.

I just can't imagine a life where i really have to spent all my days in the most uncomfortable environment for me and to get home to literally have no time for anything anymore, it makes me so unhappy and i'd rather honestly die, than to do this day for day, i have a social coach atm who helps me find what is best for me atm job wise and i had my first appointment where i broke down and had to open up about my anxieties and that i really need a psychiatrist to prescribe me something, in my head i feel like the only way for me to be functional in this society work wise, is if i'm on meds just making me completely empty and rid of feelings that completely block me from making this progress.. It probably all seems so silly and shallow and in some way i feel so awful and disgusting about myself, like a spoiled little baby who doesn't wanna endure the same shit everyone else goes through and i know for me there's no way out of this and i do try to see the positives like maybe it helps me to get out and work and to meet other people, but even the fact i have to socialize and have these shallow, script like conversations with people day for day.. it's just the most depressing thought to me that this is the life i'm going to live.. I don't even know what i feel the most passionate about, tbh most of the time in life i don't even feel much anymore and spent my time playing games and doing work around the house and stuff and doing errands, but i often feel so depressed in life i don't feel that energy in me, that spirit to keep finding what i want.. I have no friends irl, i hate the place i live, i hate it with a passion and there's nothing i can do about it, but hope i won't be so fucked up anymore one day and get a job to move away, but then i feel so uncertain about doing that, because i can't leave my mom behind and want everything good for her.. There's a person who lives so far from me that i wish existed in my life, because there's so many things on how this person affects me positively and the thought i can't ever see them is so depressing, it adds up to everything else on top. I don't think i can actually find the help i need, because in society we are suppose to be functional and if not.. well the only way is to get forced and thrown into the pit.. And i am not happy with building a life here.. a place i so passionately hate.. And i've tried multiple times to build a little friend circle online at least, but it never worked out and honestly i am so tired of toxic people on the internet who just come in to hurt you even more and to make you get frustrated even more over the fact that you have to start over again and find new people again and you can't actually maintain a sustainable friend circle that you can talk to and hang out with..",mentalhealth,"I'm currently at the worst stage of my life, i'm the unhappiest i have ever felt..

His ""girlfriend from there"" said he was a pedo and that he once flirted with a 14 year girl and got beaten up by her father. He fell in love with his girlfriend's sister and when she got pregnant he made her have an abortion. He often badmouthed me and my sister to his secret family.

He had been spending all our money there, with call girls and according to her with underage girls. He's a terrible person by all means. I've always known that my parents aren't the best, but all that is just nauseating.

I've always fancied myself as being pretty resilient. I mean, while I do have suicidal thoughts, I have gone through some stuff without becoming bitter or a jackass. I have a speech problem and as a result I also have a thick accent in my native language. My head is going bald, I am going bald, I am only 16. But I am still among the best students in my school even with all that stuff, and I am proud of my resilience.

But somehow that made me lost all the hope. I was studying for University entrance exams. I was also studying for the ACT, because I want(ed) to study in the U.S. Now I wonder: what is that all for?

I work in the mental health field as a peer mentor helping people who are currently receiving mental health services find jobs.  The severity of the symptoms and diagnoses we deal with ranges the entire spectrum.  The whole idea is that we get people who have recent mental health hurdles (which they may still be overcoming) into jobs to get them fully stable.  Most of the time (95%), the referrals are stable and ready to go.  Not all the time though.  As a peer mentor, I've had my own issues.  But, part of my job is to literally say (in a nice, supportive way), ""If I can do it, so can you.""

We recently got a referral for a person that had a lot of promise, as far as having a stellar resume and a cordial disposition.  I did this person's intake interview and paperwork and could immediately tell they were very symptomatic.  But, I did my best to be accommodating and we got through it.  At this person's next appointment, they brought me a thank you card and said that they had been having a bad day when we did the intake  and that I had made the situation more bearable.  I certainly thought it was unexpected and absolutely a nice gesture.

(pause here to point out that I'm generally a very compassionate person, but especially so at work because I have a strong attachment to my work — this has caused some people in the past to get a little more attached than most folks may be comfortable with; but I'm always nothing less than professional)

So, things progress, this person exhibits some more symptomatic behaviors.  Nothing too damaging, but I can see that they are still struggling internally quite a bit.  Eventually, they say they want to be discharged, stop receiving services, etc.

After hearing this, I reached out to the person.  We had an interesting phone conversation.  The big revelation (besides them wanting to discharge — which I let them know in a kind and supportive way that I didn't want that to happen) was that they said (paraphrasing), ""Since I'm discharging, we should see each other outside of a working relationship.""

Now, here's where it gets tricky.  

I let them down easy.  Basically explained that, even though they would not be working with me anymore, it would still be an inappropriate relationship.  They said they understood.  We wished each other well and hung up.

Then, as a last effort, I texted saying something along the lines of, ""You're going to be successful in whatever job you find.""  I could tell I was losing them and wanted to maybe say one last thing that might strike a chord.  They texted back some unkind things and implied that they would be ending their mental health services as well.

Because of my job, I have some knowledge of this person's medical and mental health history.  I'm not going on anything other than my own experiences with similar situations, but I feel like this person is headed down a terrible path into some seriously damaging behaviors.  I have some contact with their mental health team, but as this person is going to be discharged soon, I feel like I have two things working against me:

1)  Time, obviously.

2)  I'm just a peer mentor who cares a lot.  I'm not a clinician, I'm not licensed in any way.

I have this person's contact information, but as you can understand, it's a slippery slope.  I want to continue to reach out, but I don't want them to get the wrong idea.  I've mentioned it to other people I work with and they're not as concerned as me.

Throwaway account because I post a lot of personal stuff on my main one 

Two years ago (senior year of high school) I was in a mentally abusing relationship. I clung onto it because it was my first serious relationship. In my mind I was happy, but in reality I was constantly being manipulated, belittled, and ignored. I’ve lost all my close friends and joined my SO’s friend group which was extremely closed and toxic. I thought that having such an “elite” friend group meant happiness, but I couldn’t be more wrong. The relationship ended with me being cheated on. I was so oblivious, the girl joined our friend group before it happened, too. I begged him not to hang out with her alone, but he shrugged his shoulders. Here’s the important part that will help you understand my problem: he did not feel any guilt in cheating, he did not feel guilty for breaking my heart. He just shrugged and left. No consideration for me. After the break up I was so mentally destroyed I’ve starved myself for two weeks straight and lost my absolute will to live. Everything those two people did was completely malicious and mischievous but that is a wound that I do not want to scratch anymore. In the end, everyone left me, the friend group turned their backs against me as he was their “leader” and I’ve graduated school regaining a friendship with an old friend.

A few months after the break up, I ended up meeting my current SO. From the beginning he was caring and attentive to my existence. It felt amazing. Of course, the first few months were extremely rough, I was so damaged after my previous relationship I couldn’t love him. I felt like an empty vessel. When he told me he loves me I told him I will love him in time. And I did. 

Two years later I’m still with him. We have the most wonderful, healthy relationship I could ask for and I couldn’t be happier. I could go on and on about how our lives have positively changed but there’s no need to. I know he’s the one for me. We went through a lot of tough time and no matter what we always support one another. I also have an extremely healthy friendship with the friend I’ve rebonded with at the end of high school. She’s my best friend and she also has created a sibling bond with my SO. I’m extremely grateful for them.

My problem is that recently I started having these dreams. In my dreams my current SO suddenly, out of nowhere, announces to me that they’re leaving me for another person. And the announcement is done in a happy, careless way, with no consideration for me. The rest of the dream I cry and try to understand why this is happening. Why was what I felt not as strong as what he has felt, how can he just leave me like that? I bet him to not leave me but he is ignoring me, and I feel small. I wake up from these dreams crying with a painful heart, and a horrible mood for the rest of the day. It has also impacted, not in any sort of major way, how I feel when my SO speaks about his female friends. I immediately get uneasy and nervous, even though I know very well that he would never hurt me.

It’s very obvious that my mind is replaying what has happened before, but why now? How can I stop it from doing so? I see my ex and his gf (the same girl he cheated on me with) from time to time at local music shows but I really am indifferent to their existence. It doesn’t bother me anymore, I don’t care. I have my own life and what’s important to me is my future with my SO. It’s only these dreams that haunt me out of nowhere. I just want to take care of my mental health, and understand why in the back of my mind there’s still parts that didn’t heal.

The reason this affected me was because I had liked this girl freshman year of high school, but was completely new to this school and was having severe social anxiety. I decided in March of my freshman year to start being more social and to see a therapist about my anxiety. I later started eating breakfast at school with this girl and her friends and eventually built up the courage to tell her I had liked her. She rejected me and said to leave her alone. That put me into a spiral and I started becoming really manic which in turn left me with few friends and more anxiety. 

I spent my sophomore year mostly by myself again but choose a few friends to hang around. I was eating lunch with one of my friends and his friends when he said that I was the type of person to shoot up the school. This made me really suicidal and I had to go to my cities intensive out patient program (a program that took place for three hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons for six weeks). This program was to try and help my mental health while still allowing me to live a relatively normal life outside of the meetings.

This year, my junior year I started being more social and I felt better. I eventually texted this girl saying that I still liked her and asking if she could block my Instagram accounts. She went to the school therapist with this because I had posted a meme about suicide on my meme account. The therapist got really nervous and said that I couldn’t come back to school until I got clearance from my personal therapist despite my telling him that I was mentally healthy. This put my into depression and I had to work to get out of it. I eventually got better, but now I’m freaking out because I heard the girls voice on a video presentation in class.

&amp;#x200B;

This colleague (Di) was my friend when I first started working. She's the loud type, always broadcasting all the good work she's done. But I realize she's constantly badmouthing another colleague who's a bit slow. When I first started I always thought Di was the hard working one. After a few months I realize Di's critics on this other colleague can easily be applied to Di as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

9 months into the job, Di's father died of stroke. I get the sense that she was sad, and she still misses her dad, but never once did it occur to me she has depression because nothing really changed much in her lifestyle. I know because we still hang out as often as we used to before. Her appetite is still the same, she has no trouble socializing, and she still sticks to her weekly gym schedule. She talks to me about missing her dad, but that was it. No other self blame or regrets or suicidal thoughts or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

This goes on for another 7 months. And then Di and I got into an argument. We were working together, and she was doing something wrongly, and I tried to advice her. Wrong move on my part. From the way Di has been handling the other slow colleague, I should have realized that Di is someone who always thinks she's right. I thought it was a small argument, but the next day I found out from my boss Di took an emergency leave because she's not feeling well. And she wouldn't even reply my text.

2072,manman6352,1547123009,1,"Quote from nhs on dbt therapy:

*""Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a type of therapy specifically designed to treat people with BPD.

DBT is based on the idea that two important factors contribute towards BPD:

you are particularly emotionally vulnerable – for example, low levels of stress make you feel extremely anxious

you grew up in an environment where your emotions were dismissed by those around you – for example, a parent may have told you that you had no right to feel sad or you were just ""being silly"" if you complained of feelings of anxiety or stress

These two factors may cause you to fall into a vicious cycle – you experience intense and upsetting emotions, yet feel guilty and worthless for having these emotions. Because of your upbringing, you think having these emotions makes you a bad person. These thoughts then lead to further upsetting emotions. 

The goal of DBT is to break this cycle by introducing two important concepts:

validation: accepting your emotions are valid, real and acceptable

dialectics: a school of philosophy that says most things in life are rarely ""black or white"" and that it's important to be open to ideas and opinions that contradict your own

The DBT therapist will use both concepts to try to bring about positive changes in your behaviour.

For example, the therapist could accept (validate) that feelings of intense sadness cause you to self-harm, and that behaving in such a way does not make you a terrible and worthless person.

However, the therapist would then attempt to challenge the assumption that self-harming is the only way to cope with feelings of sadness.""*


So the goal of dbt is to find coping mechanisms to replace self harming.

What sort of things would be recommended here? Or am i taking this to lightly.

As a spouse to someone with bpd, can i use dbt in a simple form to help her? How do i validate her sadness and help her?

So I recently quit school to work on my mental health which is honestly a long time coming and my mental health usually takes a nosedive during the winter months. It has never been this bad though. I've never been with someone while this has happened so for the first time I find myself juggling my mental health and my gf whom I love deeply. Now the strange thing is that I will love hanging out with her than for some odd reason after a while not. It's as if a switch in my brain says you are aggravated, upset or depressed about this situation now and then my mood drops. This has never happened before. Before this situation, I had always been a fairly level headed and calm person but now I find myself getting annoyed/frustrated at the slightest task, schedule changes and failure. Having more than 1 dedicated thing to do for the day stresses me out beyond belief. The other day I failed at parking between the lines about 6 times and I just cursed and hit the steering wheel a ton while she sat there and watched. That never happened before. I'm just aggravated beyond hell and to add onto it I can't be physical with her anymore which sucks... Up until the month of month of December our sex life was great but since then it has happened 1 time which was great but I just no longer feel the drive to do it and don't really get totally hard in that situation. I will, however, go home and masturbate which gets me off really fast. I recently started taking Adderall for ADHD which might have something to do with that, but I have no clue. I hate that I don't wanna be physical with her, I hate it. It makes me cry, and that's another thing I Find myself crying all the time and just getting sad around people for little reasons. What is wrong with me? Is this just a depressive episode I am going through? I am really fucking scared here, I want to get back to what I was before this happened.

My sleepy head logic assumed it was an overzealous postman or some local kids whom I promptly expected to fuck off.

However I’ve never had it like this, and I’ve never heard noises once I had woken up and had come around.

I’m constantly on guard at work, jumping at the slightest little thing, seeing things out of the corner of my eyes that aren’t there and I’m honestly terrified.

2084,thru_glass,1547107203,1,"Hi.  A bit of a back story.   I have dealt with depression and anxiety for the greater part of my life.  Mostly depression, and then later anxiety sprung up for some reason.  I've always not enjoyed being around people but I assume that is normal but my ""anxiety"" with people got worse.  Also last summer I was dealing with PTSD but I don't think I am suffering from it anymore.  

Right now the only time I will go out in public is early in the morning, like the grocery store.  Otherwise if I go to the store when the general population is out I get extremely anxious (just very tense and just other dreadful feelings).  I was reading just a little bit about agoraphobia and it seems to be  majorly linked with panic attacks, which I don't think I have ever suffered from.  I mean panic attacks seem way more extreme because I only experience anxiety (albeit crippling at times) when in ""crowds"" but I don't consider those panic attacks, right?  

I recently quit my night job because working nights was messing even more with my already fragile mental health.  I was working nights so I could work alone, which I like a lot.  Now I am just at home, applying like crazy for jobs of course. But mostly I'm just lazy.  

This morning, I finally got around to taking a walk around the block for a little exercise since I am mostly sedentary.  I had been wanting to do this for quite some time and it has only been day one and now I am scared to do it again tomorrow.  But I know I need to push myself but it's just tough.  Why the hell do I get so nervous walking on the street?  During the day is a different story, I hate walking on the street during the day but this is morning and it is dark and mostly just cars but I feel like I am in a fishbowl even though I know no one gives a shit about me.  I don't want to take my anxiety medication so early in the morning just to walk out of my apartment building.  Even though it calms me, I would eventually probably feel sleepy when I get back home.  

I think if I get a regular job again my anxiety of being out won't be as bad.  But even with a regular job I am anxious.   I also get scared to death when I get invited somewhere.  I usually try to get out of it but if I can't I will take some anxiety medication to mellow me out, but I hate having to do that.  

I just moved back in with my mom so I am home all day and then when I spend some of the time with her after work I get so irritable and will usually get angry and yell at her.  It must because I'm so isolated and have no contact with anymore except her.  I don't want to be mean to her, i feel so bad afterward.  And I hate telling her sorry because after awhile it just gets old, I mean who wants to be told sorry and then it just happens again the next day, it doesn't seem right to me.  That's why I wanted to walk every morning.  I just feel hopeless.  It's like either I spend some time with her (and risk getting irritated and yell) or I go in my room and be alone but then she's all alone. 

BTW, I am currently on wellbutrin, abilify, and then I have clonazepam which tells me to take it every day but I only take it when I feel extremely anxious.  It feels just like a short term (8 hours max) solution and I don't want to grow a tolerance to it in case I really need it in a situation.  I was taking zoloft too (I was seeing another doctor out of state and just came back to my psychiatrist) but my doctor took me off of it because she didn't think it would help my depression (she kept asking why did that other doctor put you on that?), she said I didn't need to be on a SSRI since she said it mostly deals with compulsion.  I always thought SSRIs were for depression and anxiety.  Any other drug that helps with this (social?) anxiety, instead of a last ditch (emergency) solution like clonazepam?  

I don't know what exactly I am asking anymore but I am just trying to figure myself out and figure out how to get my life together because it seems like a mess, better than when I was dealing with PTSD but still.   I am trying (it is hard to concentrate on books at times) to read self-help books...of all kinds.

I give 110% at everything I do because growing up I was made to feel like I had to work extra hard just to keep up. Now I see that I am far more educated than many of my peers and I am a much harder worker. I don't mean to sound arrogant, there are many areas in which I fall behind (social skills for example). When I start a task it will consume my mind until it is complete and in excellent condition. Moderation is not my strong suit. With all of this in mind, committing to anything at all seems impossible. The economy is shit. My life is shit. Why bust my ass at a shit job for shit pay wasting the majority of my time each week being a ""productive member of society"" when I see that society as being counterproductive to the very existence of our species.

My mother is the most amazing person in the world, which in a way kinda sucks because otherwise I'd have just offed myself years ago.

2095,tangled-wires,1547097343,1,"My uncle (mid 50s male) recently had what could be best described as a nervous breakdown. He went to the ER and then a psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed him with depression.

Maybe I am not well educated on the topic but that is why I am posting here.

My uncle believes that people are listening to him and that someone is coming to get him. There was an incident where he pulled pages out of a notebook and then tried to claim he did not do it and it was someone else who pulled the pages out. He wakes up in the middle of the night and is supposedly very upset, he is constantly nervous and shaking. (He told the psychiatrist all of this.)

Is a second opinion warranted? He was fine over the holidays and this has never happened before. Should he get a brain scan to make sure it isn’t some tumor or other problem along those lines?

Thanks!

2096,o7606445,1547097283,1,"I have this pressure I put on myself that I should be ridiculously successful and that I should be able to learn/know almost everything when I can't. I frequently have been called out for trying to be a ""know-it-all"" when I frankly don't. I sometimes pretend to know what I'm talking about so people think I'm smarter. I feel like I should be doing something extra everyday like starting a business or club or volunteer blah blah blah. Because of this, it depresses me like crazy. I don't see a point in doing anything honestly. I barely want to do any school work and doing the bare minimum feels like so much work when it really isn't jack shit. I hate spending time with myself, I never know what to think about or I just constantly think about how I should be better than I am. I often find myself absorbing myself in reddit or youtube or something (nothing really healthy tbh) to just forget that I'm miserable and hopeless. I hate being alone, I fuckin hate it. I can't think of really anything that I genuinely would want to do whether that be an activity or a career. I'm honestly in a really damn good engineering program at a great school and believe i could get a pretty good job out of that, but it depresses me like hell to think about just workin some pointless ass job for some dumbass company 40 hrs/week just to make a living. What is the point to doing anything. I just give myself this pressure to be some multi millionaire or whatnot  but don't know if its even worth it at that point. I guess I'm just asking how can I live with myself without hating myself and be happy again? How can I stop comparing myself to other people and giving a fuck about what they think?

2097,hot-sauce1,1547097020,1,"I am currently a junior in high school and live in a very wealthy/preppy area. My school’s current method of discussing mental health is essentially just showing all students a (not very helpful) video about mental illness every time one of our classmates commits suicide. This is clearly doing next to nothing to aid the student body’s overall mental health, and does not relay the message to students that our school can help them. 

Some of my classmates and I recently founded a student-run organization in our school called the Mental Health Board. So far, we have held a couple of events for our school where we educate students on mental illness, how to handle stress, and how to help other students in need. While I am very proud of everything we have done, it seems that this has had little effect of the overall mental health of our school.

Earlier tonight I attended a town hall meeting regarding mental health in our city/state, where several law enforcement chiefs, presidents of mental health organizations, mental health professionals, and citizens discussed the important issue of mental illness and suicide in our community. I spoke to the group about my experience of how mental health is treated at my school, our attempts to improve this, and asked for any advice of what we should be trying to do. While the police chief’s response was very unhelpful, several people (parents who have lost children to suicide, people who work for mental health organizations, people who work for the city, etc.) gave me their contact information and told me that they are willing to spend time and money to work with me and my school to make a positive change. It seems that we certainly have enough manpower, funding, and passion to get something serious accomplished, but unfortunately I am lacking the creativity and understanding to think of what we should actually do with all of these resources. I would love to know what you all think would be most beneficial to the most people at my school regarding mental health. We have several well trained counselors and psychiatric professions at our school who would love to help, but students are not taking advantage of these opportunities, and mental health is a serious issue. I am very involved in my school and find it very likely that the administration would help me with this if I can get a detailed plan on what I want to do. 

TL;DR I have the resources to create a significant change in my school regarding mental health of students, but I don’t know what would be the most effective way to help people. 

I would also like to point out that I have not personally struggled with any serious mental illness, so I apologize if any of this sounds ignorant. I know that I can’t make magically everybody happy, but I have an awesome opportunity to help people in my school and I need advice on how to go about it.

2098,fakeaccountsorry123,1547096572,1,"I am afraid I have schizophrenia, and it's really fucking annoying. I just want to say first, I would like to go to a psychologist, but I am unable to for money reasons as well as social anxiety (which is funny considering I want help for my social anxiety but my social anxiety is preventing me lol).

Writing stuff out like this kind of helps me so.

About three nights ago I was trying to sleep, but my mind wouldn't stop making noises. I wasn't hearing things out loud, it was coming from my head if that makes sense. I don't remember what I was hearing, but I think I was making up car horn noises and just people talking. 

I suffer from Pure OCD instrusive thoughts (I suffer from sexual intrusive thoughts as well as pOCD), and sometimes my brain tries to convince me I'm crazy, which I think is the intrusive thoughts, but I have never read anything like this so maybe it's something else. Basically, my mind just tries to convince me I am crazy. 

I was looking at early symptoms of schizophrenia, 

1. Depression, social withdrawal  

2. Hostility or suspiciousness, extreme reaction to criticism  

3. Deterioration of personal hygiene  

4. Flat, expressionless gaze  

5. Inability to cry or express joy or inappropriate laughter or crying  

6. Oversleeping or insomnia; forgetful, unable to concentrate  

7. Odd or irrational statements; strange use of words or way of speaking

and regarding 1, I have become kind of depressed these past few days, but I think that may be either my period starting soon (even though I had my period about 3 weeks ago, but I do get depressed for a day or two before my period starts), or I just need more vitamin D or exercise. I enjoy being by myself, and while most people around me think it's weird and that I'm crazy (mainly my mom and one of my friends, the rest just think it's a kind of weird), I personally don't think it's weird. I just like being by myself. So yes I am socially withdrawn, but I don't know under what context it's referring to? 

For 2, I have been kind of angry these past few days, but I've also been able to think about my anger (like telling myself hey this is dumb chill out). I've never really thought through my anger before until recently, so that's cool. I don't think I have an extreme raction to criticism; if I am criticized I usually accept it I think or I'll ignore it. I don't relate to 3; I hate going out in public with greasy hair or long nails. For 4, I asked one of my friends and she said yes, but I always thought I moved my eyebrows a lot when I talked and smiled a lot? so not 100% sure how to answer. She said I looked bored most of the time. I don't have issues with 5. With 6, I am unable to concentrate, which actually makes me think I may have ADHD, and I have been looking into ADHD since I know boys and girls seem to have different symptoms, but idk if I maybe just need to drink more water or focus more? But I do have issues with being unable to concentrate. For number 7, I don't think I have issues with this.   

For possible delusions, 

The major thing is I do this thing where if I, for example, have two separate paths I can go to reach a destination, sometimes I'll get a feeling to go a certain way. I'll also get feelings of ""Oh, I should choose THIS water bottle, not that one"" for whatever reason. Sometimes I'll stand there and debate which bowl I should get because they're both giving me good feelings lol. Idk what the fuck this is, but it just recently started I think. I don't know if this is special thinking? This basically happens with everything, even if i decide wear something. However, it's not all the time. To add to this, sometimes I'll think ""You shouldn't eat that right now"" and my mom will end up bringing home some fast food or something later, so my mind is like ""SEE I told you not to eat that, so now you have room for a good chicken sandwich,"" and NGL I do sometimes have trouble seeing this as being illogical when something happens later that I benefit from whatever decision I made earlier (word jumble sorry, but idk how to word that lol). 

Another thing is the illusion of grandeur. I do seem to have this feeling that I am a ""chosen one"" ? (I know this sounds stupid, and that's another thing- I know this is illogical, and it's just like a small feeling of ""what if?"" I have). Again, I know this is stupid, but it's just a Hmm what if thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing that is kind of embarrassing is my mind will sometimes tell me ""If you do this, you might become crazy"" so I'm afraid to do certain things. For example, I like going on the watchpeopledie subreddit, but I limit myself because I'm afraid it will make me crazy and whenever I do watch something from there, my mind is always telling me I'm crazy now stuff like that. 

To add to this (I keep adding shit sorry), whenever it's dark, I won't see anything, but my mind is like ""What if you saw something"" and it's like my mind is trying to imagine something there. &lt;-- This part is my main issue that's annoying me and affecting me. 

Am I freaking out over nothing? :( I was thinking this is all just the work of an overactive mind but idk Thank you for reading if you did :)

2102,oboeyeah,1547090951,1,"I started building a wall around myself in middle school, when I first started my battle with depression and anxiety. In 7th grade I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and moderate Depression.

I feel so fake. I mean, when I laugh, I'm truly laughing and feel happy in that moment, but almost all the other times, there's always a sense of...dissociation, I guess? Like there's cracks in the wall where my true self can seep through, but I still keep up a persona. This person I've created and shown to the world is tough and cynical and doesn't like people. She doesn't like hugs or romantic movies and books and hates dresses.

That's just not true.

I'm not very tough at all. I'm really sensitive, and am easily hurt by people even when they don't mean any harm. I'll feel horrible if I hurt someone because that's the last thing I want to do, normally. Even through my skewed vision of myself I can see that I'm very caring person.

I love hugs. Especially my mom's.

I'm actually a romantic at heart, but no one would ever believe me if I told them. Part of me likes watching and reading romances, but at the same time that and people around me being in relationships makes me sad. I love the idea of true love and soulmates and stuff, but I'm terrified of rejection and vulnerability.

Here's an example:

I'm 18, about to turn 19, and I had my first ""real"" date a few months ago. For some dumb reason, I thought I was ready for a relationship. We met on Tinder and we go to the same college, and he was perfectly fine. But, he kissed me at the end of the date. Nothing crazy, it only lasted about 3 seconds. But once it was over I remember scrambling out of his hug and into my residence hall, impatiently waiting for the elevator to take me to my room. I was high on adrenaline, and texted my mom and a friend that I had just kissed a guy, and then it started to sink in. *I just kissed a guy. Oh my god, I just kissed a guy.* Granted, he kissed me, but I could've pulled away. I should've pulled away.

I broke down. Thank god my roommate wasn't there. I was frantically texting my mom while crying. This going to sound stupid as hell, but I felt...dirty, in a way. I'm not exactly sure why. There's was nothing really dirty about it, but even thinking back gives me the same feeling. I was freaking out. I'm surprised I didn't have a panic attack.

I had become vulnerable in front of someone. It makes it worse because I barely knew him, and also, I think part of me wanted time to build up the wall for him that I had already shown to everyone else.

Needless to say, we didn't have a 2nd date.

I'm so terrified to destroy that wall. That effing wall that I despise but also don't tear down. I'm petrified to get into a relationship and one day my boyfriend wakes up and realizes that the girl he's dating is fake and ugly. I'm scared to be vulnerable in front of others because I think they'll use it against me.

I don't want to continue to be fake, but at this point, if I start being true to myself, everyone around me is going to question me. I'm just scared.",mentalhealth,Scared to be vulnerable,2019-01-10 14:29:11

- **Self harm history** (Bulimia, relapse was 3 days ago; cutting for 12 years up until a year ago) 
- **Hyper empathy** (Feels like I absorb other people’s emotions, especially if they’re negative; can’t listen to sad songs or I will have a depressed mood) 
- **Paranoia** (Hyper-vigilant; distrustful of others; think others are always out to get me; always think the worst of others)
- **No relationships** (except with husband; all have blown up; thought all my life *they* were the problem but realized *I* was)
- **Low self esteem** (don’t recognize self in mirror or self in photos?) 
- **Conduct disorder** (criteria is met when I was younger if that matters)
- **Attachment issues** (did not attach to anyone until age 14 and when I did it was anxious attachment which I still struggle with)

I’m writing here because I don’t really know or have anywhere else to go to for information. Last month, I started to seriously look into finding a therapist. I signed up for BCBS health insurance through my company which kicked in at the new year, and I figured it would be a good time to actually start going to therapy. As a gay man, it’s very important to me that my therapist have experience working with LGBT patients. 

After a lot of back and forth and confusion, I found out that my mental health coverage is actually contracted through ComPsych which is now my sole provider. Their coverage pales in comparison to what my coverage would be like under BCBS, and it’s really demoralizing. Their customer service is pretty awful as well, and it’s hard to get quick responses to certain questions, especially with long hold times just to get transferred to the right place.

I started looking through their network and doing research and phone consultations, and to be frank, I don’t know how comfortable I’d be seeing any of their doctors. They’re either unresponsive, have terrible reviews online, or not someone I see myself making progress with after having a phone consultation.

I’ve considered seeing someone out of network, and the potential out-of-network therapists I’ve spoken to have been honesty amazing. I have out of network benefits, but even with these benefits or sliding scale options, financially it’s not nearly as sustainable as seeing an in network provider. I’m at a wit’s end to what to do. Do I foot the bill and pay to see an out of network therapist I really see myself having good enough chemistry with to make good progress? Do I try to meet with some of the in-network therapists who I didn’t have a good reaction to post-consultation just to see if it would work?

I have some big life decisions that I need to make by summer, and therapy would be invaluable in making them, so I’m scared that I’m gonna waste time with these in network providers.

Does anyone have experience finding therapists through Compsych? Does anyone have experience negotiating better coverage for an out-of-network provider? Is this something I should speak to HR about?

I’ve always been able to trigger episodes where I completely detach from my body, everything feels surreal and dreamlike and I feel completely out of control, like I have no idea what I’m doing or how to continue with it (walking, talking, etc), as though I’ve just woken up from a dream. It’s trippy and pretty frightening. This feeling, though lasting &lt;10 seconds is really unmistakable and intense and from what I understand, it’s probably dissociation.

The thing is though, I don’t get it in association with my panic attacks or when I space out with ADHD- it’s largely either a purposeful state (prompted with trigger phrases), or something that just kind of happens every once in a while. I’ve always been able to do it at will, and I’ve not found anyone else who can. (I’m 20 now, but I can remember doing this when I was younger than 9 or 10... it may have been going on for longer though.)

2120,SkeletalDiva,1547078557,1,"I'm just gonna get right into it. I'm 18 years old and I recently just finished high school. Last year during my senior year I was majorly depressed and isolated myself from all my so-called ""friends"". I only had one good friend who was also going through her own stuff and we sort of fed off of each other's sadness, but we would also make light of our situations. Last year is when I can say my ""depression"" really escalated. I was constantly stressed out about my grades, I was in a semi-stressful relationship, I isolated myself from almost everyone and I hardly ever left the house. Not to mention I've had an eating disorder than nobody really knows about. I've been bulimic for 3 years and I also have anorexic tendencies. During my final exams, all I did was binge eat and watch Netflix. I had been a perfect straight-A student the year before and I think I was just super burned out so I didn't feel the passion or desire to study. School was hard and demanding and I found myself just going through the motions. I would do my school work, go to school and talk to my one friend, come home and watch TV,  sleep, wake up, binge eat then purge. 

Although my depression escalated during this time, I have always had ups and downs. When I was younger a feeling of sadness would sometimes overcome me for absolutely no reason and then I would go back to normal. As I got older this feeling would come and go and I would ignore it. I told my mum and all she did was tell me to try and push it down and be happy. As I turned like 18 this feeling of sadness is now more pronounced and persistent. It's not a crippling feeling, I can still function but I'm it's as if there is a constant and subtle sadness that is with me most of the time.  Sometimes this sadness intensifies though and I have found that I have lost passion for most of the things I used to like. I have my whole life ahead of me, I'm a young and attractive girl but I have no true passion. There is nothing that really drives me except my eating disorder (I know it's fucked). I am happy at times when I get to leave the house and go out ut these moments are fleeting. Starving myself also makes me happy.

 I thought that after high school I would become happy because all the stress was off my shoulders but I'm not really. My final exam results came back and I got all A's, I have even been featured in several local newspapers as they were so good. I consider it an act of divine intervention from God that that even happened as I know I did not try as hard as I should have to get those grades. It was purely God. It was just a blessing that I really didn't deserve. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I know I've been ranting but here's my question (finally). I've got the perfect grades (which have opened up doors to so many privileged opportunities btw), I'm attractive and I'm young. Why am I not happy? I have not been diagnosed but I think I am depressed. Should I seek a counselor and get on anti-depressants? (I'm skeptical about this as I don't wanna be a zombie). Mental illness runs in my family and my mum has even called me crazy a couple of times when I've had sever breakdowns. What should I do? I don't want to go into 2019 with the same things that have been plaguing me. I want to get better and I want to be happy. Help me, I guess.

And so I've come here to ask a questions I've been asking myself for a while. Let me tell you a bit of the things I do. I constantly overthink and worry about little things. With me I know that if I do anything and the outcome of it is embarrassing I will hate myself for it. For example, I hate ordering food by myself at a fastfood resturant because I sound weak and awkward and so I get angry at myself for not speaking up and just ordering my fucking food. I cannot look at people in the eyes anymore. I personally refuse to look people in the eyes or just look at people in general because Im afraid of judgement and just a certain look and lower my self esteem. Im very insecure so I hardly ever do anything for myself that I should do, If my nose is stuffy and theres tissue in the front of the class I wont go up and blow my nose because I don't like adding attention to myself. My insecurities have built up since middle school, and they've taken a tole on me. I refuse to talk to people I don't know because of fear of them insulting me and making fun of me. I hate myself. I always find some way to pick at who I am. It doesnt even have to be that serious but I take it that way because I'm sensitive . I can't talk to my parents  friends about any of my personal problems because I hate crying infront of others and seeming  weak to other people, I personally feel that I won't be able to form stronger friendships with my friends because I hold myself back. 
Im sorry if this seems like a shitload of things  that aren't making sense. But I want to change for the better so that I dont continue to hate myself and not let myself be free from my insecurities.

2128,joobafob,1547071334,1,"As a bit of background, I'm 21M from the UK, and I've been suffering from anxiety (GAD, panic, health anxiety) for about 6-7 years, but it's been really bad over the past 2. As a result, I've been practically housebound and haven't really had much of a life in that time, although I am in therapy and have made significant progress in the past couple months. 

A couple of weeks ago, I was just watching Netflix before bed, as I usually do, when I had this weird thought of ""huh, my laptop is just a chunk of metal and plastic, so why do I like it"". This seemingly benign thought has spiraled into a series of bizarre and abstract existential questions that have sucked almost all of the joy out of my life. The questions are things like, ""why do I enjoy certain things?"", ""am I wrong to enjoy things?"", ""what's the point in caring about anything?"", ""why do I like things now that I thought were boring as a kid? Should I find them boring now?"". Like I said, very weird, almost nonsensical thoughts and questions. It's gotten to point know where I'm not even really having the thoughts, but I'll try doing something I usually enjoy and I just feel nothing. It's like if I'm watching TV, I can't empathise at all. It all feels so separate. The only thing I feel is a sort of heat or pressure sensation in my head, like my mind is trying really hard to feel something, but just can't. It's almost like fog, or a cloud. 

Right now, I don't know what to do. I keep telling myself to snap out of it, but I just can't. I keep saying it's just depression, but how could depression come out of nowhere as the result of one thought? I'm scared to see a doctor because I don't know what I'd say. I just feel wrong and it's all seemingly because of a conscious thought that I had one night. I'm scared that I've lost the ability to enjoy life now. I'm really confused and feel super low and honestly didn't really know where else to post something like this because, like I said, I'm not even sure what I'm feeling. Depression? Existential crisis? Derealization?

2129,champ_mc99,1547071256,1,"So last academic year I just started medical school. I fell into depression at the end of first term/January. Told my GP about it in February - she signed me up for CBT which had a 6 week waiting list. I wanted antidepressants but was not prescribed it as it could interfere with my epilepsy (just my luck).

So nothing to treat my depression it kept me awake at nights and caused me to miss lectures the next day. I spent most of the day not revising and just... worrying.

CBT started at the start of May, though I only managed to fit in about 3 sessions due to therapist being busy and had postponed a couple to revise for exams. 

Failed my exams. Had to retake all of them in the following august (spent revising from 5 to 8 hours a day during this period). Failed again by a small margin.

Now I'm retaking first year. I'm commuting to university. My parents don't let me join societies or go to the gym (let alone socials) as I let them down last year by failing. I've not got much of a social life - I have two friends who I don't see too often and they don't do much besides studying.  Last year I had loads of friends and used to go out to party often (before depression).

I finished my CBT and was feeling better but relapsed due to failing my exams, leading all my negative thoughts to come back. I'm lacking motivation to study.

Had a few ""dark thoughts"" but never would really act on them... for now at least. 

So great, am I gonna spend the rest of my student life lonely and miserable?

Oh how I envy the calm minded students passing all their exams while using their freedoms to drink the night away...

I started off 2018 very well. I was doing okay and I was motivated to really study for my A-level exams. But, as expected, I procrastinated a *lot* and kind of went crazy with overthinking and worrying that it was even harder to do something. I worried over failing, not being good enough and all that. Time passed by and I don't know how I did it, but I actually did ""okay"" for my standards. I was so relieved and then I was faced with the decision what I was going to study and where. Again, I began worrying, so much I couldn't handle my emotions, I cut myself after years of no physical self-harm. I applied to several unis and got accepted to my ideal uni because I wouldn't have to move. 

My semester started in October and I was motivated at first, but then my mood dropped, like a sack of potatoes. I have no future plans, I have no motivation, I have no direction and I was thinking on changing my major, but I believe that no matter what I'll decide to do, I won't ever be good enough. I just won't and it's so demeaning. 

I feel like I'm slowly giving up, or maybe I already have? I haven't been doing any studying. All my homework I do last minute and I've already missed deadlines (thus failing two classes, I think). I actually have to yet submit my homework   today, but I find myself... not caring😞? I don't really care at the moment, but I know the panic will hit me soon and then I'll drown in a sea of hopelessness and self-loathing. And everything's just shitty, because drinking (not much of course) and self-harm have become coping mechanisms.

My uncle confided in me that he was sexually abused when he was 5 by a a neighbor years ago but somehow forgot about it until now.

I also learned he was struggling with his sexuality. He looked very shook. One day he was really depressed and he wanted to ask me something because he thought he was really sick and that there was something really, really wrong with him and he wanted to get help for this problem. He told me he had a problem that was kinda personal and he trusted me. He confided to me that he thinks about men while masturbating. He said he didn't know if it was normal for a guy to be thinking that. He didn't know if that meant he was gay. I didn't know what to say. He then asked, "" well what do you think about when you masturbate...Women?"" I said yes. He then said, ""so its not normal to think about men, is it?"" I said No. He was shocked and I was a little freaked out as well. He really didn't know he was gay. He then said he thinks the abuse made him ""psychologically gay"" because all his life he thought thinking about men was normal up until recently when started questioning his sexual orientation. He asked me what he should do because the pills weren't working and didn't know what he was doing anymore. I told him to go to counseling. He said he was going to go get help immediately. I felt bad for him and worried. Now a year and a half later, he's still going to counseling and dealing with these problems. We still hang out but he's changed. He doesn't smile anymore and says that he feels ashamed and embarrassed about everything. How can I help him? Did the abuse make him gay?

I’ve had chronic nightmares since I can remember. Actually, I’ve found out that some of my earliest memories are recalled nightmares and didn’t actually happen.

I am used to having one or three “mild/medium” nightmares (which I wake up from) the majority of nights with maybe three or four days a month with some sort of relief and three or four really rough nights. 

It’s generally pretty damn exhausting and I’ve been sick of it for years now. I generally wake 4-5 times a night on average with 4-5 hours of sleep a night. I can always recall dreams and they are incredibly vivid and physical. They can completely throw me off for the whole day.

I’m really getting run down after years of this shit.

As of last night, I’m really not sure how much longer I can handle these nightmares without losing it.

Last night, I had one of the worst I’ve ever had in my life- i haven’t even been able to verbalize it to my husband it was so bad.
It involved absolutely hideous violence and felt like it lasted days. I soaked completely through my pajamas, sheets, comforter and quilt and woke into a massive panic attack, nauseated and crying. 

Didn’t go back to sleep.

Have not been able to function today at all. It’s been one big panic attack all day.

I desperately need relief, advice, techniques!! Please, if there’s anything that has helped you- or if you have something similar - please share!

I’ve been diagnosed with a few disorders: schizoaffective - bipolar type, nightmare disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

I attend regular appointments with a psychiatrist and a therapist.
Currently taking seroquel, Zoloft, prazosin for said nightmares, and ambien on a case by case basis.

tl;dr - I’m on the brink of losing it if I can’t control my chronic nightmares. I need advice/ techniques to get some relief ASAP!

( I broke a window, and changed the locks) anyways. I was all prepared to go, knowing I need help. I have already done the program that helps you at home and clearly that wasn't working. So I go to the hospital, both nurses who help me are so good and nice. Then the doctor came, the doctor desmissed my case completely. Made me feel worthless and stupid. All she did was give me meds. And sent me home. We tried telling her that I was not safe at home and I was scared that I would have another blackout. ( They happen randomly once a week or twice. I have no control over them) she pretty much said because I don't want to kill myself they can't admit Me. So I said when can I come back. What if the pills don't work?  She said until you have another accident we can't do anything. I felt lost, I felt hurt. She wants me to go home and potentially hurt people just so they know for sure something is wrong. We went home defeated, at this point I was so hurt in my mind there was nothing I could but go home and try and hurt myself so someone could help me, anyone .

I've got a sick note until the 28th and have been referred to some kind of psychological team. I'm finally ready to let them know everything instead of thinking that everything they do will me me worse. Whilst I've been okay enough to stay away from the various mental health services, it's still been pretty difficult to get through most days but due to my past experiences I've able to use that to keep myself somewhat sane.

Anyway, I'm getting a little too old to keep changing jobs every few months and completely messing up my life every few years. This time I may lose my flat and job which is a bit of a pain but shit happens. If this happens then I plan to get a gym and swimming membership to some local club and hit it pretty hard for 6 months, stay on meds, do my appointments and stuff and re-evaluating if I can get back into work and my own accommodation from there. 

Does anyone have any experience with using physical fitness to get better? Can anyone recommend a pretty intensive plan that I can have a look at? 

I don't take recreational drugs much anymore. Maybe once or twice a year. I pretty much stopped drinking all of last year only really starting again recently when my sleep levels dropped to a hour or two per night. Obviously I plan on dropping these again once I'm back on meds but I thought after dropping them the first time that would be half the battle. I do smoke tobacco but as far as I'm aware it doesn't have any negative effects on your mental health so I will continue the fight against that one.

I'm hoping that if I chuck myself head first into fitness then I can stop the cycle of getting a job and place and then messing up a little down the line. Can someone please share their stories and recommendations.

Not a frequent poster and a native english speaker here
Haven’t posted in a long time, god knows how it works. Just looking for anyone’s two cents on this topic.

To start off, I’ve been to 4 specialists. Two psychologists, two psychiatrists. First psychologist experience wasn’t so good, after that I’ve just been sceptical about it. 2 years went by and after things have gone a lot more severe and things were even more rough than ever before, I’ve decided to finally give it another shot. Here I am, with my second psychologist at the current moment. First psychiatrist was a private one, in between of the two psychologists. Got diagnosed after two visits, at least got that out of it. Dropped her after that, it was too expensive to watch her sit and not say a word for 45 minutes.  It was all about Social anxiety disorder at this point.

Back to my third and current specialist (psychologist). I’m just lost whether I’m expecting too much or just blind, oblivious to the “help”.  She denies everything I’ve been telling her, presumes her own things, literally just stomps on me emotionally. Haven’t been to fourth psychiatrist much, as she only gave me a paper document of  a trial of homeschooling, as I’ve not been able to go to school.  

Is it supposed to be like that? Is it normal? Am I just too dumb for help?

I was also frequently going to the gym at the time, so I was also taking creatine, and pre-workout which is basically junk loaded with stimulants and caffeine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the gym one day and took pre-workout. Mid-day the following day, I took an adderall (don't remember the dosage since Im not really prescribed for it), and smoked some weed at night. All I remember was bending down to get something in my closet and then felt EXTREMELY dizzy and disoriented when I stood up. Everything I heard sounded like it was echoing, my skin felt itchy, I was shivering but sweating, felt like i couldnt breathe right, and I felt a sharp pain in my chest and an overwhelming sense of fear. I tried to sleep it off but just could not help it, so I stood up but immediately vomited. I felt better afterwards, but had brain fog that lasted about 5 days after the incident (couldn't think straight, felt dumb, zero concentration. Everything felt dreamy). The paramedics that night took my vitals and didn't see anything wrong, they just said gym supplements tend to have a lot of junk in them and I just needed to get it out of my system.

I just dismissed it as a panic attack. But I randomly thought about the brain fog three years later today... Could I have had a mild heart attack that caused my brain to be oxygen deprived, hence the brain fog? Can heart attacks go away?

2168,piinkmoth,1547048516,1,"I think something might be wrong with me, but I don’t know what. Sorry for the long post ahead.

A few weeks ago my mom said that I have been acting different lately, and that I haven’t been myself. She couldn’t really give me any concrete examples of why. I didn’t think that I was acting differently, but took her word for it, and told her that I would try to be more self-aware of what I was doing and how I was acting. I assumed that my anti-depressants might be not working and I hadn’t realized it yet. 

This weekend we went to the casino one day with a family friend. I was having some period cramps, but other than that felt fine and assumed that we were having a good day. When we got home that night she wouldn’t talk to me and I assumed that something was wrong, but didn’t want to push it. The next morning when I got up, she told me that I had completely ruined her day. She said that I was acting like a spoiled brat, and that she gambled away $200 just because she was pissed off. I asked her what it was I did that made her angry, and she said that I was just acting “like a spoiled brat” and I rolled my eyes at her. I truly and genuinely do not remember doing this, and I think she mistook me shaking my head or looking away or something for eye-rolling. I was genuinely shocked by this, and actually started crying because I felt so bad. I apologized genuinely and profusely, and couldn’t stop crying for the rest of the day. I felt angry that she called me a spoiled brat, because I don’t think that was deserved and I really and truly don’t know what I did wrong. I didn’t talk back to her, though, because I was raised better than that and know that it wouldn’t do any good. She accepted my apology and said it was “over and done”, but I’m still upset about it. I make the money for the two of us and work my ass off, so the spoiled brat thing really dug deep into me (I didn’t bring this up, though, because I’m not an asshole).

I will be the first to admit when I have done something wrong, and it’s totally possible that I was acting badly that day, but I really truly don’t think I was. This scares me that I am not acting like myself. I scheduled an appointment with my doctor to maybe change my anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication because I think that maybe it stopped working and that’s why I’ve been acting “different”. But I feel like I’m going crazy and need a mood stabilizer or something to just shut my emotions off. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, and I’m genuinely afraid for my mental health that I’m bipolar or borderline or something and don’t realize it. I feel like I have acting the same as I always have, but apparently not. Is there any weird personality disorder or mental illness that can cause this?? Sorry again for the long post.

The 2nd shift person calls out today. I WANTED TO. This makes me feel SO shitty right now. I'm fuckin miserable. Nobody else cares if they screw their coworkers over. The part time fill-in, who, even though she complains about not getting enough hours, said she couldn't come in to fill in. They have one more employee to try before they ask me to do a double. ( i just had back surgery a few months ago and physically cannot sit here for a whole 16 hours). Like wtf. Why do i always have to be the dependable one? I'm fighting back tears bc I'm so fuckin aggravated. Every phone call is pissing me off. I feel bad that I have an attitude towards my fellow employees and visitors who've done nothing wrong, but nothing can shake the way I feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: don't have to do a double. But i'm still pissed about my missed opportunity to grab some peace of mind and sleep today. Thankfully I'm transferring departments in a few weeks and if I need to call out, it won't be that big of an issue. They're interviewing potential receptionists as I type. Can't fuckin wait.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading my vent, if you did.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Wanted to call out of work, didn't cause i don't like screwing people over. 2nd shift person called out - screwing people over. Fill-in person said she couldn't come in - screwing people over. Now I'm on the verge of an anxiety attack because I've been barely sleeping and getting very agitated. And I'm taking it out on employees, callers, and visitors.

The three of us were inseparable, and while it seems that my buddy has moved on from Bill's death I don't think I have. I've seen therapists and I've tried talking, but I'm still to this day tormented over Bill's death by my own brain and my inability to let it go. I have dreams all the time about Bill, and most of them he's alive in the dream and doesn't realize he's dead, so I go through the motions with him and I generally wake up sobbing. It had been a while since I had any dreams about him, but two nights ago I had dreams about him and he was dead in the dream. It was me at his house going through his things with his mother, and I'd wake up from the dream and go back to sleep and it would just pick right back up.

Ever since then I've been stuck in this rut where I feel like I have this constant black cloud over my head and I can't seem to kick it. I want to cry almost every waking minute, and just can't seem to get my mind off those dreams.

Does anyone have any input as to what might be able to help me, should I go back to therapy if I feel that the first time there wasn't really any help? I feel like if I talk to my other friend about it, he just doesn't feel it the way I do, and I think a lot of that is because he's extremely hardened from his time in the military (combat) and I think he's just more used to this then I am.

2172,skinner1818,1547045260,1,"For the last year, I have been struggling with the resurgent effects of depression. I suffered badly for several years during school, a mixture of home pressure and bullying. But after leaving school I knew a few people who helped to drag me into the real world. They eventually drifted away, but I thought I had made enough changes to my life that I thought I was over the worst of it.

The scary thing is that I did not really know that it was happening, it was a slow creep that changed me so slowly I barely recognised it and the effect it was having on me. I lost interest in daily life as a whole. I stopped seeing people, stopped going to the gym, stopped taking supplements, stopped writing, stopped gaming, stopped reading. My life just became a cycle of work, home, eat, sleep repeat. I did not even care that I had undone nearly two years of weight loss within six months.

I have to thank my brother for helping me out this time. During my usual Christmas stay at my parents, he physically forced me to go out. He brought me along to meals with his friends, encouraged me to talk to them and drink with them. And for the first time in months, I felt something other than hollow. It felt like surfacing briefly from a deep pool, only to sink back down again without realising.

That surfacing, brief as it was, seems to have eased something. I started using a notebook, writing what emotions I had felt that day. Since Christmas day, it has only been in the last four days where I have definitively felt anything. Most of those have been negative, with one day having a positive emotion (Christmas day itself).

In the last four days, I have noticed my appearance again, even though it is overweight and pallid in clothes that show every flaw.  I feel shame about how I look and anxiety about how I am seen in public.

But they are emotions, and they are not blank pages.

This post has become a bit rambly, and I know that everyone experiences depression differently, with different triggers and different solutions. This is not a post about how to deal with depression, I am still a long way from that and have no right to tell anyone how to live their life as everyone suffers differently.

This is my story of my first steps. And I can add 'determination' to my notebook, the second positive emotion.

2173,nimbus_rose,1547044682,1,"Here are some things I really need to get off my chest:

I am not a happy person. I feel fleeting moments of happiness, but overall I am not happy. I feel more and more the need to convince myself that I like my job, because I can no longer tell if I’m being abused by it or just being overly sensitive due to past emotional trauma. Every time my mom tells me she wishes I lived closer to her, all I can think is “No way in hell” and then I immediately feel guilty. 

Every time I leave my therapist’s office I feel pretty good and hopeful, but that feeling never lasts long before something happens to chase it away. 

I have one friend whom I trust enough to share my vulnerabilities, but I don’t feel safe doing so with the rest of my friends. I love that friend like family, but I also feel like the only reason I have any other friends at all is because the two of us were treated as a package deal. They wanted her, and got stuck with me. Logically I guess that probably isn’t true, but my emotional state doesn’t always respond to logic. 

I have anxiety and constantly worry that nothing I’m doing or could ever do is good enough for the people around me. As a child, I thought that if I did everything possible to fulfill someone else’s needs, they would do the same for me. Thinking like that made me feel that there was something I could do to fix the fact that my needs were being neglected. I don’t know how to stop thinking like that. 

My anxiety once got triggered by a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons in which my character had a heated confrontation with her daughter that caused me to subconsciously recall similar confrontations I’ve had with my own mother.

2175,rosebudpng,1547044114,1,"My family and I have a complicated and strained relationship. I moved back into my parents' house after college and now live with my mother (59), father (68), sister (33), and her daughter/my niece (10). 

My mother has a history of emotional abuse and alcoholism. We get along okay, but I have a lot of unresolved trauma from bearing the brunt of her abuse growing up. She also can be really immature, and can't see beyond her own frustrations. My sister is a pathological liar and a textbook r/raisedbynarcissists parent. I'm sure you can see how having these two around makes the house feel like a powder keg. 

My dad and I have taken it upon ourselves to be my niece's form of stability, and I always try and separate her from situations where my mom and sister verbally (borderline physically) have it out with one another. But today, apparently, is the last straw for my sister. My mother accused her of stealing money from her, so now my sister is threatening to pull my niece from school at the end of the year, saying she'll move out of the house.

This terrifies me. My sister is (supposedly) always at work, meaning I see her daughter/my niece more often than she does. Despite allegedly working 40-50 hours a week at a decent pay rate, she still doesn't have enough money to pay my dad for ""rent"" (only $100 a week, and he's often lenient and doesn't ask her for the money at all). All of my niece's toys, clothes, etc. are things that me, my dad, or my mother have bought her -- my sister didn't even spend a dime on my niece for Christmas. We don't know where her money goes. 

I know that if my sister moves that my niece will suffer even more than she does now, but I also know that if my sister does decide to leave with her, and there's nothing I can do about it.

For the mental health aspect of this post: This situation is causing me to spiral. I have pretty bad anxiety, and I've had one of the worst panic attacks of my life just now. I feel the intense need to self-harm, even though I haven't done so in months. The thought of eating or drinking anything makes me sick, and all my mind is doing is racing at the thought that my niece will be left with strangers, go unfed, or worse if my sister does end up leaving. I'm also feeling intensely guilty for making this situation about myself and my mental health (even as I write a whole post about it, ha). I'm not sure how to handle this.

I mean, it does not bring any benefit at all, and on the contrary, it seems to bring more cons than pros. People would be afraid of you, shy away from you, look at you through tinted lens. Your future actions will also be questioned and scrutinised for any hidden agenda and your current relationships might be strained especially considering the negative perception of sociopaths/psychopaths in the media (which you have to admit, are based on certain degree of truth, e.g.serial killers).

No doubt a psychopath/sociopath knows this, given their above average intelligence and calculating nature, so why would they choose to expose this more than undesirable side of themselves(especially given that they like to create better facades of themselves)?

I started realizing because of the reactions ive gotten from family and friends that i dont care about others like most people do. I can be quite cold at times. I care if someones hurt or if their lifes in danger but i dont care to be around them, interact with them or do anything for them unless truely nessesary. I used to as a small child though. Anytime my family talks to me i roll my eyes and just want to get away but stay usually just so i dont cause a problem. Occassionally i wont accept a hug from my mother and this upsets her deeply and she'll yell at me and loss her temper. When shes not crazy or drunk, shes extremely overbearing and wants my constant attention. Its normal to go do occassional stuff with a loved one i think but she wants me to do stuff with her all the time, usually daily and its taxing and anytime i show disinterest she usually ignores this and if i say clearly i dont want to she gets angry with me. When im away from home for a few days at my friends (im an adult) she misses me but she also seems jealous of my time and asks weird questions about my friends so i try hard to keep the volume down when speaking on the phone and get off as soon as possible. She talls so much. All the time. And she embarrasses me to no end. Shes like this with other family too but more with me prob cause i show the most disinterest. My dads dead due to his drinking problem. He loved us but i never felt emotionally connected to my dad. He was emotionally distant all my life and I just didnt care to be around him when i got older. Both my parents constantly fought and when drinking it caused trauma for me and my sis because of the violence. They both hurt eachother physically and my mothers hit us all at different times, me taking most of it when she drinks. My brother has extreme anger issues and repeatedly hurt me and others deeply emotionally and i dont really talk to him now. My other brothers an alcoholic with a violent past with people and drug use and all that shit but he wants to be there for me and my younger sis. My older sis is a liar, distant and never talks to us. She didnt even go to our dads funeral. My younger sisters autistic but has mostly grown out of it. Shes just super introverted, lazy and acts like a child. Thing is despite these things i know they still love me, at least most of them. But i dont return the love. And i dont care much about others either. I avoid talking to family members, even my younger sister. I dont pick up calls usually and hope they just stop wanting my attention. Plus i dont let any other family members in either, like my aunts, uncles or cousins.
My friends are a little different. My best friend ill talk about after the others.  I have respect for my friends and they brighten my day, thus i spend time with them but its more for a selfish reason i think because i dont care about them as much as i should. I still have a problem with wanting to see them like i do family and sometimes only agree to hang because i feel i have to to keep them around.
My best friend on the other hand is literally the only person ive ever truely cared about and sacrifice things for purely because i want to, not because i think i have too. We had a little history 3 years ago in highschool (we're both girls) that was very confusing and only resulting in kissing so we stopped to preserve the friendship. Ever since ive had feelings off and on and i care about her more than any person ive dated as well because, like everyone else, i dont care about people that much, even my romantic partners, except her. Ive noticed paralells in how i feel for my best friend and how she loves me. Ive noticed that other people who love me want me around like she does but i just dont.
I feel this is a problem. I am reaching out because i feel im missing a big part of life. I feel like all the love i have focused on my best friend should be the same for all my other loved ones and friends but i just dont feel that way and i dont know if thats bad or warrented toward my family and the things they have put me through. Im aware i may be selfish but im definently not toward my best friend. I care about her happiness more than my own. And shes been through similar things that i have growing up. She even has this same issue of not caring about others except me and our one other friend. Both our dads are dead for the same reason. Its like shes ment to be in my life. We always have fun and theres not a day that goes by that we dont talk to eachother, even if just over text. I think this is what its like to be in love with somebody. She doesnt know about my residual feelings however and it kills me because i cant tell if she still feels that way or just as her best friend.
Ive had persistent depressive disorder, anxiety and dissociative symptoms since middle school. I just wish i could have the connection i have with my best friend with others since this seems to be how normal minds work. Not the in love with them part, just the fact that i should be able to care about other people like i do her, right?

TL;DR: Basically ive had a traumatic homelife and i cant connect to others around me emotionally. I dont care to be around people who want to spend time with me but ill do it anyway because i feel i have too to keep them around.

I was in therapy weekly and that kept me (mostly) above water.  In sept. I moved to a different city on the other side of the country and my mental health instantly improved.  In nov.

Now on new years eve I was told I have lost the apartment, after just 2 months of living there, and I have 2 months, but preferably 1 to move out. I have the landlord breathing down my neck, but due to me not being able to get any income other than absolute minimum gov.support, my rent money is limited, and I can't afford an actual move. My mental health also makes it impossible to have flatmates, and nobody wants a cat. 

I have the choice of loosing all my belongings, accept flatmates on the cost of my mental health, and keep the cat. 

Loose the cat, which is my main emotional source of support, and possible some of my belongings and move into someone's basement or something

Keep the cat and all my belongings, but move away from the city where I have now built a mental health treatment plan along with doctors, move away from the posibility of any work, move away from my only family that is not toxic - and live in a house isolated away from everything, together with a previous abuser. 

Now I am keeping that cat, so it's either 1 or 3, but people really negatively affect me. So I have applied now for government housing just until I get more income and can support myself, wait time for reply  4wks, and then if approved, an additional wait until I know where I can move, so I am hoping for it, but so so scared it won't come in time for the end of rentig-contract. It's also super strict and require me to have lived in the city I apply for for 2yrs, which I have not.

2192,ClownGiggles,1547030149,1,"Today I woke up and realised that I had lost all sense of reality. I no longer feel like i have a grasp on what is real, what is not; what is important, and what has meaning. On my walk over to the lab today I started to realise how disconnected from the world I feel. As I was walking and looking at the environment around me I started thinking about it in detail. I was trying to be more in the moment, but in doing so I felt even more disconnected. When i tried to instead think about the past or the future I found myself unable to, memories all seem like a white hazey blur, and the future just seems entirely blank. Not blank in the sense that I can make it whatever I want to, but instead empty, as if I cannot even envisage a future of any kind significant enough for me to want it.

As I got onto campus I started to think again about the present moment, and about what would happen if I didn’t exist in it. Not in the sense of not existing at all, but instead in that specific moment and time; if I suddenly disappeared and had a different life, what effect would it really have? Are my current and previous actions really all that important? If I were to suddenly seem to stop being around, what would people think/do? 

I wonder if my teachers would worry, or would they only notice my absence because of missed work reminders, rather than actively being aware that I am no longer present.

The more I try to be mindful of my thoughts, my fears, and where they stem from, the less connected I feel to them. It seems to me that when I take the time to actually think about the things that are affecting me, they themselves lose all of that meaning I was placing behind them; and if those are the things that motivate me to act and think a certain way, then removing that meaning leaves me with nothing at all. I question everything that i assign meaning to, my thoughts, my actions, my choices, my relationships, my possessions. They all have a meaning based in past and emotion, but if I remove that meaning by being more aware of why they have meaning, all those things quickly lose their significance to my life. 

The things I thought defined me, made me who I was, and gave me a purpose, suddenly mean nothing at all; so why was I so concerned with them in the first place.

In a sense, it gives me the freedom to live in the moment, and not have any form of attachment to any one idea, person, or quality. But, it also makes me question if I am searching for something that doesn’t exist. I feel like I want to start over, find something new, experience new things,and make those connections and meanings that I believe in, and after analysis remain something that I am happy with, but I am unsure if those things are possible. Is what I currently have the best I will have? Will I continue to be miserable and feel insecure about my own mental health the more I look for something to make me feel more complete and secure in my life?

I have to do everything myself, which I'll get into why later. I recently lost my cat, and things have been going downhill. Suicidal and Homicidal thoughts are going up and I can't go a day without crying so hard before feeling so numb. I keep having bad memories, so many. I'd call my mom neglectful. She's always gone. Screwing other people, hanging out with friends, she stopped making dinner when i was 10, or any meal. She forces affection on me and snaps so often and gets mad at me, i'm constantly afraid of making her sad and upset. it's been engraved in my memories, making her upset, is literally worse than anything. It's always about her feelings. I can't tell anyone about the fact she forcibly hugs and shows affection. She kissed me once, on the head and i spent an hour trying to clean myself off because I felt so uncomfortable and I ended up cutting myself because I couldn't deal with it. My brothers been hitting me, choking me, slamming me into walls, literally hurting me so much. Sometimes grabbing knives and threatening me with them, he never does anything but laughs when he sees im in fear. I can't say, I have any family. I've never been close with my dad, although he's been here for me the most, I still can't really call him ""my dad"" infront of other people. I say, I'm a single child because that's what my brother wants. He doesn't want me to be his sibling. I bet once I kill myself maybe he'll be happy. My parents got involved too soon and had kids too soon. They both regret it. I feel like a mistake. I'm so afraid to tell anything like this to my therapist because i'm terrified of what my mom will say. I don't want to hear her yell again, she's so loud and i feel so scared when she does that. A few months back my mom and brother got into a psychical fight, and I was awoken to my mom screaming with this horrible horrible voice that sounded not like hers, to call the police. I couldn't find my phone. I began freaking out, I couldn't breathe, I felt extremely suicidal. I fell to the ground in shock and pain, when she says she was leaving, I didn't know what to do. I was glad but scared. She came back 2 days later. I wished she didn't. I feel so lost with education and everything. At this point, I'm so so close to committing suicide. I don't want to do this anymore. I can't. I'm so lost, I don't know what to do and I know I'm not gonna live another year.

2196,underseawalnut,1547027719,1,"I'm not the best person. I don't know how else to write this, so I'm going to list some of the bad traits I've noticed, things I do and say that just feels so natural until later when I think over what I've done and realize how \*not normal\* they were.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I feel as if the world owes me something. I don't outright say it, but I feel my personality is leaning toward that thinking. I just look at people and expect them to be nice to me without me having to put in any effort. Yeah, I'll jump at the chance to do things for them, respond to them if they make small talk with me, or just smile at them in general, but I feel those aren't enough considering I don't actually talk to people or acknowledge them until they make the first move (which I know is a real shitty thing to do, but I just don't know what to say or do around other people).

\- I'm not the greatest daughter. I am short with my mom and treat her the same way she treats me, which I know is wrong, but I can't help but do it. It just feels natural to just not give a crap about her feelings and such like she has done to me, my brother, and sister. I want to change that. She's been saying she wants to kill herself ever since she quit her job that she's been working at for years and it scares me that I can't feel anything but annoyance any time she says things would be better if she killed herself. I hate how far my lack of feelings for her has gone and it terrifies me.

\- I'm not the best sister. My mom has pitted us against each other for our whole life, things like shit talking one of us to the rest of us. For example, for some reason my mom hates my sister (ever since we were little) and has always talked shit about her to me and my brother. As a result, we see our sister as someone who's disgusting, lazy, and a nobody despite her paying the majority of the bills and actually having friends outside of the family. She goes out and do normal things, the only thing that's true is her being a slob by never cleaning her room (piles of clothes in corners of the room, trash like candy wrappers and junk in the drawers, etc.).

Because of the way our mom has raised us, I don't feel any love for my little brother (20) and older sister (23). I feel the same unnatural dislike my mom has for my sister, although I feel that my dislike is so much lesser than my mom's. I want to change how I treat my sister.

My mom (M) would take stuff from my sister (S) and give them to us. Things from food S had bought for herself and just things in general. And I take it. It really scares me how much I don't care when these things happen until S discovers what happens. I feel S is so unwelcome in our house, but she has no way to leave since her credit is too bad to move. I really want to change how I treat her, but I don't know how.

\- I don't know if I'm depressed or just lazy. I don't shower regularly, I don't clean up during my days off, I hate going to work and being around other people, and I just hate getting up from the couch and leaving the internet unless it's to go watch a movie. I think I'm depressed, but I don't know. I want to say that I feel like I'm in a black hole with the light of the stars behind me in a tiny circle signaling the opening of the black hole and how deep I'm in it. I'm floating in a space of nothing, yet there's this pressure closing in all around me. I feel weightless, yet heavy at the same time...if that makes any sense.

\- I am a heavy procrastinator. I know what I want to do with my life, but I can't work up the motivation to do anything. I know what I need to do and how to do it, but I'm just watching as the days turn into weeks then to months and I'm still working at a job I hate.

\- If given the chance, I'll lie to save myself. Things that are so obviously a lie and makes my heart pound because I know it's wrong, but I can't stop the lie from coming out. It literally just slips out. And it's over the smallest things, things that won't negatively affect my life. It's stupid and ridiculous.

Those are the top things I can think of, but I know there's more. I want to place the whole blame on how our mom raised us. She didn't teach us how to be respectful adults, she just sat there and expected us to know what to do and how to behave. Her discipline methods was to beat the hell out of our asses with a belt. I feel with physical discipline, a parent should set a limit of spanks to the offense, but she would just keep hitting as if she's working out her anger, and it's usually over the smallest of things (me and my brother were never spanked for burning paper and leaves in his toy truck, but my sister was spanked for shouting at my brother in an argument they were having). And of course, with us taking after her, we treat each other like shit. There are good moments where we're a family, but 95% of the time we're at each other throats.

I want to change the person she turned me into, but I don't know how. I think therapy is the only way, but I keep putting it off to look up later. My brother has been in prison for 3 years and he gets out in 3 weeks. He has these plans to get himself and us out of the hood, but I feel that as soon as he steps foot back into this family, all of it will be squeezed and drained out of him. My sister has been saving up money and my mom calls her evil each time S denies giving M any money (and it's never for anything important, mainly for things that could wait until we get paid again), and I know she'll do the same to my brother. I want to change who I am so I can be someone my brother can depend on when our mom eventually turns against him.

I'm sorry this has gotten so long, I just need a push in the right direction to better myself. It feels like I'm asking too much for this sub and I'm really sorry for this.

TL;DR - I feel that the person that I am needs to go. I feel that my mom is toxic and was the main problem in how I turned out. I feel stupid trying to say my mom was the main problem, but I can't see it any other way. I want to change myself for the better and become a better person, but I don't know where to start.

2207,TraditionalDefiance,1547017163,1,"I got to school early today to talk to my academic counselor. It was the first day of second semester and I was really nervous (but also excited?) to find out if the schedule change I had requested at the end of last semester had been approved. If so, I would finally be out of the absolute living hell that is my English class. 

I was mislead by my current teacher into taking this class when I asked her if there was a lot of public speaking in the AP class. She said no. See, I think for most people 5-6 presentations, essay readings, in class ""stand up"" quizzes (where you get put on the spot to answer a question that decides whether the entire class gets points for that question), socratic seminars, or assignment presentations per month would count as a lot of public speaking, but not for this teacher.

My anxiety skyrockets when I have to speak publicly. It completely consumes my entire life. I don't eat for a full day beforehand, I don't sleep several nights in a row, I occasionally throw up, I usually go through an anxiety attack shortly beforehand, and, if it's really bad, I pass out. If I do make it to the actual presentation, it's a mess of tears, stutters, anyways you get the point. It's *bad.* I am lucky to be on a 504 at school that allows me to do presentations in front of my teacher only, but my English teacher finds all the loopholes in it to the point where I am left literally powerless. Last semester in that class was terrible, as you may be able to imagine.

Anyways, after expressing this with my psychologist, she let me know that she could write a recommendation to the school to get me out of the class. I was ecstatic. I walked into my academic counselors office the very next day, handed her the note, and requested a schedule change. She let me know that I could only be taken out of the class in the 2nd semester. She put in my requested and handed me an appointment form to check back in with her after break. I was so excited.

My request was declined. Something about a strong recommendation by my teacher against it because she thinks I have ""lots of potential."" So now I'm hopeless.

2213,BywaterLabs,1547008715,1,"I made a journal template a few months ago and I have found it useful, so I am sharing it here. It is slightly complicated, but you don't have to use all of the cells if you don't want to. Basically, every day you enter in values for your mood, anxiety, and whether you performed a certain habit or not. The habits I have in there are social, sleep, supplements, stretching, meditation, guitar, reading, and jogging. There are more clarifications to the right of the journal in the document. The values needed to get a 100 are entered into the first week. The goal is not necessarily to get a 100, I just wanted a consistent way to track my progress at these habits and I don't like all of the habit apps, so I built my own. The reason sleep is a 2 is because you can go to bed on time, but wake up late, or vice versa. I made the socializing habit more complicated because I believe that it's important to be social and to keep track of how often you are social if you have social anxiety like I do. What gets measured gets managed, right? But I weigh certain social activities much more heavily than other ones. Feel free to change this all up if you want to!

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to adjust the math, just keep in mind the bottom row of each week has math in it that creates a score out of 100 for each different habit, and the YELLOW box to the right is where the final week's score is displayed. That box just takes the average of all of the other scores.

&amp;#x200B;

The CBT portion of the journal is such that you can double click any cell and view a whole page of a journal entry at once. It's more difficult to read all the way through than a word document, but the point is to be able to look at a few paragraphs of journaling while seeing as much other data as possible at the same time, on the same page.

&amp;#x200B;

With this journal, you can easily copy all of the text from an entire week of journaling and use a word counting app to see what your mind has been on the most lately. There is a word counting app available as a plugin for google docs, although I am not necessarily recommending it. I sincerely hope someone else finds this journal useful. I don't think it's necessary to use it every day of your life, but if you are into journaling and knowing data about yourself, then this should be fun for you.

&amp;#x200B;

The first link is editable, so someone might ruin it for some reason, but I put a second link to a non-editable version that you can download and upload back to Google Docs if you need to use that. I couldn't figure out how to share it in a non-editable form that would also let people just make a copy. If you know how to do that, let me know. Thanks!

I should note that this journal is impossible to print...

2214,Marshmellah,1547008494,1,"Hello, so I am asking this question because there is a lot going on currently and I am just very confused. So to start off,  years. You should know that I grew up in a very toxic environment. I've had to witness my siblings, not me, get abused growing up, and it took a very bad toll on my life. Around the 8th grade, I noticed that I began getting moodier, and when I entered high school, it skyrocketed. However, I convinced myself to believe that this was just normal mood swings caused by my hormones because of puberty and whatnot. I didn't start questioning this until I hit my junior year. Before I get there, you should also know that my home life is not healthy at all. I have Caribbean parents who are very strict. I am not allowed to leave my house AT ALL. I am only allowed to go to school and back home, unless I am going somewhere with one of my parents or relatives. I was never allowed to go to a friend's house, walk anywhere, not even go to a store or movie theater by myself. My parents are also not there for me emotionally. To them, it's like providing a home and food/clothes is all you need to do to be a parent. My family life at home is also extremely toxic and I feel as thought I been neglected in a way while growing up. Since I've started my junior year, my paranoia and anxiety got worse, I felt like I started to  be clingy with my friend whenever she would hang out with others, and my sensitivity got worse as well. I remember around two months, I told my friend about how I believed a comment about me in class, and all she said was ""don't worry about, it probably wasn't about you."" I don't know why, but this got me extremely mad to the point where I didn't talk to anyone for the rest of the day. I try to be very careful to make sure I don't do anything that might cause our friendship to break, because as it hurts to say, she's my only true friend. I began to realize that my mood constantly changed abnormally. I would be happy one moment, but the next I would just get so upset and wouldn't want anyone to talk to me. It came to the point where I would go home and cry myself to sleep at least 4 times a week without telling anyone about it. The next morning, I'd go back to school and act like nothing happened. It hurts to keep going through this, and it's mentally exhausting. It takes a toll on my academics because all of the crying and drowsiness causes me to stay up late and try to complete my homework. I never tell anyone that I cry because I'm afraid they'll tell me I'm overreacting or being stupid. I am very insecure and I get so mad when I fall behind on grades because to me I feel as though that's the only thing I have going for me. It's like I believe that if I don't have a strong academic profile, then I have nothing to offer from myself. I beat myself up when I get a low grade in class and try so hard not to cry in front of everyone. I often get mini panic attacks about something you may think is small, but to me it's a big deal. For example, a teacher once told me that I asked a stupid question and this was back in the 7th grade. I constantly think about if the people that were present still remember it and if they told other people and whether or not they have a judgement of me based on that situation. I know I might sound crazy, but I honestly don't understand why I continuously think these things. If my friend doesn't answer my text,I normally start to believe that they don't see me as important or maybe I said the wrong thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

If that wasn't bad enough, I can never escape pain. When I go to school and suffer, I suffer when I get home as well. Like I said before, I feel neglected in a way and because of what has happened in my house in the past, I constantly feel depressed because of the outcomes. It's like I have no one. No one can relate to what I feel on a constant basis. I've done my researched and feel as thought I might have some things, but I won't bother mentioning them because I don't want to self-diagnose myself.I want to try and do well in school so that I can afford to go on campus for college because I want to see a psychiatrist. My parents are foreign, so they don't really understand the whole mental illness thing and won't listen to me if I tell them i need to see a therapist. Hell, they might actually get angry with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of you who might read this might just tell me it's hormonal teen issues, but I have big feeling it's not. Any help?

2215,sad-but-rad-,1547007540,1,"I had been planning my suicide for about a week I guess. Killing myself has been on my mind for months, and yesterday was the day I had decided on. 

I had a good day at work. I hugged my loved ones. I even ran up and down the dark halls of my old high school with my cousin (around 9pm), reliving old memories and laughing until it hurt. Overall, it was a great day. I enjoyed what was supposed to be my last day of life. 

I went home. I prepared everything. I put four envelopes on my bed: a letter to my mom, dad, best friend, and a paper with general instructions for my finances/last wishes/and my pet lizard’s care sheet. I cleaned the house, made my bed (something I never do), and took out the trash. I took a shower, shaved, and put on the clothes I wanted to die in. 

The plan was to cut my wrist vertically and bleed out in the bathtub for easy cleanup. I sterilized the blade as a habit of a long term self harmer, but this time I there would be no gauze or Neosporin nearby. 

I took a deep breath. I placed the blade where I would make the cut. I hesitated. 
Did I really want this? 
Yes, dumbass. There’s no turning back now. Stupid cunt. Just do it, you’ve waited so long for this moment. You got this. 

I made the cut. It wasn’t deep enough. That wouldn’t do it. That wouldn’t be enough to kill me. I cut again, deeper. I cut 5 times total. It was enough. It hurt unlike anything I’ve ever felt. I watched it bleed a while, turning it over and let it drip. 

I started to get dizzy, and I started thinking. I started panicking. 

No, this wasn’t what I wanted. I didn’t tell my little brother goodbye. I didn’t tell him I love him. I didn’t hug my grandma. Shit, I didn’t include her in my letters. What the fuck was I thinking? I don’t want this. There’s so much I forgot to do. How could I possibly forget when it’s the only think I’ve thought about for months? 

I snatched a towel from the cabinet and applied as much pressure as I could. Dumb. So dumb. Fucking idiot. I ran to my room, grabbed my phone, and called my neighbor (I live in the middle of nowhere, calling an ambulance would have taken forever). I called my therapist and explained the situation. She calmed me down and talked me through things until my neighbor arrived to drive me to the hospital. 

They stitched my arm and put me in the psych evaluation room. I waited 2 hours for someone to come talk to me and see if I needed to go to a psychiatric facility or whether I could go home. During those two hours, nurses were in and out. One nurse drew blood. One hooked me up to a machine to check out my heart or something. He put stickers attached to wires all over my upper body. One asked for a urine sample. 

I have never felt so powerless in my life. They made me wear a paper jumpsuit, for fuck’s sake. 

Finally the person who was to evaluate me showed up. She did not give one single care. Her questions were mumbled and apathetic. I had to ask her several times to repeat the question simply because she was mumbling and I couldn’t hear her. Anyway, I was released and got to go home. 

Now I’m stuck with this scar and a weak explanation as for why I’m wearing a wrist brace (too hot for long sleeves) because I’m an indecisive pussy. The end.

2218,gabe_lynch,1547006278,1,"i’ve read that what i have could be called “just right ocd” but i don’t know how valid that term or the article/website is. most of my symptoms have to do with things having to be even or balanced out or done a certain amount until it feels right. to be clear, i am NOT asking for an exact diagnosis for my symptoms. i know that you guys can’t properly diagnose me, but im just asking if my symptoms are generally associated with some sort of ocd or other disorder. another thing, im not claiming that my problems are very significant or anywhere near as bad as others have it. i understand that my symptoms are mild compared to what others are going through. thanks you :)

some things i do:

- [ ] if i’m aware of them, i try to avoid stepping on cracks, especially in sidewalks, sometimes on tile but it’s obviously more difficult, so i’m usually able to rationalize stepping on them pretty easily. i’ve read that some don’t think this is a symptom of ocd, and it might not be, i don’t really know, which is why im here. but i definitely think it’s a symptom of some disorder, it’s not normal the way this stuff affects me and my thought processes

- [ ] i’ll sometimes tap on my phone screen in a certain way so that the places i’ve tapped are even (for example if i tap somewhere on the left side i’ll sometimes tap on the right side in the same exact place, or if i tap on the top of the screen i’ll tap at the bottom in the same place to “even it out”)

- [ ] i pick at my face a lot, usually when im stressed about something. could just be an anxiety thing, or something else.

- [ ] if i touch my hand on something, i sometimes have to touch it with my other hand.

- [ ] if i itch something on the right side of my face, i’ll sometimes itch the same spot on the exact opposite side

- [ ] i “balance out” my blinking a lot. if i feel like one eyes been closed more than the other i’ll try to balance it out be blinking the other eye or making one eye open wider than the other to make it even. i also noticed that if i see something that might be “unbalanced” i’ll sometimes compensate by sort of squinting one of my eyes. this is weird i know but it’s not that noticeable if you were watching me while i do it.

- [ ] i hate certain materials/the sounds they make. for example, cardboard scraping cardboard, metal forks or spoons on teeth/scraping fork on teeth (fuuucking hate that), fork scraping plate or bowl, the feel of velcro (not the soft side), this one material that some wind breaker jackets are made of

- [ ] if im going through the playstation 4’s menu’s, usually when im in the library section looking at my games, i’ll scroll over/highlight the games in a kind of pattern, usually i do a figure 8 or infinity sign type motion hovering over each game, in order to “balance it out”, again. because the game library section splits the games into three columns, i try to select/hover over each game equally to be balanced. for example if im hovering over a game in the middle column and then move my selection thing over one to the left column, then i’ll usually move it back to the middle column and then one to the right column afterwards to even it out. if i’ve hovered over too many games in the left column, ill balance it out by scrolling over games in the right column until it feels right. this probably makes no sense without a picture or physically showing you what im talking about, but i can’t really do that in text :(

- [ ] if im playing a game and i move the camera to the right, i’ll usually move the analog stick (controls the camera) back to the left to even it out. a lot of times i also try to tap the side of the analog stick on one side (for example the right side), then try and tap the exact same spot on the EXACT opposite side (on the left side). 

basically, a lot of times i’ll move the analog stick on my ps4 controller in the same exact way but in the opposite direction that i originally moved it in order to “balance it out”. i’d say this happens the most often as i play games all the time, so it’s a lot more noticeable.

- [ ] i need the volume on the tv to be on an even number, or if it ends in a five (like 35 or 25) but never an odd number. i just don’t like it, idk why haha

- [ ] when using a calculator i’ll click the clear button over and over even if i know that it’s clear. this might just be a people thing though cause i’ve heard others (that likely don’t have ocd) do this aswell, so i don’t know. it could also just be adhd

- [ ] i don’t really have any of the overly cleanly symptoms that some have. i don’t scrub my hands till they bleed or anything (might be a stereotype that i’ve learned from media, correct me if im wrong), i just wash them like the average person would. in regards to my room and especially my backpack and stuff from school, im actually pretty disorganized. the one thing that i will say i don’t like is hair on clothes. if i see a hair or something similar on my hoodie or something i will immediately try and get it off. it bugs me when, for example, someone in front of me has a hair on the back of their shirt, but i obviously can’t just reach over and take it off haha.

- [ ] not sure if it’s related or not but here’s something else i thought of. i don’t really like when one shoe is sort of stacked on top of another shoe. i just like it a lot more when they’re right next to each other side by side, without overlapping or anything.
please don’t take this post as me trivializing ocd as some might think (judging from the pinned post one the ocd sub reddit). im genuinely wondering if it’s possible that i have mild ocd or some other disorder(s), which would explain a lot of these behaviors. the last thing i want to do is make people mad over a question i have

2223,totallytubular11,1547003170,1,"Hi everyone. I've had a long long battle with depression since my early teens. I think I ""beat"" depression about a year ago - by that I mean, I feel much better, happier, etc. even if I do have small periods of sadness here and there (Nothing like my previous depressions where I was constantly sad, sometimes suicidal, and involved in some self harm). 

And while I am content for the most part - I feel like I lost this huge part of myself. I feel like I'm not in sync with my emotions, and like I'm almost just constantly distracting myself from feeling things by keeping myself constantly busy.

I'm not really sure how to explain this - but it would be comforting if other people could share if they've experienced something similar, and how to get out of it. 

A part of me wants to go back to being depressed because I at least felt like ""myself"" - sometimes I'll just put on really sad depressing/triggering music to feel like I'm still me or actually here.

I want to live, but sometimes I don’t know that I deserve it. I would never do anything to intentionally harm myself or others, I just wonder if I should give up. Resign myself to nothingness.

I want to speak with a therapist, and have asked my parents to set up sessions on multiple occasions. They haven’t yet. They don’t know that I’m depressed. I suppose telling them might help them understand I need to talk to someone, but everytime I think about telling them I’m crippled by fear.

2237,Franticsymetric,1546993894,1," 

I (23F) grew up with a brother (now 21M) who was my absolute best friend. I would do, and did, anything for him. When it came to college at an elite Ivy League school, I paid his down payment because my parents didn't want him to go that far. On birthdays Jordans were on his feet. When he needed help moving I did it, carrying his things/furniture to storage in NYC despite his absence, a solo task of 9 hours. However, in the last year and a half my brother has gone off the deep end. He took a semester off school, sits in his room all day, expects everyone to bring things to him like food, hygiene products, etc. My parents have do whatever he wants because they fear he's going to take his life if they don't. At a certain point, despite in the past calling me his best friend and the best sister, he 180'd saying I was the source of all his problems and the reason for his mental health problems. He cut me out of his life for 9 months but then came to me demanding an apology from me for causing his mental illness, but quite frankly, after much evaluation with myself and a therapist, I have no idea what I'm apologizing for because recognizing that at times I'm not the best person, to my little brother I genuinely don't think I have been. Him making me feel as though I ruined him has really personally affected me. I cry all the time and feel as though my brother died and I am a bad person. The realization that I have been a pretty good sister is only recent. I'm stuck because I'm afraid if I don't apologize he'll harm himself, but at the same time any apology that will come from me is going to be fake. I miss my brother, and I don't know what to do with myself. His erraticness has resulted in the worst year and a half of my life, almost as if my old brother has died. If anyone could give me advice on what to do; I'm going through a very difficult time.

To note, though, when my brother has been good, he has been great. He was my best friend. The only person I can trust. I'm stuck because I keep reverting to these images of what he used to be. :/

EDIT: Another question: how often do people tell untruthful things to their therapist to the point where they believe it? Ex: my brother says that that his therapist says my parents are the worst when I personally know my parents are unbelievably amazing, doing anything for their children. I worry that he has fed his therapist with untruthful information and so whatever the therapist says back to him he takes as truth.

2241,Mogusaurus,1546990903,1,"My wife has been chronically depressed/suicidal for the entire time I have known her.  I've prevented a lot of attempts, we've been to a lot of professionals and she has had a few medications. One gave her inorgasmia that hasn't gone away, one gave her insomnia that has only subsides a little, and one made her rageful while she was on it and she has had anger problems since.

She also has very bad breakdowns when she is confined. She'll smash her head on walls and the floor, gouge into her neck with her fingers, try to get her hands on sharp objects.

So I've tried to pin and eliminate every trigger I can for her... But it just isn't working. She was molested, heavily abused, and otherwise entirely neglected growing up. She was malnutritioned and I still have a hard time getting her to eat nutritious food. She has several back injuries and severe bunions. She gets cysts all over when she eats much salt, any processed sugar at all, much oils... Tomatoes. She has bad tinitus. She has pcos... 

So basically she is a walking medical nightmare and I don't trust professionals with her for a second because they have fucked up far more than they've helped, but at this point she had lost all hope and I'm ready to try just about anything, but not really because I think that if she isn't kept under in inpatient care she will find a way to kill herself or she will be imprisoned there. I'm also concerned that her medical needs won't be met.

A huge problem I have is that there is a precedent for pushing medication without consent, there is a precedent for medical imprisonment, and there is a precedent for people not getting the care they need. She has a LOT of care she needs.

Does anyone here have experience in mental institutions as it concerns such an extreme case? From what I've heard its really hit or miss, and i have no idea how to make sure its a hit...

You can create an LPA for anyone over the age of 18, as long as they have enough mental capacity. 

I should have created LPAs foe my parents before they lost mental capacity. I had to go through the long court process and therefore I have to pay annual supervision fees. If I knew what a LPA was, I would have created this before it was too late.

I'm just trying to tell my     story in hopes it will connect with someone and they can share their     similar situations. I'll start it off when I was 8. I was a quite  niave    lad. Young and dumb I suppose. But one day my life had changed   forever.  I  was in the basement of my grandmother's house (me and my   mom lived   there most of my childhood.) I heard a bunch of noises   coming from   upstairs so I ran up there. I didnt really know what to   expect. When I   got to the top of the stairs my uncle and my   grandmother were sitting at   the dinner table crying. My uncle ran and   picked me up once he seen me   and held me in the arms. He pulled me   close to him and said ""I'm so   sorry OP, your mother passed away."" I   was shocked, but for some reason I   didnt cry. I just held all of my   emotions back and I felt nothing.   Still today I dont know why, maybe   because I didnt fully comprehend what   was happening. Later on In my   life I found out that she had killed   herself. I always had a thought   in the back of my head that it was me   and it kinda never left me.   Anyways, fast forward a couple years to when   I'm 13. I had been   staying with my grandmother (my dad wasnt around   most of my life). She   had gotten to quite an old age and her mind was   slowing fading. My   dad came in from wherever, probably the third time I   had ever seen   him, and decided to stay with us. He noticed my   grandmothers behavior   and said it wasnt normal (her waking me up at 2am   saying it was time   for school). My dad took me out of the house and I   moved in with his   sister. His sister was a straight up b. My grandmother   had saved  15000  dollars for me from my SSI money and was saving it to   get me a  car,  when she got her greedy ass hands on it she bought  herself  a new  car.  It wasnt till I was 15 that i understood what was  going on.   They had  sold my playstation while I was gone and said they  had no  idea  where  it was. Once i seen how greedy they were i left and  went  to go  back  and live with my grandmother. Her Alzheimer's disease  has   tremendously  increased since I was 13. She cried Every night after I    left. Which  ultimately sent her Farther and farther down into the    disease. When I  got back to her house she did not even recognize me. I    was so  depressed because I felt like it was all my fault from where I    left. I  still do. No I got back though my other aunt was living with  her    taking care of her. She passed away in the later years, she was     bedridden from a stroke and slowly drifted away. I was depressed for a     long time over this and still am today. I always think that if I  would    have stayed I would have prevented her downfall. I stayed with  my aunt    till I was 18. I thought she was different but she wasn't.  She said  she   was saving up my SSI for when I moved out. Little did I  know she  was   using it for 500$ hair extensions and what not. Well I  met this  girl   when I was 17. She was absolutely stunning. She was  weird, funny,  smart,   and such a philosophical thinker. My aunt hated  her. The  reason why is   because she was noticing how much my family  fucked me  over. The house I   was staying in was supposed to be mine  but my aunt  made my grandmother   when she had Alzheimer's to sign the  house over to  her. Slowly I  started  to hate her more and more. Later  that year I  got a call from my  family.  They kept telling me to give  the phone to  my aunt. They told  her that  he had died and committed  suicide in a car  wreck, and not me.  NOT HIS  OWN FUCKING SON. At this  point my family  was nothing but scum  on the  earth. And it is truly  sad to say that. Me  and my aunt fought  alot after  that. Everyday it  was heated  discussions about my girlfriend  and me. So  I left. I  packed my shit  and I left. I went and lived with  my  girlfriends  parents for 6 months  and they were more of a family to  me  than my  own. Now I'm here. I'm  18, living with my fiance( aka that  weird   funny and beautiful girl  from the story.) And we have a dog and 3   cats.  I love my life now. For  awhile I wanted to kill myself but I put   my  family in the past and  started worrying about me.

2247,peachie7,1546989325,1,"Hi, I’m 22(f) and I’m sorry in advance for my life story, I’m also sorry because I know this is going to be all over the place. I’m just tired and have no where else to turn. My whole life has been a pattern of feeling like being dead is the only solution to escaping my mothers mental and emotional abuse/mental illness. Although there are other factors that contribute to feeling like this, she is the main reason. Ever since I was little she has been unstable mentally and emotionally. There were some good times in my life but the negative highly outnumber the good. I grew up in a poor home raised by a single mother of four. I loved her like every little kid loves their mother or father and loved when she would show me affection, but there’d be a lot of times,for example, when she did, she’d scream at me and tell me ‘get the fuck away from me’ if I maybe was squirming too much’ so I’d never really know what to expect from her growing up. She has always told me she’s loved me but then does things that make me want to end my life. My father was in and out of my life but mostly absent, I remember her using him against me with things like, for example, if I didn’t clean my room when I was little she’d say things like ‘of course your room is dirty, you’re his daughter and the whole family are scumbags’. 
Name calling is something that occurs all day every day of my life, but I’ll get more into that in a bit.
There was constant screaming and chasing around the house with my older sister and constant screaming and fighting with my older brother, most times I would run upstairs and cry to get away. My sister acted out and my brother became addicted to heroin so there was a lot of worrying about that and going to school at a 5th grader being teased because of it(not that I blame him for anything, he is an amazing person and cared for me when I was little). A lot of the time everyone would leave and I would still be there so I’d often be the only one she could take her anger out on, not only because of my siblings but because of everything. She has always made everything my fault. 
When I was around 13 I noticed I started to become depressed, my mothers reasoning for this was because it was at this age where all girls just snap and go crazy. Also I was never allowed to do anything and if I’d go to a friends house id only be allowed there for like 2 hours then I’d have to come home, so I’ve always been really sheltered.  Anyway. It got as bad as it could get between the age of 14 and 15.   It came on very sudden. All of the sudden i was crying in bed everyday and I couldn’t get out of bed and I stopped going to school. It also probably had to do with the fact that my sister had my nephew then my niece and I was basically left to raise them, even though I lived with my mom and ‘she had them too’ she only ever really did things like cook and clean and I was left with everything else, so that probably contributed to why I stopped going. I missed out on everything. At 14 I took about 20 pills(probably just ibuprofen and whatnot) and tried to kill myself, the same night my mother told me to kill myself out of anger because I wasn’t moving from my bed and wasn’t cleaning or doing anything. So that happened. So the past 8 years of my life I’ve been doing nothing and accomplishing nothing but sleeping and laying around with the occasional hangout w one of my friends. Nearly every day since I’ve wanted to die. When I question small things about what she does, it gets bad. I said ‘I always help with my brother’ in public before and got a black eye because of it. She’s generally not physically abusive but if I push her far enough she is. I fight back verbally though and it makes it so much worse. I’m called a cunt multiple times every day. She says things that I’m not even going to get into, that make me want to end my life. It’s every day it doesn’t stop. My anxiety is so bad and self hatred and confidence and hope is so completely destroyed that I’m scared of getting a job or continuing school. I 22 and she controls everything and has to know every deal about my life. The day I turned 18 she tested me by coming into my room and trashing it saying ‘if you’re going to leave, leave now’. My first sleepover was at age 20 and I was awake and terrified the entire time because I left even through she said if I would I would be homeless and ‘you’re selfish how could you do this to me’. I have chronic fatigue, clinical depression and post traumatic stress. My mom knows this. Every time I tell her she’s making me want to kill myself during an argument she tells me to shut the fuck up and that it’s for pity and that I’m abusive because I scream back and for telling her how horrible she is and that she’s a awful mother. I was hospitalized again in may, for feeling like I was going to kill myself and wanting to change and to find a way to get away from her. Nothing has changed and it’s still a cycle of me being scared and depressed and incredibly tired. 
I’m 22 and feel like I’ve never even existed.
About a year and half ago, I ‘realized’ (didn’t ever fully understand consent up until then) that the first time I ever really hung out with a boy, when I was 15, I was raped. I had taken sleeping medicine that day(I’d take headache pms to make me sleep because it was better than being awake, great logic I know) and then went and hung out with this older boy. He lead me behind a park in the woods. I told him I wasn’t feeling right, I must’ve told him 50 times ‘I’m feeling really overwhelmed’ and he just kept pushing a wouldn’t stop. I must’ve been so mentally out of it that I didn’t understand what had happened, it felt wrong, but I would’ve not called it rape because back then to me when I’d think of rape I thought of a strange man jumping out of the bushes and using violence. That year I also realized how often I’d actually been sexually assaulted. I think the first time it happened was when I was about 5 and I slept over a family friends house and I woke up in the morning completely naked with my sisters friend hovering over me laughing. This same exact thing happened again and with a different older girl and another incident with the first girls brother when I was about 6 and he was about 13 or 14. Then all throughout middle and high school being touched and groped constantly. So I think this is what caused me to now shut down with anything sexual. I’m 22 and am unable to have sex or do things like hanging out alone or going on dates because it physically makes me sick and terrifies me. 


Again I’m so sorry for all this mess, this is my every day life and I don’t think it’s possible for me to not word it messy and all over the place. With all these things being only a couple examples of some of the things that have happened, there’s so much more that I’m too exhausted to get into, that makes me feel like my whole like has been useless and I should have no future because I am too mentally ruined for anything good. I am emotionally detached. I have depersonalization, I don’t feel real and I feel like I’m constantly having an out of body experience. My life is a nightmare. There are some good things that happen, but I am always too depressed and detached that I cannot enjoy anything good. I’m in constant fear. I know the main problem right now is my mother. I need out. But i need to get over my fear of living and everything. I know all of this probably sounds so pathetic and someone reading this might say ‘why don’t you just leave?’ This is how she made me. She’s insecure, abusive and mentally ill and she’s doing this to me to keep me where I’m at so I believe there’s no way possible that I could live without her. 


I need help. I don’t know where to start and I feel so alone. I genuinely feel the only way I’m going to get out of this and find relief is by dying, and I  a lot of the time I feel like that is what is meant to happen for me. And even if I do get out I don’t think I’ll ever be able to have a normal life. I really need someone to understand. I’ve been shouting and screaming for help my whole life and no one has a clue about what I’m going though. I know there’s worse problems in the world and maybe I’m just overreacting but I really feel like I can’t do this anymore. ",mentalhealth,Is there any hope for me and my life.,2019-01-09 10:15:25

2254,Saraummings,1546981064,1," 

I am going through a terribly lethargic and low period in my life. I'm physically achy, head foggy and have low motivation for lots of things I usually enjoy. I'm also getting some (?) anxiety and depression. Possibly this is because I have low self esteem from not achieving much right now. I currently sleep for about nine hours at night and often have a twenty minute nap during the day.

This compares to 7-7.5 hours with a short nap midday usually.

A short summary of the years leading up to this:

My partner left me pretty much overnight three years ago. We have a business together, I still run it with him remotely and am on good terms but obviously him leaving me for someone else was traumatic especially as we were living and working together full time and had been together for seven years.

Since then I've had an 18 month relationship with a very intense person who broke up with me also - I tried so hard with him I nearly turned myself inside out. Since the end of that relationship I've come to realise he's perhaps mentally unwell with OCD and anxiety (he had rules on turning over in bed, how to sit on the sofa without 'wearing' the cushions, how to squeeze the sponge out etc. and would freak out and shout if I got this kind of thing wrong).

I think I was in such a low place post relationship no.1 that I lacked the ability to screen well. I am still on good terms with guy no.2, though don't have much respect for myself for staying in that relationship for so long.

I've been running a very intense business with some extra paid work on the side for a year and a half. The extra paid work has come with some horrible work place bullying. It's been resolved but I still have to work with the person. I can't leave just yet but I am looking for other jobs.

I've also been writing and have published a novel in October, a life goal of mine, with a real publisher. Big shock but amazing. After publishing it I became ill with coughs and colds for about six weeks and now it's three months later and I'm still...meh. Occasional suicidal ideation but only because I'm so angry with myself for not getting enough done, I don't think it's anywhere near serious.

The good news is I'm now with someone lovely who is actually \*easy\* to be with. I was set up with him by a good friend of mine who happens to be a counsellor. We get on well as friends and he's very gentle with my feelings and tries to build my self esteem. My friends think he's 'such a nice guy' and are thrilled I've found someone 'not like the others'.

He seems to like the fact I'm a writer and we like the same kinds of films. And the sex is awesome :D

So lots of good things there.

But I still feel like I'm coming apart at the seams and have no motivation. It's been three months and my to do list can't handle much more low motivation.

I've told the new guy I'm 'tired' but nothing more. He's super, super clever and a high earner as are his friends and I feel like I haven't achieved much and am stupid in comparison.

I'm a club runner and have been forcing myself to run a few times a week and do some intervals on the bike. It hasn't really helped much, I just feel like I'm dragging a corpse around.

The last time I ran was four days ago, I'm giving a bit of a break but it doesn't seem to be helping. I couldn't face going out today, to be honest. Maybe it's a bad idea to skip exercise in terms of mood?

I'm falling prey to a lot of self help at the moment, the kind I wouldn't usually go near if I was feeling normal. Not sure what to do really.

**It's almost like now I've found someone nice and my novel got published I've chosen now to fall apart?**

I am, thank god, able to do an hour a day on my second novel. I think this is keeping me sane. But everything else is sliding.

So basically I started getting into coke here and there at the end of last year and there was one night in where I did a fair bit more then I should of and sent me into a full on panic attack that lasted about an hour, Since that night I've started getting feelings of derealization (I feel like i'm watching my life through a video) and also getting anxiety attacks which I never got before. 

There were 2 or 3 times where I had did some more coke after this all about 3 weeks apart but I never got any relief so I've started to stop smoking and doing coke this year (last time was NYE) but I still feel the exact same and starting to worry I wont be able to get rid of this mindset.

Does anybody have any similar experiences to this as I would love to know wtf is going on rn.

2256,YaxYaxx,1546979627,1,"I just really need to rant here because today was the first day of the semester for some classes at my university, and one of my professors said/did something that really upset me that I think speaks to a problem prevalent with professors in Canadian Universities.

I have been diagnosed with serious depression and an anxiety disorder to the point where last year (2017-18) I had to drop out (losing my entire tuition for that semester) because I was so close to the edge which was related to some medication changes at the time. 

Last semester was my first semester back, and I did much better than I thought I was going to (3 A's and an A-) which was amazing and definitely helped my inferiority complex, but that is beside the point, I just wanted to state that to show that I am not just trying to get my degree, I am more than willing to put in work to learn. 

So Prof hands out the syllabus [for the English Lit course he is teaching] and begins talking about it. We get to the assignments portion: 3500-5000 word essay, okay that's pretty nuts, but fair enough, this is a senior level course. But then he says that he was considering making it MUCH longer, which was kind of a what the heck? But okay, you're an inconsiderate professor who doesn't consider how his students taking other courses; those are a dime dozen. 

Then he gets to the required reading portion of the syllabus (which i had already seen) which consists of 11 books ranging from 150-400 pages and then he specifies how he purposefully chose a number of books that were on the line of manageability (like that's objective or something) for no specific reason just other than he didn't want to narrow it down more, but we have already covered that he's inconsiderate. 

Now here's the kicker and the part which upset me quite a bit because I understand that it's university and some courses are going to expect a lot:

We get to the portion about Mental Health (which is a requirement in my province) and he goes on a 5-minute speech about how seriously he takes everything mental health...

Are you sucking kidding me? 

Like ""huh?"" Times a billion. 

You don't get to assign a pretty insane curriculum for the semester, acknowledge how you are aware that your expectations are pretty ridiculous and then talk about how you're an advocate for mental health. Have you ever even met someone who suffers from a mental health issue? Because your actions definitely don't at all show that. 

It was just so hypocritical and oblivious and (probably unintentionally) cruel.

2257,mayimzjqocrhoyypisay,1546979348,1,"I worry constantly. I'm only 30 but I keep thinking about death, about the future, about what I haven't accomplished, about how inadequate I am, about how I've wasted my existence. It's impossible to sum up how I feel into one post, but here's a snapshot.

Objectively, when I have moments of clarity, I realize that my situation is enviable. Sure I have a contract job that will end in the summer, but it's a software engineering job. I have experience working abroad, a college degree in computer science from a good university, and I'm not stupid. I know that software engineers have it much easier than others on the job market, and I have a comparatively large amount of money in the bank. So why am I so sure that I am going to fail, end up jobless, then end up homeless or having to leach off of my family? Why do I see myself as being such a complete failure? Why am I so terrified of job interviews, so terrified that I end up failing them, when objectively I know that people with lesser skills are happily employed and performing? Why am I so obsessed with how people perceive me?

Then there's other people and how hard it is for me to like anyone and make meaningful connections. As an example, I work with people that I rather dislike - which should be fine. But why does their behavior, even when it has nothing to do with me, affect me so much? Why is it that when a coworker cracks a stupid joke, kisses ass, or gets a project, it affects me to the point that I start falling into a spiral of intrusive thoughts about hurting them, obsessing about what's wrong with me, and feeling completely worthless? Why can't I just be like ""ugh what a douche"" and then get on with my work, like other people do? Why must I reevaluate my entire existence and hate myself when mundane things happen?

2259,thund3r3,1546979040,1," This is my first post here, and it's a post I never really saw myself making. To my disbelief, I've recently been told by multiple doctors that I have anxiety.

Two weeks ago I had a normal day at the start of my Christmas holidays. At the end of the day I kicked back and played a few games with some friends online. I noticed about an hour into gaming my vision was blurring a wee bit. I thought, ""Well, that's strange"", and I packed the game in and went to bed. Pretty much as soon as I hit the mattress I felt shaking/tremors coming on and noticed I felt feint in the chest with a pulsating heart-beat. It's a feeling I'd never felt before. This pretty much continued all night, during which I found it hard to remain calm because of what was physically happening to me. It very gradually subsides the next day.

The next day I went to see my doctor. He did some regular checks like blood pressure and listening to my heart, but played it down and said it could be the flu. Basically wait it out. This didn't sit right with me, especially because I felt 100% most of that day, and I've had the flu - it doesn't feel like that. I demanded blood work and an ectrocardiography test. I had those tests done and they indicate I'm healthy.

Fast forward 2 weeks later. I've been enjoying time with family and put that episode behind me. At this point, I put it off as a one-off event - maybe the doctor was right, it could have been the flu. I sense it creeping in again. This time I'm surrounded by family and starting to feel the same physiological effects. Shivering, pulsating heart-beat, feeling faint. Again, it lasts all night and into the next day. It very gradually subsides.

OK, now I'm convinced something is wrong with me. I saw a doctor today and he was pretty much convinced I was experiencing anxiety related symptoms. This doesn't make sense to me especially because 1. I'm a healthy individual (pride myself with gym/exercise/eating habits, 2. I've never experienced this before in my life, and here I am at 29, 3. I can't think of anything overbearing in my personal life that could be the root cause (not ruling out something majorly subconscious but I can't find anything).

Now it's kind of a day-to-day thing. Some days a better than others, but I almost always wake up with the feeling creeping in.

I am treating it as a mental health issue at the moment but still considering other possibilities.

Does this description resonate with anybody here? Similar symptoms?

Just had this flow through my thoughts...
I’ve been trying to get help for my mental health because I can tell within myself I’m not stable at times, I’ve visited my GP and I’m taking 20mg fluoxetine daily and currently on a few waiting lists for sessions of CBT...
Nothing is happening so far!
I was beginning to have an auto pilot again, around a month or so ago, it seemed the tablets were helping me cope and manage the days. Now, Im really not great and suicidal thoughts are bothering me at any point of the day, it’s very strange to explain but I get the urge to bang my head against something... nuts I know but honestly, I’ve hit my head with my fists/wrists a few times and it’s not as though I’m meaning to allow the urge to happen.. if that makes sense?
Sometimes I believe I’m quite a danger to myself, so I stay at home and don’t go to work, I have a thought, I wouldn’t say it’s a “plan” because I really don’t think I want to die, it’s more of a thought which in a way teases and torments me, an easy way out... I’ve been succeeding at not choosing that path so far, but I’ve been tracking my moods (my memory isn’t so great so I forget how I’ve felt, what I’ve said) and things aren’t looking up at the moment, my moods are really not my own? 
Annoyed that therapy is taking so long but still eager to start, in this mood at the moment, I want to sort my shit out... wonder if this mood will stick for a while 🤞🏼

I don’t know if this is just depression and anxiety or anything more? I’m really trying to seek affordable and trusted help, my GP has referred to me as “psychologically complexed”? But it has not been expanded on...
I feel a lot different from what I used to be, but somehow I’m in the same boat at 21 as I was at 14, not coping with life and wanting to end it.. very strange!!

Pray something comes through for me soon please! Trying to take it day by day!

I am unable to control my emotions, almost at all. I can feel my reactions building and can feel rage fill my body, moving from my toes to my head, and eventually expelling out through either me screaming or causing myself physical harm (scratching, hair pulling, etc). 

My husband is not able to handle my outbursts anymore and has asked me to admit myself due to my last one, but has also stated he will involve the police the next time it happens. 

I am afraid of leaving for a multitude of reasons. 

-I have pets that I am concerned about. He’s very busy and forgetful of their food and water. He’ll recognize before it could even potentially cause dehydration or hunger (the bowls are out at all times), but I don’t like the idea of them having any subpar care. 
- He’s expressed trust issues due to certain behaviors I’ve exhibited that seem to be part of my state. Paranoia, lack of communication, etc. He’s gone through my phone in the past. I’m afraid that while I’m away, all I’ll be able to think about is my privacy being invaded. I didn’t keep a journal for a long time because I was so afraid of him reading it and how any of my thoughts might be interpreted. I want my time away to be spent healing, not worrying about what he might find to try to use against me when I return. (This sounds like he aggressively and consistently searches my personal belongings and that’s not the case. There have been few incidents where it has happened. At the beginning of our relationship we didn’t communicate well but we do always talk these situations through and try to be proactive rather than reactive, this is just my paranoia giving me another reason to not seek help and it’s working)
- My boss doesn’t take kindly to absence. Its an easy job and I’m on his good side so far, but I’ve had quite a few absences due to an increase in migraines on top of an injured ankle/foot. He’s understanding to a point, but I’m afraid I’ve used up what I can of his patience. 
-I’m afraid of finding out I’m crazier than I think I am. I’m concerned about my family history with BPD. I’m afraid that what started out as depression has turned into something more dissociative. I don’t feel as much as I used to. Not just anger or happiness or anything. Compassion. Guilt. Responsibility. I just don’t really live much. I feel like I just go through my days. Watching slightly out of my body as it does the things I need to do every day. Work, eat, clean, sleep, repeat. I’m mean spirited and really negative about others. I’m all about not bullying because I was throughout my life, but I can’t stop myself now which feels horrible. It’s mostly opinions I share with those around me but I don’t like how nasty I’ve become. I liked myself much more when I was avidly trying to improve other people’s days. I rambled in this one a bit, but Long story short, I’m afraid I’m a fucking psychopath. 
-I’m afraid it won’t help and this is actually just me now. I’m just this ball of anxiety and stress and negativity and nobody will ever want to be around me again. I keep saying things like “this isn’t me” or “I don’t feel like myself” and it’s been so long that I’m worried I’m grasping onto parts of me that don’t exist anymore. 
-I don’t want to have an extended admission. I don’t know if this is even possible upon voluntarily admitting yourself but it’s one of my biggest fears. 

I could really use some insight as to what this process was like for anyone who has gone through it. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I realized I have not been responding to a head injury a couple months ago the best way, and I am afraid my use of psychedelic drugs since then may have altered something. Either that or Im predisposed to mental issues (which I am) or both. 

Firstly my experience on LSD since the concussion was terrifying. Genuinely terrifying. I was thrown into a panic by my own thinking and began having auditory hallucinations. I was hearing words I wasnt saying in my voice and my friends were saying scary things they werent really saying. It stopped shortly after I got ahold of myself, but Ive been hearing things since. Ive done LSD a decent handful of times and this has never happened to me.

I am bipolar, and during periods of extreme stress I will hear sounds that are not actually there. This includes footsteps, mumbled talking, distinct but quiet music that doesnt belong to any song, and occasional loud banging and scratching if I am scared or paranoid. Occasionally I would hear slight whispers if I am walking past some people even though they are not whispering. This happened before the concussion and drug use. 

When the concussion happened I could not be in a dark room without seeing figures walk past me. I could not sleep for more than 5 hours due to an absolutely crippling and undue anxiety. I did not go to a hospital but I also did not get sleepy or die (obvs lol). My friends urged me to drink with them later that night and I did so theres the first thing I did wrong. Nothing outright came of it but it probably was not the best way to start the healing process. 

Now after a couple months (3) and the drug use.

I was lying in bed at night and I heard a very loud and distinct whisper say ""Hey"". This immediately scared me. I know its not suuuper uncommon, but I havent heard that sort of thing since I was a very young child. (I occasionally heard ""hey"" in a family members voice but it would be as I was falling asleep and it hardly ever happened.) I was wide awake when this happened. 

It didnt happen again but I slept with a pillow over my head in case it sounded closer next time. 

The other day I blew my nose and had to wipe a boogie off my nose. When I wiped it, I heard my roommate in the other room say ""ugghh gross"" in a mumbly voice. He was at work and no one else was upstairs with me.

My friend suddenly started talking loud and enthusiastically and I heard his voice... double? Like someone was matching pitch with him and saying the same thing. 
I also thought one of my friends said ""I like your shirt"" and they were confused when I said ""thanks my grandma got it for me"".

Schizophrenia does run in my family from both sides, though no living members have it. 

I am genuinely scared I was predisposed towards it and using heavy psychedelics before my brain fully healed has caused some kind of disconnect. Im not smoking anymore, doing any sort of drug unless it gets prescribed to me. Will that give me some sort of chance?",mentalhealth,I think I may have not treated my brain so well... is there any way I can let my brain re-sort itself?,2019-01-09 03:43:48

2287,asheristrasher,1546960138,1,"background: i'm a trans man dealing with depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies. i've had several stints at the psych ward either for attempting suicide of being too honest with a therapist. the last time i was was over thanksgiving, and i'm still deeply unstable. even in there, i have trouble communicating how i feel. i have the tendency to try to make people happy, so that means pretending to be okay even with my therapist and i have depersonalization-derealization disorder, so the world is always fuzzy anyways. not that i can tell them that.

i had an appointment with my gender therapist yesterday. i came in determined to be completely transparent. instead i ended up talking my ass off pretending i was getting better to please her. but at the end of the session she asked if i had thoughts of self-harm, and in a rare moment of honesty i said i still did it. she then noticed a burn on my wrist and looked all disappointed, then warned me that 'remember, you need to be stable for at least six months before i can get you on hormones'. she said she didn't want to get a call or a note saying i had slit my wrists.

fuck 

i spent the rest of the day in a daze. i didn't sleep tonight, but that's normal. she gave me a worksheet of coping skills and about 15 minutes ago i finally worked up the will to get them out of the car. i read through the list, and then spent the next ten minutes in a quiet tantrum, punching the wall and my arm and tearing up my safety plan and kicking the shit out of my mattress just quiet enough so the roommates wouldn't hear. i read one of the sections about coping skills for wanting to cut because you're dissociated and tried to practice their mindfulness technique. it worked and for a second i was aware of the shitstorm i was in.

i'm going to kill myself if i can't get on hormones. my asswipe insurace won't let me get on hormones because i'm 'unstable' and they think the possible mood swings will make me roid rage. even i know that's bullshit. i'm a lot moodier when i'm suicidal, you know. cocksucking bastards.

 i know i need help. i need to be in inpatient, i need to be honest and i know i'm this close to a full-on mental breakdown. i fantasize about trashing my room and breaking everything in it. if i reread that fucking worksheet i might. i'd be willing to smash that window next to me at the drop of a hat. but i can't get help, or it'll take me even longer to *feel better.* i have to fake being okay for another 3-4 months and paint a smile on my face so i can get my testosterone. can i even do that? no, probably not. i'm probably gonna break at 5 months and 29 days and start this shitshow all over again.

When I was either 5 or 6 years old, I was diagnosed with leukemia. The whole cancer experience has changed the way I think of myself and others several ways.  I've been talking to a friend about this and I'm making his post now because he thinks it'll help. During my chemotherapy, I would still go to school.  Most of anything I did would grant me praise. Something that I did (I'll admit it now, this was absolutely awful) was trace drawings from a computer monitor and then present them my own for like, 2 years. I got fake praise and real praise because I told people I did I on my own. Very stupid, I know. I think it was because people thought I would die and that whole thing about having a positive outlook or positive emotions would help me with my recovery. This happened from sometime during kindergarten all the way to about 3rd grade. I say about because I started having what I think were panic attacks from the drugs I had to take. I started feeling intense weakness, and anxiety. I didn't know what anxiety was so I was just ""nervous"". I was also ""nervous"" when I felt weak because I thought weak meant I couldn't lift something up. Doing any sort of activity freaked me out and I would cry, and my teacher was sick of it, my parents were confused and also tired of it, and I didn't know why I was like this because I just took whatever I was given without question.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 4th grade when I transferred to a school where nobody would treat me differently because I was the kid with cancer. Nobody knew, and I didn't tell many people because nobody would believe me until I would show my scars. I never got any fake validation I was getting the years prior to that, so I felt like I wasn't actually good at anything. Didn't try much, didn't talk much. I did start caring about the validation though, whereas before I thought it would just come naturally. I never told my parents about my issues because I would think that they could just tell me to get over it, toughen up, or leave them alone. I thought I was putting an unnecessary burden on them.  It's actually why I don't have a therapist, or why my parents don't know that much about me.  I would draw on and off after the whole tracing thing, still tracing but when I brought my drawings to school I wouldn't show them really.  I think that because I feared to talk to people during 3rd grade (I'd start crying because of all the drugs I took.) that I started becoming very quiet in class. I'd rarely participate anymore. I'd just do the work. I stopped caring about school around this time, as I started struggling with math and just never asked for help out of fear for looking stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's fast forward to 9th grade. I started playing Smash 4 with some friends at school during lunch. At his point, I had been cured of my leukemia (cured at the end of 4th grade) and was just a guy who had cancer but doesn't anymore. Anyways, I started playing the game with people who had experience with the series already. They were good and I wanted to get good too. This was my first Smash game, but it's an easy game to learn, hard to master. After a month I was okay, and then throughout high school, I was 'good'. I say it in quotes because I often look to pro players and realize how probably very bad I am at these games. It's important to note that because it's actually the reason I'm here. I constantly compare myself to others because I seek validation through being good at games and drawing. I'm attracted to the fighting game genre, but I'm only 'good' at Smash. I suck at most other fighting games with the exception of Darkstalkers where I still don't think I'm good. The difference is that I practiced Smash because when I play Smash with friends, I feel like I have a chance at winning, and a solid chance I'll look like a good player. Why? I think I see it as a way to get praise and validation. I crave validation because of my perfectionism/performance anxiety. I still drew but didn't like showing people. Even for assignments in graphic design class, I would hesitate on turning anything in because I didn't think it would be good enough. I turned /plenty/ of things in late. Hated most of my stuff when I did, too.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything from whenever I got cancer (I always forget whether I was 5 or 6) all the way to basically now has caused me to have panic attacks on a somewhat regular basis. My first one was something in January of 2018, and since then I've had about 9 or 10 total panic attacks. Some alright, others being total disasters for me. I made it 3 hours into 2019 without having one, and had one right before and partially during writing this post. I've avoided several, but if I didn't I'd be well into a least he teens for amount that I've had

&amp;#x200B;

So how did I get here? I hated how I played Tekken 7 against some friends while winning or losing, tried training for a bit, went online alone and got trashed for a few games, thought I should just give up, said it in our discord server, and someone said that I was freaking out for no reason because I was doing fake practice for like 2 hours total while everyone else practiced for about, oh, 50 hours. He's completely in the right for telling me that. My experience with 3D fighters was super limited as I never really tried playing them say or Soulcal 5 or an hour and Soulcal 1 on the Dreamcast when I was like, 10 and then lost the game.  I expected too much of myself, trashed myself for it, friend talked to me, I started digging my past back up, looking for connections, and now I'm here. I want to fix this. I want to stop being so much of a perfectionist and get over my performance anxiety and anxiety in general. I want to be able to just draw again, and just play a game again. I want to do things without over-thinking how I look in front of people, I want to talk to people more without wondering what the think of me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I had cancer as a kid, people felt bad for me, fake praised/validated me, then stopped after changing elementary schools, played games and got good with friends in high school, also drew in high school but never thought the drawings were good, played Tekken 7 today and expected too much of myself, felt like I should drop it, said so in a discord server, friend told me I was freaking out over nothing much because i just didn't practice and it was okay to not be good with 2 hours of total play, started realizing why I was freaking out, now I'm here asking for help with anxiety/perfectionism as this experience isn't just in games or drawing, but in day to day activities.",mentalhealth,"Had Cancer, Struggling with Validation, Perfectionism, Anxiety, and Panic Attacks - Want Help",2019-01-08 21:23:30

These past weeks have been a little rough to be honest, it's first started with me blacking out again, then losing sleep having the same nightmare over and over, and then i heard a voice before i went to bed.

Don't get me wrong, things are getting slightly better, I've gotten a good nights sleep for the past two nights, and the nightmare has passed, but i'm starting to think theirs no slowing down of the blackouts.

I think for things to make sense i need to talk about this voice i heard. Last week i was laying in bed on my right side preparing to go to sleep, but then in my right ear that was on the pillow, i heard a whispery voice say ""Ben"", this was terrifying for me. It was after that incident when i started having that reoccurring nightmare.

If you possibly read my update on this saga, you 'd know that i wanted to know if i could have ""personalities"" coming through me in my blackouts, as many people mentioned DID. So what i did, was made a text document asking ""Hi, how are you feeling?"" then i'd leave it alone. Honestly i thought i would just forget about it and move on. 


But a few days ago, i got a response that just said ""sad""


I passed this one off at first, my first thought was that i forgot about this, and i somehow stumbled across this and just responded myself.  But a part of me didn't want to disprove it yet, so i made a follow up question:

""what is your name?""

I figured this would be the make or break deal, if i got some stupid answer or no answer at all then i knew it would've just been me.

Hi guys. I honestly don’t know what to do right now. I am in the midst (maybe even reaching the peak) of a burnout. I’m 19 years old, working 10 hour shifts, 5 days a week, and getting home at 9pm. I’ve recently tried to get a new job as I’m just so tired of working such long hours and getting home so late, barely ever seeing my significant other. I went in for a trial at this new job and they said they would contact me soon to let me know if i got the job or not, they haven’t contacted me yet but i find myself hoping and praying that they don’t want me. I’m also having my own inner problems and my significant other is in a really dark place right now which just has me terrified, i just want him to be happy. Anyways, i am just so mentally tired and it has been causing me to be extremely physically exhausted. I don’t know what to do as my two days off don’t do anything to refresh me as there’s always something that i have to do on my days off, I can’t have more than a few days off as I’m a casual so I don’t get paid leave (I’m having a few days of holiday at the end of the month but I’ll have to save up to be able to do holiday things and still be able to afford groceries when i get back).

My mother is a caring and loving woman, but she has struggled for much of the last ten years. It began shortly after both of her best friends passed away, one from sudden terminal cancer and the other in a weather-related tragedy. We live in a small town, so there weren’t a lot of opportunities for my mother to find new friends, let alone close friends like she was accustomed to. Since I was still very young, I didn’t quite understand what my mom was going through at the time.

 As she did find new friends, she gave all her time and energy to helping these people; yet, each time she was overly trusting and she ended up being taken advantage of or shunned when she realized the effort wasn’t reciprocal. She would literally go at the drop of a hat if someone needed her, but all she received in return was empty promises. 

After several years, and instances of this, my mother has grown paranoid beyond anything I’ve ever dealt with. The last instance was particularly tough on her. While helping a ‘friend’, someone allegedly put malware on her computer and phone. She’s shown me some of the things that concern her, and I do believe she had some kind of virus on her electronics. 

However, every time I’ve tried to help her, she breaks down and becomes extremely upset. Then, when I quit helping, she’ll blame me for never helping her. Some of that is my fault for the way I’ve handled it. Regardless, I’ve told her to just bring it to a specialist, so she does and it seems fixed for a while. It always reoccurs though, going on almost two years now. 

But things have spiraled out of control. She started locking all the doors, leaving lights on, saying things have been moved in the house, thinking she’s being recorded or followed, etc. She’s even begun blaming family members, including me, for ‘manipulating’ her devices and essentially spying on her. She’s even gone as far as threatening leaving. 

Now, she can still be the amazing mother I remember, but the littlest of things can trigger huge outbursts. These outbursts continue to grow in regularity. She spends many days moping around and uninvolved, and I know that’s not what she wants; she’s told me through tears how badly it hurts to feel so uninvolved in everyone’s lives. Part of that is on my family; my brothers run their own businesses and have families and I can only return home once every six months. Often, though, it seems like even when we do call or invite her out she’ll decline. One of my brothers used to call her every single day, but the constant melt-downs and wild accusations have made him call less than twice a month these days. 

Others have noticed her change in behavior over time too, but everyone dismisses it as her acting crazy. Since her close friends passed, I’ve witnessed what seems to be depression gradually balloon. I’ve tried to talk with her about seeing a physician or therapist, anyone who could possibly help, but it gets rebuked. She continually says she’s fine, but she isn’t acting like the person I know. How do I convince her to seek some sort of aid? I need to get her help before it’s too late.

2312,BipolarBrotherHelp,1546932507,1,"He is 19, we live in Houston Texas, my father and I just wrestled him to the ground and called the police, after the cops had detained him they sent a psychiatrist to speak to us and called his doctor, and he has since been sent to a nearby mental hospital.

Last fall was his first semester in college, he spent all his money, barely went to any of his classes, and slipped into substance abuse while pushing away his friends. Finaly, over thanksgiving, he aparently was contemplating suicide, he bought a rope. When we got back to college he told a counciler he had attempted suicide and was willfully hospitalized at which time they upped his medication and monitored his mood.

He seemed to get better over christmas and my parents were willing to let him go back to college but over the past few weeks he has been sloching on his medication and hasn't been proactive in signing back up for college (he hasnt withdrawn, signed up for classes, spoken to the proffessionals at the school). Over the past week he has been getting worse, not taking medication, making awful descicions, drinking, doing pot and another drug called kratom, hes spiraling out like he did before he attempted suicide. So today my mother told him that they didn't want him going back to college, which apparently ended with him screaming at her and shoving her. 

When they got home he had calmed down, but apparently he had called his friends to come take him away, he told my father he was leaving and my father tried to calm him down, he hadnt taken his medication so my father made him take it. My father tried to keep him from leaving the house and tried to keep him talking but he was manic, the doctors at the first clinic had warned us about him running away, and we knew that he was in a bad place. He tried to rush out the door at which point it got physical, he hit my father and my father tried to restrain him, he broke free so i tackled him to the ground, we were telling him to calm down but from then on he just screamed in our faces as we held us. ""I hate you, Fuck you, get off me, this is your fault, I can make my own descisions"" the usual stuff but he also said some more severe stuff, he told me he wold slit my throat, he threatened suicide, he said that he would go to the hospital and once he was out we would never see him again. It was nightmarish, he was foaming at the mouth trying to bite and claw at us.

After the cops got him his friends came in and they revealed that they were just as concerned about them, he was doing other drugs like extacy and smoking far more frequently than he said, they told us that he was more manic and having behavioral problems. Finaly after a psychiatrist, or someone the cops called maybe a psychoanalyst, heard the story and phoned his psychiatrist they aranged to have him put in the hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, shit is bad, but whats most worrysome now is that he wont speak to us. We hope he cant release himself but we are concerned that he will lie to the doctors and minimize the situation so that he can get out at which point he will leave with someone else, hopefully one of his friends and not his drug dealer. I dont know how much power he has, he is 19 but he is clearly not fit to live alone.  Im so scared that he will just wind up leaving and never find us again, what can we do? I think the best thing for him is an extended stay in the hospital so they can really get him on the proper medicines, so that hopefully he sees some reason and dosent cut us off entirely. I dont know. Please, any advice.",mentalhealth,"My bipolar brother was just taken to a hospital, he says he never wants to see us again",2019-01-08 18:28:27

I went to a general doctor to be excused from work as a teacher this week. I was prescribed Prozac (I tried Laxapro last year and stopped immediately because the vomiting was not worth it). My school might resent me but at least I have a doctors note to cover me if I can’t muster the energy to go to work.

I took melatonin and the Prozac. My mom is worried about me taking antidepressants. It is 2AM and I haven’t slept since two days ago. I know I need to find a therapist. I know I need to keep my job as a teacher for now and unemployment isn’t an option. I’m not even tenured. 

I opened up to my mom about what’s going on, and I realized I had a dilemma. She sympathized with me but she left me some questions I couldn’t answer right away:

1. Do you hate teaching now?
2. Are you being too hard with yourself? A third year teacher isn’t expected to be perfect.
3. Would a 9-5 office job with no overtime make me happy? Would I regret quitting teaching? 
4. What would I go back to college for? Living in NYC isn’t cheap, and I have to remember alternative jobs means a huge cut in pay. Can I live with that?

I know my boyfriend would say to keep teaching- I just need a better school environment. But that doesn’t feel right. I’m not getting tired of the kids- they’re the best. I just keep getting burned out at some point year after year, and I catch myself simply counting down the days until summer break.

2315,saul230,1546931088,1,"So I suppose I should preface this.
The reason this is here is because I either lack the balls to open up honestly to the people around me.
I'm not sure if that's because I underestimate their computing ability, or if I'm just scared that they will abandon me if they were fully aware of what rolls through my head. 
That would lead to my ultimate fear- being alone.
Ironically, my efforts to not be alone is a major contributor to what would be the main contributing factor to issolation; that would be the Ruse. 
The Ruse is the web of white lies that make your acceptable to the society and in turn your peers.
That bullshit ""I'm buying a coffee"" smile. Weaved into the more complex mascaraeds, like that of mutual career or accedemic progression.
People are the center of their own universe.
A universe that has become sick with the misappropriation of values, patience and almost of every aspect of nutrition- both spiritual and physical.

I am a Male.
I am well educated.
From 20-23 I owned a cocktail bar and restaurant.
It failed.
It failed for a multitude of reasons.

I need to explain why this mattered.

I migrated to Australia as young child.
My mother was emotionally unstable, I'm not sure if was her personality, the pills or the epilepsy or the Parkinson's, but it warped my ability to perceive emotions. I have to ask.
This has got better over the years, I can read people's emotions better. Although I've never had a problem reading their motives.

My father worked alot.
I think he used that to escape the emotional swings of my mother.

I tied my self worth to their approval.

I didn't do well at school, to this day everyone thinks I did, but I bullshited my way through.

To avoid this being known to anyone, I had to bypass going to university. At least for a while.
I knew the answer to this was money.

Through a series of almost unbelievable events ( another post maybe) I managed to own a cocktail bar &amp; restaurant and even two night clubs for a brief period of time.

This distraction lasted almost 4 years.
I was good at the hospitality side of hospitality.
I was not equipped for the bussiness side of things.
Maybe if I had done more at school I would have been equipped, but I wasn't. I suppose we can scapegoat something else for that.

Spiritually, I didn't like bussiness, the only joy I got from it was to share the fiscal return with the people I thought where loyal to me. I suppose I was offering gainful employment, but I was mostly buying loyalty.
Is that all I Crave?

The Stark realization that foundation of bussiness is the same as that of capitalism, slavery and genocide. The exploitation of another soul.
The only difference with bussiness being that it's designed To prolong the exploitation of others with the insentive of money to fuel the inevitable crutch to survive the monotony of mindless cycle they are forced into. Rinse and repeat, lose your mind for variety, right?
Simply a more complex type of torture, one so complex it becomes self inflicting and self full filing.

I digress.
The bar happened because I couldn't face the disapproval of my parents, entangled with it being an exceptionally good way too feed my ego and delusions.

Ultimately when it all fell to shit, I was more equipped to deal with failure then I was when school finished. 
So I suppose that worked out.
At one hell of an expense.
When the bar was falling, I fell heavily into drugs and booze, initially to tend to my bordem. Then to tend to the inevitable emotional debt that comes with borrowing happiness from the next day, aided by a bag of misc powder and whiskey.

I must say I did give th business thing a go for a while.
I threw myself into the dishonesty and sick nature of it.
I was good at it.
but I couldn't wear it for very long.
It ate away at me.
It made my soul sick.
I've tried to make a mends since then where I can for the people that had to be exploited for my gain.
I spent a long time wondering who was I using and who was using me. Sometimes it was symbyotic and sometimes it wasn't.
But either way, it's over now. I think.

It's been a year since then, I've had two jobs since then. Currently I'm recovering from my Fourth shoulder reconstruction. So I'm not working.
Maybe all this time to think about everything is good. 
We will find out.

About the time the bar ended I started smoking weed.
Most days it's the first thing I need to do.
I started smoking as justification to shake the Pills I was popping (clonazopam 0.5 x 3-8 a day).

It worked.
I'm always coughing and wheezing these days.
I tried not to smoke today. I felt sick and agitated and anxious.
I meditated for and hour then fell asleep and had a weird sex dream. 

I have spent the last year (prior to the Reco) working relatively consistently 9-5- I did  take a day off every couple of weeks though.
I had my emotional ups and downs. 
I spent a lot of time playing PlayStation.
For the first few months I was dating.
I met the girl of my dreams very quickly.
I had dated and fucked my fair share over the bar days. I think mostly to validate myself. 
But this girl is different to anyone I have ever met.
I feel a love for her that I have never imagined. I desire for codependence. A level of inate trust I have never experienced.
Plus she is a total babe. Like undoubtedly a 10. ( Half Israeli half Argentinean, do the math )
I'll probably marry her unless she gives me the flick before then. I hope she doesn't.
Also it's the first time I've dated a Jewish girl, so I'm actually experiencing a taste of my parents approval in regards to this relationship which is nice.
I'm not entirely sure how it happened as I always thought I'd have to have my life together (Job, house , money etc) to find a woman of her caillber and have her be attracted to me. But I was wrong.

I think a huge part of my eversion to the 9-5 isn't the work, I do like to work hard, I find it meditative.
 Also it stops me from having time to be the architect of my own destruction.
It's the title.
My father always found his sense of self in his occupation.
That hasn't appealed to me. I don't want to be an engineer or a doctor or a thing I want to be me.

Or maybe that's just another delusion. 
A way to justify my inadequacy.
If for every inadequacy I had a delusion - I woul be tripping balls.

Now I've enrolled In a course. Everytime I go to log on and do it, I get exhausted. 
I remember that feeling from when I was in grade 9.
I was so far behind, for a multitude of reasons ( A learning difficulty being one- EXCUSE THE SPELLING^)
It would be the evenings before I had to submit a assignment and I knew I had the brain power, but I felt so so sleepy. To sleepy to work.
Is that called procrastinating? Or am I to much of a Bitch to do things when I'm tiered.

I've done basically fuck all for weeks now.
Sure my right arm makes typing difficult at the moment, but if I really wanted to do it, I suppose I could figure out a way.

Recently, with this time off, I have been dabbling with LSD &amp; DMT.
I haven't had any bad trips or anything, but I can say, It did make me believe in the Soul.
Maybe that's why I'm finally having all of these thoughts solidify.
Maybe it's just the time.

I'm very much looking forward to getting my shoulder to the point at which I can get physically more fit again.
While tripping, I had a understanding of the fact that that body was a conduit for the soul. Like a filement in a light bulb. And it being ""unshapely"" inhibits the spiritual conductivity.

With the new girlfriend has also come a new diet, I have been eating a mostly vegan diet - unless it's inconvenient.

I like it. 
I like not having the heavy feeling in my belly after I eat. 
Also philosophical, not consuming sadness sits well with me.

Or maybe all of these thoughts are a delusional biproduct of my sensitive soul being emotionally raped by a  sadiatic, gluttoness system that I was not ready to stomach.

I am never happy and for no reason. I’m 15 and I can’t remember a time when I was truly happy. I hate school and being at home. When I’m sad I have no escape. I spend the weekends and most time out of school playing video games. I’m interested in something for a second and then not at all. I like pro wrestling and went to Wrestlemania this year as I live in New Orleans where it took place. I felt nothing throughout the show. Or even in the lead up to it. I begged for this tickets and was anxious to go but once I knew I was set to go I felt nothing. I am spoiled, I have a gaming PC, a PS4, two good dogs. What else does a 15 year old need to be happy? 

I’m on adhd medicine and sometimes before school consider the possibility of just chugging the pill bottle just to end it. I’ve never thought about actually doing it though. I used to get very bad anxiety before school and it’s starting to come back. The workload is horrible and it doesn’t help when I hear adults say “wait till you get to the real world and have a job and kids and a wife and taxes and a social life” just thinking about it brings me to tears. As I get older and I’ve begun taking on more responsibility the worse my anxiety has gotten. Driving terrifies me, getting a job terrifies me, going to college terrifies me. I’m scared of life. Every night and morning I dread going to school and during the day I dread going home. 

I don’t do well with people. I have a few friends. Most people just annoy me. Family gatherings make me want to cry as I have to be around so many people that I don’t particularly like for far to long.

I've learned this lesson so many times that it no longer really qualifies as a lesson. It's just something I know but sometimes, I guess, ignore: Turns out that saying how you feel, even if it's overwhelmingly scary/hard/seemingly-impossible, is the right choice.

If you're ever afraid to utter how you feel, think about it like this:

There's a radical, liberating magic to speaking those words. The scarier and harder it is to say, the more magic it is. The more powerful it is. How does the magic work? No one really knows. It just is. Don't question it. Doesn't really matter in the end. It's magic and you have the power to use it if you'd only try.

You're not just telling someone how you feel. You're casting a spell. And the power of that spell increases exponentially the harder it is to say. Be brave enough to unleash that spell, for the love of God. Go Harry Potter on that motherfucker's ass. Save yourself, the people you care about, from Voldemort.

For the last week or so, I’ve been having what are now the tell-tale symptoms of psychosis for me.  First, I was just really scared going out at night. Then I started hearing and smelling things. Weird beeping and cracking sounds and the smell of mold. I started seeing shadowy figures on the edges of my vision. I started to think that someone was following me. People were watching me.  Everyone in the convenience store was just there to gather information on me. I made direct eye contact to let them know I knew what they were doing. I drove out of my way to lose whoever was following me. I obsessively checked license plates to make sure I didn’t see the same one twice. 

I was absolutely terrified, and I wanted to tell my boyfriend right away that I was being followed in case I disappeared. And that’s when I realized I’ve thought and felt this all before. It all felt so real and so logical that I felt like I had been slapped in the face when I realized that this was just my stressed out brain telling me lies again. 

I worked every single day for the past two ish months without a day off, my boyfriend just broke his leg, the holidays happened, and I wasn’t sleeping much, so it doesn’t come as a surprise that this happened again now, but it’s still absolutely terrifying. It’s so scary to be able to believe something so strongly that’s not real.

And I’m still completely functional. I know that these things aren’t real, or at least I can tell myself that after the fact and calm myself down. When this happened before, I didn’t know I had this problem and thought what I believed was real. I missed school and stopped eating. Now I’m still able to get myself to work, make dinner, clean the house, etc. I just secretly feel like I’m drowning. I know I need to take a few days to rest and work on my mental health, but that’s impossible for at least the next month. 

Anybody else experience this and how do you cope?

I just moved to a new city for 4 months because I got a work term for a company here. I'm 22 and have lived with my family my whole life, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to try living on my own for awhile. I found a decent price in a room in a house here and this is going to be my first night in the house. I have an uncle who also lives near the city and I had been staying with him for the last couple days to help me get settled in. However, upon being dropped off to the house where I am renting a room, I began to feel quite uncomfortable and alone. I don't know anyone else here in the house and it's hitting me I'm on my own for the next few months. I felt dizzy, faint, and may have had a minor panic attack (have had some before). Now I'm regretting my decision to live on my own and considering if I should stay with my uncle instead. I would have less freedom and he lives about an hour commute from the city while the house I'm staying at now is right in the middle of downtown and I have as much freedom as I want, but I feel really alone.

2333,ThrowawayMM1989,1546916854,1,"Prepare for a long write up.

My  girlfriend and I have quite the history, as I feel most couples do, but  this is the first time I'm being 100% transparent, as I really don't  know where to turn with this. We started dating in July of 2014 and had a  relatively bumpy relationship. We hit a bump about 2 months in(this  will be important later), but got back together after a week break.  After about a year, we decided on getting a four bedroom, 1 bathroom  house together(she owns it, I pay rent), so we could have our big dog.  It was a fixer upper home, and we started diving into completely  remodeling the home after about the second year, where we had our first  realistic disagreement as a couple.

I  worked as a bartender while touring the country in a band every third  month or so before getting a position with a non profit about a year  ago. She was working for a hospital handling insurance up until about a  year or so, and she since started working dispatch for the local PD.

I  grew up rather poor, and she grew up not rich, but well off. We had a  room mate decide to move out and GF wanted to keep the room vacant. I  wanted to fill the room and continue to put the rent towards the  mortgage so we could simply save and make updates to the home. She  ultimately won the decision, as it was ""her home"" and she started  demolition on the room while I was out of town on tour. Her dad is quite  the handyman and has really been a teacher to myself through all the  work that would come of this new venture. We started with the original  bedroom, but dove into the bathroom, office, basement remodel, and  garage before finishing the original bedroom. That's about half the  house. We're talking down to the studs demo, including replacing studs,  electrical, insulation, and dreaded drywall. This was something that  would take place on the weekends, usually Saturday's and Sunday's as  their schedules would allow. As a bartender, I was pulling doubles  almost every weekend, working 8am-4pm on the house, and 5pm-midnight or  later at the bar. And to top it off, GF and GF's mother would often  disappear to the hardware store and come back hours later with more  accessories that GF's dad and I would have to install, meaning GF's dad  and I would do most of the work. On one hand, it was nice to be making  progress on the home, but I quickly turned into an employee to the  family. If I wasn't working on the home in the time set by GF's parents I  would get told I wasn't ""invested"" in this future, scolded for choosing  hobbies over the work, etc. If during the weekdays when I had time off,  things didn't move along, GF's mother would find ways to snark about my  work ethic. Mind you, I barely knew how to use a screwdriver before  this entire thing started.

We finished  the garage so I could have a place to practice with my band, but only  with the exception she could store her new car in it(justified). We  finished the bathroom, which was supposed to be a weekend remodel, but  ended up taking almost three weeks(sure). We finished the basement so  that we could get another room mate, as GF admitted she was struggling  to pay the mortgage and bills. The mortgage was roughly 900, I was  paying 250, my brother was paying 250, and the third room mate was  paying 450 as it was a much larger room. Utilities were covered by my  GF. When the first room mate moved out we lost the 450, which GF said  she would cover because it was her decision to remodel it. Once 6 months  passed and the original room wasn't finished(replacing floor/ceiling  joists is a b\*tch), we entertained the idea of remodeling the basement  to get a room mate. We did so, and recovered $500 a month for the  basement. So GF was receiving $1000 from from myself, brother, and third  room mate. Her only cost was covering utilities.

In  January, 2016 the hardest thing that could've happened in my life  happened. My dog passed away. It cost me thousands of dollars in  emergency costs, and broke me mentally. This is where we really started  to struggle as a couple. I think it was the first time she saw me  vulnerable, first time I had ever cried in front of her, and the first  time I was physically incapable. I was floored for weeks. I took time  off work, cancelled half a tour, and started to withdraw into myself. We  made it about two months before we decided we need to fill that void,  and we got a puppy. Puppy grew up, and puppy's sister came along 6  months later from an accidental litter, and the breeders gave her to us  for free. We now had two big dogs, and one big unfinished house.

About  a year ago, I decided to give up the band. Previously, GF and I talked  about having a plan where this would happen, I would find a career,  invest in a new car, and then we would ultimately get rid of all the  room mates. Band broke up in September, I started applying for jobs, but  wouldn't take a career in which I did not feel fulfilled. Through the  job search, I hit a level of depression, and lost a lot of confidence as  I was turned down multiple times. Girlfriend and I started having less  sexual relations, as she really was not supportive through this. Sadly, I  think her mother's emotional abuse started to show. This is something  that would always bother me, but I wasn't really aware that emotional  abuse was a thing. GF would put me down in front of friends and make me  the butt of a joke, she would constantly quiz me on where I was going,  and who was going to be there, when I would be back, putting me down,  and talking to me like I was stupid. ""Do you know how to feed the dog?""  ""Can you figure out how to shovel the walk?"", etc. This only seemed to  increase when we would argue about working on the house on my days off,  or when I would try to spend time with my family on weekends, and I  believe this pushed me away. I started resorting to porn instead of  sexual relations with her. More specifically cam girls. She was also  working early mornings, and I would feel guilty about waking her up when  I would get home from work, or interrupting her sleep at all.

My  GF was always the jealous type. I mean, hates every ex girlfriend I've  had, is immediately threatened by any women in my workplace, and  accusing me of cheating by having friends that are women from touring.  My GF went through my tablet when I was on tour. When I returned home,  she was off, and something was up. She started being more mean to me  than normal, and I called her out. She admitted that she thought I was  cheating on her via social media. I asked her to show me, and she  brought up messages on facebook and twitter with female promoters from  across the country. Now we were a DIY band, and booked all our own  tours. So I would have to reach out to anyone at all that would book our  genre and would be willing to pay us to play. This often included a lot  of women, and I did not feel guilty one bit about the conversations  with these promoters, because they were strictly business. She had taken  these as flirting, and they just simply were not.

I've  always believed in the ""If someone is looking for something, they're  usually hiding something."" Which doesn't always hold true, but I decided  that I needed to do some of my own research on my GF. I looked on her  external HD at old pictures from her recent phone back up, and found  that she had met up with her EX during the week that we took a break in  the beginning of our relationship. She changed the name of her EX to her  best friends name, and would hold conversations with him behind my  back. There was not a ton of damning information, but enough to prove  that they met up over our week break, and they both stated that nothing  happened in the texts to each other, otherwise I would have ended things  there. I still felt the false name on the number, and the meeting  itself was a problem, and we talked about it. We got over it, and things  were fine, for the time being.

She  started getting mean again. I called her out on it, and she brought up  her struggling financials and the burden she believe the room mates was  putting on our relationship. She had gone through my twitter messages,  and I had confided in a friend from TX about the struggles of my  relationship with my GF, including weariness of marriage, philosophical  questions about monogamy, and my friend from TX happened to be a female.  My GF felt this was a breach of trust, and felt violated that I had  confided in someone else, rather than her. In a sense, I agreed. After  we seemed to have gotten through that, I noticed she started gaming a  bit more than usual with a specific person online. I went through her  snapchat one night when she was asleep and found halves of conversations  between them. In one, ultimately she told him ""she always wondered what  would have happened if things would have worked out between them(and  other things relative)."" There again, wasn't any concrete proof, but we  all know which emojis are sexual and which ones aren't. She confided in  him about a future that didn't include me. Not much different than my  mishap. I was determined to find out the truth. I had felt down about  the relationship, and resorted to more porn, including watching cam  girls, and seeking premium snapchats via reddit. I reached out to a  specific cam girl, gotten a free snapchat, and watched it a few times  before deciding to delete it. When I called out my GF about her snapchat  incident, she asked me to show her mine, which I did. But she went to  my reddit instead. I snatched the phone, and immediately broke down,  admitting to my addiction to porn, seeking out snapchats from reddit,  etc. I felt the connection between someone she knew, was more like  cheating, than my connection with someone I didn't know. This is one of  the main reasons why I believe this relationship can work. When I was at  my weakest, and most vulnerable, she decided to stay. She sat down with  me, and tried to be understanding as to why I was choosing porn over  her. Our sex life flourished, we had a new found trust between each  other, and things were looking up.

In  March, she started being mean again. I don't have any other way to put  it, but she wouldn't be able to hide her true feelings, and would get  bitter and just mean. I questioned her. She sat me down and gave me an  ultimatum. ""Either we get married, or we're done."" Now, you've read this  far, so you know our difficult issues with trust, and how little there  is. She later admitted that yes, she had added her fingerprint to my  phone, and when I would sleep(heavy sleeper), she would go through my  entire phone. This includes all private messages, search history, and  even my porn fetishes. I couldn't commit. I could not do that to myself,  or to her. We still had so far to go, to make this work. She was  serious. Either I propose on the spot, or at least make a verbal  agreement, or I should leave. I chose what I believed was right. I made  plans to move out. If you think things have gotten messy, just wait.

I  moved into a friends house, and my brother along side me. We moved over  the course of three weeks, and I slept the weeks on the couch at my now  ex GF's house. I resorted to tinder and dating apps to fill the  friendship I had with my now ex GF. I'm an attractive guy, and had no  trouble finding women to date. She also resorted to tinder, and was  dating. I met one girl in particular who was an exchange student from  Thailand, she was nice enough, but I knew it wasn't going to last. We  saw each other for about a month, and things ended. When we ended, ex GF  had still been in contact with me throughout the summer. She came over  one night, and for the first time we were open and honest about sexual  relations. It was so weird. We had always been open with our own sex  life, but to hear about your person talking about sex with someone else,  it's like a different level of friendship. We talked about all the bad  sex we had been having, and ultimately ended up having sex. She wanted  to jump back into things then and there. I couldn't do it. At least not  on the spot. She took it as me not wanting anything to do with her, and  she stopped all communication. The problem? We had a road trip planned  three weeks later.

I had to go to a city  7 hours away to see a concert, and she had to take a train out of said  city to see her grandmother, so being the practical penny pincher I am, I  offered to drive her there if she'd split gas. This was one of the best  trips we had ever been on together. There was no arguing, no fighting,  just two best friends taking a road trip. It was so awesome. I wish I  had enjoyed the trip more. We spent three day with our friends, before  she left for her portion of the trip. We slept together multiple times,  and for the first time I felt like I wanted it back. There was a catch.  She was talking to someone else.

Now, I  knew about it, as she was open with me, and told me that they had gone  on a date, and that she planned on going on another with him when she  got back. I told her not to. I told her that I didn't want her to, but I  knew she owed it herself to see if that's what she truly wanted. When  she returned home, we continued seeing each other. She would talk to me  about things, no judgement. Tell me how the dates went, and I would tell  her how my dates went. She told me about all the ""checks"" he marks on  her checklist, and how much he is her perfect person. That really hurts  to hear when you had been dating someone for as long as I did. She  talked about him already meeting her parents(who of course hated me at  this point for ""leaving""). This is where my conscious started to kick  in. I made her choose. And by making her choose, I started getting mean.  I found myself bitter and angry. When I would text her, it was often  out of anger. Ultimately she did choose him. And I was devastated.

I  cut all contact and I lost my confidence. I started questioning my  worth, my resume as far as ""checks"" for other women. If I couldn't cut  it, cause I wasn't the safe option, then why was my life worth living?  There's this situation that I am absolutely horrified of. Where I become  so weak, that I put suicide on the table. I call 911, searching for  help, searching for answers, and she answers. What kind of ironic,  bullshit would that be? But it's not on the table. And things get worse.

Months  pass. My health still deteriorating, my physical health isn't a  priority, and I'm a pessimist for the first time in my life. I make my  way back on vacation, visiting the same friends her and I vacationed to.  I send one snap to her, and she immediately responds. Then again. And  again. And before you know it, we're talking in my basement, about the  horrible person she chose over me. The selfish dick, who had the  audacity to blow her off on dates, to get drunk by himself. The check  list master who couldn't muster more than two ways to compliment her. We  did exactly what we were so absolutely scared of being while together.  We became the cheaters. Her relationship with him failed over the course  of the next three weeks, carried on only by some tickets that they had  previously purchased.

Now, this is the  part where everyone lives happily ever after right? No, that's where I  need your help, and your advice. We've since been back together for the  last month. The problem? I've become a mess. I have/had access to our  phone records, and was able to see who she was calling/texting. She  would say one thing to me about not talking to him, and I would see  phone calls lasting much longer than ours. She would get off work, and  call him first, then me immediately after. Once she ended things with  him, they did cease all communication, but the three weeks waiting for  them to break up really messed with my head. Over the course of the  holidays, shes become almost non existent in my life. Dispatch hours are  extremely tough, often three 12-hour shifts and a 4-hour shift; either  6am-6pm, or 6pm-6am. She would come to my house at 6am and leave by 7am,  sleeping until 3pm or 4pm, and head into work. On her days off, she  spends it with family or her new found church friends(which I fully  support), but she still hasn't told her parents or friends about me. As  she is absolutely horrified that they will cut all contact with her,  which monetarily she needs then, and I'm sure she isn't exactly sold on  us right now. Anyways, her sister was in town from Christmas, who  apparently knows about us being back together, but I did not see her or  her sister from Dec 18th-Dec 27th. Over this span, a weird number showed  up on the call log(I checked as she was almost non existent) and it  turned out it was easy to enter it into google and pull up a name who  she is recently friends with on facebook. There were multiple phone  calls lasting half an hour at 2:30am and 4pm, including multiple 6am  phone calls. My mind instantly jumped to the worst possible conclusion. I  knew that if I confronted her via text message she could easily delete  the texts or information, so I went to her house last Sunday at 1:30pm,  while she was sleeping and caught off guard, and told her to show me the  messages. She claimed he was just an ""old guy coworker friend"" who only  calls, and doesn't text. She said he ""knows all about her and I's  relationship, and is well aware."" She denied showing me. I gave her an  ultimatum, and she still wouldn't show me. I left, wholeheartedly  planning to leave and be done with it, threatening to cancel the phone  plan, take my TV, etc. The following day she changed phone plans, packed  my tv up, and prepared for another breakup. Ive since offered her  multiple chances to show me the messages, and she even went as far as to  tell me that she wiped her old phone. This seems increasingly shady, as  her story has shifted, he brought her coffee to work, and she admitted  that they did text, but it was all philosophical texts about life. She  states that this back and forth going through each others personal stuff  is toxic and unhealthy. I agree, wholeheartedly. But I don't believe  her. So much, that the last two nights, I went too far. Well, lets start  with last night.

Last night we made  plans to do dinner and a movie. We went out to a mexican spot, which is  relatively hidden in this small town. Afterwards, came back to my place  to watch Bandersnatch, of which she made it about five minutes in before  falling asleep. It's a choose your own adventure movie, and absolutely  cannot be slept through. So I changed the movie so she could sleep, and  she woke up upset. I told her it's okay if she wants to sleep, but she  resisted, saying she had her contacts in, and she wasn't going to sleep.  I put Bandersnatch back on, and she immediately fell asleep. I chose  all the options, and at the end of the movie woke her up and told her  she can go home if she'd like(she doesn't like sleeping at my house  cause puppy is at home alone), but she was pissed I told her she could  leave. I just feel like the time I get from her isn't quality time  lately. It's 6am when I'm half asleep, or if she does come over, she's  sleeping. We had a giant argument about the situation, including her  work hours, and her being emotionally drained from the calls she takes.  It's a bummer. Well anyways, tonight I worked at the bar until about  11pm, and I knew she went down town with some coworkers. She had been  bad about texting me all day, but it got worse the more she drank. She  made a comment about me picking her up from downtown earlier, so I had  planned to change from work, pick her up from downtown and go back to  her place. Her plans were different. She was downtown, and texted me  telling me she was at Bar A, so I went to Bar A to pick her up. When she  came out of the bar, she was with a coworker, but it was only 1 and it  was a male. I happen to know him from highschool, but I wanted to see  what would happen so I didn't initiate contact. And she wasn't  responding to my texts. They walked to another bar, and I drove over to  the entrance of that bar. It was down the street, and I wasn't sure I  actually saw them go in. My mind started racing, and I assumed they were  a pair. I drove across town to her house, and sat across the street  hoping to catch them coming back to her place so I could at least get a  solid evidence situation. I sat there until 3am, with only one text from  her the entire time, I even called her twice which was ignored. I  decided to give up and go home, assuming they went to his house. She  called me and said ""her and some coworkers"" were at a 24 hour diner,  having food and she'd call me when they got done. I drove to the diner,  and watched her and this same guy leave the diner together. I followed  the lyft back to her car where they got out and hugged each other. I  kept driving and was over the entire situation. Then she called me. She  talked to me and filled me in on the night, although leaving out much  information about who she was with. I pressed her and she brought up a  female name, and I admitted that I saw her out and she was not with said  female.

Where  do I go from here? What kind of positive thinking do I need to do to  get my head straight? Is the emotional abuse real? Or am I now the  abuser because I'm pressing her to be honest and transparent? How the  fuck do I confront her parents, or fix things in the future?

2338,linux-boi,1546913995,1,"Ok, so I don't have much people to talk to, so I hope I can share my thoughts here. I have a mental illness, still not sure what it is, but it eats me. Basically, I feel that God (even though I am not sure if I believe in such), and my parents, have eternal authority over me. For such reason, I feel that I am enslaved forever. I feel trapped. If it were up to me, I would rather not live. I feel like no matter what I do my parents have ultimate dominion over me, simply, because they are my parents. I indeed am an independent adult who lives with my mom, but I pay for all home expenses, including my mom's expenses. I am 21 years old, soon to be 22. I feel like a complete failure in life too, after my mental illness kicked in. Before, my life was completely different, but I don't want to talk about before right now, I want to talk about the present. I feel like even if I repay my parents the money they spent on me since I was a child, that they would still have some sort of authority/dominion/ownership of me, simply for giving me life. I'd rather not live feeling like this, since this makes me feel like a slave, and I can never escape this situation. I am merely their cells, so in a way, they own me. Also, pertaining the biblical God, I also feel like if I do believe in him, that he will forever have authority over me. At the end of the day, he is God, and last time someone tried to be just like him, they were cast to hell. I am not saying that I want to overthrow someone in power or something, but as long as there is a God, I feel like I can never be free, because if I ever try to reach my full potential, of'course without hurting anyone or anything, that I am not allowed to be as strong as God, ever, so at the end of the day, I will always be inferior. Such things make me feel like an eternal slave, and I do not see the point to look forward to anything. I would gladly prefer God to take my lie away, make me cease to exist, so that I do not have to be enslaved. I feel like whatever I do, there is no point to it, because as I have said, my parents &amp; God will always have authority over me, so I can never achieve anything for myself. I feel trapped. This is my mental illness. I guess I just want your guy's opinion of this. I feel hopeless, as my parents will always be my parents, and if there is a God, God will always be God, therefore, I will always be an inferior slave. I'd rather just have not existed with such scenario. I have tried to be comfortable and happy with my situation, but I just can't feel genuinely happy, nor pretend. I feel very uncomfortable, depressed, and sad by knowing that I will always have someone who has eternal authority over me, whether it be God or my parents. I'd like to clarify that I do not have an issue with others having more power than me, such as a judge, cop, my boss, etc. This is because I know that they have their positions due to their own efforts, and I completely respect and back them up. But knowing that someone has eternal authority over me, just because they gave me life, and even them knowing that I would rather not exist if such is the case, and know that the situation still will not change, that's my issue. I know this may sound ridiculous to some, but to me it's very real. Sorry if I come of as weird since I know this sub has mostly posts about depression/anxiety.

After I go to bed, before I fall asleep, sometimes my thoughts, which are almost always quiet, or, well, not loud, turn into screams. Whatever word, sentence, feeling, impression, anything that goes through my mind feels like it wants to rip my head apart. 

It makes me feel the kind of fear I've never felt before, a fear of something unavoidable, like my mind will tear itself to shreds with it's own thoughts. 

I've found a remedy though, at least there's that, if I focus my hearing on a video or a song and just turn something on my phone it goes away, but it comes so suddenly and unexpectedly that every time I think I might be falling asleep, I'm afraid of the fear I'll feel if it happens.

I’ve been through 5 jobs since 2018. At all of them, I’ve sincerely tried my best to do a good job every day and I really made an effort to get along with my coworkers and supervisors, but at every job I have ever had (pretty much all retail), I’ve either been ostracized and ignored completely or actively harassed by my coworkers (one once threw a chair at me, and another locked me in the freezer as a ‘prank’, not to mention tons of vulgar, open sexual harassment).

My coworkers always tell my boss that I’m not working, that I’m just wandering around doing nothing, when in fact I’ve been busting my ass doing really hard work all day. For some reason whenever I’m doing a task, and another coworker sees me, they’re aggressively like “where have you been?!” umm, doing my job? I don’t know how to convince people that I’m working when I’m literally already working. I do everything my supervisors tell me to do. I’m very polite and I do everything I’m told and I follow all the rules. But literally nobody sees it.


I don’t know why this is a recurring theme. Apart from just trying my best and being very kind and polite to everybody, never saying a bad word about anyone or even giving any sass of any kind to the supervisors, I’ve also had panic attacks at work, anxiety attacks, I’ve openly cried many times when I’m overwhelmed because I just can’t help it, I feel so much pressure every moment of the day to do everything right, and I try as hard as I possibly can, but apparently it’s meaningless because people ALWAYS think I’m not doing anything.


Unfortunately where I live, your only options for work with a high school diploma are retail or food service which is pretty much the same thing. I cry every day when I get home from work and I’m so sore from the physical labor and running around that I don’t even have the energy to do anything fun. Maybe this isn’t for me.

What’s weird is that right now, I’m happy. I’m okay, albeit a little bored, as I’m in my room alone with no one in the building. But I was looking in the mirror and decided “why not?”. 

I wasn’t suicidal I don’t think, at least I don’t want to kill myself at this very moment. But for some reason killing myself in that moment seemed like a fun thing to do. It made me feel free, like nothing matters because I can just end it all at any moment and people would care and miss me and think about me. 

I don’t know if it’s my issues feeling isolated that makes me happy knowing people would think about me when I’m gone. I don’t know if it’s just that I subconsciously think it’s cool and edgy to be a broken mentally ill turd. I don’t know if it’s just weird brain chemistry. 

But when I run this box cutter up and down my arm just lightly enough to not break skin, I feel like it’s going to be okay. Because nothing in this life matters. We’re all made of stardust that will die along with the universe. And because of that, I don’t fear killing myself anymore. I don’t worry for my family or my problems or the things I’m missing out on by dying. 

Death basically just finishes the race. But if the value of the race is in running it instead of finishing it, why does the end matter? I’ve run a great race so far, I’ve loved every minute of it. But if life is just chasing another high and avoiding another low, how does that not seem tedious? Why does it matter if I die right now?

This might seem like a weird post, but I’d like to vent and just see if anyone else has felt the same.

I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for years now, and on New Year’s Day, everything kind of just came spiraling downward and hit me in the gut. I was suicidal and so depressed that I called several hotlines which were all closed for the holiday. I then went to the nearest hospital emergency department and was admitted to the mental health inpatient unit on Jan 1. 

On Jan 2, I had a breakdown in the unit and was placed in the high observation unit of the same ward (cameras in the rooms). I had a bunch of panic attacks in the high observation unit because the screaming of the other patients made me scared, but after all of that, I felt a lot safer having the nurses and doctors there to help me.
I got discharged yesterday (Jan 6), despite me telling my psychiatrist I wasn’t feeling ready to leave. 
I kind of wish I could go back although I know being in a hospital is not a permanent fix and long term inpatient is not the best. I’m using all my community resources that I can and hopefully those help.

Anybody else feel like this ever?

Im sorry if this is long, its the first time Im opening up about this. Im not the kind to casually date as I have to feel a deep connection with someone before I seriously consider them and thats something I almost NEVER find. If I do, Its one long term serious relationship or I wont get into it. I found this connection once and so I dated the guy (hes the only guy Ive ever dated) but four years into the relationship, I found out he was hooking up with other girls. I broke up. I was devastated. Things got worse as I had recently joined a university away from home so all these changes literally screwed up my brain.

Now I have trouble sleeping (insomnia), anxiety issues including social anxiety (being super shy and introverted doesnt help), depression (which I dont think is major as I can distract myself with friends etc but as soon as these distractions go away, I go back in this hell hole and I cant remember the last time I was completely happy, not on my own, not with distractions.), my grades are falling tremendously (From being a straight A student to getting D’s or flunking), I have anxiety attacks or panic attacks (I think) often where I start pacing and get super restless and I feel like I need whatever Im stressing about to go away or I’ll die. My chest gets tight and I find it hard to breathe. (Im also asthmatic.) My head feels like its going to explode and I feel nauseous. I cry a lot. I have zero motivation for anything whatsoever, nothing about the past, present or future makes me excited or want to be alive. I cant pay attention for longer than a few seconds, I cant memorise more than a word.

I feel like I had a little (just a little) trouble with mental health before but the breakup and going to university ended up being the major triggers for a more serious illness. Its been a year and a half since I moved to university and about 7 months since I broke up. I feel like I’ll never be able to feel ‘love’ again, especially because of how hard I find it to connect with people. I constantly day dream about what I felt and how badly I want to feel something other than hurt and betrayal. My memories are now screwed up, I cant differentiate between whats real and whats not. I feel as if everything that I had, the memories where I was happy, all that is a blur, a dream. It isnt real even tho I know it is.

I have tried socialising, Ive made new friends, Ive gotten into art again, I play the piano, Ive pushed myself a little out of my comfort zone (not too much as I get anxious then) but nothing seems to help. At the end of the day, I still cant get over what happened. And I am super tired and exhausted of being this way, I genuinely want to be happy, healthy and I want to move on. Please help?

2349,cay12250,1546900530,1,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety ever since middle school (now a 22 year old female). I was never diagnosed with anything because I never was able to seek treatment. I think I have social anxiety, depression, and OCD. Since around 8th grade I’ve dealt with anxiety around people I’m not comfortable with just yet, and it takes me a while to be comfortable. It makes me sick to be the center of attention and I would never be the one to speak up or raise my hand in class and I hated group projects. I had 1 friend that I would be around all day because it seemed like I wasn’t capable of forming connections with others and I never knew how to hold conversations without becoming anxious. It was almost like my mind would shut off and I couldn’t think of anything to say. Now that I’ve been out of school for a while, I still don’t really have friends. I moved states over 3 years ago and have yet to make friends. I have a boyfriend and I spend a lot of time with my sister (we’re best friends). I’ve tried to make friends, but I overthink it. I’ll get the courage to ask to hang out and if they don’t express interest on their own to do something I’ll think that they don’t want to be friends. I hate parties and will constantly worry that people are thinking I’m weird for being shy and quiet. I’ve had depression since around the same time as the social anxiety. I find it hard not to want to do anything but lay in bed and feel down a lot of the time. I would never commit suicide, but I have had thoughts that it would be so much easier if I didn’t have to be here. As for the OCD, I think I developed it within the last 6 months or so, or maybe it’s always been there but just got worse. I have wild thoughts that everyone I care about will die, specifically in a car accident. Anytime my sister or boyfriend leaves I’m worried they won’t make it home. I have an intense fear of driving and firmly believe that I will die in an accident, so I have compulsions in the car as well. I was in a car accident this past summer so that must have triggered that intense fear. I have 2 dogs and think that when they’re in their kennel when I’m not home that they’ll get out and get into something and get hurt. I have to take pictures of the locks on their kennels and I’ll think to myself that if I don’t, they will get out and something bad will happen. I’m terrified that someone will break in at night so I go back and forth checking the locks multiple times and taking pictures. I‘have to wake up early for work every morning, so I check my alarms over and over, probably 30 times, until I fall asleep. I think that if I don’t I’ll miss work and get fired. These are just a few of the things when it comes to the obsessive thinking. Constantly worrying and overthinking is mentally exhausting me, and I don’t have access to seek therapy.

As far as I know, I don't have any other mental health conditions. But lately I don't know what to make of things happening more and more frequently. I wasn't sure where to even talk about this so I thought the mantal health subreddit is the most appropriate one.

The one definitive thing that really freaked me out just a few minutes ago is making me question several things and I really don't know what to make of it, if it's really just my mind playing tricks or if there's something more serious going on with my mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just scrolling through my youtube feed, listening to music, then I pass by recommandations from youtube of this channel that I've been following for years, Nomad Colossus. I KNOW for a fact that I have watched all of his videos across the years and I've always followed his findings closely as I was really intrigued with this video game.

What caught my attention was the fact that seeing the name of the game, Shadow of the Colossus, seemed really out of place for me. I had literally been watching more of Nomad's videos on the game just a few weeks ago, but for some reason this time I **strongly** felt like I did not remember the game being called ""Shadow"" of the Colossus. I remembered it as *something* of the Colossus, but not the word Shadow.

Moreover I did not recognise the thumbnails or titles of the videos, even though as I've said before, I know for a fact I have watched all his videos throughout the years. [And as you can see they're not exactly new videos either.](https://gyazo.com/a0554f46388cbdf168a521f3a09bfe55) These videos are also the types that would really intrigue me to watch and I know I would've never passed the opportunity to watch them after seeing the titles. I don't remember animals in the game other than the lizards and birds, I have no idea what's in the thumbnail for the video about animals as it freaked me out too much to watch it yet.  I would have always loved to see the lost music track, more beta colossi and the pool scene. I would have never *not* wanted to watch these videos!

And regarding to the name of the game, I starting feeling like I was going mad because I felt like I knew for *sure* that Shadow of the Colossus was not the name. I remember the game being called ""SotC"" for some reason though and that's the only thing that doesn't feel unnatural to remember.

I even felt the need to go back through my discord server and search to see if I had really said ""shadow of the colossus"", and to my surprise [on 6th of February 2017 I indeed called the game Shadow of the Colossus](https://gyazo.com/1b170dd949e874a048dc0806e7ecdbf6).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I should also mention, as it might be relevant, that I've had deja vu feelings way more than any of my peers. I only found out the deja vu feelings weren't normal when I was a kid and no one around me had them to the frequency that I did when I talked about it. Lately though, especially in the past 3ish years, they've become extremely frequent, with several cases at minimum of 5 times a month, sometimes several in a span of a few days. Doctors don't believe it's cause for concern but it's starting to get tiring and annoying. They're small things most of the time like feeling as I've seen things on the internet before, heard of new tv show plot a few years back before they were filmed etc.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how many times I repeat the name Shadow of the Colossus in my head it still feels unnatural and I'm still at loss as to why I feel this way and why I don't remember seeing Nomad's videos... It doesn't help that I've recently changed computers and youtube did not keep track of my history to show me with the red line underneath the thumbnail that I had watched it, as it usually does.

I don't know if these are even symptoms or hints to another serious mental health problem, as google dismisses deja vu as innocent and I have not yet found anything certain about this sort of... *amnesia* I suppose I could call it.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels really disheartening, especially when this game has been my all time favorite for several years and I have always been very deep into findings about its lost content or secrets, and Nomad's videos especially.",mentalhealth,Possible disconnect from reality.,2019-01-08 09:29:05

I ended up going to college in the Bay Area in 2010, and she stayed in our town and went to the local Uni there. Over time, we kind of lost contact. She made new friends and so did I. 

Fast forward to 2014. I graduated from college and am still living and working in the bay area.  I haven't talked to Ilene in a couple of years, but she messages me on facebook asking for money. She said she was in a really tight spot and needed it to get an emergency abortion. Even though we hadn't talked in a long time, I still considered her a good friend and sent her the money. She said she would pay me back in a couple of weeks but after that she went completely dark. I didn't hear from her again until a month or so ago. She messaged me and our other friend from high school on facebook saying she missed us and that we should all ""take a trip to cancun"" this year. I'm always down for trips with friends, but it just seemed really out of the blue and weird considering our last interaction..

Yesterday I get some calls from a random number, I didnt pick up but saw that i got a voicemail. It was from Ilene, and she said that she missed me and she saw pictures of me and my partner on facebook. She said my partner was beautiful and she wanted to get to know her. She then sent me this facebook message:

 ""I was molested by my mom. I called the police and they escorted me out of the house because she would not let me leave. She’s painting me as schizophrenic because I called child protective services on her in 2014 for the baby. After she told the baby that I’m sick I knew it was time to leave. I’m staying in an Airbnb and flying to Seattle I’m the 11th. No one knows that I’m leaving. It’s going to have to be for good because she is really hurting me. It’s bad. I can’t succeed and be near her so I’m going to pull a Wilson. Do you know anyone in Seattle? I need to build a network.""

The thing with Ilene is her mom has always been really strict, but she never said anything about any kind of abuse when we were in high school. I know that doesn't mean anything and abusers can manipulate their victims and come in all different forms. But she has 2 sisters close in age and 1 sister that was born when we went to college. I'm friends with her other sisters on social media, and they have always posted snapchats and stories with their younger sister the past few years. 

I asked her if she was ok now, and if she had a chance to talk to her sisters or other family members about her mom. She replied with: 

""It’s not safe to talk to them. (sister 1) dragged me back into the abuse and intentional or not she is my ruin. (sister 2) is employed to trick me and then I end up in trouble. I left my dad’s house in Dallas for much of the same. I’m reaching out and finding people to help me. If you can let me know.""

The thing is, i know her sisters are some of the nicest people i know. I seems really unlikely that they are all in on some plot to abuse Ilene...

I reached out to one sister on Facebook, she saw my message but has not responded yet. I'm really worried about Ilene. I really don't know what she has been up to since really 2012, she has been pretty absent on social media, and the only thing I see are snap chats or instagram posts of her sisters. It seems like she might be having a episode of some kind that is making her paranoid about her family.

How can I help her? I don't want to enable her delusions if she is indeed in some kind of mental health episode, but I also don't want to turn a blind eye if what she is saying is true. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: old friend who I haven't spoken to in years sends me intense facebook messages telling me her mom molested her and all her sisters and family are plotting against her. It seems like a mental health issue, but i'm not sure and don't know how to proceed.

2352,derkavfefe,1546894330,1,"Over the past couple of years I have noticed that my logical thinking and overall comprehension is becoming more and more inconsistent. It takes me longer to understand things, and providing logical arguments can sometimes be impossible especially because I couldn't fully understand what I've read, to begin with.

I have had some increased stress because of my lack of job security (i.e. had two mediocre performance reviews, in the dark about whether the project is going to be given more funding, etc.), life situation (i.e. having to stay with my brother and parents because I might need them to fall back on if the company goes under), etc. I've also been consuming thc edibles pretty much daily for the past couple of years. Not a whole lot (5 - 10 mg), but im wondering if this goes deeper because I've found that when I begin to lose arguments ESPECIALLY because I couldn't understand it initially I have very strong urges to self harm (rip out my hair, cut myself, punch myself, etc.) I've only ever gone so far as hitting myself out of pure rage or smashing a keyboard, but I'd never cut myself or rip my hair out. This seems to be triggered when people make a comment about something I am insecure about (job, intelligence, etc)

Thing is that it seems that my comprehension and logical thinking is getting worse as time goes on. I have brain fog every day, stress headaches, etc. The only time this went away was when I was home for a week for Christmas--i actually felt normal again. I could think three steps ahead, got a decent chess rating from elometer.com despite not really playing much chess at all, worked on my own programming project... I was happy.

This school year has been the worst. I have been struggling with depression suecidal though self harm and a bunch of other stuff. So this year started amazing i had an amazing summer and was in a relationship and was pretty much the happinest i had been ever i practically felt bliss and euphoria on every day for up to two months and this continued a few weeks school started when suddenly i got a lot of work and pressure from school making me stress out i couldn't work because my thought would be racing and i could bearly comprihend them giving me a massive headache this happened almost daily and is where my self harm tendencies started with me using pins to self harm and banging my head against the wall and while this was all happening my girlfriend broke up with me which made me even more depresed and made everything even worse and my turrets had come back something that i hadn't have to deal with since 3rd grad (im in 10th grade) and and after a while this became to much and i started cutting but luckily this only lasted for a week then i went back to normal excluding my turrets but some weeks later i found out my grandpa died which is when shit really hit the fan i started cutting every single day and planning to kill my self and no matter where i went i could stop thinking of ways to comit suecide and when i looked at a building i just thought if it was tall enough to jump off of to kill myself this drove me to make a plan and try to execute it and on that Saturday i went out to a parking lot that i thought i could jump off of to kill myself but for some reason when i got there i didn't feel depressed anymore i fealt Normal almost happy so i went home and i was extremely angry at myself so i cut die into my leg and cried myself to sleap and after that day all of my tics stoped and i was fine for about a week and for the next few weeks i was for the most part normal other tan that i would become depressed and unbearably sad some days and cut myself but this only happend like every other week. But now after the Christmas break im back in to the depssive suecidal loop where everything feels meaningless and i want to die. I have had strong urges to cut myself again (especially today) and im afraid im going to try to kill myself again and the worst part is that no one knows about my self harm depression or anything i wrote about in this post except for the turrets bit and i have no one to turn to because i am afraid that if i tell someone everything will change as my parents and probably the school would probably find out about the suecide and self harm stuff out of no where. And i know some people will tell me to seek professional help and i already am in contact with a psychologist because of my turrets and also because they think i have adhd and i am still waiting for the diagnosis but im afraid to tell them about the depresive episodes self harm and suecide because as i said no one knows anything about this and think im fine and happy as im still very social and seem happy but on the inside im hurting. So what should i do please help i just want to fix this before it gets worse than it already is.

However, the British Army does not allow anybody with psychosis to be enrolled.

Over the past few months I’ve been noticing that I don’t enjoy anything, not just my hobbies and interests, anything. Even food. Everything tastes the same. I hate playing guitar, riding my Harley, driving in general, I hate talking to anyone about anything, I hate the sound of someone else’s voice. I hate just about everything.

So I’m writing this post in hopes that I could get some clue to my sisters mental health problems. So my sister comes into my room asking if anyone has ever told me about masturbation..because when she discovered it it was scary. From all of our knowledge, she doesn’t masturbate and has never had sex, even after being married. I’m wondering wether her masturbating would relieve her depression. She’s severely depressed and is obsessed with a guy who is 6 years younger than her and has no interests in her. She sends him disturbing emails and he knows not to reply because she’s crazy.  So I was thinking maybe most of her problems would be solve if she just masturbated? Is that wrong to think? And how do you convince such a person to start?

2364,mtomache,1546887589,1,"TL;DR We began a relationship in August despite both of us knowing the timing was incredibly off. I finally had enough in December and ended it, however we have pretty much remained in constant contact because he’s convinced that it will work in the future and doesn’t want to lose me as a “friend”.

He started pursuing me in July, we had been friends for about six months prior, the entire time of that he was with his long term (8 years) girlfriend who was also pregnant with their second child, so I did not view him as more than a friend. In July I continuously told him the timing was terrible, that she would most likely want to work it out with him once the baby was born, that he was just lonely, etc etc. I KNEW the red flags were there so I am aware I’ve enabled a lot of the behavior. However, when he and I were just friends, I truly truly believed he was one of the most trustworthy and nicest people I’ve met, that’s why I felt like after awhile, it was safe to move forward. Again, this is after weeks of him being persistent. 

A little background: he’s INCREDIBLY charming, outgoing, everyone is drawn to his personality, and he gets along with everyone. Everyone likes him, literally. We worked together so I saw this from my first day. I on the other hand am very much an introvert, reserved, and have walls up with most people. I’m not easily trusting but for some reason I trusted him. He and I worked alone together on Sundays so we shared a lot about our lives, childhood, etc and I believe that helped bring my walls down with him. When we started dating I kept thinking “why is someone like him interested in ME” and told my sister that as well. One thing I noticed is he did lack empathy towards people who he did not know or did not really care about, he would make comments about suicide and mental health as if they were not actual things that existed and if people committed suicide they were in the wrong but that it wasn’t his problem. We worked at a hospital so anytime the topic of death would come up he would say “everyone has to die someday” in a nonchalant joking manner. Both of these rubbed me the wrong way as I myself have struggled with depression and anxiety half my life (never felt comfortable telling him that).

Anyway- his baby was born in September and from that point forward I pretty much have felt like he is lying to me about his children’s mother. I believe they got back together but that he continued to string me along with his lies for months because he didn’t want to lose the physical aspects of the relationship (my assumption). Or he’s not truly happy but doesn’t want to leave for whatever reason, in which case he should still do the right thing and handle it like a grown up. 

For some reason I continued to believe him because of how much I trusted him as my friend. 

Fast forward until now- we haven’t been together for a month but remain in contact. We haven’t spoken in three days because I called him out on lying to me and he didn’t respond so I’ve had time to really think about why he might be a sociopath. 

1. He continues to tell me that he just can’t seem to get his timing right but that he “knows what he wants” and that it’s me. He basically puts this seemingly (false) hope in my heart that at some point in the future it will work for us to be together. He says that in the meantime our foundation is our relationship and we can continue to build on it. 
2. He plays dumb a lot and I believe it’s to manipulate the situation. He wanted to see me Friday and I originally said no but then had a change of heart, and when I did he didn’t respond but later told me that he didn’t know I texted him, that his daughter deleted all his messages, but that he would have loved to see me.
3. He always controls the situation. I’ve told him this. That if we see each other it only happens because he makes the time. He always blames it on his children. 
4. His actions never align with his words. He talks a lot of bullshit to keep me hanging on, but never follows through on 95% of it. 
5. When I try to be entirely done with the situation, he freaks out, guilt trips me and tells me how he’s just doing his best and that he knows it’s hard but that he never wanted to fully give up on each other. And always says he doesn’t want to lose me as a friend.
6. He’s very persistent- if I say no he will press any issue until I say yes. The only thing he didn’t was sex because I was a virgin, but did end up losing it to him (consensually). 
7. He says he respects me, cherishes our friendship, doesn’t play games, has been honest from the start- but again, none of this aligns with his actions.
8. He’s emotionally unavailable and will not talk or open up about a lot of things. He says he’d rather just give it to God and not talk about it anymore. This hurts my heart in the sense I want to help people and I do believe he is hurting but masks it with his overly optimistic outlook/facade.
9. Excuses, excuses, excuses. There’s always something in the way of us seeing each other. Illness, children’s doctors appointment, sitter falling through, everything.

All in all, I just feel very manipulated and led on. I ask him if he really thinks I am stupid and he says I’m one of the most intelligent people he’s ever met. The more I read about narcissism and sociopathy the more I feel like he is on that spectrum. He has this “hold” on me that I can’t seem to shake and move on from.

2366,OHNONOTHERAGEN,1546885658,1,"This is long but I’m really hoping I can have support on this. I’m sorry for how long it is. 

I have horrible anxiety revolving around admitting when I’m not doing well and it’s because of huge fears of abandonment. I’ve always been tossed aside and labeled as the “bad kid” or the “troubled kid” in the family and I’m the scapegoat for so many familial issues. And when I was in high school, my depression and PTSD had gotten really bad and up to a point where I was in and out of hospitals. So at some point my mom decided that I should live in a group home (a therapeutic based one) instead of at home. I didn’t want to go there at all and I had arrived there three days before my sixteenth birthday. I’m a twin and it was the first birthday we ever spent apart, and even though we don’t get along — and fought even worse then — it was just horrible. My mom came for about thirty minutes and gave me a cake and some presents and I just stood there crying, begging to go home. After over a year, I was deemed able to go home but less than six months later I was back at the group home. Throughout the two years I was there, I was told it was because my mom just couldn’t handle me. And that I was too much. And that I had traumatized my mom with my depression (whenever I would admit that I had self harmed or felt suicidal). When I turned eighteen I was still living there and I had been under the false pretenses that i would be going home then, but my mom said no. By that point, even the people at the group home recognized that it wasn’t on me and that I didn’t need to be there. I just wasn’t wanted at home. My mom is a therapist and all of her coworkers and patients love her and say how amazing she is but it’s so hard to hear that because when it comes to me she acts like she has no idea what a mental illness is. She acts very ignorant. 

When I graduated high school, I was only allowed to be at home for two weeks before I would be going to a summer college program. When I got to the summer college program, shit went down and I was put into a horrible, horrible space mentally. I was retraumatized. I begged my mom to let me home every night on the phone. I would call her and sob. She never relented. She visited me about two or three times. I also begged my dad to take me to live with him but he was told to follow my mom’s instructions (even though they’ve been divorced for 13+ years) so he wouldn’t take me home, plus he thought I should stay at college. To be fair, I hadn’t told them what happened, but it was terrible. Finally, the following September, my mom let me come home. I entered two partial programs and then when those didn’t work I entered a residential program. 

There, we worked on a lot of family therapy and I talked to my mom about how abandoned I felt. She refused to acknowledge anything that I felt. When I was at the group home, I lived on her commute home from work but she would only visit me on the weekends, and I had actively begged her to visit me during the week. During the two years I was there, she only said yes twice. I talked to her about that in the family therapy, but she only scoffed at me. Then I talked to her about times in middle school where I would be stranded after school when I would join clubs because I had no ride home but meanwhile my mom was paying someone to drive my sister home (from a different location although same town). She scoffed again and said none of that was relevant. 

I also didn’t really go too into it but I feel a lot of abandonment from how she raised me. I felt very neglected as a child, I would often go weeks without bathing and days without washing my hair. And I was young enough for my mother to do something about that, but she never did. I also feel it towards when I was abused by my neighbor and she found out but didn’t go to the police. Instead, she yelled at the girl’s mom and the girl and that was that. The abuse happened two more times after that but she didn’t know. There were also other times I was put into an abuser’s hands under her watch, although no one knows about that not even her. 

But anyway, this all leads to how I’m feeling now. I’m doing horribly. I’m in a terrible depression, and not wanting to live. I am not suicidal, I just don’t want to live. My eating disorder has also incredibly spiraled into a bad relapse. I confessed all of this to my therapist and dietitian on Friday and we determined that I should either take a leave of absence from school or go part time. And then consider treatment. I am terrified of going into treatment for a lot of reasons but a big one is my fear of not being allowed home, especially now that I’m almost twenty and my mom is not obligated to let me live here. 

I talked to my parents this weekend about what was going on to update them and they were not the most understanding — a lot because I don’t update them, and that was hard. I can’t bring myself to tell them when I feel bad because I don’t want to be kicked out. I know my mom loves me and all that but she has destroyed my trust on so many different occasions and not just in the abandonment issue. And my dad is hard to get along with at times. I’m just terrified that I’m never going to get passed this feeling in my life. And I’m tired of all of it. I’m tired of feeling so low. I’m tired of my eating disorder and the self hating thoughts I have. I’m tired of my paranoia related to my PTSD and the horrible nightmares I have.

Yeah, it’s a huge burden as a whole. So just do one little part. Pick up a can, if everyone did it the world wouldn’t have cans on the living space. There was a movement a while back about that.

Now pretend your mind is the earth. Pick up a new can and dispose of it properly. Everything that’s stressing you out is there. Each one a different can. You have one hand on the bag/bin of which to sort these, and another to pick one up. You keep going one by one.

None the less, as one does, the mind gets messy. There are cans all over the place again. That’s okay. You find yourself picking up cans not just one by one, but two at a time. It becomes more and more easy to do.

Sometimes you have you go back to one by one.

But one thing is for damned sure. If you don’t pick up the cans, all you’ll see are cans. Until it gets to that point you can’t see a way out. But never let that stop you. You can do this. Pick up each can one by one. It may not fix anything right away but it will get better. By doing this you end up helping many more people than yourself. Like a ripple in a pond.

I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety as far as I can remember.(Which isn’t long 25yrs old) I just wanted to put a little something out here because I’m having a particularly bad day and all I’ve been able to do is pick up those cans so I don’t start crying.

Whoever you are. Never be ashamed that your mind is rough. Always remember that you’re worth it. Don’t hesitate to reach out. Someone will answer. Find a therapist. Find a doctor. Do what needs to get done because you are absolutely worth it.

Ok so I've recently gone to see a psychologist and will continue to see them for depression and anxiety, and it kinda made me notice weird things about me and I'm not exactly sure when they started. I think it's a mental thing and I've never heard of this happening to anyone else. I haven't tried asking my psychologist because I don't really want to look like an idiot and the internet is somewhat anonymous.

So every time I touch something without me actively trying to do so (like if I brush past a wall or if someone touches my shoulder, sorry for the bad examples) I have to scratch at that spot or try to rub at it, sort of like I'm trying to get clean? I'm not sure how else to describe it. 

Another thing is I have trouble trying to pay attention to things. Like in class I'll try to pay attention to the teacher or something and get distracted by a pencil and if I try to focus on the teacher again I focus so much that I'm not taking in any information. Or if I'm watching some show on tv I have to have something in my hands to fidget with or I'll play a game on my Switch.

I don't know if this is a mental thing or just me being weird, so sorry again if this doesn't belong here or if I'm just being a nuisance and also for how horribly worded this is, I'm not used to writing this much and English is my second language

2384,PunsOnBunsForHuns,1546873360,1,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

So a little background is probably important. I’m 25 years old but turning 26 on Friday and I am beyond terrified after the past holiday season. The last few years, nothing has upset me more than New Years because of all the expectations that go into the night. You’re supposed to find a New Years kiss, you’re supposed to have a resolution to better yourself, you’re supposed to go drink copious amounts of alcohol and ruin New Year’s Day with the inevitable hangover... And finally, the expectation that somehow your life will be different or changed for the better because of a change in year. I had plans to go to a party in Manhattan with some friends but decided last minute to cancel it and stay home instead and ended up in bed before midnight. (I can elaborate more on the things that happened over Christmas week that brought me to this decision to isolate myself, but I’m starting to get away from the point I want to make.)

The thing that terrifies me right now is the implication of turning 26. Health insurance. I had a very tough 2018 and was so depressed I ended up taking a leave of absence from my last job to participate in inpatient and outpatient programs for about 2 months. The programs were incredibly helpful and for several months I was doing much much better. But I was 25 and still on my parents’ health insurance at the time. I wouldn’t have been able to afford the costs of the programs I needed if not for the insurance. Currently, I’m working a fairly new job (about 3.5 months now) as a contracted engineer. Considering how recently I started at this company, another leave of absence (like with my last job) to prevent me from becoming more suicidal doesn’t make sense. I’m afraid I’ll lose my job and subsequently the health insurance that I will need for myself at the end of January. My parents have already told me that I don’t need to worry about insurance/money needed for treatments if things do lead to me losing my job because of my depression but that just fills me with so much guilt and shame that it just feeds into my suicidal ideation. 

So it pretty much feels like I’m on a deadline to “cure” my depression before the end of the month when I start paying for my own insurance. Because if I can’t afford the treatment I know I need on my own then I want to kill myself. 

And one of the worst things is I’m already doing so much to try and get better. I’m in therapy, I’m very open with my parents and a few close friends about my condition so I have support, I’m on medication, I’ve cut back on drinking and I’ve stopped smoking weed. I’ve signed up at a nearby gym and have even applied for a 6 week boot camp type fitness class that includes meal plans to meet people and keep me accountable for getting back in shape. I already know how important a healthy diet, regular exercise and social interaction is for me but I was officially diagnosed with depression when I was 18 and overall I’ve just gotten worse. Sure there’s good days but after all this time my mental health looks like a failing company on the stock market. I’m just filled with hopelessness and despair that things won’t get better. 

TL;DR: I’m terrified at the thought of being financially responsible for my depression and it’s making me suicidal. 

Anyway if you made it through all of that, thank you for taking the time to read my post. Every last one of you is loved and appreciated. If you’re struggling as much as me right now, remember just because I don’t see hope for myself doesn’t mean there isn’t any out there for all of you. Anyway, I’m not even sure what I’m looking for by posting this but I’m currently grasping at straws trying to get better so I’m gonna keep “shooting in the dark” for as long as I can still handle it.

Everyone's telling me that I need to improve so that I can get the grades required to go to university in September, but I don't care anymore.  I don't see the point trying when hopefully I'll be dead by September.

I'm also finding it difficult to manage my part time job, which is in retail. I've had this job for around 8 months, but it still feels like I've only been there for a week. I'm still anxious about things I should be used to by now. I'm constantly worrying throughout the day that I've made a mistake that will get me fired. I leave work in tears after every shift. It's horrible, and I'm tempted to quit my job just to avoid the anxiety associated with it. 

What has got me concerned lately though is that I've started self-harming my thighs. I know it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I just can't stop. I don't even know why I keep hurting myself, since I hate having to find ways to hide my cuts from everyone.

Most days I struggle to sleep. Every night my mind is racing and I think about suicide. I know it's messed up, but the thought of being able to kill myself and make all these problems go away is relieving to me.

I'm currently taking 15mg aripiprazole for my mental illness/schizophrenia of some kind and 25mg quetiapine for sleep. 1mg lorazepam just so I have something to be dependent on. And 12.5mg×3 tianeptine for depression/anxiety.

For a couple months I was eating less than 150 calories a day and at me lowest point I wasn’t eating for days. Most of the time I would only eat one meal a day keeping it under 300 calories. I lost all interest in my once favourite activities and I pushed away friends and family and stayed in my room as soon as I got home from school. I cut my arms because it was easier to hide that wrists and I had extreme panic attacks a school to the point where I threw up and I was uncontrollably shaking. I also wanted to die. I almost overdosed several times on purpose. I asked my parent to take me to a psychiatrist. They don’t know everything. But instead the took me to someone who could diagnose anything and told my parents about what we talked about when I asked her not to. I want to talk to someone who can give me a diagnosis if I need one so we can work from there. Any ideas on how to ask or get them to send me to a psychiatrist.

2393,Rosyiskewl,1546865027,1,"-I will mention anything in which I find important in the story.

Basically, two years ago I lost my pet bird. The thing is, I was obsessed with birds all through childhood because of my bird. He was pretty much my only friend and I still have sketchbooks filled with birds. I bought everything bird related and what not, but you get the point. Now, when my bird was lost my parents didn't seem to care. I got extremely depressed for about 3 months, crying and not wanting to do anything productive. 

Another thing is that my parent's relationship is bad, but sometimes it gets to the point where I don't want to be near them when they're together. My mom has told me that she's going to separate from my father soon. This has impacted me because my father was in my childhood for most of my life. But at the same time my mother suffers with his BS daily so I feel like a bad person not wanting to. Sometimes my mother has broken down and has broken through my windows. 

Six months ago was the happiest time of my life. I had conquered social anxiety which I had been facing for 3 years, and I had gotten into a great relationship. I was able to make friends easily starting the new term. I didn't really think much about my parents or my bird at this time, occasionally I would think about it and cry a little, but fall back asleep.

As the year progressed, one out of three of my friend groups started to drift apart. It's also important that they are my closest friends. I feel really bad about it but I try not to think about it. My boyfriend helped me through this. 

The second friend group was cut by myself after noticing that I was not liked by them. Basically, they never wanted to talk with me and gave me the stink eye whenever I did. They called me annoying and when I talked to them about this they called me crazy. I stopped talking to them and I felt terrible. One of them shit talked me and made up rumors but my closest friend didn't seem to care. She kept hanging around her and that just made me feel worse. 


I had a shitty professor that gave me an F for my test which ruined my grade. It's a really long story, but it was really unfair because I had worked so hard on it and that made me break down a few times and from there on I honestly hate going to college. 

At this point I had almost no social interaction on a daily basis. My boyfriend was busy with his own college and work, while I was busy with school. School seemed so meaningless at this time. I would skip many days and I felt bored out of my mind there. My boyfriend still talked to me for a little bit. From here I started to feel really weird about my boyfriend.

Basically, I started to question whether he was honestly busy with college or he was just lying because I am a pretty boring person. There were Saturdays where he wouldn't message me until 6 pm. I don't even know why this bothered me. I know he is a busy person and he doesn't have a lot of friends. And I know that he cares a lot about me. Still, I kept doubting him. I started to get bothered by the smallest things. For example, sometimes he would ignore me when talking with his friends. I felt like a terrible person for feeling bad about this but at the same time I couldn't anything about it. I got angry at him for not being able to read my emotions. There was no need for me to get angry if I never told him about what bothered me. Everytime I got angry, he would apologize and try to change himself for me. I broke off our relationship because I felt like I was too emotionally unstable and got bothered super easily. He told me that he didn't care if I wasn't perfect and asked me out again. I really missed him during those times and so we went out again. 

I kept getting bothered by the little things still, but except I talked to him more about it. He didn't judge me and tried to fix it. I would honestly occasionally get a little jealous when he would talk to his friends more than me. I don't know why I still feel like this. I was friends with his friends. One day, one of the friend he talks to a lot was rude towards me unrightfully, and I told him about it. He agreed that I was right and that his friend made a mistake. The next day my boyfriend kept talking to her like if nothing had happened and that just made me feel terrible. I felt as if he didn't care about me because he never really defended me. I told him about this and he apologized. He was confused on what to say and he promised me that he would say something. When he did, nothing really changed but I'm glad that he did.

Right now, he still talks to her the same as before. I am cruel and manipulate wanting him to stop talking to her. I know he loves me very much and just sees her as a friend. Still, my feelings don't follow my thoughts at all and when I try to control them they just get out of hand. I get upset when I find him texting her in a group chat when he's texting me at the same time. It makes me even more upset when he takes longer to respond because he's texting in a group chat.

 At this point, I clearly know that I'm a terrible girlfriend and person. I over analyze everything and don't stop thinking about it. The fact that I don't have any friends either doesn't make it better. Right now, it's 5:31 am while typing this. I wasn't able to get any sleep last night for 4 days in a row. At first it was because of them, but now I don't really know. It could be everything mixed in and I don't know wtf is happening in my brain. When I go to sleep, I don't think of anything I just feel extreme sadness. I lay there in my bed, trying to sleep. I just cry and cry for no apparent reason. I don't want to go to my classes anymore and I'm so scared to lose my boyfriend because everyone else was lost in this year. My question is, what is really affecting me? And what is wrong with me? Why do I keep getting these feelings that don't belong, and why can't I control them? And lastly, what is your advice to me? I'm afraid this is my last resort because I haven't had any sleep in a while. And physically and mentally, I feel like shit. Thanks for reading this depressing essay and I'd appreciate some help.

2394,Throwhohohomerryxmas,1546864907,1,"I will keep this as brief as possible, I am not sure if I want to vent or am grasping at some vain hope of someone offering a useful partial solution.

I am 30 years old and in the UK.

I have suffered from anxiety issues since I was 5 years old, I thought anxiety was the normal way people felt until it started to cause large social issues around the age of 18. My typical issues are: panic attacks, a need for routine and specific execution of activities, avoidance of certain types of contact, social withdrawal and general catastophising of the pedestrian.

I sporadically worked during more stable periods of my adult life, but after my last period of employment I went onto benefits due to my illness for the first time in my life.

I had to partake in an assessment. The questions were tailored heavily towards physical ability as opposed to mental ability to do things. As such, they told me I would have to go back into work, or appeal to a tribunal. It is worth noting that for the past few years I had left the house for social reasons next to no times at all, and the thought of standing infront of people and pleading my case was too much to bear. How exactly do you talk about this to strangers when the moment you make eye contact with someone you can ""see"" all of the bad things people thinking about you.

I went into self employment, as a way to tailor my social situations to be those that are favourable, with mixed success. And then it happened, a single person criticised my work, and I cannot do it any longer. Whenever I work, I approach it with dread, my heart rate is elevated for entire days. I have been unable to dare open letters for years, for reasons I cannot rationalise, I have not been able to fill in my taxes even though I had never earned enough to be taxed. My bank account closed and amassed additional charges due to these issues. I work maybe one day a month if someone contacts me, and it socially drains me for days or weeks after.

I attended the doctors a few times recently and asked for help, I explained my difficulties making my issues known and stated my discomfort, he dismissed my claims as nonsense as he was understanding me fine, apparently. In the past Ii had used SSRIs and beta blockers to attempt to handle my situation with no positive result (unless the goal was to sleep all day for months and be unable to orgasm) and had entended a CBT course of treatment for an extended period. He put me on SSRIs again leading into the same side effects and an extremely out of character and (poor) suicide attempt.

The final time I attended the doctors, the doctor said that he could offer no other medications and that ""I am aware of my problems and will address them before they become a larger issue"". Address them fucking how exactly? I have requested a telephone consultation with a different doctor but have 2 week wait time.

I contacted helplines to ask about advocacy (but apparently need to be sectioned to qualify) and just other places I can go for help. I contacted citizens advice and they could offer no support in addressing these issues, nor any useful contacts.

TL:DR 

Can't fill in my taxes due to anxiety.

Cannot treat my anxiety due to anxiety/side effects/trivialisation of my condition.

Have one good productive day (today) every 2-6 months and spend the rest of the time doing the bare minimum to live, relying on the charity of my family.

I honestly at this point have started to fantasise about suicide, I do not plan to do it but I see no other recourse if the not paying taxes could result in prison time (I don't dare look it up). I see no ways to address my issues.

2397,MLKJrWetDream,1546863579,1,"Hi guys, I just found this sub. I’m really happy it exists. I needed to ask for advice since I’m currently not on health care and can’t ask my previous psychiatrist. But I’m in the process of renewing it! Hopefully I’ll be covered again by February.

I’m 24, F and I take 20mg Prozac and a quarter of a 0.5mg Klonopin pill every day (I was really paranoid about becoming dependent on a high dose so I insisted on cutting the pill and 0.125mg was still very effective.) I take them for generalized anxiety and panic disorder. I had been in a good place for almost two years. For the last 6 months, I was tapering super slowly and in mid November I quit completely. For about a month I was mostly fine, with some manageable anxiety here or there, and I thought it was all part of the process. But 3 weeks ago I walked into an Urban Outfitter and the room felt distorted. I felt dizzy, my body went cold, my hands were clammy. I turned around and walked out immediately. I was supposed to take the railroad to my boyfriend’s but as I started walking through the streets, I felt too nervous. The area gets extremely congested, and suddenly I couldn’t make myself walk through the crowd. I took the subway home, trying to calm myself the entire way but I had all these racing, irrational thoughts.

Since then, I’ve been nervous about going outside, being in the busy part of my city, taking public transportation, etc. I went back on my medication, which used to be so effective, and it’s been 3 weeks but I still feel...off when I go outside. These are all symptoms I dealt with initially that I was able to fix with my medication and CBT, so I’m trying to get my health insurance back so I can go back to therapy. I really regret tapering, it was dumb and unnecessary especially without my psychiatrist’s supervision. I heard that if you unsuccessfully taper and you go back on your medication, you would need a higher dose to get the same benefits as before.

2398,NoOnesKing,1546861287,1,"So I’ve been dealing with this privately on and off for something like two or three years.

I know it’s dumb to bottle this up and not talk about it but I just don’t know how to do so without gushing it all out which is going to hurt.

It all started when I was a freshman in highschool and got into a near death experience. I distinctly remembering just thinking, “I’m fine, why am I fine? I should have some sort of issue” and it’s almost like that triggered the depressive episode I went into for about five months.

This was when it was worst and it felt like a pit of numbing, emptiness would well up in my chest and not go away for at least a half an hour unless I distracted myself with music or funny videos or something else. 

It was awful. There were distinct moments where I just couldn’t do anything except cry and I had mini panic attacks inside my head in school. Usually crying helps get stuff out but even the tears felt endless and didn’t help, at all.

One day after a shower and a particularly bad wave of it that wouldn’t leave I just went and hugged my mother and cried. Didn’t explain anything (in a sense that she could understand) but I cried and she held me and we just sat next to each other and watched TV which essentially ended the episode for me.

I thought I was mostly fine except ever since when I feel the slightest bit of that badness or sadness welling up it feels like if I don’t distract myself again I’m going to immediately slip into that more severe sadness again. I’ve been emotionally walking on eggshells for years and it’s awful.

I find it helps to get out of my own head and do stuff that keeps me busy and not able to focus on how I feel inside. Unfortunately my school life and just daily activities do not, in any sense, do this much for me at all.

I just want to be okay again. I just want to be able to feel sad or bad and not have it feel like that depressive wellspring. There’s a VERY distinct difference between how it felt to feel bad and how it felt to be depressed.

I’m terrified and don’t know what to do. It’s why I’m extremely scared to go to college. I know that is going to be hard for a while and I feel like the slightest discomfort or longing for home is going to set me off again.

Please, PLEASE, someone tell me what to do. I’ve tried to ask for therapy before but never in a serious enough way to actually schedule something. I’m scared they won’t be able to fix me. 

I really need some advice and any feedback would be appreciated.

2399,weemadrach,1546860432,1,"Hi there. I am a 28 year old female with anxiety, and have recently been diagnosed with High Functioning ASD. The hardest part of dealing with this on a day to day basis is work.

I work part time Mon-Fri, 4 hours a day in the afternoon. I feel like this is all I can work as full time hours would be too taxing for me. Hell, some days I feel 4 hours is too much!

I love my job. Nice quiet office job, get on with my colleagues (although they don't understand mental health as well as I would hope) and it's good pay. However, whenever I get ready for work in the morning I get rising panic. So much so that I want to just scurry back to bed and hide and never go out again. 

I know these are extreme feelings but I am struggling to cope. My boss knows of my issues and is supportive but I still feel like I am letting people down when I ring in sick because I ""can't cope"". Sometimes I go in because I don't have the courage to phone in sick, and I would never just not turn up or not give notice.

I need support. I want to live a normal life. I want to be able to do a 20hr a week job without panicking every day. I have no idea where to turn. I can't ring the support lines because of my phone anxiety and there seems to be very little online chat options.

started learning something that wasn't abstract such as statistics, I would get a 1 (best passing grade) despite the class average actually decreasing. 

&amp;#x200B;

And although I do ""well enough"" in mensa IQ tests they still give me a headache, specifically the 

pattern based tests even at the very beginning of the test, things that are dead obvious. Like

""1,2,1,2,1,2,x"" and the possibilities are x=1 or x=921. Like I understand that whoever made that 

question thinks the answer is ""1"" but I utterly fail to understand why. 

Just because they repeated like that before doesn't mean that X necessarily has to also be ""1"". Or with

the pictures where you're supposed to choose whichever you think comes next, it frustrated me endlessly

because ""which one should come next"" is not a real question to me

although dumb, at least ""which one should come next from an aesthethic point of view"" makes sense as question

So what I end up doing is asking myself ""which one do they think is the one that should come next"". But

inevitably I fail.

sufficient and necessary conditions. And I fully understand sufficient and necessary conditions and got through the

non-abstract ones like a breeze. Yet I can't get through this one (even though I know it's simple) even after watching

2 videos about it, and couple of other internet explanations as well as the one provided by my professor.

I can't even move with it even after seeing the correct answer.

is missing in me that other people have or something is broken. I know I am not terribly stupid as I got

there's a question but it's not a complete question which dictates what I am supposed to choose based

on and is directly related to reality I find it nigh impossible to answer. This is a problem to a certain degree on most test, If I don't just get stuck on questions like that, I'll follow a completely different logic stream and end up at an incorrect answer, which I nevertheless can justify as being correct even after seeing the actual correct answer.

I had a big trauma in my life back in 2014 (when i was 14). Family was undergoing near bankruptcy, father was overworking. And he isn't a mentally matured/stable person. So on 3 separate occasions in 2014, he tried to kill me with a knife, strangled me and chased me. I didn't do anything wrong, he did all those just because he was irritable and wanted to vent his stress out on someone and that was me. All while that was happening, i was being bullied in school (teachers had to escort me whenever school was over because possibility of high school gang members coming to find me was real), i had no help and no one to talk to, nobody on my side. I remembered the time when i was deadlocked by bigger high school seniors, pushed around the stairs and harassed by them constantly. All when that was happening, my 'friends' and girlfriend betrayed me and talked smack behind my back which eventually made me disconnect with them back then. I was basically alone, at home i am afraid i will die by my father's hands, i can't sleep well, i can't live well and i can't be myself anymore. At school/other social life, i fear for my own life from bullies, fake friends and etc. I am once again alone and fear that i will die. 4 years+ have passed, and now it's the beginning of 2019, i could never sleep well, nor be myself at all, very afraid that i will die everywhere i go. 2 days ago i broke down and had a mental breakdown, the trauma is unlocked again and came back like a dragon that was once asleep. I had been suppressing it and slowly masking it, but bottling all these finally led to an explosion that i could not have imagined. This mental breakdown led to my all my close family members finding out and crying and repenting in front of me about their mistakes and how they didnt save me when i was 14.

He also hates my mum so whatever my mum does, my dad starts muttering to himself in anger. Last night, my dad was helping my brother do his science fair project but the type of project he chose was 14 years old level and so my 12 year old brother was struggling. My dad and my brother spent a total of 5 hours on understanding how the project works and the physics behind it but my brother obviously didn't understand much. And so in the living,downstairs, my dad started shouting and slapping my brother head and back multiple times (I could hearing the smack from my room which is located on the 2nd floor). I felt really bad for my brother but at that time i was so ill and head a 39°C fever so I couldn't be asked to go downstairs and start arguing with my dad.

He's told me that he would've been nice to me if I had ""Good Grades"" but because recently i've got a Cs and Ds for my college grades he's been quite strict. I gotta admit that I should really start revising and stop being lazy so that i can get into university but I think hitting a child/kicking a child's back is a little too much. I really don't think my dad hitting me left a mental scar for me but back when I was a bit younger I used to flinch whenever my dad raised his arm suddenly if though he wasn't going to hit me. My brother is very clumsy and when he tries to pour a drink into his cup, he often spills the drink everywhere and my dad would get extremely irritated and called him a retard. He would often raise his hand up to act as if he was going to slap him and this resulted in my brother fearing my dad (e.g. he would also start flinching like I did whenever my dad raised his hand). I've had conversations with him before saying that hitting a child isn't normal but he would always answer back saying that if he doesn't act scary we wouldn't listen to him. Many asian parents would beat their child back when my dad was a kid so i guess that's why he acts like that. I don't even know what is right or wrong but I still believe that hitting a child is definitely in the wrong.

2409,Oxenfreeally,1546851464,1,"I've recently came out of a break up. One of the biggest reasons of a break up is because of my mental health. My ocd flared up for the first time and just took me out for a fucking hell of a ride. My (ex) partner got tired of me always having to *confess* my intrusive thoughts because it made me feel guilt and just crippled me to the point I feel chest pains whenever I talked to them or thought about it. Anyway, don't blame them for wanting to leave (even though I was the one who broke it off for their own good) as they tried their hardest to understand me but due to some reasons, I and my situation is also not good for them. They have their own issues (health and so) to be concerned about that just makes it hard to be with me and accept my condition. 

I also just recently realize (2018 november) that my little 'quirks' and ""vivid imagination"" could be ocd. I haven't had an official diagnosis but after tons and tons of research and this flare up of intrusive thoughts, anxiety attacks and worsening compulsions, I am convinced. 

&amp;#x200B;

So back to the subject. I've basically confessed every intrusive thought to my ex. Even when we broke up three weeks ago, I've still confessed after. We don't talk on a daily basis but til now we still keep in touch. It was also a **very messy** break up. Lots of hurtful things were said (more on their part but I understand cause I have previously fucked up and put some trust issues way before my flare up)

Basically we talked again today and even before we talked today, i still get thoughts but they're a little manageable. Thing is, my brain was like ""okay well, since you've said everything lets create some things to torment you"" and immediately my mind directs me to this thought:

""Maybe if your ex dies, you'd feel less anxious and sad or not anxious and sad at all.""

and **immediately** I deflect that thought so hard and violently. I hate it. I hate it so much. I don't want my ex to die. I love them so much, I still do. I still care about them, if anything I ask them how they are from time to time when things are calm. They are so lovely and were lovely to me. I don't want them any harm. 

Yes, I've been somewhat anxious they're going to move on with somebody else or before me (which is somewhat okay) and I don't want that but fuck, not to the extent I wish them death. I DONT WISH ANYBODY DEATH. Even the people I hate the most. it just feels mean and evil. 

&amp;#x200B;

Especially not my ex. I love them so much. I can't believe my brain would everthink of that. My problem here is when they message me gain since we're in the middle of a somewhat serious conversation about closure. I fear that my urge to confess (a compulsion) because I feel guilt and frantic will come up. Honestly, they're the only person I feel this way about like I can't calm down til I confess to them the guilty thought thats related to them. Anybody else, i can shrug off but not them. **I don't want to tell them about the thought because:**

1. It might make them feel bad and feel like I don't love them or wish bad upon them. I don't, I just want whats best for them but I don't think they understand how my brain works now. 
2. They might overthink about it. 
3. We're already somewhat okay. Like they weren't as angry at me like they were 5 days ago. i don't want to fuck up and have them NEVER talk to me ever again and that be the last straw. 

Someone please help. My OCD is flaring up again and I think its cause things are turning out okay between us. Thing is it also bothers me when things are not okay between us. I dont know hwere to place myself but I just don't want to lose my ex all together at all. Like unreachable at all but i am willing to stay away after we talk some closure for us to move on but im afraid im gonna feel restless til i confess the thought and fuck everythin up once more.

2412,Ukatofox,1546849106,1,"A little background:

My doctors over the years tried me on a few antidepressants. Zoloft made me fat. Abilify made me black out. Effexor shut my emotions off. Welbutrin gave me back a full range of emotions, amplified. Then I was put on Rexulti. (I piggybacked it with Prozac while I was inpatient, but took myself off because my anxiety was out of control.)

My psychiatrist thought it would be good to taper off the Welbutrin, then run some blood tests to figure out exactly what seretonin receptors are misfiring. (or something like that.) In that moment of (for lack of better word) ""detox"", I was hit with an emotionally traumatizing bombshell. I cried from Friday night through to next Friday morning. I didn't eat. I barely slept. I cried from the crack of dawn until I eventually passed out from exhaustion. I've had similar experiences before, but never such raw emotion. I've never dealt with a situation like that without meds. Tuesday morning I had my therapist, who was able to push my psychiatrist appointment to the very next day by the Grace of God. (I was off work at the time dealing with an unrelated Kidney stone.)

Dr. K fudged the bloodwork and threw me on Rexulti. Without exaggeration, after 2 doses, I was in a significantly better place. I woke up by the third dose and didn't feel like crying. I was... Stable. A feeling I'm not all too familiar with. I was exponentially getting more and more stable every morning. By the time I finished the first sample pack, I was more stable than 3ds firmware. (A little bit of r/3dshacks humor.) I didn't bloat. I had a full range of emotions. I wasn't hyper-sensitive. It was great. I ended up going inpatient because (metaphorically) if a car is driving straight and you let go of the steering wheel, it'll eventually hit a bump and swerve off the road. While inpatient, they took me off my antianxiety (which I didn't think was doing anything anyway) and put me on Prozac to piggyback the Rexulti, because, while Rexulti kept me stable, Dr. N over there didn't think it was doing enough. Ended up giving me paranoia-level, out-of-body anxiety and I took myself off. But I was doing great on the Rexulti. Dealt with a different trauma and ended up going up to 2mg. But I was doing absolutely fantastic. 

I felt like what a normal human should feel like. And I was functioning. I had to go a week one time without it, but there were no physical withdrawal symptoms, which is a blessing and a curse. I hated Zoloft because you had to take each dose within like 16 hours, Effexor was 24 hours, amd Welbutrin was 48 hours before the ""brain zaps"" and headache kicked in. Rexulti, I don't *feel* anything, but my emotions began to unravel a little. I had to cold turkey in late-June and haven't been able to go back on anything since. I was doing well without them until about mid-November when everything exploded and I'm not functioning properly anymore.

Anyone else deal with Rexulti before? Is there anything similar that might be cheaper? I know it's an evergreen version of Abilify, but they didn't react to me like the same drug.",mentalhealth,My Misadventures With Rexulti,2019-01-07 19:18:26

I'm almost at school rn and its just getting worse. I really don't want to go. I dont do what i want its to much for me rn. I dont like it either anymore. My dad didnt let me switch to what i want to do. And before that when i needed to choose i was to scared to say what i wanted to my dad. I thought i liked it what i do but i don't. It's my dads choise not mine. My alters also are not happy with it. I get alot more headachs, mental breakdowns and panick attacks. And i struggel again more with selfharm. 

I didnt get much sleep today im so exhausted. I couldnt sleep because of stress. Plus alters that didnt want to shut up. I'm scared ill not go trough this year and i don't want to do it over i don't want to do another extra year. I just need to survive this year and another one. Then i go to collage what I'm looking forword to. I'm gone do computer gaming programming. But now im still stuck here. Me and my boyfriend also promised to each other that after collage we both get a tattoo.  My dad wouldnt like that but i want to do what i want for once. 

I also struggel with reality i just dont remember sometimes that i ate or showered. like this morning i know i did it but its like i didnt. It's like it was in a dream. I dont know if one of my alters did it or something but i sturggel so much with this all.

I also feel like sometimes time goes faster like a youtube video that doesnt stand on 1x the speed but 1,5x the speed. I just get so mentaly crazy from it i don't know if it has anything to do with DID/OSDD or not. When it happens i would love to yell please stop or something what i did when i was younger.

there's static in my head. i don't know when it started. maybe it's always been there; maybe it was just quiet before and i can only hear it now. the static isn't physically heard, but it's always there. dissolving my streams of thought into meaningless alphabet spaghetti pinged and then thrown up again, going in all directions at once. and there's a physical sensation, a feeling of hollowness both in my forehead and above the nape of my neck. anatomically where my frontal lobe and cerebellum are. 

and it's always there. i can't run away.  i see every situation as overwhelming. i'm apathetic, i give up easily. i learned from living with my toxic dad that all you can do is not focus on his foulness, let him win, and hope he's satisfied his ego for the night so you can retreat in the safety of isolation. so of course i dissociate. it's the only way i learned to survive. i ignore all of my problems as long as i can and hope they go away. if i distract myself, it subjectively isn't there.

The years leading up to now I’ve coped with my trauma and issues in some weird ways, I’ve had awful boughs of depression, and anxiety manifested after I had some pretty bad stuff happen to me at a young age. Up until now it was bad, yes, but bearable. Recently though it has been tremendously harder and I have been struggling very hard with feelings of self purpose and worth, anxiety has skyrocketed off this planet, depressive episodes, spiking bipolar feelings, intrusive thoughts, and at some point something snapped and I realized things had gotten very very bad without even realizing it. Which I realize sounds a bit silly.

Now that I’m on my company’s insurance, I am actively reaching out and looking into getting professional help, which still freaks me out a lot inside because previously it was always my dad sending me to therapy for one or two sessions and then stopping because he saw no progress and felt like he was wasting money. Which has always been a personal struggle because I don’t like being a financial inconvenience. I have also been struggling with the thought of being on medication for these struggles because one of the sources of my trauma is substance abuse of a parent. Either that, or that I will feel no difference and still feel miserable as I do now. Every time I’ve ever looked into getting medication I haven’t felt anything and then felt too bad to ask my Dad to take me back because it would be costly. 

I guess this kind of turned out to be a vent but I was wondering if anyone else could give me some hope that medication would actually help at all? I admit I have issues that I need to resolve with therapy but I do feel like some of it truly is beyond that and I should be medicated.

2432,cry364,1546836173,1,"Hi...
So I originally started to look on this subreddit for some clues as to what im going through. 

It's hard to explain, but I'll try my best.
I'm in my early 20's and there have been times where this has happened to me in my teen years, just only for a second or 2 and only 1 or 2 times a week. It didn't bother me back then, it does now.

So.. the problem...

This week i have had 2 major ""episodes"" (one being last night) where i can only describe as a living nightmare. After it happened the first time i told myself that this isn't right. 
I was trying to sleep last night when it happened again and after afew ""waves"" i got out my phone and wrote down what it felt like.

(This is the unedited version)

""Its the feeling of being trapped and bounded up and struggling to get out the sudden erg to drive my finger nails down my arms as hard as i can and thoughts of self harm like cutting my self

Just a moment in time then it happens again in 2-3 more waves

What lead up to it 
Asking god to open my eyes and pleads for forgiveness then sudden thoughts of self hate then rushing thoughts and the feeling of not being in control 
Then it happend""

(That was it)

If you could get anything out of this msg please say something in the comments,
Thanks.

2. My psychologist won't renew my prescriptions because she doesn't have the time of day and there are no refills.

3. Two of them just ran out (I took the last dose this evening.)

4. You can't retake finals unless you have a medical excuse signed by a doctor.

5. I missed a month of school because I got horribly sick

6. I can't function in school whatsoever.

7.  If I try I get horrible panic attacks like before I started any antidepressant at all bad.

8. Plus there's the absolute insane pressure of trying to get caught up in my work.

9. And also having depression that saps my motivation to do anything but sleep all day every day.

10. My psychologist is gonna let my dad know tomorrow if I can get squeezed in for an emergency appointment at her other office that's further away so I can talk about readjusting my meds.

11. I literally can't even find the motivation to brush my hair or shower it's so bad but I can barely tell what's good or bad anymore because I've had this for so long. 

12. I'm so fucking stressed out I'm about to have a panic attack right now because how the FUCK am I supposed to function in school let alone take a test let alone take a test that determines half of my grade for the semester when I've missed an entire month of school. 

13. It's my senior year too so if I flunk this shit I am in DEEP trouble. 

14. I have no idea how I'm gonna survive college and at this point the only future I see for myself is in a psych ward trying to figure out what antidepressants work for me and how I can become a functional person again.

But for the past year i have been obsessed with passing out. It occupies my thoughts probably 80% of the time I'm awake. My thoughts are usually ""it would be awful if i passed out right now"" or ""imagine if i passed out here and how bad it would be"" 
Sometimes it gets so bad that it can trigger a panic attack. I spend alot of time avoiding situations because i don't want to feel this way. 

I recheck my work bag so many times before i set off to work, once in my apartment and once again when I'm sitting in my car. And then again when im in my work parking lot.

I've also noticed other things I've done in the past that i think are strange..such as spending over 3 years praying everynight to a god i don't believe in. ive stopped doing this now but looking back it seems so odd to me.

When I confided in a family member, they suggested I might have OCD. This is what I told them:

- I'm afraid that even the small decisions I make will have negative consequences for either me or the people around me
- I'm afraid to leave the house, because if I leave, it could get robbed, or maybe it'll be on fire when I get home.
- I'm afraid to use the car because I'm afraid I'll do irreparable damage to it or kill someone else if I make a bad decision driving.
- I'm afraid if I take a job in the city over, that something terrible will happen. Maybe we'll/I'll crash, maybe I'll/we'll get mugged, maybe I'll/we'll be killed, maybe the house will be robbed or destroyed while I'm away from it.
- I'm afraid if I drive other peoples cars I'll crash them  accidentally by making a driving error.
- if I have passengers I'm afraid we'll crash and theyll be hurt because of me
- after I give even small advice I agonize about it and am afraid it's bad advice thatll do them harm, or even lead them to death.

The last time I was truly captivated by an album was 2-3 years ago. I listened to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and I was blown away by it. I enjoyed it so much that I played the record again after it had ended. Even though it might not seem such a big deal to some of you, since then no album made me feel that way again.

y'know

that feeling when you're so captivated by a record you just forget about yourself, about your issues and your life, and idk you're breath synchronizes with the track's rhythm and you get shivers and it ***just feels so amazing and beautiful and fucking good man***

I haven't experienced that in a long time. Actually, I sort of did, but it only lasted for a couple of songs, after which I lost my interest for the music.

For example, yesterday, I decided to give Morbid Angel a try. The first track of Altars of Madness was hypnotizing. Yet by the album's third track I was bored.

And (roughly) the same goes for Iron Maiden, Eluvietie, Death (Symbolic got me pretty hooked though, almost finished the album), Dissection, Metallica, Nightwish, Emperor, Burzum (actually Filosofem pretty much offered me the same 'climax' Sgt. Pepper gave me but it had that 26 minute long synth song which turned me off.)

Any advice? My headphones are fine (audio-tehnica ath m40x), I usually download FLAC tracks, and my laptop does a good job at delivering the sound. I might also have depression, but since I'm 17 my parents won't take me seriously ('it's just a phase' 'this is how teenagers are') so the only therapist I could get is music.

2444,PreviouslyLitMatch,1546828874,1,"Dear redditors, 

A little heads-up; I usually lurk Reddit, the story will quite possibly be long-winded or dreadful. Sorry if this is the case. I will do my best to be as clear as possible typing this out! If you have a question, want me to elaborate on something, or want me to correct something please let me know!


I have been dealing with a burnout for the past 8+ months, which has since helped me develop insomnia and a minor depression. My psychiatrists current hypothesis is that the insomnia is the biggest problem at the moment, keeping me from recovering well and resulting in the minor depression.

Since acknowledging that there was more going on than mere stress I have been really motivated to get on top of the situation, pulling trough numerous sessions with different psychologists and psychiatrists and the heinous waiting periods in between. Going on finally seemed to pay off halfway through November, because that was the first time the actual hypothesis was set(?). Since the hypothesis I have been enlisted in the waiting period for group therapy for my insomnia. A month and a half later I still haven't heard anything.

A common theme since reaching out for help has been a lot of irrational guilt. When I first reached out to the psych I felt guilty for not being able to fix my situation on my own. For taking a spot at the psych, while there are people waiting that are in way worse situations than me. For not being pleased with the help I received from said psych. Later I also started feeling guilty for receiving food packages from the local food bank. For receiving social assistance for freelancers. For telling the people close to me I'm ""still not doing fine"" for months and months in a row. Etc etc. I think you get the gist of it by now. 

The stupid thing is that I know that most of these are irrational, but despite that i can't seem to shake this feeling of guilt. I feel like a fraud, feel like I'm cheating the system, feel like I'm always complaining, feel like I'm ungrateful for not being happy with the help I'm receiving etc. 

I can counter all above with rational thought, I know that it's okay to not be able to get trough this on my own. I know that I deserve a spot at the psych as much as he next person, and that I have every right to be critical about the help I receive. I know that the fact that I'm getting the social assistance and food packages means that my current situation is bad enough for me to be considered for the support. And I know by heart and constant validation that my friends and family don't mind the slightest bit that I talk about still not being in the best of situations at the moment. 

For some reason I can't connect these rational thoughs to my irrational feelings. If anyone has a bit of advice that would be much appreciated. 

I hope the 'essay' above is somewhat comprehensive. Thanks for taking the time to plow trough my shitty typing skills, hope I didn't bore you to death!

A really stupid issue related to another job we both tried for, ended up ruining it all. He blocked me from social media stuff and told me not to call or text anymore.

About a year ago, he randomly added me on FB. I'm nice so I accepted. However it was odd because he never made any contact. Not even likes or comments on anything. So I kinda just ignored it

Well a few days ago, I reached out to a mutual friend we both still have on FB about a dog related question (he's a dog trainer) and anyway my old friend reached out to me, he said he saw the post and even though it wasn't for him, he wanted to tell me he has a friend who has a blind dog and trains dogs. Said he was willing to try and help if he can

Anyway we chatted about 10 min, he told me that he was really upset to hear about my dog dying last year and he has followed his FB page (my dog has one) and that he would love to meet up and I could meet his dogs and he can see mine, we chatted like no time had passed and nothing changed. It flowed easily and all that.

2457,workerdaemon,1546822102,1,"Recently, perspective on life has seemed to be the common theme in my analysis of the source of problems and successes in one's mental health.

A *huge* component to keep my mental health stablized is enjoying the little things in life. One day while I was in high school it hit me, like as if I had actually walked into a window, that the day was beautiful and the air smelled so nice, and I needed to enjoy that moment. I actually ended up writing a speech about it because it had been such a significant event.

And so today, I sit here in my crippled body -- talk about depressing triggering -- with stressors all around me. Yet, I'm relatively OK because my cat looks adorable sleeping on my knee. The Christmas tree is beautiful and brings up feelings of comfort. I have shelter. I have food. I appreciate all of this.

Maybe I got this from my grandmother. We recently discussed this and she has the same perspective as I do. She is 93, and she focuses on enjoying everything she has. She views every day as a gift. Every experience as a gift. She accepts her death soon, and does not mourn or fear it. She sees every moment as a gift. I'm somewhat similar in viewing her mortality: I accept she will die and do not fear it. Every conversation with her is a gift.

The two people I'm working on these days are suffering from their perspective. My father-in-law is suffering suicidal depression because life isn't working precisely as he believes it should work. My husband is burning out trying to help his father from a strong sense of filial piety. Their perspective is torturing them. 

My husband deals with other perspective issues, too. He often focuses on the bad. He *never* takes a moment to enjoy something unless I specifically point it out to him. Oh, and our cat. Our cat brings him much joy.

This theory mostly relates to depression, I suppose. I theorize that there is a line, or quick gradient, and if we're above it we're not depressed, and if we fall below it we are depressed (my theory of antidepressants is that it can move the line down, making it easier to stay above it). Each positive experience bumps us up, and each negative experience pulls us down. This accumulation of little joys (cute cat, a smile, fresh air, warm food) helps to keep us up above the depression, and to counteract the pull down from significant depressing events.

I suffer from depression. I think my bar is naturally quite high, so it takes a lot of little joys to keep above it (either that or my life is just hard with a lot pulling me down -- I definitely suffer situational depression). When on antidepressants, it's much easier to stay above the line. 

My husband, on the other hand, is never above the line. He's been surviving through depression for most of his life. It's here where I think perspective is so important: he has so very little that will give him a bump up. Instead, everywhere he turns is another thing to pull him down. He is consumed by feelings of obligations and feeling he's about to collapse under the weight.

I believe the cat and I are significant towards keeping my husband afloat. He *loves* the cat. He can't help but have his heart flutter when he sees her adorable fluffiness. And she is a good cat, so they have good interactions together. I just merely love him. He forgets, often, that he is loved. I am an obligation he has, so often my mere existence is percieved is burdensome. So I remind him regularly that I love him, and every time it's like it's the first time he's felt loved. He only has brief moments when he realizes the value of a good partnership. The rest of the time his head is buried under a constant inflow of obligations -- most of which he creates himself.

He has other perspectives that keep him up. He enjoys meeting good, smart, hard working people and networking with them so he can fantasize about a future where he works with them all on a new company he creates. That's a good perspective.

My father-in-law is a perfect case study on how perspective on life can destroy your mental health. He believes in a strict system. Men are served by their wives. Men die young so they're never alone. A man's children, especially his daughter-in-laws, will serve him if his wife cannot. This perspective is consuming him into a black hole. He doesn't have any of it. He's so angry at me that I can't serve him to his high expectations that it's destroyed our relationship. One son, the golden child, has abandoned him. The other son, my husband, his scapegoat, is the only family member left to dote on him. But since that son is the scapegoat, everything he does isn't good enough. He feels *everyone else* is negligent in their duties to serve him. And his constant disappointment continuously pulls my husband down to firmly keep him in the realm of depression.

My husband believes that he *must* earn his father's respect. He believes if he just works harder he can get his respect. But his father will never respect him because he only views my husband through the perspective of being the scapegoat. His brother is still viewed as the golden child by his father, despite that he communicates with him just once a year. My husband can't see that it is impossible to earn his father's respect. He can't let go this perspective of life that he must earn his father's respect.

I feel changing my perspective has been a life saver. I've basically just... let go. I've let go of any expectations. I've let go any want of possessions. I've let go social standing. I've let it all go. I just float in the river and appreciate whatever it is that comes my way.

I've let go of any perspective that could pull me down.

This is not to say that *perspective* is the only thing one needs to fix their mental health. There's still other work to be done, and hell, work to maintain the new perspective. But it seems, at the very least in the case studies I am observing, that perspective is the cause of their problems.

I still suffer anxiety, explosive emotions, fear rejection, and risk so easily dipping into depression over the smallest thing. My husband is a huge vibrating ball of anxiety. My father-in-law is deeply insecure and self centered. Even my grandmother isn't freed because of her perspective, she has severe black and white thinking, golden/scapegoat child issues, and very likely avoidant personality disorder.

I guess with my grandmother and I, even though we still suffer mental health issues, it's easier to stay out of the goo of depression. My husband barely realizes that there is a possibility to get out of that goo, and his father is just rolling around wallowing in it.

Then comes the next part of this exploration: how do you help someone to change their perspective?

Oh god I wish I knew. I wish oh so wish I could help my husband. Unfortunately, my change in perspective moved faster than he could keep up so I've left him behind in terms of our mental health. It pains me so much to see his suffering. I wish there was something I could grab hold of and turn so his perspective contained more light than darkness.

And for goodness sake do I wish I could completely abolish my father-in-law's perspective of a sex-based caste system. I wish I could shatter that perspective to pieces. Then maybe he'll see he has to dig his own way out of his hole. As someone once described it, ""His son has jumped into the goo with him to help pull him out, but he is angrily pushing his son away because he expects to be pulled out by a first class helicopter with a shower, fresh clothes, and a gourmet meal."" Yup. My father-in-law definitely needs to let go of that perspective.

I wish I knew how to help someone change perspective. How do I put that thought in their head? That inception. 

The only thing I know that I can do is stay away from my father-in-law and push my husband towards professional help.",mentalhealth,Thoughts on how perspective effects our mental health and wondering how to change perspective,2019-01-07 11:48:22

After a 7 year relationship ending things took a turn for the worse and I ended up in a psychiatric unit due to concerns about my suicidal plans.

One of the things that was keeping me going was a girl I met on the psychiatric ward and we started a sort of relationship.

However she has decided (I think upon advice of the nurses/ doctor) that neither of us are mentally well enough to build a healthy relationship together.

Deep down I know this is probably the case.

But it just leaves me feeling empty again. I don't really know who I am without being emotionally involved with someone else (I think this is why they have diagnosed me with emotionally unstable personality disorder).

2460,throw_altaway,1546820236,1,"Hey there!

I'll start off with quoting a post of mine from 5 months ago in /r/offmychest:

&gt;Hey there!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It's weird to write this post.  
&gt;  
&gt;I  just happen to mostly spend my time here on reddit or some other sites like YouTube or keeping reloading news sites for more content, listening  to music. (Or you know, pleasure time.)  
&gt;  
&gt;I wake up, browse some reddit, wait for the day to go on, keeping procrastinating while browsing the internet.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's  just the same day in, day out. I feel like I am wasting my time. What's  even weirder is the fact that my mind does not really want me to play  (singleplayer) games, since they are in fact very time consuming and  feel like ""a concentrated effort and commitment to waste X amount of  time"", but on the other side I don't even want to waste it so I cannot  even wholly enjoy spending my time there. Although when I count together  the hours I've wasted so far here on reddit I could've played a lot of  games without really getting less from it. (Playing multiplayer games  with people I know is fun and fine in this regard however).  
&gt;  
&gt;I  am studying computer science and could learn something new every day. I  could spend hours and hours on programming projects like some years  ago, I could schedule some time for learning for my exams (which I  always start way too late, but unfortunately it so far also works out  really well nonetheless).  
&gt;  
&gt;I got stuff to  do, I need to clean my room, I need to learn for a subject (maths) in 2  months, I'll ideally very soon (this/next week) need to start on  deciding on my topic for my bachelor thesis, which will probably be  something which is almost complete new territory for me and will require  a lot of effort without knowing beforehand how well I will be able to  consume all this new knowledge, whilst knowing that I have previously  done so successfully in the past.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead  I am here, procrastinating, waiting for the day to go over and wait for  tomorrow to magically change. For that sudden energy and motivation  boost. Right now my brain does not even want to be bothered with  challenging and/or new stuff.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, this  feeling comes in waves. There are periods of days or weeks where I feel  rather like shit with some wasted potential, feeling behind, feeling  like I just don't even know anything and wondering how my past me always  surprises me by what it has achieved in the past, and also in the  recent past, but it just feels so unreal; and there are periods where I  feel content, super happy and pleased with my life, looking back at  previous achievements and how positive other people perceive me and how  in the general sense life is going great (studies are going great, I  have a nice future ahead of me, I am healthy, my parents, grandparents,  brothers &amp; everyone else are alive).  
&gt;  
&gt;And  still there are days like today where I just want them to be over, so  that the days can come again where I am productive, working towards a  goal and feeling good again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whatever, this is something I needed to get off my chest. (It got quite a wall of text suddenly.)  
&gt;  
&gt;I know this is not permanent, but I also know that it's very real right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;I  appreciate any replies from you. Maybe from people who were in a  similar situation once and got out of it, maybe from people who are  still experiencing a similar feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

I just reread this today and it's as real as ever, with every sentence hitting the nail on the head.

I still haven't really began diving into the topic of my bachelor thesis (hoping to start within the next few days) and I've skipped writing the math exam last year - now I plan on writing it on January 29th (hoping to start learning within the next few days, too).

I've got asked to (re-)participate in a side project (not related to my studies) in November, agreed to put 1-2 hours of work in per day (on a voluntary basis) after vacation at the end of November, had troubles to really start working on it (like understanding the framework we use), then here and there I got interrupted with some things, and as days passed and guilt rose up I've consciously avoided booting up Discord again to avoid confrontation since December. The project originally started last year for a short amount of time but was laid on ice first, and even in this period I was slow to get started. The project leader is really someone I look up to as a person (he is great socially and skill-wise), and it feels miserable to disappoint him in such a way (again). I just don't know how to get out of this situation - I'd like to participate, but just don't feel like I am mentally capable of because of all the reasons mentioned in this post, and at this point I cannot imagine of what he might think of me since I've left him (and the others) in the dark since December, like I just disappeared from earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Subconsciously my mind is getting packed with guilt of not getting my shit done (and on time), having a feeling of despair at times on how this could ever change.

&amp;#x200B;

I figure I have a hard time dedicating a block of time to a specific cause, probably because my subconscious mind  goes like this: 

*""Do you really want to commit X hours into doing XYZ? You have other stuff to do, too. If you focus your time on doing XYZ now, this time is not being spent on ZYX. Soooo.... let's wait for the day to go over and wanna restart tomorrow again?""* 

While I fully know that this kind of logic makes absolutely no sense, it seems to be somewhat accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I've got a huge procrastination problem and it drives me nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried reading up on meditation and mindfulness. I realize I just need to start. However when it comes to actually acting on that, I fail. I've got the skills, I've got the time, yet I fail.

&amp;#x200B;

Just needed to get his off my chest, sorry for the wall of text.

2462,allthecrack,1546818558,1,"So I am recently married (Me F24/Wife F/23) only within the last two months; my wife, my marriage and my love for her is the only thing that keeps me going each day. We have an amazing relationship, and can laugh and joke about anything. She literally is my best friend and the reason I get up each day.

I have a very large, and close family, who are there at the drop of a hat for anything anyone does; no questions asked. 

My sister was my best friend before my wife, she was my confidant, my closest friend and my most important person (before she had her own boyfriend and I met my wife, and we both grew up). These days I struggle to even talk to her about anything that is absolutely necessary.

At the minute and for a long time I have struggled with forming any kind of relationships, I am still beyond belief I managed to meet and marry my wife (she really is a saint for seeing beyond my problems). I have been diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety since 2014 and have been on various medications, all which have not worked for me. I was previously referred to a specialist but was never given the appointment. 

Since meeting my wife I have had a much better outlook on life and have made major improvements in my life and thoughts. But this isn’t the first time throughout our relationship that I have felt the worst, the lowest, the upmost useless person in society and whatever she says to console me I cannot help but feel these things. I feel awful for making her think that she cannot help me, and awful for making her feel like she isn’t good enough to help.

I can’t find the help I am looking for from my GP or counsellor and so I have decided to reach out to the Reddit community for some advice on how to deal with this before I ruin my life, my marriage and the woman I hold most dear to my heart. 

I don’t want pity, I am only seeking some advice I have not previously been given through medical help. Anything would be helpful because these bad thoughts are becoming far too frequent for someone who has a ‘nice’ life with the people they love.

2466,BettyRubbles,1546816558,1,"I have a 28 (F) daughter that has been exhibiting signs of mental heath illness for about two years now, maybe longer but she has not  lived with me between the ages of 17-24. She appears to have characteristics of bipolar, BPD or simply narcissist traits  (Google, diagnosed).

Let me sum up the last year.  She broke up with a boyfriend of 10 years. She ended ALL friendships: childhood, high school, college and co workers.  She’s described as being mean and nasty by friends.  She says and does  such hurtful things not only does she burn bridges emotionally she torches them. She expresses little remorse over friendships lost other than to say she’s lonely. Damaged relationship with siblings too. She smokes pots daily, numerous times a day. 

After the break up she moved into her own place and spiraled into drug use. Tried rehab for a week. Detoxed and has stayed off them. She raged at rehab on the eight day she left got on a plane ( no money from us) came home. Rehab director described her as one of the rudest clients she’s come across in a lifetime of working with addicts.  

A year after the break up she began on  weekends obsessively calling the ex and his family, friends  and acquaintances. Yelling  expletive laced demands, wanting him back.  Explosive anger a frequent occurrence, we the parents get the brunt of it.  Walking on eggshells for a trigger can be??? Sees  a psychiatrist (infrequently) to get Lexapro but does not share events, what she’s feeling or her behavior. So basically she self medicates by omitting.  

She continues to live from bouts to bouts of explosive anger. Arrested for assault, Baker Acted by the police for acting erratic. (Baker Act,"" allows the involuntary institutionalization and examination of an individual.) She’s convincing after a brief discussion with the psychiatrist, Baker Act is lifted. Self harms, cuts and picks. She works but has left two jobs without notice in the last year. We believe she’s about to get fired from her current job. 

Her rage is directed at me but I have disengage so as to not trigger now her anger is focused on her father.  She lives with us but spends most of the time locked in her room. Watches horror movies, smoking pot.  Sometimes after smoking she rages at what appears to be the slightest trigger. I think there’s a correlation between the pot &amp; rage. Also on Lexapro and to be honest when she started Lexapro it’s when the shit show debuts. She says she needs Lexapro for anxiety and depression.  

Rage, impulsivity poor financial decisions, ending friendships, blaming us-her parents for pretty much everything including climate change. She’s been living with us for a year we’ve done all we can to be supportive, loving, caring, financial support any limits or boundaries set we get crossed, ignored. Has caused significant property damage. 

Her life is spiraling, continues to call her ex, his friends so many times a day it is disruptive. Restraining order pending. 

We are blamed as her parents for not stopping her destructive behavior. We continue to  encourage Psychologist, psychiatrist, requested  friend support  talk to her family.  We’ve supported her financially when she lost her job. It’s taken it’s toll on us emotionally physically, financially, our saves retirement funds are depleted.  When she was hospitalized they did a drug screen.  No drugs found except pot. All that’s left is to evict her.  I am afraid she’ll end up homeless, jailed or dead. 

How do you help an adult with mental illness that refuses help. Watching her suffer is anguish, knowing that she is in that much pain is devastating.

I just got out of a episode of sorts.

I didn't really self harm at all. I was feeling down and of course started to break down. I cried hard, and then the disassociation kicked in stopping me. Those who do not know, when I disassociate, which also am not 100% that is actually what's happening, I stop completely. I stop thinking, moving, breathing, blinking, everything just comes to a halt.

But during this disassociation I started shaking as if about to have a panic attack. I try to snap out of it, but I started feeling heavy, like I had weights on me. I managed to slap myself while turning over onto my back, which probably looked weird. But that caused me to stop all over again. After a moment I tried to get up but the heaviness kept me down, all the while still fighting this disassociation attack. I manage to sit up but I felt the shaking coming back. Still sitting there disassociating I imagined someone coming over to me and shaking my head to help me snap out of it.

When suddenly my head shakes side to side and I fall back onto my back and into another smaller breakdown. Except this time I started strangling myself. I do not think it was intended to be of harm more so to shock my body out of what ever was going on.

2472,latt_qcd92,1546813795,1,"TL;DR  I find women my age physically attractive, but I'm not drawn towards them and can't find myself connecting with them on an emotional/psychological level. I'm only drawn towards someone that resembles a character from an anime I watched when I was 15 who's a shy but sweet high school student (Nagisa Furukawa) and that's the only reason I'm interested in women, even today. I still want to experience all of the things that you would in a sweet, innocent, first relationship as young people rather than behaving like some experienced charmer in his late 20's for a ""first"" relationship. I'm torn between waiting for such a ""unicorn"" or just giving up on dating entirely and find some way to cope with being alone. (I apologize for this being so long and understand if you don't read the whole thing)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's really difficult for me to explain this well, but it's as though my emotional/psychological needs that I have in relation to a partner and the romantic things that I want to experience are still like those that I felt as a teen even though I'm in my late 20's, now. Because of this, I don't really find myself emotionally connecting with women my age. I do find women around my age physically attractive, but I'm just not drawn to them. It's like I wanted to experience all of the things that you imagine teenagers experience in high school with their first relationship (being shy when holding hands for the first time, etc.) but, instead, I'm now in my late 20's and the sort of relationship that people have in their late 20's or early 30's is vastly different and the experiences are for people who have already gone through the awkwardness of high school love and grown up after that. I imagine that people in their late 20's or 30's, to be romantic, would go to a fancy restaurant -- or the guy would make dinner at home -- and there would be witty banter, bottles of wine/campaign, some slow jazz playing, etc. -- something really classy. While I wouldn't mind that eventually, it's as though my mind wants me to ""start at the beginning"" since I never really experienced all of those things in my teens when it came to the very beginnings of relationships (yes, if you haven't guessed already, I'm still a virgin). 

&amp;#x200B;

To me, I want to be able to just do simple things like go to a movie while being all shy holding hands, etc.; what you might imagine a first relationship between young people when they have no relationship experience and she's particularly shy. I don't want to ""start"" at what people are doing in their late 20's and early 30's. It's as though my mind wants me to do things ""in order"" and, as such, I'm finding that I'm just not connecting with women my age emotionally/psychologically. I'm not at all saying that I want to date an actual teen as I'm not interested in the slightest. It's just that something is wrong with my emotional/psychological needs and attraction and I don't know what. Guys my age are more ""competitive"", ""assertive"", ""witty"", etc. when it comes to attracting a partner -- typically more ""mature"" women --, but I just want something sweet and innocent. I feel like women are expecting the former, though, of someone my age rather than the latter and me desiring the latter I feel like turns most women off. I suspect this is because such relationships are seen as stuff for young people rather than grown adults. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's sort of like, I'm only attracted to women that are, on the outside closer to my own age, but, on the inside, -- and only in certain ways -- they're still much younger. It's a kind of a ""relationship immaturity"" that's sort of like ""innocence"" or lack of any real relationship experience rather than being ""immature"" in the sense that it's usually used when referring to the negative attributes attached to being younger. (e.g. her stuttering a little when she asks if it's okay to hold your hand rather than her acting like an idiot with her female friends.) 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background might help. When I was younger, like most boys my age, I wasn't attracted at all to women and even by around 12 years old, I still was sort of passive towards them. It wasn't until I was around 15 or so that I changed, but the reason I changed my opinions was because of an anime (Japanese ""cartoons"" for those unfamiliar) called ""Clannad"" that had a certain female character -- Nagisa Furukawa -- that caught my attention. It was the first time that I was really drawn towards women, even though she isn't real, and since then has been the only thing keeping me drawn towards women. She was, among many other things, shy, inexperienced when it came to relationships, sometimes a little naive due to her trusting nature, and, at her core, she was a kind soul who always saw the good in others. In other words, this character became a sort of archetypal figure that embodied what relationships could look like when I was a teen and it generated the desire that I have towards women because of that character. My desire with women has become, in a sense, inextricably linked with this character. Almost all of my choices in life and all of my creative energy in my goals and passions has come from a hope of finding such a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not so much that this character became my ""ideal"" and that I'm currently just looking for my ""ideal"" and simply need to settle for less than my ""ideal""; instead, this character is the only reason I'm attracted to women -- one could argue that this is simply semantics, however. As far as my emotional/psychological needs in relation to relationships go, I want to be able to experience a first relationship with someone like her and be able to grow until, once we're old enough -- even though I'm already old enough -- then start with the romantic things that better reflect my age. When I was that age, I wanted to find someone like that and ""grow up together"" as people maturing into adulthood and then move on to the things that one does in their late 20's early 30's as couples. My mind, as far as relationships go, is still there and I haven't been able to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to get past this or if I even can. My only two options that I can think of are either keep waiting until I find this ""unicorn"" or just give up on relationships completely. Thanks a lot for reading this if you've made it this far. ",mentalhealth,"I'm a man in my late 20's, but I feel like mentally I'm stuck in my teens as far as relationships go",2019-01-07 09:29:55

I dont know I have been taking the medication for ocd for 6 weeks and havent really noticed much difference.. I might not even have ocd I feel like I have alot of psychotic tendencies I had a few psychotic episodes too if I get really depressed or angry anxious I start to lose control. Like yesterday for example I got stuck on a thought that caused me to become angry for example and then I started to hallucinate someone a puppet dancing on the wall,I also saw someone starring at me when I was looking at my neighbors window,I felt like my brain was on autopilot,like I kind of was aware but not in control of what I was thinking.I just kept pacing around,blurting things out and acting very paranoid.every sound startled me.the night before I was convinced there were aliens watching me.I always feel like im watched when im home alone.I get paranoid thinking that ghosts will come after me in my dreams and these legends or something will get me.I also always fantasize over violence it seems and talk to myself and pretend im talking to others or I feel like im talking to others.I think im psychotic,Im going back to the psychologist or whatever on the 9th I think.I also hallucionate pretty often like see things run across the field of vision or I will see a plant and then I will mistake it for something else.I have trouble telling whats real and fake.I Can still be fairly normal around people and feel normal emotions and make friends and such but its really hard with my brain like this.sometimes I hear voices in my head telling me im worthless ,that usually happens before a psychotic break.I feel alone and [scared](https://scared.my/) .

2476,Hopeful_Lingonberry,1546813103,1,"Hey guys, just need somewhere to vent cause I don't have anyone to talk to. 

My (27M) brother (22M) suffers from bad OCD which is accompanied by depression and anxiety. We grew up in a dysfunctional family where our parents screamed and threw shit at each other on a nearly daily basis. My brother was the youngest and seemed to be the most affected by this. 

Fast forward to today and my parents are thankfully split up and my brother lives with my mother. My mother is a kind person at heart but is utterly horrible in stressful situations and her default is to revert to screaming under pressure. Anyway, my brother abuses marijuana and alcohol regularly and generally spends his entire day laying in bed with occasional gaming mixed in. This is obviously extremely unhealthy but has been going on for years and he refuses to help himself. My mother lacks the strength of will to make him do anything and he refuses to interact with my father who will demand he do things like get a job. There have been a few times where we have got him to start a job or to start college but every time he just lies about going to class or the job until he has some sort of breakdown, says he can't do it, and the cycle continues. He is very manipulative. For example he will threaten suicide to my mom but the few times she's called the police and had him taken to the hospital, he will maintain an incredibly straight face and claim he never said any of things to the medical professionals. 

So he scheduled to start school and move into the dorms again a week from today which I guess is triggering all of his anxieties. Today I woke up to a dramatic call from my mom (a regular thing) about how he was hungover and was being verbally abusive to her. She started blaming me for not doing enough to help and she is partially right. She wants me to be a sort of father figure since my dad is out of the picture. This is problematic though because I also want to just be his friend and support him and he resents me when I try to tell him to get shit together.

This is mostly just venting but I guess what I am wondering is how do you approach this? What is the proper blend of sympathy for my brothers problems and not just letting him walk over us whenever he has to do anything?

Shes been on leave for 2 and a half weeks now and has clearly missed at least one injection. She takes them every 2 weeks. I need to convince her to go back on the meds!

I personally believe shes been off the meds for a month but i didn't have enough proof until 45 minutes ago. My aunt told me shes been stalking her ex. (Im going to explain that in the paragraph below)
So she had a full mental breakdown when i was 15/16 and it was awful! Talking to herself for hours, not bathing, believing people were in the ceiling, we slept in the car for 3 nights and much more but the WORST thing she did was psychotically stalk her ex that she dated when i was 6. It had been 10 years and she drove 7 hours to a different province, drove to his work in pajamas and barefooted and demanded to see him. Luckily not dragging me along. My aunt took me in 6 months before that and made my life happy. I finally had a normal home. I'm now staying with her for a bit before i start uni in 2 weeks. 

I need her to take her meds, things are getting bad again. She's stalking the same ex and contacting him. He now has a wife and child and last time she rocked up in PJ's he threatened to throw her in jail.

2485,icecoldcokezero,1546808283,1,"Eight years ago, i was diagnosed with chronic anxiety. That time, i shrugged it off thinking, ""hey, this is normal, right? Everyone gets anxious sometimes. This will go away, right?"" Wrong. Here i am, eight years later, cringing at past me for even thinking that anxiety goes away like a seasonal flu.

I spent some time going through therapy sessions, and while those helped, they didnt really cure me of my anxiety*, because for people like me, anxiety is ever-present -- an annoying, unwanted companion i am eternally cuffed with.

I struggled battling anxiety for a long time. It was hard to be a fully-functional human when every speedbump looked like a giant boulder in the middle of the road. Instead of looking for ways around it, my focus was on the speedbump-boulder and how impossible it was to conquer it. Anxiety paralyzed me and made me feel like i was always bound to fail.

The smallest tasks would sometimes trigger anxiety and panic. I would cross the road planning my funeral because what if the bus hits me? I would get invited to parties, and yes i craved to socialize, but i would bail because what if i spill the drink and make a mess of myself? Public speaking was the worst subject ever, because that triggered so much what-ifs. I was sweating with just the thought of mispronouncing words and forgetting my lines. There were days when i thought i was perfectly fine, then i would be attacked by constant panic and pressure that took away my ability to function, and i would shut myself in, because anxiety was crippling that way.

I quit a lot of things in my life -- school, jobs, relationships -- some, i didnt even get to start, all because i worried i wasnt good enough. I was scared of taking a course i wanted because what if i couldnt find a job after i graduated? I couldnt take these programs because what if i fail them and i had to retake them? I resigned from my teaching job because i feared no one would take my subjects the following year, that i might not be a good enough instructor. I was scared to build relationships and would stop talking to people i really liked or wanted to be friends with, because what if they dont understand me?

Because that was what i felt, that no one understood me. I craved validation and support, but instead, some of the people i cared about left me for being ""over-dramatic"" and a ""cry-baby,"" only because they didnt understand what i was going through. Well, same. How could i blame them when i myself couldnt understand it?

After years of battling anxiety, i got fed up with it and i internally told it to fuck off. It didnt. But i knew i had to do something about it, or else, i wouldnt be able to really live. I knew that there was only so much i could do to help myself. So i did. I read self-help books, which, if i would be honest, really didnt help that much because they all say the same things i already knew (still good reminders, though). I started reaching out to my fellow anxious people and asked for advice, because, you know, it takes one to know one, and they were the best people to talk to if i wanted to really get myself. Little by little, i gained confidence about who i was and what i was capable of. It took years and a lot of hard work, but i learned so much, and i couldnt be any more thankful to the people who helped me and made me feel a little better about myself.

Fast forward to a few years later. I cant say that i dont get anxious anymore. After all, anxiety is already a big chunk of who i am. Maybe i just learned a few tricks to manage it somehow. Or maybe it just doesnt scare me as much as it did before.

The fact is, there is no one-size-fits-all approach in managing anxiety. Some people fight their anxiety. Some people try to ignore it. If it works for you, then it must be for you. But if there's one thing i realized for myself, it's that fighting my anxiety is a losing battle, so i embrace it instead. I take a break. I breathe. I ground myself to my surroundings. This way, i know that i have control of the environment im in. I recognize the situation and try as much as possible to think logically. I acknowledge the facts, and while i cant really do anything about my emotions, i talk about the situation to the people who care to listen. If im alone, i express what upsets me through writing. I walk. I go for a run. Not to try to escape the situation, but to shake off the excess nerves. I look back to what makes me anxious and assess what i can do about it. If i need to take a break and feel the emotions as they happen, i allow myself a few hours, or maybe a few days to let it run its course. I think to myself, ""it will pass."" It always does.

To my fellow anxious people, you got this. It is a hard road, and you may sometimes feel alone, but youre not. Be kind to yourselves. If you need to cry, do it. If you need to rest, take as much break as you need. If it's too much to bear alone, seek help.

To everyone else, anxiety thrives in a person's inability to take control of a situation. When someone feels lost, it is important that they feel secured, heard, and validated. This is why it is important to show kindness and compassion to everyone.

About two months ago I started having extreme feelings of agitation and sadness as well as sometimes just euphoria. I didn’t think much of it at the time but then it started to get in the way of relationships with friends and family. There are times when my friends do the smallest things and I yell at them. I just become so agitated. There are other times where I become so moody that I cant even engage in conversation or hang out with my friends.  My grades in school have dropped because its impossible for me to focus at times. The work has always been pretty easy for me, as i’ve always had above a 95 average but now they’re slipping far. My therapist recently recommended to see a psychiatrist for possible medication but im not sure what for. It’s extremely hard to confide in anyone, especially my family even though I’ve always had a good relationship with them. In some times of just extreme moodiness I’ve resorted to cutting and sometimes alcohol. It’s also extremely hard to confide in friends as it seems they don’t actually care. Every once in a while i’ll confide something small to them or they’ll ask how I’m feeling, usually when I cant even engage in conversation with them. When they do ask, I can’t tell them as I’ve become extremely paranoid and suspicious about their motives for asking. My brain keeps telling me they’re only asking so they can make fun of you and if you tell them then they won’t ever want to hang out with you anymore. This paranoia and suspicion has also translated to school where when somebody talks to me im just picturing the worst possible thing that could happen so I get visibly annoyed with them and less people talk to me. I’ve also just acted on impulse so much more recently even when it’s very risky. I recently went to a party with my friends and a bunch of random people. I just remember I was acting very crazy. I bruised my hands very badly, and I remember I very touchy with my recent ex. One girl I have always known from elementary school, not my ex, was there and I have always known she is a pretty toxic and unhealthy person. At one point I just became extremely moody and she noticed and was asking what was wrong. As soon as she seemed to care about how I was feeling I kind of formed an unhealthy attachment to her and I almost stayed at her house for the night. During that night I also confronted a bunch of old friends that were assholes and even got mad at my friends for not seeming to care. I was just incredibly aggressive that night and it seemed this one, almost random girl, cared about me more than my friends for multiple years.

2489,princeyes,1546806152,1,"(kinda long, tl;dr at the end) 

I’ve been in therapy and on medication for about two and a half years. I’ve been a plethora of ssri’s (like a lot) and currently take 10mg Buspar 3 times a day. These work for a while (maybe placebo, idk), coupled with slight nausea and/or little to no sex drive, then i realize that it’s not helping my symptoms at all and just stop. I don’t expect it to be a cure-all and fix my problems right away, I know I have to put in the work as well. Which imo I think has sorta worked a bit, I went into therapy for the first time as I got out of the ER for an attempt at suicide. Now the suicidal ideation is less...prominent? My main issue is just learning how to function without freaking out at everything. It’s still hard working through things because stuff keeps coming up and I assume the things I do aren’t really that big of a deal (ex: certain senses make me beyond angry/stressed, like fabric rustling, people expressing strong emotion, laughter) and I get put on yet another medication i’ll trick myself into thinking will at least relieve me of SOME things until something else comes up. It just makes me question myself sometimes. 

Like, is any of this worth it if things keep changing? Should I just assume whatever new thing comes up is my anxiety and not say anything about it to my therapist? I’m too scared to tell my doctor the meds aren’t working again, she told me last time “I know you smoke weed, I’m trying to make sure you don’t get hooked on anything so i’m just gonna up your dose.” Yes, I do smoke weed and vape but it’s more out of wanting to occupy my brain with something other than all these things going on in the world. 
Also, yes, i am a teenager and my doctor has known me since I was an infant and I know she has my best interest in mind. But I feel that I am much too overwhelmed and just wanna give up. 

A couple months ago I stopped disassociating during panic attacks, and I thought I was finally doing right. Clearly not, since with everything that I’m able to overcome even more things show up in its place. I’m exhausted, I spend 90% of my day trying to hold myself together and not breaking down. like, all of a sudden I sometimes can’t remember simple information, like my own fucking address, my own name, the way home etc. I’m on the verge of crying every time i’m out in public because of the slightest noises, and all the senses I have to take in. I can barely hold a conversation because I can’t seem to comprehend what people are saying. It’s like my brain isn’t processing anything but at the same time it’s processing literally everything. I feel like i’m going insane. These are are new things that came up a long while ago and I’ve just given up telling my therapist anything because I feel like i’m just wasting her time by only getting worse and not showing any improvement. I genuinely try really hard to manage myself but i’m honestly down to my last straws rn. 

I know this is bad, but I don’t know what else to do other than to fill this hole of distress and confusion with substances in order to bring me back down to Earth. It’s the only thing keeping me from doing something bad again is a hit, a bump, a smoke, a sip...absolutely anything that’ll make me feel something other than what i’ve been feeling. Nothing gives me happiness. I used to do art every day, I used to write, and hang out with my siblings, I used to be okay. It feels like everything I do is in vain, what’s the point of getting help when it only ever gets worse and the only thing that’s happening is me losing more and more pieces of who I am. 

I’m holding on because as shitty of a sister I am, I can’t leave my siblings with my parents. My dad’s got Bipolar II, and doesn’t take his medication. My mom won’t leave him no matter how much he hurts her or us. Every other day there’s a screaming fight at 3am. It’s me, who’s probably having a panic attack, that has to calm the crying children down. I can’t leave them, but I don’t know how much more longer I can continue trying to keep it together. I desperately need to figure out something before I do something i’ll regret. Please help. 

If you read all the way to the end, thank you I really genuinely appreciate it. i’m sorry it’s so long hhh. Also, theres something slightly comforting about letting out all my emotions and reading all of your stories on this subreddit. 

TL;DR : treatment (2 1/2 years of therapy, failed trial an error with many other medications &amp; currently 10mg Buspar 3x daily) seemingly isn’t helping me, if anything i’m getting worse. new symptoms/things keep showing up and making everything a whole lot more difficult. i don’t want to tell my therapist because it would waste her time because i’m not getting any better. i feel like i’m going insane. simply existing gets more overwhelming. need help.

2490,iamanxiouslol,1546805744,1,"Everyone calls me motivated. Which is true, to an extent. And I always joke that I have a ‘fear of failure’ to my friends, and not a huge amount of motivation.

Which now I realize is probably true.

For a little bit of background I’m taking the Full IB program (which if you know about it, is hell) and with the added course load of an online course (didn’t fit in my schedule so I decided that suffering was the only option :)) + extra curricular guac

I finish things really fast when given - like really really fast. I have went two days without eating or drinking solely because I wanted to finish the project the week it was given (even if it was due in, like, two months).

There’s also my utterly stupidly high expectations for my grades. I have post test anxiety and text anxiety. I have gone to tests and have basically just stared at the front page for twenty minutes because I’m afraid of the outcome. Afraid that even if I spent like 5 hours studying it wasn’t enough. I also literally get nightmares after taking a test about failing it, etc. Pretty neat.

And when I don’t do things up to my expectations - I am literally ruined. I don’t like, break out into tears usually but I just feel grief?? Like just so much disappointment for myself to the point that I feel ‘depressed’ almost? And then after all of it I sometimes break down. But it’s not even- like breaking down when you get a 52 is obviously reasonable but these aren’t even BAD grades, like is my brain??? Okay. And when this is happening I REALIZE it?? Like I know it’s so stupid that I’m literally fine but I just can’t stop it?

This isn’t even because of anyone else’s expectation either ? My parents don’t even look at my report cards. 

They also don’t believe in therapy hahahaha so I’m here. 

I have, basically, the opposite of procrastination syndrome and it’s ruining me. I went through google- which isn’t the best thing ever, and really genuinely thing this is some obsessive disorder. I can’t even watch Netflix because I constantly think I have something to do- and if there isn’t anything given I have to go ahead in my classes or practice music or anything. I have so much anxiety.

Actually, this is my fist time trying to describe what I’m feeling because I really don’t know what to do anymore. I have to reach out to somebody even if that someone is a total stranger on the internet.

I’m 25-year-old female and I think I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for a very long time, actually for years now but I’ve never been brave enough to talk to someone, not even my parents or close friends. I keep everything bottled up an I’ve managed so far, but honestly I’m exhausted, and I don’t know what to do anymore because going to psychiatrist or talking to anyone petrifies me. I always thought my problems are not important, I have low self-esteem, feel hopeless and worthless, generally I never really liked myself. However, I never experienced any big trauma, I grew up with both parents, mind they always fought and now they are finally divorced, but generally I had a normal childhood, I was never molested or anything like that. That’s why I feel like I’m making this all up, or that my problems are not as serious when compared to other people, so I feel guilty for even thinking I need help. Actually, I feel guilty almost all the time. I’m still at university even though I should have graduated a long time ago. I procrastinate all the time, even now I should be studying instead of writing this bullshit, but I just can’t make myself. I have trouble sleeping because I can’t switch off my mind, I feel anxious all the time, I can’t stop crying usually for no reason, can’t concentrate and constantly push people away. I constantly feel guilty because of this and I just want to lay in bed and cry, which is what I do most of the time until the very last second when I have to do some work.

I’ve been feeling like this literally for years and it became normal, but I know it’s not, I shouldn’t be feeling like this, but I feel like it too late now, I just feel trapped. I’m so scared of seeking help, also I don’t really have time to afford therapy because of uni, so I just don’t know what to do, but I know I can’t live like this anymore.

To explain things as shortly as possible this disorder is created because of trauma so the personality splits in ""alters"", you can check more information for that.
My problem here is that there is a new personality,  unlike the others this one doesn't know what he or she looks like, doesn't know it's gender or name at all, doesn't know anything so I gave him a list of names I found online, unisex names and it chose the name of Pragun, apart form this one there's others that I met, those being Sebastian and Samantha, Sebastian isn't really the good type but Sam is. Usually they find themselves in a room waiting on a chair or something like that to take turns, this new personality went there and saw a broken chair, Sebastian ( or so I think it was him) standing there with the light above him.
What I want to know is how to find ""the original"" aka my boyfriend, how to bring him back and teach this personality how to be able to switch as the others.

One of the things I've learned from my therapy is that I have this tendency where things are either shit or wonderful and there's usually no grey area. I also have this tendency to put a lot of pressure on meeting new people. I feel disconnected a lot of the time even though I have some close friends and I've also split myself between having this Hollywood fantasy of meeting someone in real life who will sweep me off my feet and this perverse fantasy of being with someone I shouldn't be with (someone attached with a bf/gf/husband/wife and straight/bi and well hung). These two visions naturally conflict with each other. And then fundamentally I am just scared to be hurt and make myself available to people who can hurt me. I am scared to be openly gay, to ask out cute guys I see on the street, to figure out what a date looks like, to try and meet someone in real life and not just having sex and casual encounters with guys I meet on apps.

I've set myself a goal of improving my mental health this year which towards the later part of the year has dropped for various reasons.

I've previously tried a technique to help with my anxiety where I think about the thing that is worrying me, take a deep breath, let it go and move on which has turned into a habit of constantly going over that thing, overthinking about it and then beating myself up for it whether it's something that has happened in the past or something thats more recent even if I haven't done anything wrong. I'm starting to feel fed up, tired and like i'm losing the motivation and interest I had for the things I love doing in my spare time. I don't want to keep second guessing myself, the way I feel and the way I think about things. I

Does anyone have any tips on how I can get myself and my mental health back on track? currently i'm trying to get myself out of the mindset of thinking to myself or talking to myself about things, and to stop beating myself up for things. My plan alongside this is to start exercising more as well as be healthier and more productive. I'm hoping once I start getting all of these things started it'll all fall in place and my mental health will start to improve.

2519,notyourcoloringbook,1546776453,1,"Since finding this subreddit a couple days ago I have tried several times to post what I have been feeling. I can never seem to find the right words, but here goes. 

Outwardly, I’m a happy 26 year old lady. On the inside? That’s a different story. I’ve struggled with depression since I was 10 and anxiety decided to tag along once I hit about 14. I usually describe my battle with mental illness as being stuck down a ridge. I’ve been at the bottom, where it is so dark with no hope. But I managed to climb my way out. Sometimes I would have to take breaks as I climbed, so I would be stuck, just stuck to that cliff wall. Even at my healthiest I would only describe myself with my fingers on the top of the ridge, I can see the sun and I am SO CLOSE but I’m still struggling. 

Lately I can feel myself slipping back down. I look around and try to see the good. I have a family that loves me, friends that I adore, a boyfriend who is pretty great, I’m not starving, homeless, or diseased. But I still know I’m falling. I’m working a horrible job that is a result of my failures in life. The hours are horrible (weekend overnights, 12 hours), the conditions make me miserable (humidity free environment; it actually hurts to move my face my skin is so dry. And nose bleeds are a daily occurrence), and I never get to see my friends (I never realized how much I needed them until I was deprived of them). I’ve been looking for a new job since I’ve started, but no one seems to want me. The longer I work here, the more upset I get. I run to the bathroom and cry on all of my breaks, one of my managers described me as bubbly (the word was always used to describe me when I was at my worst but faking it SO hard, so that worries me), but the person I talk to the most at work says I look sad. He says I never smile or joke anymore.

2522,Generic_Scotsman,1546773413,1,"Pre story
Hi I'm a 19 year old university student who works in the army doing officer training part time. I broke up with my long term girlfriend in late August and that's where I started to develop mental health problems. Since then I didn't really attend uni didn't go to work with the OTC (army job) and drank too much etc. I met a girl who helped me out greatly who wanted a relationship with me and I didn't want one with her. I screwed up a couple times in interesting fashions and I nearly lost her entirely as a friend. She told me that she had a boyfriend now and then I realised I actually loved her. 

Recent story 
I signed up to do a camp away in the cold for 9 days on a military base, I'd been out of the OTC loop and was very stressed about making sure everything was perfect for when I got there. I cried a huge amount before the camps and on the day of the camp (departing 1800 hours) I self harmed in a variety of ways. I went to see my counselor straight afterwords and told him the details of what had happened. (I also have to attend this camp in order to catch up on stuff I've missed throughout the year) he told me that maybe being too busy to be sad and depressed would be good for me but maybe the stressful situations wouldn't be good for me either. I decided to attend and the girl I've been speaking of is also in attendance of the camp. Every time I saw her I wanted her to be mine and to sit with me and to hold my hand and hug etc were on different training programs so we didn't have alot of time together not that she was as invested into seeing me as I was into seeing her. I spoke to the staff on the camp about my lack of mental well-being (mostly about the self harm) and they agreed that it would be a problem throughout the camp but to see how it goes. First day of camp I have a couple meetings with the staff and I try to catch up on all the stuff I've missed but dont feel great at times but alright overall. I see the girl every so often and my mood plummets and I want to hurt myself. I ended up having a meeting mid day with two staff members about it which didn't achieve much but gave me the idea to ask the girl a question I already knew the answer too (but wished I didn't). I asked her if she wanted me to get over her and she said ""sorry but yes"" this made me incredibly sad and depressed and I went to the barracks crying in front of a peer. I found an empty room and called my ex and friends I talk to about this stuff and they didn't really help much. I texted a staff member saying I needed another meeting and we had another one where I said that I couldn't bear to be around this girl anymore cause of the emotions I feel when I see her. They needed other people to be there and chat to me so I talked to my ex on messenger while I was waiting. I told her I just didn't care anymore and that I just wanted to drink 6 pints and walk off a bridge. This was my first proper suicidal thought. I asked to be taken off the camp and there was a lot of kerfuffle over whether I'd be safe at home (in my flat) and the decision was made that if there wasn't someone there who could take care of me then it wasn't safe for me. I ended up being driven home to my parents by two staff members and that's where I am now.

2523,analcrong,1546772557,1,"Okay, before you tell me it's mental illness, *please* hear me out. I'm scared shitless right now and need someone to take me seriously.

I've been dealing with bipolar and mild psychosis without medication for a while. Any auditory hallucinations I experience are generally quiet and infrequent, most commonly whispering or a radio talk show. I'm honestly not even convinced my experiences with it are beyond what the normal person would hear while under stress. I'm arguably hypomanic at the moment, if that means anything. My insight is pretty good and I've never been hospitalized for anything other than depression.

About an hour ago, I was sitting downstairs on the couch in my living room with the TV on the background while I typed out some notes on my phone. Suddenly, from the kitchen, I heard the creaky voice of a *very* old woman say something about ""putting that thing back"" as loudly and clearly as if she were standing right there. It had a kind of distorted and fuzzy quality to it. Then another voice replied, clearer and younger-sounding, and they exchanged maybe three or so sentences each before disappearing. It honestly sounded like there were two women talking to each other right in my fucking kitchen at full speaking volume before evaporating into thin air.

I turned down the TV volume as it was happening and it didn't have any effect on the voices. I hit the rewind button on the remote and played the video back, but only the regular audio was there. I listened for any kind of movement in the house for a very long time, but there was nothing. I texted my grandmother (she lives with us) to ask if she'd been on the phone even though it was 4am. Her text tone went off in the kitchen, which made me think it was her phone that made that noise. It's the only semi-logical explanation. The voices sounded *way* too real to be imagined.

The thing is, that younger voice belonged to my grandmother, and I suspect that the older woman's belonged to my great grandmother who is hard of hearing. My grandmother wasn't standing in the kitchen making that call, so what the fuck did I hear? It wasn't her ringtone or her text tone, so was it some kind of future/past conversation she'd had/will have? I'm very seriously worried that this is an omen of her death. She's in fair enough health, but I have a very bad feeling about this occurrence and am actually a little nauseous over it.

My mom told me when I was a small child I would hit myself in the face and head to ""punish myself."" While that may not be all that unusual for kids to do, it is something I still suffer from. It it less about punishment and more about relief from the brain fire. 

Another symptom carried over from childhood is rocking/bouncing/rhythmic movement. As a kid I HAD to bounce in the car, I needed to slam my back against the back seat rhythmically. These days it takes the form of restless bouncing legs all day, even in bed, disguising rocking back and forth as bobbing to music, etc.

2529,lkpjho,1546757010,1,"Hi. I had a crazy worldview that acted as a crutch for getting through life. I recently started therapy which has let me see how crazy my ideas are. I am looking to replace my insanity with genuine philosophy and am looking for advice, thank you.

I am scared of being hurt, so I would isolate myself from others and I would treat myself badly and hate myself so no one could hurt me more than I hurt myself. I achieved this by believing that being a ""good"" person is a black and white concept where if you are not 100% good then you are 100% bad. Somehow this only applied to me and not others. I was raised by a dad who constantly used guilt trips to manipulate me to feeling bad and to doing things he wanted or to not question or judge him etc. So I hold high importance in not being bad, I am sick of being accused of being selfish and uncaring and bad. I defined being good as being caring. I defined being caring as helping others without gaining any self benefit in return, even including feeling good about helping others. Obviously it is impossible to do this.

So this impossible goal meant to me that I would always feel like a terrible, broken, bad, sociopathic person. I would try very hard to help others and try hard not to feel good about it, I would punish myself for being happy or feeling good. This belief makes me think I am so bad that I need to be totally away from others, totally isolated. I need to hurt myself, punish myself, etc. This all keeps me safe.

I know how crazy this all sounds but now through therapy showing me the ridiculousness of all this, I am left lost now on what the real method of being good is?

I want to know how I know if I am a ""good person"", what definitively makes me caring? I wish it was black and white but it probably isn't. If every human is only capable of self benefit, then what exactly determines which ones of us are selfish and good or selfish and bad? What makes a good person?

I dont know how to make friends and connect with people again until I can have confidence and feel good about myself which comes self esteem from knowing that I am not a bad person.

2532,Shelali,1546755597,1,"       I've come to a realization in the past few days. For the past several years I've had a feeling of emotional numbness.

       Not to say that I don't feel emotion I feel joy and happiness as well as sadness but they never say with me. I can feel amazing or horrible about something, and I feel compassion and empathy for people but the feeling never stays. During the death of a family member who I was close too I felt grief and within 6 hours I went numb. When I had my first serious relationship I genuinely loved her and then a feeling of numbness. and I've wondered what it is in the past but never really thought about it until recently. 

       I don't understand why I am like this but I have neither the money to see someone or a family that would understand. I've always been seen as the strong one, the one that needs so help which makes it terrifying to admit to wanting help and clarification.

2533,beautifulexistence,1546754583,1,"I realize this is not exclusive to those with mental illness, and that most if not all people hate being stonewalled, especially by someone they care about.

Specifically, in my situation, I live, work, and commute with my brother, who habitually stonewalls people whenever he's angry at them or just emotionally overwhelmed. I know I should expect this by now and should know how to deal with it, but it stresses me the fuck out. My GAD loves to fixate on worst case scenarios. Generally it doesn't impact my relationships too much though. Sometimes I get very irritable and need to step away from an interaction, but that's usually because I'm just out of spoons for the day/week.

In this case, whenever my brother stonewalls me, internally I fly into a panic, worrying that he might hurt himself (not irrational imo because he does have chronic depression and frequently jokes about suicide) or that he'll really cut me off this time. He has stonewalled me for periods of more than a year at a time before, so that fear is not unfounded either.

We've spent the past year+ working on our communication, but sometimes I feel like he's always one misstep away from turning on me for good, and being stonewalled definitely doesn't help. I'd feel differently if there was a trend of him reaching out to clear things up, but historically that's been my role 9 times out of 10. If we didn't live and work together then I'd just let it go.

Tonight he started stonewalling me over a disagreement about our transportation which, sadly, isn't a minor issue.

Since I was around 7 or 8, I've had this voice in my head. He calls himself Andrew and more or less just a companion. He doesn't *command me* to do stuff, but recommends I change my manner or do something differently so that things will be easier or better for me. 

I, obviously, would tell my mom or consult a doctor, but we don't have any insurance and I'm worried my mom will waste her work hours on something not worth helping.

I have looked at the possibilities. No, Andrew is not just my thoughts. He acts as a separate figure and has his own traits. He doesn't have an appearance, but more of just a voice that associates with a mood or a feeling, not a face.


When I started middle school this year, (I'm a year behind in school since I couldn't attend school one year. I don't wanna talk about it.) he became a bit more agitated at things.

\- Someone gave me a gift on my birthday. It felt very strange and I hid it telling myself that it's not supposed to exist because the person who gave it doesn't exist. It felt very real to me.

I have little to no sexual or romantic attraction to any living being in this reality.  If I had to describe what about this world is unattractive to me, I would say the it's not ""anime"" enough. Everything in this world is unattractive in comparison to anime and the like. On top of that, I'm a furry, and obviously anthros don't exist in this reality.   For years I've struggled with this situation, and curse the heavens for not letting leave this reality in search of a more suitable one. I tried everything, even toying with the idea of magic to solve my problem. I feel like I'm at the edge of my sanity here.

2544,affect_alien,1546747935,1,"At the start of my mental health journey and made the breakthrough (for me) that I need a therapist. Dealing primarily with anxiety/depression/mood issues. 

I have insurance, but the company's therapist directory is overwhelmingly big, often out of date, and frequently without any details (e.g. Mary Smith is a counselor who specializes in counseling). Psychology Today has a directory I've been using too but has similar issues. If I find a contender, there's often no email address or website, even after a Google search. 

I'm finding it particularly difficult to find someone who deals with my issues in the area (Massachusetts, US). Everyone checks that they deal with anxiety, for example, but when I look into them further, it's anxiety as a result of an eating disorder, substance abuse, etc. I assume I should find someone who specializes as closely as possible in what I'm experiencing. 

Questions for the more experienced: 

If you have a therapist that you like, how did you find them?

Does anyone have a good way of finding therapists who know how to help with your issues? 

Basically, is this the slog and I have to keep searching? Or is there a better way?",mentalhealth,How do you find a therapist?,2019-01-06 15:12:15
2545,spoileddairy,1546747492,1,"I am a mess right now (or at least I think I am). I am not what I used to be. Recently I've hurt people that I've been trying to reach out and help. Helping others is nothing special for me since I am a very deep, empathetic, and compassionate person who is willing go out of their way to listen, reach out, meet, and help my friends. But recently I've been doing the opposite of that unintentionally.. There were situations where I felt I understood the situations but I completely misread them and would miscommunicate or be oblivious to certain things I should have picked up. This was rarely the case for me before, before I always quickly understood and knew what to do/say. Because of this, people are comfortable opening up and come to me for questions. But recently some people gotten hurt (all these people are not connected, they are all separate cases).

&amp;#x200B;

I think part of this is because my girlfriend broken up with me recently and I've been really devastated by it. Constantly wondering why and finding closure even though there is none and I should stop. Thing is, no matter what I can't stop thinking about her and what happened. I constantly have dreams of her, her friends, or anything related to her. How all the friends I've made with her are now suddenly gone. We are not enemies or have anything against each other but now it's super awkward to be in the circle of friends. Not only that those friends also have a lot of mutual friends of mine so it's like a big web of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I think about I am pretty alone. Everyone can come to me with their problems and dump their issues onto me but when I have problems, I don't really have much people to turn to or at least have any consistent few people I can rely on. I am always alone when taking care of my problem and when I had a girlfriend who helped and cared about my problems but also helped hers, was something really special. Now that's gone and I am very alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost my touch, I am alone, confused, feeling empty. Working out has always been one of my hobbies so that's been helping and I've improved so much but that only helps a bit. I've been going out of my ways to make deeper connections with people but I don't think I've met anyone who understands my feelings and thoughts yet. I haven't really been opening up to people lately and just been keeping a straight face even though in the inside I am screaming.

2547,NikeProphet,1546747018,1,"Last year I had 3 separate psychiatric hospital admissions. I spent a total of 5 months on psych wards. I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia for 4 years (I'm 24)

I got out of the hospital on October 31st. I did CBT for psychosis for 8 weeks. I met with my psychiatrist. I walked every day &amp; I started to feel really good. Things were great. I was being social again and I just felt like my head was clear.

I live with my mother. I had to move back home last February after I became too unwell to function. I love my mother but she's not without her problems. Alcohol being the main one.

On New Year's Eve I overheard her crying on the phone. She said she couldn't cope anymore, that she was burnt out, that she wanted to get away from everything. I felt sick. Then I fucked up.

I drank a bottle of cough syrup to get high &amp; forget about things. But with 150mg of DXM (dissociative) &amp; 350mg of DPH (deleriant) in my system I started having a really bad trip. I was alone &amp; terrified. It was so bad that I had to really resist calling an ambulance. I made myself vomit hoping to get at least some of the drugs out of my system but it was too late. It lasted several hours &amp; I haven't been the same since.

I'm having panic attacks daily. I feel a sense of dread and impending doom all the time. My thoughts are all over the place. I've started finding being conscious uncomfortable &amp; at times painful. When I was tripping I wanted to stab myself in the head multiple times because all I wanted was for what I was feeling to stop.

I feel uneasy. Like there's some chaos inside me that could release itself at any time. I'm afraid that if I tell my doctor they'll put me in the hospital. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past but I never tried to kill myself. It's starting to feel like that could become an option &amp; I'm terrified I'll lose control &amp; do something I wouldn't do if I was thinking clearly.

I don't trust anyone right now. Back when I was admitted to hospital last February a police officer helped me calm down when I was being held in the station before being admitted. He gave me his number and told me to call him if I ever needed to. He told me that he'd made mistakes too &amp; without disclosing what he told me he was temporarily suspended. He had to seek treatment before rejoining the police. But he keeps coming into my head. Maybe calling him is a terrible idea I don't know but I need to talk to someone that will listen and I know he will, he gave me his word. One thing I'm afraid of though is that I'm certain circumstances he might have to break confidentiality. So I could end up in the hospital for speaking to him.

I've had many episodes of psychosis over the last few years. I know the warning signs so I know when I'm becoming unwell. I just feel it. Bubbling up inside me. That's what I feel now. Wishing it away doesn't work. If I don't tell someone it will happen &amp; once I completely start losing touch with reality it's very hard for me to come back to reality again. When it actually happens I become completely oblivious that anything is wrong.

I haven't missed a dose of medication basically all year. I'm hoping that's helping me. I'd really really appreciate some advice. I know this post is long but I really just need to not feel alone with this right now. Thanks.",mentalhealth,I think I'm losing it,2019-01-06 14:56:58

This person wasn't the closest to me but she was in my life for a brief time. She was happy cheery full of laughter and full of smiles. I met her mother and her sister. She met my mam and dad, my brother and brother in law. I took her to my debs She was so bright and bubbly.  she was a pleasure to be around.

I'm very sad to say this person is no longer with us she was found this morning by I presume her parents. ( A friend rang me and told me the news) I don't usually react straight away I was taken back by it of course but it takes me a while to process it. As of writing this post it's 2:30a.m. And it's eating away at me.

This poor troubled girl who was going to be an aunty this year. She was going to do her leaving cert this year. She was going to college this year. She was going to have her 18th birthday this year. She was going to do so much this year. 

She had every contact in the world and still kept quiet. She previously attempted suicide and sought help. I genuinely thought she was in a better place but sadly it wasn't the case. 

I can't express the pain I feel for the family to lose a daughter, a sister, a niece, a granddaughter, a cousin, an aunty is something no one should go through. 

I know there was nothing I could've done and that we weren't very close we only knew eachother for 2 days for Christ sake but she touched my life she was in my home. She met my family and I met hers. 

Just knowing this young bright girl isnt with us anymore is really getting to me. I just keep picturing it and get this rushing hollow feeling all throughout my body. 

Is it normal to feel like this? Am I feeling too much empathy? I've never had someone my age take their own life who was in my life for x amount of time. 

Suicide is so prominent in today's climate. The scariest thing I learned today is that you never know who is next. Even writing that is giving me shivers. 

Please for your own sake talk to somebody anybody don't keep to yourself. I just wish she never had those thoughts. She didn't deserve this faith nobody does. 

I can't stress this enough everybody is affected by it even the people who you think wouldn't give a shit if you died. 

We do care. We really do. 

May you rest in peace.

I’m at a loss and thought this community might be able to help. My mother lives in Georgia and does not have health insurance. She has a history of mental instability and depression and that has progressively gotten worse since my step dad passed away about a year and a half ago. She has been saddled with his fledgling antique business and cannot keep up with the bills and her car is about to be repossessed. She also spends recklessly and is incredibly impulsive and unstable. She has mentioned that she feels suicidal to me and my brother separately and she owns a firearm which makes me uneasy to say the least given her volatile mental state. I do not live in GA but my brother lives with her and is very worried for her well-being. I am considering trying to get her committed so she can get some help and get stabilized. I truly believe she should not have a firearm and needs to be in therapy and on medication. But, I haven’t consulted my  brother  on this and I feel guilty making a move like this when she has moments of real lucidity. I wish she would get her shit together and get her finances in order, but it doesn’t seem realistic at this point without an intervention. She has disowned and alienated all of her friends and family and has frankly screwed a lot of them over. There’s a lot of ill -will. 

So, is anyone familiar with the process of getting someone mental help in GA with no money and 0 health insurance? Is anyone able to give me advice or walk me through what this process might be? I really wish it wouldn’t have to come to this but it looks like she’s really going off the deep end.

Basically he always had a lot of pressure, from sport, our parents or himself and couldn't really relieve that pressure. One day he recognized that and since then he is saying, that he has a permanent pressure in his head. He hoped that it is something physically but the signs are not good I guess. He wants to be alone all the time and thinks by doing nothing and being alone it gets better. I respect that but he is also not trying to fasten up the process and he seems so lost. He is currently doing an internship but he wants to cancel it, because he just can't get things done and although his co-workers are nice to him, it is a very uncomfortable workplace for him. He said, that the only thing why he had not left is the money and the fear of searching for a new job which would be the next huge stress factor for him! I am the only person he speaks to with his problems. He is not capable to tell the doctor these problems, because he just can't, he says!

It would be nice, if you can give me some advice, if you or someone you know has experienced something similar. Where do we have to go, to get a diagnosis and what can we do against it?

Almost 2 years ago I met someone who I thought I could be with for the rest of my life, we both thought this. Suddenly over the past week or so, just before Christmas I guess, she became increasingly distant with me but today we'd made plans for her to come round to mine, whilst I went to meet with a guy I was hoping to form a band with, and then I'd take her out for dinner.
I met her off the bus and as we start walking she says ""I can't continue in this relationship anymore"" and that she thinks ""we should both spend the year focusing on ourselves and becoming better people"".

The past couple of months have been hard for me mentally, I'm scared I've driven her away or been too much to handle or not done enough.

She's in her last year of university and is struggling with that and also her own stresses and anxiety, so I understand her wanting to maybe not have to focus on me but I could have understood that had given her the space.

Of course I'm fearing the worst and that she's found someone better and that this is the end for us.

I don't know what I want anyone to say or do but I thought I should just throw myself out there and hope help finds me... Like, how am I meant to be a better me if I don't have the one who inspires me with me anymore?

His work is suffering (he runs a small business), his relationship with his partner (they have a son together who is two)  is suffering and neither me nor my mother know how we can help him.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this but I have no idea how to google my problem and do not want to bother a psychiatrist over something like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

In general, I would not really say I am depressed, but I do have brief episodes where it gets pretty bad. What I described in the title is something I have noticed happening more and more over the past few years. It always goes as follows. I will be in some situation, normally with other people, and I will build in happiness and feeling content. I love being around people in general, and I would usually characterize myself as being very lonely: perhaps I like being in company to avoid this. However I keep suddenly having these moments where I become extremely self-aware. It's almost as if I step outside of the situation and am looking at myself having a good time and feeling content. Suddenly I will remind myself that this moment is fleeting and no matter how good I feel now, this moment will pass and I will be back to feeling sad and lonely. This realization obviously triggers these feelings, and people have said they occasionally notice me suddenly slink away in a conversation and become withdrawn.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to stop these realizations from happening? 

&amp;#x200B;

It makes me less able to have fun and feel excited about things as I know I will inevitably come to one of these realizations, pre-emptively ruining any chance of feeling content or happy.

Beyond anxiety, I feel like I'm borderline crazy- for lack of a better word. I'm a burden on everyone and sometimes I wish I didn't exist. I used to joke and say that I self-sabotage everything good in my life but now I feel like it's true.

Some days I feel like my 'usual' self- bubbly, outgoing, jokey, etc. and then other days it feels like a switch has went off in my head and I feel emotionally numb and cold.

For eg, occasionally me and my boyfriend fight and I say terrible things. Afterwards he asks me to put myself in his shoes to understand how it feels, but I can't.

So heres a little background. My family has currently moved quite aways to a new home with new possibilities. (New year, new home.) But like I said it's quite far from our old home so we have to go on weekends to our old home to finish bringing the rest of things over to our new home. The older and stronger ones go with my parents while the younger ones stay. Now I'm one of the older siblings so theres no doubt I'm expected to go along with my parents to help move. But last time I went, we stayed at the old house for 3 days moving everything. And I had the worst mental and physical experience ever. On the drive there I have no idea what happened. But pretty much, I forgot my own identity. My mind was in a fog so bad and my head was aching. I only had 4 hrs of sleep. Memories were dashing back and forth. My body was screaming and my head felt like it was on fire. When I finally got back, it took me the entire week to finally feel ""normal"" again. 

So here I am again. My parents are going back down and they expect me to come with them. But I became so afraid. I didnt want to repeat the same events as last time. And I felt that going back would trigger me to remember some pretty heavy memories. I was afraid of what would happen to my mental health again. 
But it didnt matter. My dad didnt care and he wanted me to come. So at the last moment I pushed everything onto my sister and convinced my parents to bring her and not me. And for some reason they agreed. My sister began yelling and complaining about how she didnt want to go. But my dad didnt care. Everyone was yelling and screaming and my sister was so mad at me. She was yelling at me and she didnt even want to look at me. What I did was so unlike me! Normally I'd apologize and go with my parents. But I froze and all I could do was curl up into a ball and hide. I couldnt even look at her. I didnt even say a word to her. I hid in the corner of the room as everyone left and I didnt even say goodbye. I was afraid of everyone. I feel so guilty. She's my best friend and I threw her under the bus.

I'm in my mid 20s. I believe I had a decent childhood, I was pretty sensitive but I could live with it, in some ways it was an advantage and I was doing great. Since my teen years, I've been becoming increasingly more avoidant, emotionally numb, anxious and depressed. I couldn't be myself around people, I'd pretty much instantly freeze up and no one could ever reach me, I grew very distant and lonely though I never admitted it to myself and anyone, I pretended that it was my choice and there wasn't much wrong with it. Even though I still had some sense of direction in life left, I feel that I would often act against my own will and make odd decisions that I couldn't explain. I would avoid most things, I couldn't commit to doing anything, it's as if at some point I would start sabotaging myself, quit everything and turn to escapism even further. Every activity felt forced, my whole life has become a tiresome habit, I lost most of my awareness, my goals and dreams disappeared, I constantly needed distractions. It all became a blur, I lost track of my thoughts and emotions, it was a state of extreme confusion and frustration. I somewhat saw myself from the outside, I knew I became the opposite of myself yet in some ways I still denied it all. Tackling every issue one by one, like addiction or inability to connect with people wouldn't work at all as I couldn't get to the root cause, I wouldn't open up even to myself. I couldn't feel much anymore, even the negative feelings went somewhere deep so I became completely lifeless and apathetic, there wasn't even enough pain that would push me to change.

After a decade or so, I finally got to the answer why most of this is happening. It was the psychological abuse I experienced at the age of around 11. I haven't entirely suppressed these memories, I just pretended it was all insignificant. Admitting that the abuse affected me would have made me feel weak so I never did, even to myself. It wasn't particularly extreme in most people's eyes, most less sensitive people would've likely mostly shrugged it off (or rather didn't let it happen in the first place) so I convinced myself it couldn't have been a big deal, even though somewhere deep down I always knew it. I felt what's done is done, there was no point in going back anyway. 

I would get shamed and attacked for my emotions, self expression and achievements. I couldn't get away from it, so I had to adapt and change myself. I completely detached from myself and became someone different and buried my old self somewhere deep inside. I have a very strong aversion to showing any emotions. Something like laughing or seeming happy makes me feel very ashamed and uncomfortable and I just  can't do it, a part of me is resisting, yet I also feel awful that I can't do it. My life is almost completely controlled by subconscious fears. As I look into myself deeper I find that I am very constrained in every way, unconsciously, every little body movement or a word said or a look has to be done in a certain way, there is a complete lack of freedom. I'm just not here, I'm like a spectator looking through someone's eyes, most of actions are barely conscious. I recently dug back up some of my goals and dreams but there are so many invisible mental barriers I still don't understand and they keep me from doing anything at all and moving forward in life, I'm completely frozen. I recently had this very brief, unexpected experience in my mind where I strongly felt completely free, like my true self and I can now understand the immense contrast, it also gave me hope that I can actually someday attain this state of mind.

I signed up for professional help and so far the first therapist seemed somewhat understanding and helpful, but they don't seem competent enough to deal with my situation despite having some credentials and I don't have much options, though I'll try to do everything I can to seek someone who could help. I have to work on it a lot myself too. I'm somewhat familiar with some trauma healing techniques but I'm so emotionally withdrawn that I can't really get into it, accessing memories also seem almost impossible. 

Even though I am more aware of my situation than ever, strongly want to heal, and get occasional bursts of inspiring emotions, I'm still facing a lot of internal resistance. I still spend most of my time distracting myself. It's as if I occasionally slip out of this coma but then I shut myself down again. Like I've been typing all this the whole day on and off, I was really into it for some time, I got emotional a couple of times and now as I'm wrapping this up, I feel very drained and tired and needing to get away, distract myself and just waste time. Forcing something uncomfortable so you no longer fear it or building habits doesn't seem to work in my current state. I'm starting to understand the importance of emotions so I feel this is what I should focus on but I don't see how. These little exercises for example like noting throughout the day how you feel seem really tiresome and annoying no matter what, it feels like I don't really recognise the emotions and I end up making things up.

2590,hmmjam,1546692665,1,"Hi everyone.

I just want to hear your opinion on something I've been dealing with for a long time now. Many years, actually.

When I was in high school (around 6 years ago) I started dealing with random anxiety attacks in that I would fixate on a stressing thought for days to the point where I'd even experience a panic attack. That led me to visit a therapist during the last year of high school.

The therapist confirmed that I had some form of anxiety, probably an anxiety disorder, but he was never very clear about it. I went a few times and then stopped because I found him mediocre.

For these past 3 years or so, I don't deal with panic attacks but I have a different form of the issue I described. I basically overanalyse things, almost all day. In most cases, they are things that I might feel uncomfortable about thinking. Not necessarily taboo or offensive. Just a tad bit inappropriate. And the thing is that If I avoid the overanalysation I start feeling stressed. As if I haven't completed something important. As if I have to do it, otherwise my day won't be right. It certainly isn't tremendous stress but it is annoying.

Do you have any idea what could be causing this? Is there a name for it? Is it something specific? I can't afford to go to a therapist in the meantime so I guess just having a possibly clearer picture of what I might be having would make feel a bit better.

Thanks in advance.",mentalhealth,Is there a name for what I'm dealing with? Need some info/advice.,2019-01-05 23:51:05

At age 21 (now) I’ve recently been diagnosed with Cyclothymia, alongside existing anxiety &amp; depression. The combination of these new symptoms over the last 5 years has meant I’ve enrolled into numerous courses and been unable to complete them. I’ve had tonnes of somewhat helpful (but exhausting and vague/short) therapy and tried 10 different types of medication (complete with all sorts of dreadful side effects). Plus experienced numerous abysmal and traumatic events, which I think I’m doing bloody well at dealing with. 

After seeing a psychiatrist for the first time, I’m being offered more therapy suited to dealing with my existing issues, and I’m finally making the decision to put my career/education on hold. Although scary, I think this has been a long time coming. As mentioned, there’s stuff happening in my life alongside this that are draining and I don’t think I’ve given myself healing time. 

Most of me knows this is the right thing to do, but part of me feels like I’ve wasted my hard work on the current course I’m doing.

I'm a 27-year-old male who hasn't had a steady job for my entire life. I've had some pretty bad Anxiety/Depression since Highschool which led me to drop out in grade 10. I don't think I'm stupid, but dropping out was a dumb thing to do. I just couldn't handle the day to day of school. As I got older I've tried to go to Adult Ed &amp; to work countless jobs with no avail. I think the longest I've kept a job has been 3 months.

I finally decided 2 years ago that I would try to get my life back on track and try and fight this, I was on a waitlist for a Psychiatrist for over a year who was not helpful at all. He did see that I had really bad Anxiety and I thought he wanted to help, but he cancelled a bunch of appointments on me then just never rescheduled. He also forgot most things I told him from week to week which really sucked.

About 6 months ago I finally started trying to get out and find work again. I got a job I have been trying to get for a while which is Reffing for a ball hockey league. I figured it would be perfect for me cause I know the place well &amp; I can make pick my own days, but it has been really tough to even keep something I wanted to do for so long and it's very discouraging. Around this time I've also been seeing my doctor who has prescribed me some different meds ranging from Anxiety,Deperssion, Sleep &amp; ADHD pills with none of them helping in the slightest.

I know I have to be patient when it comes to pills and nothings gonna change overnight, but if I can't even hold a job that is only a couple of hours a month that I wanted to do, how am I suppose to live? No money, living in my dad's apartment, it pisses me off that I need to rely on him and that bothers me the most.

In closing, I don't want to live like this anymore, but I feel trapped with no way out.

2599,BootOnBoy,1546683079,1,"Ive read as much as I can on the disorder and I know it's not really a huge deal but I am bothered by this for a few reasons. First I'd like to say that I disagree with the diagnosis. I had a stillborn son, a close friend die, and my last living uncle passed away all on top of my boyfriend of 9 years dumping me over the phone and a relapse into alcoholism (3 months sober again now) over the summer. I had a really terrible string of events all at once and she diagnosed me with adjustment disorder in October, which was a month after the relationship ended and the last death occurred. I was pretty understandably worn out, depressed, and shell-shocked at that point. I wasnt even particularly emotional that day in her office so I'm clueless as to where she got the idea that I wasn't coping well enough.

I dont as much mind the diagnosis, despite the fact that I think it's incorrect, as the fact that she didn't take the time to explain it to me or even mention it  before adding it to my medical record. Admittedly, I don't like change much and can have anxiety surrounding newness, but when it comes to traumatic life events I think I bounce back as well as anyone else. Is it normal for a doc to do that? I've never had it happen before and it seems pretty unethical to formally diagnose someone with a disorder without their knowledge. Idk why that bugged me so much, as I know adjustment disorder is more of a situational diagnosis as opposed to a chronic one like bpd, but it does.",mentalhealth,A new psychologist I saw a while back diagnosed me with adjustment disorder and added it to my medical record without telling me what it was or even mentioning the term to me.

For the past few days, to be honest, I've thought about taking a razor and slitting my wrist or maybe walking to the bridge by my apartment and jumping off of it because it would be fast. I recently flunked out of my second degree and I'm ashamed of it. I had a lot of people in my life building me up to be successful and now I'm struggling with money, wanting to drink to numb my emotions, and hiding in my apartment because I'm too afraid that the people I love will get a hint of how far I've fallen off the horse. I have the means to commit suicide so that makes me high risk.

I'm not going to kill myself today.

Instead, I'm going to give you the reasons why I'm going to stay in this life.

Reason 1: 
I go to sleep next to a man who loves me every single night. He is my asshole boyfriend who doesn't do his dishes, pisses me off when he tells me my breath is bad, and he spends too much money on his car. We've been together for two years and every night he falls asleep holding me while I quietly wait for it to be safe to pull myself off of his sweaty body and roll over to my side of the bed. Our relationship is a beautiful mess. The first reason I am choosing to stay alive is that I am sleeping next to the man that I am going to marry. I think he knows it too. I am choosing to stay because I have the capacity to love when it isn't easy. I have the capacity to love myself today.

Reason 2:
One piece at a time, I can pick up the pieces of my life. I work a kitchen job on weekends. I get up, drive 20 minutes, chop some vegetables, wash some dishes, and go home with aching feet. But I also smile while I'm there. I don't feel like a cog in a machine. I feel like I'm part of a team. While I'm there, I'm doing things that make it possible for a group of people to do something that is greater than myself. I am capable of taking small steps forward because I know that small steps are part of a larger journey. The second reason I will live is because I have the capacity to build joy from small pieces of smiles.

Reason 3:
I have things to look forward to. I'm going to be a researcher and I'm going to be damn good at it. In my short time in this life so far, I have had the opportunity to experience the best feeling in the entire world: the feeling of discovery. After months of collecting data, reading papers, and running statistics, I have had lived the thrill of learning something that nobody else in the entire world knew. Of all the tears I have cried, nothing has ever been more powerful than those tears of happiness that seeped out of me in that moment. With a joy like that burning a fire in my heart, I have the capacity to change the world.

Long story short i told my tutor i hated myself im lost and when she spoke to my sister in parents evening she said you should help him at home i told my sis that i might have anxiety and depression symptoms and she said get over it people got it worse than you i really don’t know where to go spoke to gp im on a waiting list for a counsellor had sessions with my school counsellor but i just believe id be better dead off last thing to mention i always felt bi in an muslim community so imagine creating a fake straight version of myself to make my muslim parents happy also of any of you got any suicide note tip i wouls be grateful if you could gave it to me :)",mentalhealth,Why,2019-01-05 15:50:08

I wish I could have told myself this 3 years ago because mental health struggles are real, important, etc”. My therapist suggested that I share my story because I’m always talking about how I want to help and want to help spread awareness. So, I did. I was really pleased with it and proud of myself. It was about 2 paragraphs long and very heart felt. I received an overwhelmingly positive response. 

My not so tech savvy aunt texted me “Are you okay?” with a screen shot from a family group text where a different aunt had taken a screenshot of my post and sent it to the family with a “OH MY HELL 🙄 Read this”. 

It hurt. It hurt a lot. Honestly, said aunts were major players in my digression. When I was spiraling, it was similar shit that aided me in reaching a point where I didn’t want to live anymore. 

I’m not quite sure what the eye roll is for. Does she want to read that I tried to take my own life a year ago? That I was hospitalized and that I’m still on so many meds that I struggle to cry, even when I want to, because I’m so numb? I’m just ranting, but really don’t know where to go from here.

So, I'm afraid to say Jesus Christ or God Damn stuff like that out loud AND IN MY HEAD (I know that's weird but idk lol). 
  
But the thing is, I'm not even religious. I consider myself an atheist, which makes me super confused. I think it's because my mind is always like, ""Oh, what if?"" and ""How would you explain this?"" Honestly this just makes everything 10x worse because I think I'm crazy, and I can't tell if they are intrusive thoughts or not (which I do suffer from). So I'm always doubting my religious beliefs. 

But anyway, I just now said to myself these things out loud to try and get rid of these fears. I said (((btw sorry if u are religious, nothing against that this just helped me))) Jesus Christ out loud and stuff like that. I said some kind of cringy stuff that I won't type lmao, but anyways I'm not gonna lie I was scared that my whole family was gonna die right then, and that I was gonna die right there of a blood clot or something, idk I'm still kind of scared, but I think it kind of helped. 
  
On treating intrusive thoughts I've read to not ignore them or make them go away but to acknowledge them and then don't give them attention, which I'm not really doing so this might end up making it worse idk. 

anyways just wanted to vent because my mind is very annoying and I just want to be normal lol. Does this even sound like intrusive thoughts?? I've read about something like this and my googling can't find anything.  ",mentalhealth,intrusive thoughts reeeee,2019-01-05 15:05:40
2615,nicoboato,1546661119,1,"To make a very long story short I am a 21yr old male and in 2015 when I was 16-17 i tried to commit suicide from an overdose
I was dating someone at the time when this happened. her and I had a good relationship it had nothing to do with her but because of other factors in my life I felt I had no other option but to end it all..
I was sent to hospital and from hospital I was sent to a psych ward where I spent the next month and a half doped on a ton of different meds which made me feel so numb and groggy. 
Just after the stay I broke things off with the her because I didn't want to be around anyone I didn't want to be here I didn't want to be responsible for anything. I just wanted to mess up my life and my health in any possible way I could.
From that one failed attempt my life took a massive turn, they didn't let me leave the hospital and they convinced me it would be a good idea to live in a mental health recovery home for youths. They were worried about me developing psychosis /schizophrenia because of the psychotic features I was showing. so I went with them...
I completly abandoned those that I knew and because of all the meds I actually some how forgot about everything..? I knew but I didn't at the same time.. I was still the same person as I was before all this, I had confidence and was a fun person to be around.. I was hospitalized a few time after the initial ones for small things but overall I was okay..

in mid 2016 a friend and I were kicked out of the res for  excessive drug use with multiple warnings (out of all places huh)  everything went to shit from here , i was homeless for awhile until a family let me stay with them. My mental health started to get really bad and memories flooded back in of that night.
i ended up having a psychotic break or as I'd prefer to call it a spiritual psychosis which lasted over 4 months. from then on I've turned into this timid and scared person. From that episode I'm polar opposite of who I used to be I've lost myself and haven't found him yet. Not like I want all of his attributes back but I want myself back at least. The hallucinating and evil spirits took something of me and the flashes of what happened that night really hurt me. I remember her crying on the phone yelling why did I do this. All I could say in a calm voice is I'm wanting to see my (dead) uncle that's all I was saying I don't think I understood what was really happening and then I realised that it was our anniversary together that night (I would have know then but I have no memory of that month leading up to the night) 
It made me feel so extremely guilty and I really started to hate myself alot... How could anyone do all of this and not care better yet how could I forget about something as big as this?
Shit after shit kept coming at me but I was determined to get better, and to help myself out of the rut. 

2018-2019 I've been doing positive things with my life. I don't do drugs, I am studying and I am part time working as well.. but because of my low self worth I feel I am unworthy of happiness and love. I'm scared I could do the same to the new girl I'm interested in. So I back off and it hurts me but I can't stop myself from doing it. This person is super caring and a very lovely person but I keep backing away. 
I've tried so many times to learn to love myself again, to stop self destructive habits to let go of the past. Slowly I've been stopping all the bad coping habits but I just can't let go of what I did. What I put people through. 
I feel like a horrible person. I feel like the life has been sucked out of me. I can barely let people in and I want to. I want to trust, I want to love myself but it's like life is stopping me from going any further.

I just want to know if anyone has been through something similar. Any advice or If anyone can help me out on letting go or tips on moving forward.

Since I started working full time in my 20s and especially in the last 2 years Iv ended up drinking every night just because of the stress of work and it seemed to cut down my need for weed, my go to release. I ended up drinking 8 cans and buying 3.5g everyday I was even smoking before work. Iv always got depressed and got overly anxious about even insignificant thing, mostly work and getting in trouble drunk or making a fool of myself then worrying about whatever Iv done, what people think, what I can’t remember and ultimately why do I do this time and time again. Then this year things just seemed to blow up, I’d had a good paying job for about 4 years, a girlfriend I loved and was pretty happy with life despite my issues. Then in March my gf left me, this made me get worse but I really started questioning if I was happy with life and just developing more of a destructive mindset. This is when i started to drink more gradually from 2/3 cans to eventually 8 every week night and on the weekends a lot more but it took a few months. In this time I was living with my mum and my stepdad and sister. Then in April my parents split up, I used to call him dad. I’m going to save detail about this but in the end after he moved out and going through loads of old papers we found 2 remortgage documents, what should have been a bought house had over 80k debt on it. This just made me start to loose trust in everyone, I literally don’t trust anybody. I had a mental breakdown and ended up out of work for 6 weeks and that was one of the lowest points of my life. But somehow i managed to get back into work, I actually got a better job. I don’t know where I’d be if I didn’t. But doing that meant I had to lend 2k to get a car as I used a company car at my last job. For a while I tried my absolute best I cut back drinking a bit, tried to cut back weed but it didn’t work. I paid back the 2k. Then I just slipped back into it within a month I was back drinking and smoking loads, I started to really worry if I was good enough at my job, will I ever meet anyone, do the people I work with hate me.i can’t drink more than 2/3 without wanting more then backing out and just waking up and the stuff I was doing was getting worse. Now, December I crashed my car totalled it and the insurance wouldn’t pay out because I abandoned the car so that was recovered and I lost it. I blacked out on the works do, New Year’s Eve and most nights over Christmas. The stress has got so much worse all I do is worry, I’m dreading going back to work. I don’t even know how I’m going to get there, what If I did something stupid on the works do. Im at the point I’m lay in bed and my minds racing thinking of all eventualities, my heart speeds up and I even get the shakes sometimes. I worry about this house aswell and feel like it’s on me now I’m the only high earner, even though it could still be sold through divorce. It’s still my family’s home. But then I think Iv handled it well and get times when I think it’s all going to go to plan, like really happy but that never lasts longer than I’d say even 2 hours. So 2 nights ago Iv attempted to cold turkey weed and beer, it’s been the worst nights ever Iv not slept at all I’m wandering about then just lying down panicking with worry nearly so today I just did it.

Her latest episode was around November of 2017. Her doctor had decided to lower her medication dose, and, within a month, had divorced from my father, got him kicked out the house, and had gotten herself into financial trouble (I attended a residential school at the time, so I learned of this when I came home for Thanksgiving break). She didn't take care of herself, clean in anyway, had huge mood swings, and became very aggressive whenever I asked her if something was wrong. She often spoke to herself, laughed for no apparent reason, then cried minutes later. Luckily, her dose was returned to the original amount and she stabilized. 
Now, almost exactly a year later, she's showing some signs of another episode. She seemed completely fine, then my sister slept her for a few nights, and she became aggressive toward my father and I, laughing out of no where, then crying minutes later. 
Her symptoms alone are not problematic, but she is very important to us, financially and because she's family, so this is of great concern. We asked if she was taking her meds, she says she is, but this seems to trigger her aggressiveness.

Unfortunately there are even more issues, these being that my mom doesn't take me seriously when I talk to her about how I feel and shrugs it of as teenage hormones and it leaves me feeling like theres no one I can talk to. This also results in her not really wanting me to go to therapy because she doesn't see that there's much of an issue. Lastly is a money problem. I dont have much money and I've heard that therapy is really expensive and from what I've seen it's way too much and I can't afford it. At the moment I dont know if my school offers any form of therapy or if they can refer me to a therapist that won't charge as much as others and still get a good therapist.

2626,denizaydar,1546648898,1,"Hello,

I have been diagnosed with depression and I have been on the anti depressant sertraline for about 2 months. However, i am pretty sure i have more than depression, but i havent shared this with my doctor. 

I struggle to feel empathy or understand situations unless i am deeply emotionally involved. For example, my friend was explaining his childhood problem, and my other friend upon hearing this felt so bad and emotionally involved, whereas i didnt even blink an eye. However i knew exactly what words to use to make him feel like I had empathy and to make him feel like I understood. It sometimes feels like i can manipulate social emotions as if they are my own. I am not a sociopath- if i see someone hurt directly in front of me, or if i am properly made to understand the emotional extent of a situation then i can sympathise- other than that, absolutely nothing. 

Furthermore, I struggle to believe life is real. It’s as if i am convinced everything is a simulation or that I’m imagining what is going on, like my friends and family around my are just figments of my imagination. This affects my life negatively and it makes me struggle to take things seriously. 

I am also extremely suicidal- even tho I am on anti depressants, i dont even feel sad anymore, i just feel suicidal. I constantly think about dying, every hour of the day, i plan suicide constantly but im too LAZY to do it. And the fact that i know i most likely will pussy out in the last second due to natural human survival instincts. 

Does anyone know how i can just feel normal? Even typing all of this feels stupid because a big part of me is telling myself im wasting my time as ‘nothing is real anyway’. My ex researched into my disconnection with reality and it sounds like i have depersonalisation disorder (“Depersonalization disorder is marked by periods of feeling disconnected or detached from one's body and thoughts (depersonalization). The disorder is sometimes described as feeling like you are observing yourself from outside your body or like being in a dream.”) which makes complete sense, but i hate it so much and want to get rid of it.

1. Identify thought distortions or anything immediate causing these feelings if there’s anything specific (for example: arguments, dwelling on specific fears, paranoia, etc.)

2. Remind myself that this is an unbalance, I am not alone in it (lots of people experience it), and I am loved.
   Who am I loved by?
       - ((Insert those you are loved by. Everyone and anyone))

3. Remind myself that I am secure in myself. I love myself and forgive myself for having these feelings, but I cannot let them control me. I owe it to myself and those who love me to remain strong and not let my emotions effect me too deeply.

4. Redirect my attention by:
-Drawing/Painting
-Working out
-Writing music/singing/practicing
-Taking a nap 
-Writing letters to people I care about or even myself
-Writing down my feeling then crunching it up
-Meditation (Calm App)
-Watching something funny
-Prayer
-Practicing self care aka taking long baths, painting nails, tweezing eyebrows, face masks, lotion
-Take a walk with My dog
-Hang out with or call a friend
-Be productive..clean, work, organize, or apply for scholarships

But tonight I started thinking about my father. I see him day after day binge watching movies. The same movies he gave me crap about when I was kid. He is so inert. He sits, then eats, and take afternoon naps. He doesn't have to work, for years now, but then it hits me: everything he ever made he made while he was in a motivated spike state of mind, while he had ambition. I was always wondering why did he stopped contributing, he could have done so many great things, and then I came to realize. That's where the anger kicks in. 

&amp;#x200B;

And don't get me wrong I inherited a lot of these behavioral patterns from him. Which is pretty much what every therapist ever asked me (about my parents). I always admired his zen like calmness when things got though, it was like a super power, but on the other end of the spectrum he would lose it on a totally insignificant detail out of the blue. You could say we are pretty emotional, but since raised as stoics (cause we are men, and men don't cry) we got this imbalance .  


So, to get back to the question at hand - what am I trying to get out of rage. Well my answer is - energy (strength). Excitement, motivation, willpower, joy, passion all come through the same channels in my body as anger. Anger is a cover-up for fear. Cause in places where I'm displeased with no results I won't put in extra work and focus, it's lost on me, I was never a good student. I was intelligent and I like tricks and shortcuts, but I didn't like the grind. As I write this I almost feel sorry for those whose see-saw (don't have other way to put it) is almost in balance. It's like a gift, cause I have big dreams (academic, philanthropic, financial, artistic and spiritual)  - and my anger is proportional with consequences of  those dreams not coming through. Not saying that people with lower emotional expressions don't.   


The part about procrastination (which was also discussed with my therapist) also ties into this. I don't want to start something and \`\`master\`\` it - cause I will get bored by it once I do. So I am basically having my midlife crisis before even reaching a fifth of a life, cause, in my silly mind, boredom is inevitable so why bother.

With this said - I intend to put more of those super exciting, fast, short term, bungee jump (metaphor) experiences before me. I don't know how to start, but I can remember a young high school student, who tried to sleep every other night, cause he thought he would get extra time to achieve at least a tiny bit of his fantasies, so I will follow his footsteps ( and maybe be more careful on that whole sleep thing) =)

There is certainly much work for me ahead - I just wanted to share and maybe compare some experiences. Maybe somebody finds this useful. Hope you have a good night.",mentalhealth,Conclusion about anger issues,2019-01-05 10:31:10

As a child I lived in a pretty quaint small town, about 10,000 people. But to the north and south of us were cities of 100s of thousands, however I was restricted from going outside almost all of my life. 

I wasnt allowed to ride my bike outside of the yard until I was 10, I wasnt allowed to ride it out of view from the front door until I was 12 and I couldnt go anywhere more than a block away until I was 14

My mother also smoked marijuana so she never allowed me to have new friends over unless it was planned days ahead of time, also we had over 300 pedophiles living within 10 miles of us about 250 of those were really close

I remember a lot like I'm an info sponge

About 90% of my life has been spent indoors 

I have about 12 friends and a fiance 

Issue is, now I'm having issues mentally, I am constantly paranoid that someone out to get me, I fear most animals

I have really intrusive thoughts like horror movies starring friends family and loved ones that make me afraid I'm going to hurt someone because I have these violent visions. 

I dont know what else to say, I'm afraid I'm never going to be able to fit out in the normal world, I try to think logically but I never put into factor, human emotion. 

I love learning, I graduated 2 years early. But from the time i was a child to now i am asked almost daily  if i know that I'm weird or I get blocked/kicked on games because I'm too abnormal

Also i should mention I've played video games (2-12 hours per day) to pass the time as my primary form of entertainment for the last 18 years (since I was 4) as I wasnt allowed to watch normal TV until I was 8, I also wasnt allowed to listen to music on the radio until I was 12. So I listen to mainly records, bing Crosby and Bobby daring and the like

However now that I'm older and all, I'm getting yelled at about not being able to work and I'm afraid I'm going to be homeless, my fiance moved I fear she is just using me, but i am highly paranoid so yeah. 

I've been on fluoxetine for the last 8 months, and it's been helping with depression and all but I still get frustrated or upset over little things and I'm worried that I'm going to do something that I'll regret. 

I just am afraid of being locked up for life because I constantly feel like I'm about to snap and idk how else to describe it.

 I bottle up all my emotions, always have, but the only person who I feel comfortable talking to is my ex or my current fiance but they both get annoyed when I let everything out 

And I'd do it with my therapist but I dont want to go for a psych ward I'm really scared of going there again, the local ones are filthy and abusive and it only made it worse

Also, I have been having issues involuntarily repeating myself, whether it's one or two times or 50 times, sometimes it's just in my head other times I uncontrollably say it out loud. 

Also I am diagnosed with unspecified depression and unspecified anxiety 

I've been in therapy for almost a year and they cant tell me what I have, I'm just now getting checked for brain damage and autism. 

Idk what I should do, because I'm about to lose Medicaid and become homeless (currently hopping couches) 

Idk what else to say, also sorry this is a jarbled mess, I dont know if I'm even legally sane at this point. I just worry about the whole job thing because 1 Medicaid expires in 4 months and my fiance moved out of state (shortly after telling her about my mental health issues) so every mailing address I have rn is not applicable for Medicaid 

I just... I want to know what to do because no one I know of deals with this, I'm the only one here that has these issues and i dont know what to do, I dont know how to react or respond, i just want to be ""normal"" and i dont think I'll ever be able to have that...",mentalhealth,Not normal?,2019-01-05 09:11:01
2640,chanteriyaki,1546639549,1,"I used to have severe depression years ago, and honestly I thought I had a grip on it for at least the last 3-4 years. 

Over the last few months without even really noticing, I stopped almost all my daily rituals I once was easily committed to for the sake of my health (both mentally and physically).

I’m far from sad, I’ve been content. Just... blank-ish. Nothing really phases me too much. I neglect myself a lot now.

I rarely try to look good anymore, I have slacked off on my skincare, and overall maintenance. I just don’t care because I feel there’s almost no point.

My constant mentality consists of: “Just another person in this world that doesn’t really matter” ... although I am aware that this is not true. I just feel there’s no use in trying so hard because there’s no reason to look or try my best, because my best is insignificant. There’s always way more that are better. 

There’s no need to care for myself so much because I’m going to die no matter how healthy I try to be, or how I look. 

Almost like an “all for nothing” kind of attitude.

I work 40 hours a week to contribute my existence to a fucked up economy, living in a world led by money hungry leaders who feed off of us. I will be paying money to live for the rest of my life, and working strenuous amounts to just get by. In order to combat this, I must spend tens of thousands of dollars to go to a post secondary institution and major in something (after years of studying) that will pay me enough to enjoy my life to the fullest. 

And this goes for the majority of humanity now. 

I will always feel guilty for being as privileged as I am and know that others in helplessly in the most horrid of positions, living the hardest of lives. Yet here I am still complaining. It at times makes me feel ashamed.

Even though I know it’s not all about money, the expectations and requirements are still there to be a functioning human in this society. It’s just exhausting to process it all. 

Although the smallness of my perspective may be overwhelming, I know I do matter. I just don’t like care as much and it’s hard to describe. 

If I’m not at work or with people, I feel almost like I’m in a shell and emotionless. I don’t have the motivation to do as much as I used to. I barely have the energy to make a meal. Or go work out. Lately even SHOWER, which is insane for me because I’m obsessed with feeling clean.

I don’t know if it’s due to my full-time job, general exhaustion, or what. It’s just taking a toll. I’m not sad, I’m content. I’m just not quite myself. I don’t have the motivation or energy to care for myself like I used to.

So with knowing that, I've been able to achieve a 56k/yr professional job and am a single parent/homeowner. I've got some debt but a clear plan and good credit and no issues with paying my bill's every month. 

My major malfunction is relationships. I'm very busy and as a single parent, I don't have time for a social life. My only real way to socialize is by maintaining a dating life. However, if I meet someone really interesting, I tend to get over excited and let things progress too quickly. This usually results in the relationships ending kind of drastically when it turns out not to be a match. 

Or worse, my two children have different fathers. I was with each for 5 years. Both relationships were me being codependent with an addict. I'm the marty/pseudomother trying to help them/fix them...about 2 years in I try to leave, and end up getting pregnant and going back and then leaving again after the child reaches toddlerhood and I realize their father really sucks at everything and wants to also be parented. 

So currently, I've met a man who treats me so differently than the others. Hes kind, thoughtful, helpful, wants to be my caretaker etc. However, he has no job, no car, a suspended license, and just moved back with his parents because he lost everything all at once. His whole life fell apart in the span of 3 months. He has a history of drug abuse in his early 20s but now hes in his late 30s and hasnt abused drugs in many years. He drinks responsibly and has been actively trying to improve his situation in a very poor community without many prospects. 

Do you see what I'm doing? I found someone who is nice to me and I'm painting him with rose colored glasses. 

To add to it, I let things move fast and everythings going so well, but after letting him stay with me during the holidays, I took him back to his parents and communication from him has slowed. He seems to be sinking into depression but that's what I decided on my own is the cause of him not talking to me as much. I lost sleep over his decreased texts.

Attention scared the living shit out of me. School wasn’t pleasant because of this. Ive struggled with body image as long as I can remember. I remember always having a reason to be sad. During elementary school I had full blown insomnia that later was cleared up for full blown depression. As a teen I was diagnosed with bulimia, depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. I’ve been hospitalized multiple times for all of it. My mom was a bad mom. She was abusive mean. I never trusted her. I never loved her. About six years ago her addiction caused her to almost kill her self and we told her she needs to cut the shit so she left us with my dad and went home to Texas. My dad has been doing the best he can being a single dad to my two siblings. After having kids and reading all the books I came to the conclusion that the way she raised me is the reason why I am the way I am. You build trust with your kids when they are first born and I guess I felt like I wasn’t loved enough. 
So my parents are broke and going through a nasty breakup. My mom vandalized our house. Kid napped my disabled sister. Turned our heat off in winter. And told the police my dad is a child molester. And we went through the thing with my sister. Accusations were cleared. They came back a few weeks ago to check things out because she told them to. She’s not in the same state so she wouldn’t even know. 
DISCLAIMER: my dad was my hero. He will give you his last twenty dollars. Will give you the shirt off his back. All he’s ever done is try to give us the best life possible. 
I found out a few days ago that my brother found pictures of little girls on his phone. My brother found out like six months ago and it ate him up inside so he told me. I haven’t found out for sure for myself. But that just means my mom was right. He’s a pedofile. He probably abused her the way she said too.
Now almost every mental disorder I have has strong ties to being sexual abused. Like all of them. And my whole life I’ve felt invalidated because my life was “fine.” Is it possibly that he abused me and I just don’t remember.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to reach out and ask if this community of wonderful people can spare some time to have a look at our kickstarter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend have spent the last few months putting together a Zine (a hip mini magazine) on the topic of mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

It's titled MENTAL and is designed to examine mental health and its effects on young adults, and to be an outlet for people to share their story through different mediums. The Zine consists of articles, photography, artwork and poetry in the hope of providing some form of comfort to individuals suffering from mental illness.

&amp;#x200B;

The project has been completely DIY so in order to get it to print we need a little help funding the printing. There is a kickstarter page here

&amp;#x200B;

[Help Support the Print](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mentalzine/mental-1)

&amp;#x200B;

If you can spare a pound or a penny that would be grand. And if there are any others you can think of that might be interested too please share it along as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

A website will be live in the next few days with the option to pre order one of the magazines. We are to have the Zine printed within the next three weeks! At the moment we are only shipping to the UK but if things go well we will look to start sending it further afield.

It's so stupid, but I am upset that this wasn't the case when I was literally dying. Back then, psychiatrists were evil demons dealing pills and messing up one's chances to get a good job according to my family. All because she was so confident in her psychology webinars and the healing power of Reiki. All because an evil psychiatrist once gave my dad a pill against nightmares and he started seeing the world grey.

How spooky. Definitely worse than a daughter killing herself with malnutrition (I recovered because my dad was killing himself with sleep deprivation then, injured himself, and got admitted to the hospital), or sleeping with abusive people, or binging to the point of obesity and blackouts.

It's so stupid and she's having a hard time herself, but I'm so insanely upset.

I will pay for her appointment as well just to prove that all these years of hell locked inside my cranium could've not happened had I gotten a proper treatment. To prove she also has issues that she needs fixed.

Three days ago I developed suddenly out of the blue, thoughts that I am the only being ‘real’ on this world. Something made me search the internet about it and a bunch of philosophers made me afraid of everything I had experienced in my life. I have been trying to fight it constantly on my own, with my mom’s help and my girlfriend’s help, since they too have suffered from similiar problems. The more I think about it the scarier it becomes. It made me doubt this world, people, emotions, thinking, history (if it happened at all or I just made it up), it doesn’t matter how many good arguments people have the subconscious doesn’t settle down. The only reason I am searching the web is because my mind is programmed to ask google for problems. I am having constant anxiety, loneliness, agony/ going through hell every second of my day. Deep down in me I know these thoughts are just thoughts, but it’s an ongoing battle between ‘me and myself’ and it’s not doing me any fagors. I am seeking help to make this pain go away, noz someone to explain to me why that might or might not be true. I just want to get my life back because these 3 days felt like another man’s life.

2671,bOAsAMA,1546614946,1,"Ok its a long story but i hope one of you will take time and read it all.  Just for context ill be briefly talking abt my past too.

So until i was in like 8th grade i had like super concentration (atleast it feels like that now). Which means if i wanted to concentrate on something even if boring i could be 95% focused in it. It atleast felt normal then as it was never any different.

So thats when i got hooked up with online gaming and my sleep pattern went to hell . I’d sometimes sleep 3 hrs a days sometimes went to bed at 9 while sometimes i’d sleep at 5 am eake up at 6 30 and go to school.

Before i realized gradually it was very very hard to pay attention for me . Even if i maintained sleeping pattern for weeks. This really bothered me for 3 years . I’d try really hard to focus in things just to prove to myself that i was still normal (atleast my normal).It fel like i was always in auto pilot mode and id try to be in the moment very hard but would only be able to focus for a little while only P.s however i was still doing okay in studies as i was a pretty good and well above average in studies before this but even after the onset i was still doing slightly above average. However the performance in my gaming was where it was verg troublesome , i was very good at it but i got stuck at somepoint after the onset , the auto pilot was really getting to me cause gaming requires you to be very in the moment unlike studies where you have time to recall stffs.

This really bothered me for abt 3 years and it was adding unwanted stress to me so one day i somehow decided id just stop thinking abt it and let auto pilot take me (kind weird but hope u understand it). After 3 years of stressing abt it i just wanted to stop worrying abt it .

I thought i had adhd then and really wanted to try aderral but its not availabe in my country so i never did and later found out that adhd onset happens quite earlier.

So 3-4 years later everything was good apart from the auto pilot thing which is still happening . I started to drink a lot not cause of anything serious but i joined a company with 3 other friends who all drank heavily everyday so i just picked it up. (I used to drink before but not that heavily and not that regular).

Now that i think abt it sometimes after 2,3 days of heavy drinking if my diet was somewhat not optimum and if i slept little id wake up slightly drunk and the first thing id want to do was drink (i was not that super alcoholic tho who had to drubk from morning just happened often). 

The first time it happened to me was when i was living in my office for a while cause it was near to our drinking spot and i could avoid drinking and driving . I was drinking heavily every evening and id go to office and smoke some weed with anothe rgroup of friends. I’d feel this feeling of euphoria and get things feeling where nothing mattered and i just disnt care abt anything. The first time it happened i spent a considerable amount of money (for me) just blew it up , i genuinely felt as if money was nothing but paper and its better to have fun while u can all that young wild free bullshit. And believe me it was not just a person blowing money while drunk, i had been very very drunk many times before this but this time it was quite different i was not even like super drunk like i used to be but my thoughts were somewhat not inplace and maybe even slightly delusional? Sounds a lot like i was in a manic state. And also i grew anxious after drinking a lot for few days (just evening tho) for example if a friend told me to treat him drinks just jokingly i’d feel like it would look like i was being stingy so i did treat !(and believe me i never really cared abt auch thjngs before)

It was still okay till this point i recovered fully after the state drank alittle leas for few days.

So after few months it was during festive season here in my country i drank a lot for 3 days straight and my diet was really poor during the three days , the third day i drank around 6 bottles of wine , 3 bottles of beer , and few glasses of whiskey frm morning till the next morning ( and it was after 2 days of heavy drinking and poor diet). And on that day i was hit with the “fuck everything” vibe i had just started saving a bit since i blew most of my money on alcohol and stupid stuff a good friend came to meet me and just asked if i had some money to lend him as he was going yo play cards on normal condition as i was hell bent on saving from a few days earlier id say atleast i was broke myself but i was on the 3rd day of drinking and was actually quite anxious due to alcohol so i started overthinking and gave him jy saving as lending (it wasnt much tho as i had just started ) and in spur of moment i too went with him to play cards . And thats when i added the 6 bottles of wine to alrdy drunk me , now i wasnt just drunk i was completely thibking differently at this point the same “fuck everything nothing matters “ kinda mood i literally won like a persons two month salary i like 3 hours cause i dint care at all and was playing quite loosely and betting big and luck was on my side normally even if iwas drunk id play small after wards and  try to save the money but as i literally didnt care abt anything the. I was giving money to anyone who was aking frome me playing big side bets even tho i didnt eant to but the guy besides me asked me and i said yes cause of anxiety and ehat not . I lost everything but i still did not care at all luls . I just eas so engrossed with playing cards and drinking i dint care if there was money on the pot or not i just wanted the feel of turning cards . And i forgot to mention i could onjy concnetrate on one thing that day so as i was playing cards i could not understand the conversation around me so if some one told me smthing id just hear my name and then had to to ask that person to repeat and then only could reply even if the person was right next to mr. so this happened and the net day too samehting happened i wastill drinking. Played cards won before lost later didnt care at all after everyone went home i played cards with a friend with no bet just cause i wanted to feel the thrill of pkaying cards till 7 am and then on the way tot home drabk some more till i finnalu felt super drunk and slept at friends hone woke up then while going hone everything felt weird . I felt confused and was even slightly confused find the way to my own home even though i travel the same road nearly everyday.

So that was a prety weird experience so idecised id not drink for a week or so but for three to 4 days after i still felt pretty weird and when people talked to me id feel kinda lost and confused an dsometimes couldnt understand ecen though i could hear waht they were saying . i thought it was alcohol myopia at the time. I felt extremely depressed the next day tho.

So i quit drinking for a week felt a little better but not as much as before when i felt normal . I again started drinking and after 4 evening of dribking it suddenly hit me i didnt care abt anything at all like even more than before , i was getting more anxious at the same time and it was a birth day party of a friend and i just sat there keeping quiet and was like kinda the party pooper for the day and i had not even drank that much that day just 2 pack of whiskey. So after that i was suddenly in delirium for the next 3,4 days.

It was nothing like before , all the weird ibstances before was nothing compared to this time and i wasnt even drinking. I could only focus on one thing while sober . Even when i was listening to someone i couldnt understan their point.  At the same point i felt quite irritated at other people . I started calling out. My coworkers every single simple mistakes . I had to make anyone asking me question repeat atleast two times before i could comprehend the question and even after that i would not know how to react it was like i want in the same thinking plane like the others . I also felt kinda superior to everybody at thesame time and felt kinda like i knew the truth , which tho normal people would not understand it and i was right in everything i did.

So ive kinda snapped out of it although i still think did things right in somethings which is probably me rationalizing for my weird actions but tho i dont have to make my peers repeat every questions i stil feel a slight bit of grandeiose and still feel weird in interactions and how to react even in normal situations and also i dont enjoy anyones company that much , normal talks which i used to take part on now feel like worthless garbage talk and fails to peak even a bit of my concentration . I fail to find joy in things i used to , just feels like im too mature or know much better than the person talking (i usually am right most of the time tho even before all these events but i used to fake enjoying or paying attention before but i just cant nowadays)

P.s although it may sound like ima chronic alcoholic im not as bad as i make it sound upwards haha . I dont have the pangs and dont suffer from withdrawal at all . Its just i used to drink plentifully quite regualarly but its still nothing compared to real alcoholics just reaaly above average tho. Its been a month since the delirium (which ithink was an episode of delirium) never checked . Ive drank only twice with weeks in gap that also. Just few packs . But i still dont feel the same as before the episode . 

Tldr : after 4 days of heavy drinking i had delirium while i was sober for around 4 days which gradually went down but even after a month i feel weird and really really differnet from before . The

2673,MikeyLikesIt89,1546614688,1,"First time poster. I apologize in advance if this is not the correct avenue to post this. I am half seeking advice and half unloading. I’ll try to be as concise and honest as possible. 

5 years ago my wife messaged me on Plenty Of Fish. I was 24 and she, 25. I stopped going to bars and clubs shortly after my 20s began because I was tired of one nighters. I looked for the love of my life from an early age. So there I was. Seeking. The message was refreshing. Full of context and genuine questions. We engaged and talked for a week or two before dating. Within a year we were engaged and married. 

I have been a soul seeker since 16. I have been interested in metaphysics just as long. My life’s journey leading to 16 was challenged with best friends dying in car accidents, divorced parents, and an alcoholic mother (at the time). I did everything in my power to find my true self. I have striven for harmony in myself and found it in my 20s prior to meeting my wife. I was at peace with myself and the world around me. I meditated daily. I exercised daily. I worked my dream job as a personal trainer and channeled my energy to others to help boost them to a higher state. 

The picture I painted of myself is just one dynamic. I am also a very sexually active person. I am a Taurus through and through. During the first 4 months of being with my wife she did not want to have any sex. She had sec prior to me, but wanted to wait for marriage for us. This was my first hint that there was some mental barriers for her. I am not saying that in any way shape or form her requests were outlandish. In fact it was refreshing. But it had me digging deeper. 

This lead me to learn about her past boyfriend of 4-5 years (on and off). He lied to her constantly and violated her trust. He had a child with another girl prior to them being together that he hid from her, etc. 

Knowing she had this “baggage” I was especially appreciative of her motives to withhold from sex. I tried sharing knowledge of practicing meditation, mindfulness, and other tools I had used to reach my own mental clarity. Things were going great, but I still needed a sexual outlet. 

I would use an email pen pal to “get off”. It was purely fantasy. These were strangers. I made the mistake of hiding them from her and I violated her trust in doing so. I took full responsibility for my actions. Apologized, and never did it again. To show my dedication and how true my love was for her, I proposed the next day. I wanted her to feel secure. I wanted to be with her forever. It felt right at the time. 

About a year after being married I stumbled upon some old emails between her and her ex. They were sexually explicit. Both of them sending videos of themselves masturbating (long distance at the time). I asked her why she still had them and she said she didn’t know she had them. So I asked her to delete them and reassured her it was ok. I believed her because she believed me about my emails being purely fantasy with no intensions. A few months later I find the emails still there. At that point I was upset. They were deleted for good shortly after. I worked through it with her and never lost trust. 

Another year or two pass and her trust issues have never healed. I have always thought they were never healed from her past relationship, but didn’t want to believe it. I wanted to be with her and support her in any way I could. She suggested seeing a couples therapist and I thought it was a fantastic idea. 

My wife has a tendency of not letting go. She lets her mind get the best of her and she gets stuck in thought patterns. She doesn’t posses the skills to disassociate with her “brain/mind”. So these trust issues have lingered for years. The therapist did a great job of giving her “homework” to teach her how to practice mindfulness. Over the course of a few months we saw him biweekly and it seemed like it was working. When he asked if we thought we were ready to stop seeing him she quickly answered yes, but I was hesitant. It took me years to reach a state of relative mindfulness. But I supported her decision and we left him. 

Since, she has expressed trust issues every month. At this point (5 years) I am worn out. I am an honest man. I am loyal. My life revolves around my family. I spend my days and weekends with my wife and son. I cherish every moment. I do not have a disloyal bone in my body. All of my is hers. 

We are going on a trip in February and my wife needed our marriage license to renew her passport. I thought it might be in my fire proof lock box that’s hidden away in our basement. So I find it and when we open it there were some condoms (from who knows when). She instantly became worried I was cheating on her. This morning after dropping my son off to school I went to the gym to socialize with the regulars. In fact I was showing them pictures of my wife and son when she began frantically calling me and texting me. I was engaged in conversation and did not want to be rude so I sent her to voicemail. I then get a text asking where I was and what I was doing. I excused myself and called her to find she was having an anxiety attack because she thought I was cheating on her. I remained calm and was able to calm her down. I told her I needed her to seek professional help. I did it in a respectful and calm way. I explained the number of factors (including our son and myself) that were at stake. She obliged and made an appointment. 

There are many more instances where my wife has had freak outs. Many, many more. Quite periodically in fact. I am constantly being questioned. I feel like an outsider or roommate in my own home. I left my dream job to chase other jobs that could provide more money to support our family. Mostly because my wife was afraid I would cheat on her with clients. I turned down 3 great job opportunities because of the same. I am no longer in a tranquil state of my life. I have gained 20 lbs.  My personal health has become less important to me. I feel disconnected from myself and my relationship. 

I am in no way perfect. I get grumpy. I get angry. I have my faults. I recognize them and try to grow and learn from them. Then I move on. 

At what point do I draw a line and make an ultimatum. I feel so alone and worn thin. I don’t feel loved or feel the love I had for her. 

I mostly think about my son. I am trying so hard to be supportive of her. I want to make this work so my son can have a stable family life to grow up in and flourish. 

So do I wait another 5+ months while she goes through therapy again? Will she ever be able to heal herself while she’s with me? ",mentalhealth,Trust issues,2019-01-05 02:11:28
2674,Renner-kun,1546613944,1,"OK, I'm finally doing it. I'm sick of feeling like shit. Let me introduce myself. I am a quiet person, I struggle to talk to people that I haven't spoken to in the last year or so. I am currently 19 and about to start my second year of uni in Australia doing bachelor of mathematics with a major in pure maths. I currently have a GPA of something like 6.9 and about 8 friends. Basically, when I started high school I didn't do much. I did well at subjects in general but was aimless. Later on I decided I liked science and wanted to be an astrophysicist. However I later realised that my main love was actually mathematics. However people often think this means I don't like other things. I am very into modelling (as in building models) and since the end of school have gained an appreciation of film and literature and the analysis that goes along with it. I also have a keen interest in history and politics etc. In fact there are very few things I don't find interesting as I have also been playing guitar for almost 9 years I think and love music theory. As you might have gathered I tend to do fairly well at most things I put my mind to. I however unless I put in an absurd amount of time I feel like I pick things up quickly but then stay mediocre. Due to this people seem to think I'm some kind of prodigy and I can do anything and everything perfectly and I think this and my personality have made me into an intense perfectionist. I don't have a job because I think I know sub consciously that if I get one I'll have a break down because currently, during semester I spend almost 8-10 hours a day doing work related to uni and only speak to my friends on weekends or if I see them around lunchtime. I never do work on Saturday as I am a Christian and I can't justify it to myself, however on Sunday's I will either play video games with my friends or I will do more work for uni. Recently however, playing games has stopped being relaxing a lot of the time and I find myself getting depressed over not being good enough. I feel like I either let my team/friends down if it's multi-player with them. Or I feel like I'm letting myself and someone else down if it's a Vs game because I don't play as well as I want to and the other person just gets to stomp me so neither of us have fun. 

Now that part of the issue is maybe clear I want to clearly state my almost constant fears because I need them out of my head. Some of these I have admitted before to either the uni counsellor or one particular friend, however I never admit to my friend in person and instead via text as I can actually do that. Firstly, I have a fear of being inadequate for myself or others. No matter how much I'm told that I'm not, I can't shake it. If I make a mistake or if I do something stupid I will just hate myself and feel terrible. For example the other day I was playing a game with some of my friends and I couldnt do something which got mad and I just quit and left, ruining everyone's fun. For like a day and a half after that I just kept replaying it and telling myself I don't deserve friends if thats how I'm going to treat them and it wasn't until I was convince by a friend that no one cared that I was finally able to come back. Secondly, I have a constant want to be alone, and yet a simultaneous fear of being alone and/or abandoned. I am a very introverted person and crave to be alone. For example I have a dream that one day I could go on a hike or something by myself or sit in a log cabin alone or most often I want to be in the middle of a huge city, high up, alone looking over everyone else and just seeing everyone but no one seeing me and I can just watch forever. But then, often when I am put in situations when I am alone I become depressed and feel extremely lonely and I'll tell myself I'll always be this way and that no one could ever love me. I've never had a female friend and I genuinely can't talk to girls so why would I ever get a girlfriend or get married? I want so badly to be able to show my ability for love and affection but I can't because I can't even speak to people. I also have an immense desire to teach others what I know. I love the idea of tutoring and bring useful go someone else. I love seeing someone get it after I explain it but I often can't do that because if I see someone in need that I can help by explaining something I'm too shy to help them. If they ask I will, but why would they? Lastly, I am severely addicted to pornography. I hate that fact and I want to stop but I can't. I've tried so much but it just feels infinitely worse because I'm a Christian and I want to be able to love people and then I do that and it's just the worst. 

Anyway, I don't even know what I expect to get from this. I've admitted this kind of stuff before but I just had to get it out and I only have one friend to talk to about this stuff and I feel like I have bothered him enough. These are my issues, I need to resolve them, but I can't. It's not his problem, it's not your problem and yet I feel the need to burden others. Sometimes I really do hate myself.

Sometimes I believe my teeth are melting out of my head, other times I believe people are going to kill and replace my family. I have tons of hallucinations. Some repeatedly show up: a huge black bird, a man that watches me, and shadow people. Some physical hallucinations include me tasting blood in my mouth, or feeling pain from an imaginary knife stabbing me.

I(25f) am married, and have 2 children. A 5 year old daughter, and a 1 year and a half old son.

I asked for help to get better. Which costs money-treatment, medications, to see doctors.

2677,TacoTheTin,1546612359,1,"I'll just jump straight into it. I used to have panic attacks from an age so young I can't even remember and I still have them but before that I had asthma which just vanished; yes it is possible but unlikely. My panic attacks are set of by the feeling of being suffocated which now I think about it; it makes perfect sense.

Anyway at about 11 I had my first real gut wrenching panic attack, my brother sprayed deodorant in my face (for one reason or another)
and soon after I was screaming; clawing at my throat, thinking that i was going to die and so parents had to call paramedics out. Obviously I got to the hospital and it was all in my head. 

At around 14 I started smoking cannabis and after that the panic attacks became extremely intense and more frequent, every day from 14 to nearly 18 I lived in constant fear of my own mind. 

This also caused me to become obsessive with certain things I started washing my hands after everything I had touched, obsessively bitting my nails everyday, I couldn't eat food unless my dad had made it for me, I couldn't shower with water too hot (incase the steam made me feel as if I couldn't breath), I started clenching my fist whilst swallowing food because it became uncomfortable to do so and I locked myself away from everything and everyone. 

(I still do most of them it just isn't as bad now)

This caused me to fall into depression; which is less than pleasant, now understand I can't stand  pain at all and fear a slow death also self harm was off the table, so I decided to emotionally destroy myself by locking myself away more so than I already did; stopped seeing people entirely  lock myself in my room and barely even spoke to my family. 

Well eventually it became so bad it dredged up something that happened to me when I was a child which I had forgotten, it was that traumatic I had completely locked away. so I decided to then  go and get help I was diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety, I was given tablets that for 2 years a did well fuck all. 

I was on a job searching course at one point and due to my mental health issues and capabilities I found it hard to do this stuff unlike a normal person. This one time we went to a call centre which instantly I knew was a really really bad idea. (For me) 

The moment I got there I knew I was right I was in constant panic mode whilst trying to keep my cool and not drop to the floor infront of a group of strangers anyway after all of this we left for the train station and that was the first time I had contemplated suicide and actually meant it, as I heard the fast train approaching which would completely blow straight past the station I was at; my mind went to jumping straight infront of it. 

I had to hold on to rusty old metal fence squeezing it as if the world had turned on its side and gravity was dragging me towards the tracks *sounds dramatic I know but it is how it felt* 
the train went past and I had a sigh of disappointment/ relief. 

Anyway I got myself back to the doctors and got new and better medication which has made me a lot better, now during all of this time I have been  taking medication I have gone from 11 stone to 18 stone which Is now causing physical issue in my body like sleep apnea amongst other things

His brother and I agree he has a mental issue but we can’t figure out what it is.
Here’s what I know:
-He’s almost 30
-He constantly needs validation
-He gets very insecure when I take my shirt off and makes rude remarks about how I think “I’m the shit” and I’m a “pretty boy” just because I walk around my house comfortably and I have a six pack, big whoop right?
-He steals money from me when he gets the chance
-He throws away my stuff small by small pieces so I won’t notice 
-He basically does small stuff here and there to ruin my shit and inconvenience my life
-He does this no matter how nice I am
-I haven’t done shit to him mind you, I notice he has a mental illness so I’ve been ignoring it for months and just forgiving him 
-He feels the need to degrade everyone 
-He freaks out when he doesn’t get his way
-He WILL NEVER EVER EVER ADMIT WHEN HE IS WRONG, he would rather drag it out for an hour and act like we were arguing about something else!!! SERIOUSLY!
-He uses passive aggressive language against everyone to seem like he’s innocent but means harm with his words, he does this CONSTANTLY he just speaks to everyone like they’re an absolute idiot and they can’t see he’s being a dick
-He lies a lot 
-He will act like he is your friend but is faking everything like it’s nothing 
-He is extremely entitled... one day went rent was do, he said “well I don’t have all the rent and honestly I didn’t even need to give you this $100, I could’ve hid it and made you both pay for all of it”

He says he just “forgets” to do hw or just stops trying. He barely graduated high school and he’s already failing his first semester of college. We go to the same college and I found out he even dropped a class and hasn’t told our parents yet. It’s an expensive school and he’s already $15,000 in debt and doesn’t seem to care. He also gets involved in unstable relationships and friendships and gets in the middle of things that are dangerous and things he shouldn’t be involved in.
A year ago he was feeling suicidal and was hospitalized, but released early cus they thought he was fine. My parents just staged an intervention but it never helps. He just gets more depressed and angry and does worse and locks himself in his room and hurts himself. 
It’s really damaging my parents and I am angry at him. I know I shouldn’t be and I know how he’s feeling, but he was the favorite and was given everything he’s ever wanted but just can’t stop destroying everything and everyone around him.
I’m also scared for him because I don’t trust him to be alone with himself. He’s impulsive and angry and depressed and I’m terrified he’s gonna kill himself.

He’s been very dismissive about his mental health issues, and even though I saw that things weren’t how they were supposed to be, I didn’t know how to approach him about it without pushing him away even further.

Yesterday night he came home to our childhood home in the middle of the night, finally breaking down. He was crying so much that he was shaking, and just said *”I need help”*. He hinted to mom that he’s been self-medicating with alcohol to keep his horrors away, and I accidentally saw scars and welts on his arms when his long sleeved shirt rode up a little.

They (he and mom) had to wait in the Emergancy room for mental health for almost ten hours, and when they finally got to meet a nurse and a doctor, they told him that he *wouldn’t* get admitted to Emergancy Care to be on suicide watch, that they *wouldn’t* remit him to get help at the Mental Health For Young Adults unit, that they *wouldn’t* assign him a psychologist (if we want one for him, he’ll now because of this have to pay for any sessions completely by himself, and he has no income), and that if he has “any further issues”, he should contact a GP (general practitioner) later.

For reference, we live in Sweden. What can we do to help him now? He’ll get a GP appointment in a while, but I honestly don’t know how he’ll cope until then. I think I’ll need to stay at home and not leave him alone until then because I’m scared of what he’ll do now that he’s been turned away from Emergancy mental health care after FINALLY admitting how bad things were (they said, and I quote “the mental health care unit for young adults only care for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by now”, because they’re understaffed or something??).

I've been called every name you can ever imagine and even my own name has been mocked to the point that I get triggered when I hear my own name. My name is not common and I've only met two or three people with my name so I don't hear it often... But when I do it hurts me to hear that disgusting name that everyone hates and makes fun of. 

In 7th grade I moved schools and one of Eric's friends happened to move there too. He told everyone about how much I was hated at my old school and why I left it. At recess we would play ball tag and it was the entire class against me. As soon as I hit someone they would just give the ball to the fasted guy in the class who would hit me while they all ran away. I was held down and punched in the face and my nose bled a LOT to the point my entire face was covered in blood.

Once I got to high school, Eric and his friends also went to that school and carried the bullying there. I joined the football team and was actually pretty good. Then I injured my neck and found out I had fused neck bones from birth that caused me horrible pain when I had any contact that pushed my head back which halkens often in football.like reality altering pain that I can not explain. I was called a pussy and got harassed by all of the football players who were convinced to harass me and said I never belonged on the team anyway. 

I have played video games as my main way to escape reality since I was 8 years old. I estimate I've put on average over 15 years, 2000 hours a year except for the last 4 years of college where I have only put in about 1000.

I am no longer bullied in college and am in pharmacy school but I was abused by my dad until the age of 24 where I finally moved out all of my stuff while he was gone at work and never spoke to him or my sister again. 

Since I have been bullied and abused so much in my life I can not trust anyone. I secretly feel like every single person I interact with hates me, even if they are friendly to me. I feel like an outsider who doesnt belong. 

I'm doing well for myself. My part time job pays $25 an hour and I'm in pharmacy school with honors and will make a good living once I finish. I love giving people advice so that they can live a healthy and happier life. It is very rewarding to hear someone thank me for super simple things like ""I didn't realise my permanent stuffy nose was allergies and now I can breath again with Claritin!"" or to hear people say they can now walk again without pain after helping them find some proper extended release arthritis pain medicine. Or to prevent people from being harmed by a drug interaction.

Despite doing well, I feel guilty any time I spend money on myself. I work a lot and have a good paying pt job and make about 30 thousand a year while in school. As a result I can afford to buy myself stuff like good food, clothes, extras like headphones, have bought my own car in cash, have paid my school in cash, etc. Since I don't have any help from my parents and I don't want to get in to debt. When I spend $2 on coffee or $2000 on vacation, even though I can afford it and I work for my money, I just have this feeling like I'm an idiot and I'm indulging my stupid impulses that don't deserve to be satisfied. I deserve nothing.

Many days I want to kill myself but I know better. People out there have survived far worse. I still want to do it. I have made many plans. When I was 12 I pledged to jump off the bridge as my class biked over it for a field trip. In high school I tried to buy 20 oxycodone pills to kill myself but I was scammed. I wouldn't have taken them anyway and just gotten high. I barely ever drink but I do love opiates because they make all of my suffering go away. I do them only a few times a year and know better than to get addicted. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD and severe anxiety and i take Paxil every day which helps with the physical symptoms of anxiety but does not make my demons go away and stop tormenting me.

I have flash backs every day to my bullying. I think about my dad all day every day wishing he wasn't so terrible to me. I could write another post just as long as this one about all of the stuff he did to me but I don't have the time. He punched me in rhe dick for asking for a Gatorade once. Was incredibly vindictive and could hold a grudge for something minor you didn't even notice you did and bring it up days, weeks, months later. 

I am now on such a good path in life but every day I wake up and feel like it's only temporary after I endured so much suffering for so long. ",mentalhealth,I was bullied for all 12 years of elementary &amp; high school and it still hurts me as an adult,2019-01-04 19:09:35

I used to be a very optimistic person as well, and I still am, but I’m not emotional at all. I haven’t cried in months to the point that it is concerning and have felt indifferent towards almost everything, only strong emotions really resonating. I have been cautious to pull the “oh I must be depressed” card as I see teenagers say that all the time, but I truly don’t know what to do and honestly I’m scared to ask anyone. I recognized this in myself and got really into Jordan Peterson who has podcasts about these kinds of issues, but I’ve already lost any motivation or desire to listen to them.

I used to work out and eat moderately healthy but the past year has been so terrible for me. I almost died from drinking too much at my cousins wedding in the beginning of the year. 

I was sexually coerced for money at one of my jobs. It is a very lucrative job that does not require any sexual thing, but if you flirt (and drink) with client you are likely to get more money. This group of lawyers convinced me after several drinks to show my boobs and I did because I was drunk. immediately after I felt terrible and cried in my room for 5 hours and told my boyfriend what happened and he was very mad at first but was loving after taking a minute to think about it. It is still one of my deepest regrets in life. I quit this job.

My other job was very stressful this summer (busy season) and I worked 70 hours on my feet every week at a restaurant. I eventually had a mental breakdown and needed to leave one day. On top of that, I started school in August and on one of the really busy nights during the UFC fight it was packed. I was taking care of a table and I heard a gunshot go off. I hid with the rest of my table (children included) behind a wall until I didn’t hear anything except people running. I ran to the stairwell and I learned from one of my coworkers that my other coworker had been shot. Over a bar fight. He was very well loved. I watched his bloody body get CPR before whisked off in an ambulance. I never stop thinking about this day. I went to collect my belongings and saw blood everywhere on the floor. He died that night.  I can’t stand when people ask me about this (in line at the grocery store when I’m wearing my uniform, at work, when I tell people where I work). This has been a very traumatic incident for me and I’ve talked to a counselor and I was doing okay for a bit but the thoughts just keep coming back. The counselor was through the school but we had our last session and things are getting worse.

I forgot my best friend invited me to her birthday party 4 times over the past week. I showed up to her house with a gift and she said “you’re coming right?” I had to borrow all of her clothes and makeup. She was a little mad but glad I came in the end. I just feel so shitty about everything. I feel like a terrible person. 

I haven’t felt like myself in over a year. I never workout anymore (one thing I loved doing). I eat out all the time and drink much more than I used to. Everything sucks right now.

Anyways I don’t know if I’m supposed to be posting this here but I don’t know where else to post it. Someone please just help me I don’t know where to go from here.

So, basically, for the past few years, I've had severe depression. I was suicidal, I self-harmed, I had isolated myself from everyone I loved because I thought that they all hated me, I was stuck in this dark pit which I couldn't get myself out of. Finally, after ages of my friends and family begging me to get help, I went to therapy.

Therapy helped me a lot, surprisingly. I went for an appointment once a week, and when I saw that only consultation wasn't helping, I convinced my parents to let me get antidepressants, and I was prescribed Prozac. The medication, along with consultation and major lifestyle changes, helped me a lot and I can very proudly say that I've overcome my depression. I no longer need the medication, and have stopped going to therapy as my therapist said I don't need it anymore.

I've felt happier than I've felt in ages, and I'm proud of myself for finally taking the steps to betterment.

However, now the problem is, whenever I feel sad, I'm scared. Whether I have a reason to or not, I worry that it's my depression returning and my life will be spiralling out of control again. It's as if I've completely forgotten that I'm allowed to feel sad, and it doesn't immediately mean I'm depressed, but when I do feel any sort of negative emotion I start thinking I'm relapsing and only make myself feel worse.

I don't really know what to do and how to fix this, and whether it's normal to feel this way. People who overcame depression, did you ever feel this way for the first few times? I'm insanely concerned that this isn't normal, and there's an underlying problem which I need to address.

TL;DR I had really bad depression which I overcame, but now whenever I feel sad I'm worried that it's my depression returning and I don't know what to do.",mentalhealth,"I (19/F) had depression, and now I'm scared whenever I'm sad.",2019-01-04 17:21:18
2706,gakore,1546582742,1,"In my early teens and a little depressed but not here to talk about that. Don't know when this started, but essentially when a person or an animal does something I don't like I guess? (not entirely sure what triggers me) I get real pissed of and yell, curse, and always threaten the person wether it's with a first in their face, or verbally. when it's an animal I go really hands on and man handle it. I don't know why I do this, and that pisses me off even more because I generally love animals and love to talk to people. And I get depressed when I later calm down because I scream at myself that I'm mentally fucked or something. Anyways an example of me getting angry was when I was at school with a group of  friends. We were playing tag or something (because high school can be elementary School if we want it to be) and I got real pissed of at my friend for saying something I don't remember and I arm bared him to the ground and pulled his arm to drag him. uuugh it makes me shiver to think how fucked up that was because when he came up to me and asked why I did that, my response was to say I don't know, and run away to almost cry in the hallway. When playing with my dog he'll get riled up and play this run in circles and nip game and it pisses me off that I have to use actual effort to catch him cause he's very fast and agile. When I have him I don't hurt him, would never think about doing that. I just trip him to the ground softly, he's so excited he doesn't care, and he'll keep nipping. So I put my hand on his face to keep his mouth away while my other hand is in his body telling him on the ground. I just wonder if I'm not abusive by doing this? Because I feel I am and it makes me feel like a bag of shit.

I used to think that pushing through all this was so I could ""do my own thing"" together with him once she was off doing her own thing but I don't even know what that is anymore. I used to think it would involve art but I lost what little inspiration I had when I got pregnant and it never really came back. School is expensive so finishing my degree is not an option. Hobbies are expensive so exploration of interests is extremely limited and just painful. We have so much debt I'm starting to doubt it will ever be gone and afraid we're going to be stuck here in a place we hate for the rest of our lives. Previous attempts to live elsewhere have failed. I'm geographically and emotionally isolated from anyone I ever called a friend and convinced it's better for them this way because no one likes a chronically depressed wet blanket which is what I've become. Trying to make new friends destroyed the last vestiges of my self esteem (please no platitudes about how they were the wrong people and I should keep trying). I've lived so long without getting things I wanted that I don't know what I want most of the time. Routine rules my life. Sleep, eat, work, provide for others, repeat. I'm 35, that's too young to be just waiting to die but I don't know what else to do with myself beyond raising her to adulthood. I'm so unhappy. And tired. And lonely. And done. Everyday I find myself thinking ""I'm done."" There is no more magical someday. It's passed and I didn't even try to catch it so now I'm just waiting to die and trying not to drain too much from anyone else. And I have no one I feel safe talking to about it except you, kind reader. Thank you for getting to far.",mentalhealth,Waiting to die,2019-01-04 14:42:42
2719,furry_dracone,1546573169,1,"I'm losing my damn mind. **Warning: Gross.**

*TL;DR: My grandparents overall treat me as an accessory to their happy marriage than an independent person. I'm the only one taking care of them (&amp; the only one who can), and my grandma in particular is pissing me off to the point I'm starting to lose control.* 

What tipped this off: My grandma can't control her bladder very well post-surgery, which is reasonable. What isn't so reasonable is her utter absence of respect or decency. She's totally OK with doing the same things around me she'd do around her husband any time - Changing clothes and also, using the port o potty type thing, which is in the central room of the house. This is the room with the TV and their bed, where the three of us convene every night. There is no way to enter or exit either my bedroom, or the house at large, without passing through this room. 

My grandma is totally OK with just stripping naked, and/or sitting down to pee, with me present. She makes no attempt to warn me. I have expressed my disgust and displeasure multiple times, and at least twice now asked her to at least let me know so I can clear out of the room/avoid it, but she doesn't, and both of them act like I'm being unreasonable when, I get pissed off when I'm playing video games only to hear piss and fart noises 6 feet from my left ear. Or catch naked grandma in the corner of my eye, drop the controller and run, and then get pissed off and ask her AGAIN to tell me first. 

The way I function in this household, my job is to encourage whatever they want to do to keep their morale up, and cook meals. They do genuinely care about me on some level - My granddad's generously offered to drive me around so I can finally get a job outside of patting their asses full time - but from the minute I wake up to just after they go to bed, I can't have plans. I can't leave because I can't drive &amp; it's not safe to walk/bus. I get up, do what I'm told, feign excitement, remember all the shit for them that they can't, and don't get to start MY day until between 8 and 10 PM. 

My grandma's gross actions only make a feeling I was having that much clearer - She acts around me like I'm not there, or like I get treated the same as her husband, because all I am is an accessory. Something that's there as an add-on to their married life to make the quality of life better. Maybe she doesn't remember to respect the boundaries I've tried over and over again to enforce because she forgets I'm someone other than a mini version of her husband. (She's not generally a mean person, so she's not doing this on purpose.) 

Every time one of them pisses me off (mostly her) I have to physically run away, turn a corner where they won't see me, and start beating my own face, pounding the wall, stabbing the air, etc. My friendly, coping facade has started to crack, too - I've started blowing up at both of them. I don't want to be like this - I want to be the best version of myself. But I can't do that here; and, worse, I'm terrified I'm turning into the same angry monster that I spent my childhood being traumatized by. Something very scary is splitting the seams of my carefully reconstructed-post-trauma personality.

Even if I tell them how upset I am about all of this, nothing will change. They already know I'm unhappy living here and are working on fixing up an apartment property we already own so I can reasonably live there (the walls and electrical systems are all busted), but until/even when I move out, nothing can possibly change. If no one's looking after them, their quality of life- with one tired all the time and one losing their marbles -is going to degrade fast; I'm the only one who can, as my mom doesn't have the sanity to even stay for dinner without getting pissed off at them, and there's no one else in the family.

It’s really confusing to me because I only care about myself, while at the same time, no one could hate me more than I do. 
I’ve been diagnosed with PSTD (personally disagree with this one) Depression NOS, and ADHD inattentive.
Is this a symptom of anyone of these disorders?

It’s just been a matter of waitlists and the like. And getting help for mental health issues. I’m back on medication and went back to therapy. But it isn’t helping. My issues have changed but they aren’t better. (Ex with anxiety I don’t have anxiety anymore generally. But I will have random somewhat extreme panic attacks that come with almost no warning, aren’t connected to each other in any obvious ways, and are overall more frequent than before.) I’ve tried a few different things but nothing has been good. With medication I have kept getting horrible side effects, or just haven’t really worked, And with therapy I’ve burned through 3 in a year. I was with each for a full month at minimum meeting regularly but there were major issues with each. The first was pretty focused on my sex life (he partly blamed porn and my bisexuality on my depression), the second was part of a study where they had to do it in a specific way, filling out sheets with them, and the 3rd was just kind of clueless She would forget major details, she wouldn’t use proper pronouns, and she didn’t understand most of my experiences so she would rephrase my issues and if I said no that’s not the actual issue she would repeat it until I agreed. (Ex. I said I wanted to talk about grief bc my close friend died a few years ago and it was near the anniversary. She said it was bc I was grieving the person I could have been, when I disagreed, she said “that could be the reason but I really think it’s this even if subconscious,” and spent the entire time trying to make me talk about that instead of my friend whose death I was actually struggling with). I’ve done a few other things here and there such as meditation, yoga, general exercise, zentangling, etc. I want to get better and I’ve been depressed for almost a decade now. I know that I can’t handle it, much less fix it. But nothing has really worked, is there alternatives, or a better way to do the things I’ve done before. (Ex. How do I find a good therapist.) I’ll get some help later since I’m waiting for appointments but it would be nice to do something in the interim because it will take a while and I don’t think the things I have set up will fix everything.

2729,Yeah_Good_Point,1546569991,1,"I’m 30 y.o., have a beautiful wife and 1 year old daughter. I’m writing on here because I’m getting desperate. I’ll try to keep this as brief and concise as possible. 

This mainly has to do with my work life. I’m an introvert leaning person working in a extroverted workplace (construction management). Work is very challenging/stressful and the hours are very long. I’ve always felt like I didn't fit in this industry, but it's what I went to school for and I actually landed a job with a great company. From the start I’ve felt very insecure at work and feared my coworkers could see right through my lack of confidence. I figured that if I just stick with it, I’ll eventually gain enough experience to be confident and happy. 

Fast forward 5 years and I’m now in a leadership position making a great wage with great benefits. I’m very new to managing people (5 guys directly under me now) so that’s adding to my anxiety. But just in general, I’ve NEVER felt comfortable in my own skin at work. I’m very quiet, like to keep to myself, dread going to lunch or really just interacting with most of my co-workers. I could get away with this in my old role, but its causing me to fail as a manager. 

I also feel like my insecurities are keeping me from communicating well. With 5 years experience, I now have plenty of advice and knowledge to share. But I feel like there is this big wall in my brain, keeping me from accessing information that I KNOW that I have. I get so nervous and uptight when it's my turn to speak. I can't even joke around with my co-workers properly, I just feel so strained and fearful that I’m going to say something stupid, or embarrassing. I just feel like every conversation I have, I’m constantly thinking about how to not make that interaction awkward and it almost always has the opposite effect. 

I don't want to put alcohol on a pedestal, but almost all of these problems go away when I have some drinks with co-workers. I hear all the time, “Wow, L is so fun when he’s drinking!” and, “You’re like a totally different person!”  or they say jokingly, “You should drink at work! You really open up!”. I’m famous for having this “dual personality” and its become unhealthy as I’m always encouraged to drink more when I’m with them. 

I could go on but I’ll stop there. My wife suggested that I take counseling and I think that’s a good idea. ",mentalhealth,I've been struggling at work for years and need a turning point.,2019-01-04 13:46:31

2733,Rydgadurmalmur,1546567288,1,"About 3 years ago I started experiencing minor anxiety attacks. I used to smoke weed at that time but stopped around the time I got my fourth anxiety attack. It started out as some sort lf anxiety regarding my health, constantly worrying about diseases and all kinds of sickness. These were pretty text book examples of anxiety according to my therapist and he told me not to worry too much about it. I took his advice and continued my life.

A couple of weeks later I was on a bus with a friend of mine when I suddenly get this strange feeling that something is wrong. I try to ignore it but I was starting to feel sick. My mind started spinning and I felt like the walls were closing in. I felt extremely dizzy and could hardly hear what my friend was saying. I started to panic and asked the driver to stop, which he did. As soon as he stopped I ran out in terror. I felt like I was about to die. I tried to take a deep breath, but the air felt so thick around me. All of a sudden I felt like I was dreaming, which alarmed me even more. I felt trapped and I wanted to wake up somehow. I felt like everything was an illusion and my whole body was in state of panic. My friend managed to get me home, where I went straight to bed and when I woke up I felt better. 

After this incident I started seeking help. I told my therapist about it and she told me this had been an extreme panic attack. She explained to me how the mind can sometimes play tricks on you and make you feel like you’re in danger when you aren’t. She told me that my former weed habits had probably sparked this a little and that I needed to give my mind some rest, which I had been doing. 

I isolated myself for some time out of fear. I went to see all kinds of doctors but nobody could give me a clear answer to what I was dealing with, but they all agreed that it was some sort of anxiety. Some said I was bipolar. I started experiencing panic attacks regularly, but nothing compared to the one I experienced in the bus. These panic attacks were always related to me feeling like everything was unreal, an illusion. For example, I started thinking about the meaning of life a lot, and how life existed and how the world was made. You know, those kind of thoughts. Whenever I began thinking about this, I would feel like I wasn’t real and started panicking. This was a mix of confusion over how I could possibly exist and the feeling that nothing was real. It always made me dizzy and begin to panic.

Over the years I have gotten better. I still get minor panic attacks here and there but nothing serious. However, tonight as I’m writing this, I experienced a bigger panic attack than I’ve had in a long time. It started out from similar thoughts as I described earlier and a sense of panic and confusion. I’m calmer now but started wondering if anyone out there has had similar experiences?

I talk too much, too loud, and about things no one really cares about. I have never had a romantic relationship longer than a few months. I haven't dated anyone in over a year.  I also have never really dated someone I didn't meet while in high school, nor have I really made many long term/close friends out side of high school (although I realize this is true for more than a few people). 

How can I reconcile that I am incapable of forming meaningful relationships with people with my desire to be social? I've made friends online, but that always implodes.

It eats away at everything and constantly leaves me in a state of feeling both empty yet filled with every emotion at the same time. The anxiety and the paranoia of growing up in such shit situations has and forever will have me mentally messed up.  

I can’t listen to people yell without having a full blown anxiety attack. I can’t have my narcissistic step dad get angry at me without sending me into a depressive episode. I can’t be around my dog or be around people eating without having my blood boil. I can’t just expect to have a normal day without going into a daydreaming episode. I overthink. I overeat. I undereat. For fucks sake, I’m eighteen years old and I have a bald spot. 

It sucks. It sucks it sucks. I need help, I need therapy, I need medication. I’m so so so fragile inside of my head, but on the outside I put on this stupid persona pretending to be totally okay for people and I’m tired. 

No, I am not okay. But I’ll tell you I’m okay because I can’t explain why I’m so sad. Even if I did try to explain, everyone I try to talk to always says stuff like, “Oh Im so sorry” and “It gets better with time!” NO. Stop telling me that. Stop telling me that things will eventually get better because no, no they won’t. At least not anytime soon, for me.

I like schedules. I like things to stay the way they ARE. Holidays mess up my schedule. Holidays mess up my head because they do nothing but become a constant reminder that I am *fucking alone*. I’m so tired of being alone and I’m so tired of not getting the help that I need. 

I can’t have my daydreams properly right now because my step dads work schedule is weird at the moment, so he is home either all day or earlier than usual. I can’t daydream at night because my floor is creaky and I have to pace when I daydream. I have to talk when I daydream and I can't do that at night because everyone in the goddamn house is asleep. 

In order to satisfy my mind I have to pace in the kitchen and listen to music really, really loud. I have to make the hand movements, I have to talk. I have to talk. I can’t do that when my step dad is home because he judges me and thinks I’m weird. I can’t help myself. I can't not talk to myself. I can't still still during my dreams.

In school he was pretty badly bullied mainly for being shy, and has had extreme social anxiety for as long as I can remember because of this. So much so that I'm pretty sure he basically doesn't talk to anyone outside of work and my parents back home. And when I say extreme social anxiety I really mean it, he struggles to get a sentence out even when he's talking to me.

So cut to about 4 years ago, and I get a phonecall from my sister telling me that he had a breakdown and told my parents that he was contemplating suicide. He went to counseling for about 6 months, and then flat out refused to go after that stating that he was better and he wasn't having anymore suicidal thoughts. Then as time went on it kinda just seems that everybody in my family completely forgot about that period of his life, including me to an extent. I stopped messaging him as much, and only really talked to him when I went back home every 5/6 weeks.

So he's been working in a grocery store for the past five years, day in day out doing the exact same thing. This is nearly what kills me most as he is capable of so much more, he has a university degree in a really sought after field! So I came home for the holidays for a couple of weeks for the first time in about 8 months and just noticed how down and out he seemed to be, like he has just resigned himself what he's doing now. I tried asking him how he's doing and he kept saying he's fine even though I know that's probably not true, but I know I can't force him to tell me how he's feeling. I can tell he thinks that nobody cares for him, but I really really do. 

I live in a different country now so keeping in touch with him is even harder now, and I just have this awful sinking feeling that I'm gonna get a phonecall one day saying something terrible has happened.

I have no idea why I'm posting this now, I have to get up for work in 3 hours, but I just can't get him off my mind. I've told him and my sister to come over and visit me in a couple of months, so he has something to look forward to but I dunno if that's gonna help. My sister is the only other person in my family that I can talk to about this sort of stuff, and I know telling my parents about the worries I have just won't help.

I cant pay attention for longer than a few seconds, I cant memorise more than a word.

I feel like I had a little (just a little) trouble with mental health before but the breakup and going to university ended up being the major triggers for a more serious illness. Its been a year and a half since I moved to university and about 7 months since I broke up. I feel like I’ll never be able to feel ‘love’ again, especially because of how hard I find it to connect with people. I constantly day dream about what I felt and how badly I want to feel something other than hurt and betrayal. My memories are now screwed up, I cant differentiate between whats real and whats not. I feel as if everything that I had, the memories where I was happy, all that is a blur, a dream. It isnt real even tho I know it is.

I have tried socialising, Ive made new friends, Ive gotten into art again, I play the piano, Ive pushed myself a little out of my comfort zone (not too much as I get anxious then) but nothing seems to help. At the end of the day, I still cant get over what happened. And I am super tired and exhausted of being this way, I genuinely want to be happy, healthy and I want to move on. Please help? Any advice on heart break, moving on, dealing with anxiety/anxiety attacks, depression, insomnia, learning to make sense of memories, fixing your learning abilities that have deteriorated due to mental illness or maybe just encouragement is welcome!
Im sorry if any of this doesn’t make sense or if I missed out stuff. 💕",mentalhealth,help!,2019-01-04 12:22:42

I'm 100% sure my dad is bi-polar. His whole family has a history of depression and various mental illnesses. His sister takes medicine for her bi-polar disorder. He refuses to get help though. For a few days, he'll be a great dad. We have similar interests and we can watch a movie together and have lots of fun. Then later he'll constantly get mad at everything, he'll stay in his room all day and not do anything. He'll lash out and scream and cuss at everyone. He'll ""punish"" us by slapping our arms. He'll randomly have really angry outbursts. It's so scary how he'll change from a really sweet guy to a person I'm scared of.

I don't really blame him for it. His parents divorced without really telling him when he was 5. His mom just took all the kids 20 hours away from their home. When he went back to live with his dad when he was a teenager, I'm pretty sure he was abusive to him. My grandpa probably has some form of bi-polar as well.

My mom I think has anxiety. It'll come on slowly, but she'll rage at the tiniest thing and take it out on me and my siblings. She once got so anxious last year that she made me drive her home from work before I even had a learners permit. It was only a mile or so away, but she definitely had a panic attack. She'll shake and have to lie down. When it happens, she can't handle anything. She had to be hospitalized for stress a while ago, but she hasn't done anything to help herself since. I also think my mom has some kind of paranoia due to her believing conspiracy theories and completely freaking out about things on the news (Ebola, etc) She also micro manages everything we do. If my hair isn't quite perfect or something like that, she'll leave me home. We live in the country so I can't take a bus to school instead. She will also say really cruel things about people when they're right next to her.

My mom and dad both seem to hate each other too. I think they'll probably divorce in a few years. My dad is paranoid that my mom is cheating on him (though she isn't) and yells about it in front of my younger siblings. My mom tries to make every conversation about how much she hates him, also in front of my siblings. They yell and cuss at each other late at night.

I think this is affecting my siblings. My 8 year old brother gets really angry about everything and got in to a fight with a kid at his school. My 11 year old sister has really bad self esteem and overeats from stress. My youngest sister who is 7 is constantly crying about something and will break in to tears at the drop of a hat. My 14 year sister just hides in her room and never really talks to anyone. My dad in one of his rages threw away her clothes for being ""showy"".

I'm 16 in a month, and will graduate a year early, so I can get away from this soon, but I'm scared about my younger siblings. I don't want my brother to become my dad. I don't want my sisters to always be sad.

I feel bad for saying I hope they divorce, but if they did, our home life wouldn't be nearly as toxic. I can't force them to get help, no matter how much I try. I love them both, and when they're normal, I know they love me. They buy nice presents for us on Christmas and they feed us. They aren't neglectful. I just wish they'd help themselves.",mentalhealth,My parents are mentally ill and they won't get help.,2019-01-04 12:10:14
2742,Rixe,1546562790,1,"I've been writing down all of my symptoms for the first time - I've previously held back because of worrying I'll be seen as crazy, even by professionals. I can't help but wonder what they're indicative of.

* Severely low mood and barely able to function - massive cognitive impairment compared to how I am when able to function

* Showering and household tasks are extremely difficult - uni work almost impossible to complete at the moment, especially with it being related to psychology

* Started a job in June that I only lasted three weeks at - had been experiencing some lethargy before then but that started a downward turn towards feeling useless.

* Found out stepdad has advanced cancer which knocked me further down, even with counselling my mood was still relatively low and my attendance suffered.

* I've been upping sertraline dose at doctor's recommendation and it is having absolutely no effect, even at 150mg a day.

* I experience thoughts of being killed and maimed extremely often, kind of like a twisted form of daydreaming

* Suicidal thoughts have been increasing but upon discussing it out loud, it is more a desire to change my identity (one of them was walking out and disappearing completely)

* Past abuse as part of a friendship make it hard to make close friends - being told constantly that I was disturbed for 3 years whenever I displayed any sort of new depression symptom (at the time not knowing what it was). I'm worried any new friends will inevitably abandon me after I become too full on with them. I rarely get past this hurdle but I have recently and I was ecstatic - my new friendship has now calmed down to a more normal level.

* Obsession with wondering what is wrong with me to be this way - I constantly research mental disorders and I know better than to self diagnose and advertise that I do this, but it's a great source of distress to not know exactly what is up with me. I've been worried about this for years and nothing has ever come of it other than depression and anxiety from a GP.

* Overattachment and oversharing with a new friend when I get too close to them - rejection often happens after this and I get very depressed and inconsolable for some time. 

* Mood changes very quickly in response to triggers, a good thing will make me very happy for a little while and a bad thing happening will ruin my entire day.

* Emotions feel intense and out of proportion - I feel like I'm way more emotional than everyone else and react far more, but I've gotten better at trying to  make myself look like I'm responding more normally.

* I will often break boundaries and try to overextend myself into my friends' affairs in an attempt to make myself useful then hate myself for it.

* I'm scared of intimacy in case the other person sees just how crazy I am - though my relationship with my current partner has been two years of him being very understanding.

* Automatically assume people don't like me and can sense how unstable I am.

* Urges to self harm and overdose - haven't done it because of partner

* Feeling incompetent compared to ""normal"" people, especially with work related matters. I can't seem to hold onto a job any more.

* Starting to feel like I'm losing my grip on reality, dissociating more and narrating life in third person as I do things, as well as treating inner thoughts as a conversation between two sides of myself.

* Nightmares about being hunted and chased and held hostage by the aforementioned toxic long gone friend who i haven't even seen in years, as well as my rapist ex who I've been free from for three years this year.

* Try to downplay illness to seem more sane - even to professionals

* Hid and downplayed it all to my partner for fear of abandonment and the shame of being like this

* Repression led to it all coming out at once now",mentalhealth,Trying to get together symptoms to mention to a psychiatrist,2019-01-04 11:46:30

I’ve been to a few different therapist and they’ve all said they recommend me to talk to a psychiatrist and get onto some antidepressants but I never thought of myself as “bad enough” to take that step (bad though to have- I know). The thing is, I’ve always been told by my parents that they don’t want me to be dependent on medication and I guess it’s just instilled into me. I’m also afraid of other side affects like weight gain (I’m very triggered by my weight as I’ve always struggled with body dysmorphia/ED) and a medication making me worse than actually helping me. Not to mention I don’t even know if my insurance will cover that. I’m also afraid to tell my mom that I’ve been having more frequent suicidal thoughts.

2748,Angel_Piper,1546561186,1,"So here’s the deal

I have a lot of drivers anxiety because of my experiences with drivers ed and behind-the-wheel instruction with a driving school

Drivers ed did nothing but use scare tactics to keep us from thinking about drinking and driving or not wearing a seatbelt, we barely learned anything about actual DRIVING in the course but instead watched testimonials of scarred car crash survivors, a graphic re-enactment of a teen dying in a dui car crash, people getting ejected from cars, cars getting crushed by trains, all the really bad stuff. The health teacher also loved to remind us we were driving a literal hunk of metal that could at any moment kill someone or lead to our deaths. And this was just the beginning

Then I got to taking driving lessons and boy did that leave a lasting impression. The driving school sent over an old man, he was grumpy and just overall not a patient man who should be teaching 16 year olds to drive

Every single mistake that first day lead to being SHOUTED at. He stressed me out to a point where I actually almost crashed the car on the first day (leading to me thinking what my health teacher told us was true, and I was eventually going to get someone killed) I started to avoid lessons, we reschudualed multiple times because he gave me panic attacks and my parents REFUSED to call the school and ask for a different instructor. He’d get annoyed with me because I’d only want to drive around parking lots because he’d made me scared of driving on streets where I could possibly hurt someone, because I felt like I was a horrible driver.

After that I barely practiced driving with my parents, and when my schedualed test rolled around we canceled it and rescheduled, only to cancel that appointment and never reschedual.

Now I’m turning 19 in a few weeks and I still don’t have a license since I can barely drive,my permit is expired too so I can’t practice anymore. I don’t like driving past other cars, 18 wheelers give me panic attacks, I feel like I’m operating a death trap every time I’m behind the wheel, and I’m convinced I’ll always be an asshole and a leech who relies on others to drive me around

I feel like my anxiety is never going to let me learn how to drive, and any therapist I’ve talked to has just said to just drive and get over it

2749,blueybluel,1546560451,1,"This misophonia is literally ruining my life. When I was a teenager, my dad would go to pee and leave the door open, and it sounded SO LOUD. I'm a girl, so I couldn't understand why he was peeing so loudly. Was he just pouring a bucket of water into the toilet from five feet up? Was his urethra the size of a golf ball? Why was he so loud? It was upsetting to me, so I had to leave the area whenever he would go to the bathroom.

Ever since, I couldn't stand to hear ANYONE pee. It felt like just hearing the sounds was FORCING me to think about other people's genitals and how exactly they were making those sounds excreting liquid, against my will. To this day, I still plug my ears whenever I use the toilet. I'm used to it now, so I don't think much of it and just habitually do it.

Now it has become every liquid sound, such as turning the faucet on, faucet dripping, dogs drinking water, dogs licking their lips, etc. I'm fine when I'm washing the dishes myself, probably because I'm the one in control and I can see everything that's happening, so I don't have to have an imagination about the sound. When I can hear other people turn the faucet on outside the room, though, I can't stand it. I have to plug my ears and hum to drown my eardrums out until they're done, but usually when I unplug they're not done, and I still hear the sound, and I lose my mind with anger and frustration.

2750,Ilikeus1110,1546560437,1,"Hi everyone,

So I’ve struggled with mental illness for almost all of my life.  

During the past six years things have gotten dramatically worse. I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and moderate depression. I’ve wanted to get better since then but ive been struggling   With consistency and perseverance. All I wanna do is avoid the reality of life and how far away I am from being normal. I do this through shopping, tv, or just doing anything that doesn’t make me think about my issues. Every time I try to do therapy, I feel extremely unmotivated, sad and just can’t focus for shit.  I’m just extremely tried and sad most of the time. 

In addition, I haven’t had the best experiences with therapists.i’ve seen a couple throughout the years and honestly they barely helped me at all. They didn’t  even seem to care or take me seriously. And For some reason, exposure isn’t working as good as it should for me.  despite how many times I try to gradually face my fears I’m still the same. In regards with cognitive restructuring, I have no idea how to do it. I don’t know where to start, how to do it right or anything like that. How am I supposed to think straight and change my thoughts? 

I’m just so tired of life and the way I live it. I’m not living  guys, I’m just rotting.

I want to reduce my anxiety and depression but I don’t know where to start. I have major self esteem issues that I believe are like the core of my anxiety and depression.  And also I  suspect I have body dysmorphia as well. 

I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts.

2751,JustYourFriendlyNPC,1546558706,1,"I met this girl online when I was a depressed, suicidal, kissless handholdless virgin. I was 20 at the time and she was 19.

I thought she would be my manic pixie dream girl that would save me from my misery. Meeting her for the first time felt exhilarating. I had my first kiss, we held hands. But I soon realized that I rather fell for the idea, not the actual person. I didn't really love her, couldn't feel ""the butterflies"", but I liked the carnal aspect of it all. But I didn't told her the truth, because I wanted to lose my virginity to her. She knew I was a virgin and she was one too. A perfect scenario for not-so-attractive young male as I was. I was thinking that I couldn't let the chance slip. I stuck in a long-distance relationship with her for sex and out of fear of being alone, even though she had a fair share of her own psychological issues (mild BPD, self-harm, suicide attempts in the past etc) and we didn't click as good as I thought we would.

Two and a half years later she cheated on me multiple times with some guy she met through her friends in her home city. She said she also kissed other guys (and girls), one of them way earlier, when we were 1.5 years into the relationship. It's strange that I felt devastated even though I didn't really love her. Can someone explain this? Am I a narcissist? Possessive? Or maybe I did love her, after all?

Anyway, for my own sanity I cut all contact with her. Shortly after that she had a suicide attempt. After leaving the psychiatric ward, she tried reaching out to me, asking for forgiveness and wanting to ""be friends"", but I had always stated that I didn't want to keep in touch. But I also felt guilty for not being honest with her all along. So last time she contacted me, I told her that I hadn't really loved her and I apologized. She was a bit upset and even spiteful in response, but then said she's not angry with me. Me, on the other hand, can not really forgive her nor forget what she has done, even though I am no saint myself and would have probably cheated on her as well, given the chance. I guess I got what I deserved.

What bugs me is that telling her the truth didn't bring me a sense of closure. Every time I reply to her, I feel like she gains some power over me. I don't want her to know that I somehow still care. I instantly feel much worse. I am scared to death to admit any weakness before her. I still feel humiliated by her. She clearly has no respect for me, since she keeps contacting me even though I don't want it. Is she manipulating me?

In June me and my boyfriend, who where living together for a year and have been together for 3,5 years, decided to buy an apartment together. We went through the whole process, looked at apartments, found a really great appartement in one of the best streets in the city, we went to the bank, got a loan and even signed the papers.

2756,sm441709,1546556294,1,"Hello all. I have a brother-in-law (BIL) (m26) who I believe needs treatment/therapy. He has always displayed a lot of signs of Asberger's/Autism spectrum: very quiet and reserved unless the topic is one of his interests, does not pick up on social cues, rarely makes eye contact/smiles etc. His girlfriend (f22) has recently reached out to my wife, BIL's sister, stating that BIL has been scaring her lately (saying hurtful things, not spending time with her, making rash life decisions, not being himself etc.). She is worried because in the past he talked about being depressed and how, at times, he thought about killing himself and specific ways he would do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full disclosure: the girlfriend has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia so it is possible that some things she tells us may not be 100% accurate.  


There is tension in the family, between BIL, his girlfriend and his parents. His girlfriend reached out to my in-laws awhile ago when he first talked about his depression/suicidal thoughts and she felt like they didn't take it very seriously. I think my in-laws have a somewhat dismissive attitude about mental illness/therapy and they thought they could help him by checking in with him more and spending more time with him. BIL's girlfriend rarely comes to spend time with the very close-knit family and the in-laws take this personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: As far as he knows, his girlfriend is the only person that knows about all of this. He knows that his parents know he went to therapy because the bill was sent to their house but I don't think they ever talked about specifics or reasons why he was going. We are getting a lot of 3rd hand info from his girlfriend.  


The girlfriend has had her own past with depression including a suicide attempt and she sees the red flags in his behavior right now that scare her. At one point she showed him a list of Asberger's symptoms and he agreed that it sounded exactly like him but when she told him it was for Asberger's he got very offended and thought she was calling him slow/dumb. She got him to see a therapist several months ago but he stopped going after about a month because it cost too much (nearly $1000 in about a month) and according to him ""they weren't getting into anything serious"".  


I'm looking for advice on 1) How to get him to be more open to therapy, 2) How to find a good/affordable therapist, and 3) Any advice on handling the awkward dynamic between the in-laws/girlfriend.  


I am seeing if the girlfriend can get us his insurance info so I can try to find somewhere he might be covered.  


TLDR; My brother-in-law has a history of (un-diagnosed) autism symptoms, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I'm looking for advice on getting him to open up about the idea of therapy and advice on finding a good/affordable therapist.

2757,qpalzmwoeiru,1546555611,1,"Just before I get into this I’m just gonna say sorry for the wall of text. I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this stuff at the moment in my life and I’m beginning to find it increasingly difficult to keep bottling it up and pushing it down. I feel I just need to get the words out, if even for the sake of straightening things out in my own damn head. 

I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me and it’s driving me insane. I’ve had god damn diagnoses of everything from borderline personality to schizo-affective disorder and everything damn thing in between. I understand that there are a lot of issues with labeling what something is and how it can be detrimental, and I suppose in a way the incessant need to label everything is a large contributor to why I’m so confused and feeling singled out now, so I guess it makes sense. I mean, if labeling issues like this was never a thing and it all just fell under the one category with a list of all the symptoms, then maybe things would be easier, but what the fuck do I know. At this stage, after seven fucking years of all this shit, I’d honestly just like to be told in a straightforward manner, “this is what’s wrong with you, this is what it means” and so forth. I just feel because I’ve not been boxed up in some category I must be the god damn outlier who’s just completely batshit, which I know logically isn’t the case but that’s just how it feels. So god damn lonely. 

Recently in my life things have taken a bit of a turn, and more so than ever I feel like I’ve literally got nobody to talk to whatsoever. I just try and ignore it as best I can and then everytime I think of it I get this hole in my stomach and shit just spirals. What’s the worst is that the only time I’d tell people even a little bit of it is when I’m fucked drunk, and then the next day I feel so god damn stupid for spilling my guts and making a fool of myself like that and how annoying it must be for them and how they think of me that it literally just exacerbates everything. 

I’ve got a therapist and all that shit but honestly I feel it does nothing. I’ve been to so many of them over the last few years that it feels more like a damn routine physical than it does a safe place. 

For seven years now I’ve been going through this. That’s not to say I haven’t had good time and stuff. Some of the best times of my life have been in the last seven years. But what sucks is that whenever I try and communicate how difficult it’s been the fact that I have had a good time is almost used as an argument against me that I’m overreacting or exaggerating. 

In the last year more so than ever before I think about killing myself. I’d never do it. I’m terrified of dying. Yet for some fucked up reason nine or ten times a day I think about literally just ending it all. I can’t understand even how I fantasize about it so much when the idea of actually dying terrifies me, but there it is anyway. A friend even came up to me one day a couple weeks ago and asked was everything okay because I’d been making more suicide jokes than I usual would. And it’s a total defense mechanism thing I understand that. I joke about everything I feel it just makes it easier to deal with, but then suddenly it just bites me in the ass when I realize that it’s undermining the validity of the shit when I do want to talk to someone about it. Yknow, as im sure you’re familiar with the whole “dude you’re not depressed you’re always laughing and joking around”. 

Since I started college and started drinking things are even worse. I literally drink as much as I can sometimes in the hopes that I won’t wake up or at the very least sleep through a god damn night (which happens maybe once every two weeks). I’d take any drug that’s handed my way and I don’t even know why. Somehow while being terrified of dying every action I take appears to be in direct contrast of that feeling. Even when I’m at the god damn bus stop I feel the need to stand right at the edge of the road where if a car were to swerve I’d for sure be fucking crushed. 

As well as all this shit I’m constantly trying to lose weight. Since I was put on ability four years ago I gained a shit ton of weight, then when I was taken off it because it wasn’t helping, I managed to lose some of it. Then when I started drinking a few years ago it’s just all back on again. I barely even fucking eat yet still gain weight. I know it’s the drinking but I mean it’s also just basic science that if I have less calories in then I do out weight should be dropping but no that doesn’t seem to apply. 


Anyway I’ll leave it there. I’ve a lot more to say but honestly I feel sick just typing this shit out. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Over the past year or so I’ve noticed “new” behavioral and emotional tendencies such as self isolation, feeling like something is seriously wrong for no apparent reason,  general uneasiness (spiritually and mentally), and most prominently, literally nothing makes me happy anymore. I’ve always been melancholic and I’m pretty sure I’ve been depressed for a while but there’s always been a light at the end of the tunnel. Lately though, the light is hard to find. My hobbies and outlets don’t work as well if at all anymore. When I spend time with friends I’ll wish I was alone and simultaneously wish I could be as carefree as them. But I can’t? There’s just always something in the back of my mind telling me nothing is okay. That I NEED to be worried. That something bad is GOING to happen and I am running out of time. 
I remain hopeful that I can pull through and that this is only a phase, but I’m a very deep feeling person and I often worry that all of my life experiences and traumas have just built me up to be this anxious, lonely person forever.

2763,Fire_phoenix33,1546554231,1,"I have OCD. It makes me do weird things. The things I do don’t seem normal to ‘normal’ people. Normal people don’t understand. Having OCD means that I get thoughts that aren’t mine. They don’t belong to me, and I can’t control them. I get these thoughts and they tell me to do things, otherwise something will happen. Normally, something bad. One analogy I have for it is thus:
Imagine someone comes up to you and holds a gun to your head and tells you to give them all of your money, or they will shoot you. What would you do? You could comply, and give them your money, and they would leave you alone, you wouldn’t get hurt. Or, you could try and fight them and possibly get shot in the head. Is it worth the risk? If you only had five pounds on you, you might just comply, it's really not worth the risk, is it? What if you had £100? £1000?
This is like OCD. It makes me do things I don’t want to do just to avoid the danger/ fear. Sometimes it is only little things, so it makes sense just to give in. Sometimes its much much worse. Then you have to think, is it worth it? Sometimes the things it comes up with are so horrifying that you would rather be shot in the head.
Another analogy is thus:
Imagine your brain. A nice healthy brain. Then, a parasite infects you. It clings onto your brain stem, feeding off of you. It tells you to do things, and when you do them, it grows, and when you don’t, it releases toxic chemicals to make you feel scared and uncomfortable, but when you don’t do what it says, it starves. If you give in it grows and its tendrils spread through your brain. It pollutes your thoughts and makes you wonder how much of you is really you anymore. How much of my thoughts are mine?

2767,Rampant_Reptile,1546552443,1,"Disclaimer first. I don’t have health insurance so I haven’t seen a professional and been diagnosed, so this is all kinda just how I feel and doesn’t have the professional diagnosis to back it up. But I’ve started a new job and will look into the insurance they provide to rectify that.

I feel like I’ve got social anxiety bad, and maybe depression but maybe not. The depression symptoms have gotten a lot less severe and frequent since I quit drinking, so maybe I just feel mopey at times from the anxiety. 

I hate leaving the house to do anything. I feel awkward and stay quiet during family gatherings, I can’t think how to describe it other than feeling awkward around everyone. And plus my whole family is all doing alright on their own, married, own their homes and all that.  and I’m the only one in the “failure to launch” kind of situation so I really feel like the black sheep of the family.

I don’t like being in public, I don’t like to ask for help. If i can’t find a place that i’m looking for while driving, or a product I’m looking for in a store, I’ll just leave and go back home.  I don’t like to talk on the phone I worry I won’t know what to say and will just embarrass myself.

I especially can’t enjoy large public events like parties, concerts, conventions, parks and stuff like that at all. I don’t really get claustrophobic in tight spaces, but if I’m in a big group of people I do. I usually start to feel jittery and short of breath and just get out of there quick as I can. 

I used to drink when I was feeling depressed cause it kinda made me forget about it for a while but that was a terrible idea. I turned into a heavy drinker for a while, ruined some relationships with my long time friends and my now ex gf. I’ve since quit drinking and I don’t feel as pathetic and useless anymore. I’ve started a new job and I’m trying to get my shit together and stay positive about it, although I’m deeply in the hole financially. It seems hopeless at times but I try and not think of it that way.

Really now I just feel kind of lonely at times. I have 1 friend who I used to go fishing with and stuff, but we don’t do much together anymore. And no one else to text or talk to and share about our day/week or whatever.

Certainly no prospects of a gf with the social anxiety, afraid to go out and meet and talk to people, the large amounts of debt which will consume 99% of my income for prolly years to come. and the fact I still live at home with a mediocre mechanic job. Nobody’s gonna want to date me. 

I suppose the thing I need to do is get insurance and see a professional about social anxiety and try to get help with it so I might feel more comfortable and be able to go out and do things and make more friends.

2771,shangxin_hu,1546549498,1,"I feel like a bag of untreated mental issues.    


My history is that I felt depressed since I was 12. I don't think anyone knew or they probably didn't think it was serious. I had a breakdown and felt empty for years after that, to the point I didn't think I was human. I was functional, I studied well, but the future was a black hole for me. I didn't feel love or happiness at the time. I wasn't even glad to get into university, but later deluded myself into thinking it was a ""new start"". The start of a new, successful me.   


It wasn't. One week into starting uni, I showed kindness by helping a  guy in class. He started pestering me, visiting me every day since we lived in the same dorm. It's so cliche, but he got beyond all of the walls I've built over the years, I fell for him  in a matter of  a few months despite not enjoying any human contact or company for years before. I was supposed to focus on studying, but I felt empty for so long in my life that this love I had was the first fulfilling thing I've ever felt. He was optimistic and funny, my complete opposite, I thought he liked me because he pursued me,  but he tossed me a few weeks after I let him kiss me. He didn't even tell me, let me follow him around and just acted cold towards me, but I had no experience in love and didn't get the hint.   


When I realized what was happening, my depression surfaced again, and I started avoiding him too, but it wasn't even the worst part. It was maybe just a month after my realization of being rejected that he came into my room in the middle of the night, climbed into my bed, and .. I struggle to remember the details, other than that I begged for him to stop and chanted how much it hurt,  but I was frozen, I couldn't control my body at all, and all my mind did was scream at me that this was wrong while he just said ""shh"" in response. I had to leave early that morning and left him in my bed, I didn't even cry. I went to meet  my friends, maybe I was still in shock but I acted 'normal'. I don't remember much after that, other that I closed myself off from the world, and became deeply depressed. I obviously couldn't tell anyone. I blamed myself for not being able to stop him too. I never got an explanation, no closure. There was no confrontation. I found out in a roundabout way that he was completely drunk (I didn't even notice that he was) and he didn't remember a thing (I don't even know if that's true because he acted normal, and I didn't think anyone could act normal after what they did). To this day it bothers me if I think about it. It makes me cringe. I feel guilty, ashamed that I let that happen to me. I was always the girl who thought you had to be stupid not to spot such scumbags in advance. In reality, he was the nicest guy I knew..  A year later he reached out to me, asked me to meet him, and apologized for ""everything"". I regret that at that time I never asked what exactly ""everything"" was. I pretended I didn't know what he meant and continued to explain to him how he was long forgotten. Now I will never know the truth. I will never know ""why"".  


After this I spiraled out of control.  I went abroad, stopped contact with all of my friends and family, and jumped into the arms of another horrible man, who emotionally abused me for a few months. It looks like a short period of time, but maybe because I was already depressed, I managed to hit a new low when I returned home. I lived alone for half a year, closed of from the world in a coffin-like room. I didn't go outside for days, living of toasted bread and tea, because leaving my room even to reach the kitchen caused too much anxiety. I missed all of my lectures. The gaps left by that made me realize that I'll never make it in the field I've chosen. I was at the bottom. I flat out told one professor that I won't send the final project because I'm too depressed. He reached out to me. Talked to me about professional help, said he was depressed his whole life too.  


Thanks to him, I finally reached out to a family member. He, in turn, asked me if he could tell my parents. The family was shocked, and I feel bad that I put them through this even now. I never got therapy, just medication, that I struggled with as well, because life didn't feel better. I became a functional person again, but nothing came out of higher education for me. I have no actual skills to find a decent job. I tried to learn other things but nothing came to fruition, maybe because I only went for things that could be successful fields, but I never liked them. In the end, I feel like I've wasted years of my life and yet still can't snap out of it. I feel inferior to everybody, including my amazing SO who is doing so well in life that he got a new job abroad, and expects me to follow him, learn a new language and ""make it"" there as well. All I feel is anxiety. When we're together, I take out my stress on him because that's the only way I can pretend I'm not depressed. When I'm alone, I sink back into this helplessness. I can't even force myself to eat. I feel like every year, for the past 5 years, I've been telling myself that it's a ""new start"" but it never worked out. I don't trust myself to succeed in life. I feel like everyone secretly thinks I'm a failure so I want to hide even more. I just want to make them proud, so I can't even show any signs that I still have a problem. I nod my head and smile, when my SO happily talks about our future. Meanwhile, all I can see is myself giving into another delusion that I can become successful. I feel like it's draining my life force.   


The only time I felt truly happy was when I had my first decent job, but it was a short-term contract and one in a million kind of a job. It didn't have high requirements, and the pay was double the average. I felt worthy for that short while and actually enjoyed life. Now I'm back at 0, facing life in a foreign country, and all I can think about now is that I'll never find a good job again or it will take years to do, because I'll be even less there than I was here. I don't even know how to deal with myself. I feel like I'll disappoint everyone, because ""new starts"" never worked out for me before. It feels like I've just been buying more time and avoiding the truth that I'll never amount to anything.  


Today is just one of those days for me. I know I'll go back to being 'normal' again, pretending it's just how life is, ups-and-downs, until the next time it hits me again. Maybe by that time I'll have the ability to go to actual psychotherapy and figure something out. For now, I needed to let this out somewhere, because I feel alone. So sad and alone.

2776,christinaa1982,1546548238,1," 

I am writing this as an attempt to get some order in my mind about something that happened to me when I was a kid. My parents only had me and divorced when I was four, and my mum got a new boyfriend who I had a good relationship with. He had a son who was six years older than me. I’ll call him M. I stayed one week at mums and one week at dads until I was 18, when I moved in with my dad. My dad was a great dad, but also an alcoholic. We lived in the same house until he died seven years ago. I still live in his big apartment. 

I remember things from my childhood in small fragments, but like most kids I guess I couldn’t store too much information. I read somewhere recently that we have tendencies to save the most traumatic events, but that its easy to forget details and perhaps other experiences similar that were considered less traumatic. 

I remembered that I adored M. He was older and cooler, did hip hop dance and martial arts, he was a very boyish and quite handsome. He would spend weekends with us and I would follow him around like a puppy. I have vague memories of him playing with me when he felt like it, I feel like they were boyish games like making traps for me (that were kinda dangerous) and the general feeling I have of our relationship was that I mostly annoyed him and sometimes he would be fun and nice to me. I also remember once being in a park with him in winter time, I was small, and I picked up a huge rock and through it at his head. Im not sure this is a real memory, I haven’t asked my mum about it. But I wasn’t a violent child at all, why did I do that?

So the traumatic memories I have are two clear ones. The clearest one must be from when I was prob 8. We were all in my mums house, she and stepdad was watching TV in the living room, and me and M was in the dining room next door with doors closed. He had a friend over, who’s face I cant remember. They made some kind of fort out of chairs and blankets and we were all inside there, I dont remember how it started, but I am sitting on the floor without underwear and my legs spread wide. The two boys are crouching down taking turn licking my vagina with their tongues sticking out in a silly way as if they were eating an ice cream. 

I dont remember what I was feeling, but I dont think I was upset. I actually feel like I probably thought it was exiting, and sort of fun to get this attention and be part of the the big boys playing. I dont remember how it started or ended, I just remember looking down at my little hairless vagina and seeing their tongues sticking out like that. I cant remember any physical sensations, like if I enjoyed the stimulation or not. 

The second memory is from a party at my grandparents house, I am wearing the national costume, maybe xmas or 17 may. He is steeling me away taking me into my grandparents bedroom, door closed, lays me on the bed and gets on top of me. I remember fumbling getting into my pantyhose, but I dont remember what kind of thing he did to me. I dont think it was painful. 

The frustrating thing is that I had these memories for a long long time, but it has been bothering me more and more the older I get. Now I am 36 and at the moment I am completely obsessed by it. I have an on and off fascination for macabre documentaries about murders, child molestation etc, and lately I got into the whole pizzagate story and something kind of changed in me.

My perspective of the human mind and human condition keeps evolving as I grow, so what didn’t seem so important now suddenly seems huge and life changing. 

I actually had a sexual relationship when I was 8. With a 14 year old boy. I dont remember much of it, but it happened. I had feelings at the time I have no connection with today, but still they have been a part of my emotional development.  

Was I “in love” with him? Did I hope for things to happen between us? What did those things that happened make me feel? Did I tell no one? What did he say to me when it happened? Does he remember more than I do? 

I think the first person I told was my ex boyfriend, when I was maybe 26. He took it seriously and we discussed in a good way that made me feel safe. My mum and stepdad broke up after a while, but stayed friends, and I continued having a good relationship with him. The idea of him knowing what his son had did, scared me a lot and I also never really considered telling my mum for a very long time. When my dad died I went to a lot of therapy, and finally I told one of them about the episodes. I had seen her for years, and we had talked about a trillion other things in my life, and it felt weird that I hadn’t wanted to bring it up, when it finally felt so right to talk about it. 

It was natural that I stopped being around M and almost never saw him. The older I got the more I tried avoiding events when he was there. My mum kept in touch with him, and I always felt horrible to be so “uninterested” in that part of our (ex-step) family. Finally a few years ago I told her. She took it pretty badly, I mean she got really sad about it and I think she blames herself a lot. I have been explaining the story to her and my closest friends as something I have already sorted out and come to peace with, like that they dont need to worry about me, I just want to share it with them.

A month ago my and mum were talking about it, it doesn’t happen often but its not like a taboo or anything. She told me about something she remembered. Once my dad had discovered a hickey on my neck when I came to his house, and he had confronted my mum about it. When they asked me about it I said we were only playing. My dad had told my mum to keep and eye on M, and make sure he didn’t do anything to me. In the moment she told me it felt like a small story, but the more I thought about the more fragmented memories and thoughts appeared. My mum prob feels horrible knowing that conversation happened, and maybe subconsciously she needed to tell me. And my poor dad who actually was onto something and tried to protect me unsuccessfully. 

The creepiest thing, was that when she said hickey I remembered that. Either the feeling of him sucking on my neck or seeing the bruise, my mind is trying to put together a game about him making the marks. It wasn’t necessarily a sexual thing, but it still feels uncomfortable to think about. Because that was my body, and both good and bad stuff happened to me, but I cant remember which is which and it feels confusing. What else dont I remember? 

Suddenly now I feel closer to him again, like he is a part of me. Like other men I have been romantically involved with in my life. I had long-term healthy relationships in my 20s but since my dad passed I have been single and struggling with my mental health. I am a freelance artist, and the last few years I pretty much stopped working. I sleep all day and stay up all night. I smoke a lot of weed and even though I have a lot of good friends I dont like going out, dont like drinking, don’t like drunk people. And I dont like most men. The men I have been involved with have been all super tricky, like too young or just too eccentric, and the men I am sexually attracted to are usually very closed of emotionally. 

I have always been very sexual and can remember masturbating very early. Prob before M came into the picture. I was curious about porn early on, and spent a lot of time masturbating in my teens, and I still do. I lost my virginity at 16 and experienced a bunch of slut shaming early on so I became very careful about who I had actual sex with. I would make out with like seven guys at a party, but before I had a boyfriend I only had sex with a few guys I thought I felt safe with. With my boyfriends I had great sexual relationships, but they all escalated into more extremes during the relationship, mostly on my initiative. From early on I liked roleplaying, rape games, anal sex, latex clothes etc. But it was always within feeling very safe with that person. Its also worth mentioning that my first real boyfriend was 12 years older than me, when I was 19. 

Now Ive been single for 8 years.I am mostly ok in my life, but I know I am occupied with thoughts and worries that are not considered “normal and healthy”.  I almost never have sex or physical contact with people, being around kids make me cry. I am on a low dose of antidepressants. I have been through suicidal ideas and scrapped them, I have been hysterical, calm, stoned, sober, motivated and surrendered, right now I am just so tired of worrying about myself and I envy my friends who have kids and family and dont have time to worry about their childhood trauma. I am so deep into my own mind and trying to figure out where I am failing, and I cant escape it, even when I am around other people.

My question, I guess, is would it help me to confront M about what happened? Does anyone out there who managed to read through my whole text have any similar experiences? I dont think I want to see him, but I have been thinking about writing him. I dont want him to feel attacked, and probably he remembers and feels icky or bad about it. What I think I want, is to know if anything else happened beyond what I remember. Was there more times? Did he do other things, and if so what? I know it sound awful, but if lets say he would masturbate me regularly, that could make sense for some of my weird sex hang ups.

Would he tell me what he remembers, or would he be too ashamed? If I ask him to tell me everything he remembers, will that be too confrontational for him? Do I have to share with him what I remember? I dont know if I want to do that, I feel like I want him to tell me about it how he remembers it. I dont know if its even a good idea to be poking into this, should I just try and let it go and put it all behind me? I would really love to hear from anyone who had similar experiences.

First off, a little bit of backstory, I guess. I’m 18 right now, and when I was 13, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 adenocarcinoma of the lung. 

Before her diagnosis I dealt with a little bit of anxiety, mostly separation anxiety. After she became diagnosed, though, this anxiety transformed into a panic disorder and agoraphobia. I also was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and PTSD as time progressed and my mother became sicker and sicker. 

It was... really bad and really traumatic to say the least. I was one of her primary caretakers at age 16 and 17, since my dad could only take off so much time before it became leave without pay. She was in so much pain, and so ill, and I was faced with it every hour of every day. Had to drop out of school at one point to take care of her. 

She died in May of 2017. Throughout this whole process my anxiety had been getting progressively better with therapy, and my depression was always pretty bad, but manageable with medication and therapy.  The PTSD and depression were my main issues, the panic attacks still came and went, but I had pretty much knocked the agoraphobia out. 

So fast forward to a month ago, December 3rd. I was on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Tampa (where I go to University). This was only my 6th time flying, with my first time flying being around Thanksgiving time. So, my flight experience started in 2018.  Anyway, this flight ruined me.

The whole flight was pretty turbulent, but thanks to Ativan, I was okay. We start our descent to land, and we reach about maybe ~700 feet from the ground, and the pilot takes off again. It was absolutely paralyzingly scary. It was storming in Tampa, apparently, and the pilot couldn’t see the runway, and had to do a go around. Everyone I’ve spoken to, including pilots, say this is rare, and it is fucking terrifying. 

I had a lot of anxiety about planes to begin with, but this changed something in me and now my agoraphobia, panic attacks, and general anxiety are back. I don’t know what happened, I was doing so well, and it’s so discouraging to feel like I’m a million steps back in my growth process. Has anyone had an experience even somewhat similar, or have any advice? The counselors on campus are generally unhelpful, and my therapist that I love is back home 7 hours away. 

TL;DR: Scary flight reverted my anxiety and now I’m an anxious mess and can’t get over it. Help. ",mentalhealth,Anxiety Flare Up After Flight,2019-01-04 06:32:53

I don’t trust people at all, so that means I don’t really forgive them. My family was pretty toxic, like they’d make fun of me and then tell me I was overreacting when I got upset. This was always the case, from the time I was small. It only got worse when I got older, of course, because “that’s how the world is, nobody else is going to care about your hurt feelings”. That’s basically what they’d say. Just put the children down for being “too sensitive”. In high school I just reinforced those ideas in myself with how I treated others and how they treated me. I had a lot of toxic friends and I was toxic too. 

Now I’m 24 and I don’t trust people and you can’t forgive without trust and vice verse. It takes me forever to tell somebody I’m upset. I forgive, but not really? How do you forgive without forgetting the past and keeping a score?? Like I thought that was just normal. Guess it’s not. 

I think part of it is that I forgive when I don’t want to because I’ve learned from my family that fighting back doesn’t work and I’ll lose anyways so just forgive now and more on, but never trust them again. But that’s not forgiveness. 

How do you forgive? What’s your experience with building trust and forgiveness? I watch ted talks, I journal, I do meditative stuff sometimes. I read books about mental health.

2789,awfercryeye,1546534994,1,"Howdy Reddit. I came here just to ask this one thing.

So I USED to think I was fine. In fact, more than fine: I thought I was one of the (seemingly few) mentally healthy people out there. I love life, enjoy my friends, have a happy marriage, no real troubles. The issues in my life are so small compared to those I see all around me, I am in a constant state of gratitude for what I have. And so I thought I was fine.

But... a good friend of mine (now lives about 2000 miles away) is stuck at home sick, and she recently posted about how lonely she is... how loneliness is a form of torture, with solitary confinement used to break prisoners' spirits... and so after I cheered her up I got to thinking: huh. There must be something the matter with me, because I have ZERO problem with being alone. ZE. ROH. Nix. 

In fact I have never, ever, that I can think about, been lonely, bored or homesick. Wherever I am, that's where I like being; whatever is happening, I take an interest in it. I used to think this was because I'm creative (I actually am an advertising writer) and could easily amuse myself with imagination. I thought it was a GOOD thing. 

I can be alone for as long as you want to leave me that way. Those scenes in the movies where the prisoner is alone and going bonkers never resonated with me. I mean, if there were nothing else to do, I would just make up a whole bunch of songs and poems. It's ok if there's nobody around to hear or read them-- making them up is the fun. And so I went, blissfully along in life thinking I was fine. Until....

I read a person on Quora asking about ""Schizoid"" mental illness and how its hallmark is *not feeling loneliness*. 

**So question: IS THAT ME?** 

Reading more about this disorder, the rest of it doesn't sound like me at ALL. I don't have anhedonia, I don't dislike social interaction, I have never been hindered or held back in life... \*that I know of\*. 

But I also read that lots of people with this disorder have no problem with it. Apparently the problem is the way other people around them feel? Or something? Anyhow now I am curious to know: have I been suffering from a mental illness all along? 

Oh well, if I have it then I have it. Life's been good so far and a new label won't change anything. It's just... well, it sort of makes me disappointed in the world. It almost seems like today there is no way to avoid having some kind of diagnosis. Even what I thought was happiness may turn out to be a pathology.

My situation is kind of weird, but I have been having a hard, hard time coping with it. Over this past semester I was studying abroad in China. During a midpoint in the semester I had to give a very large presentation to around 100 students. 

Now, before I continue, let me preface this by saying that before this incident I have always been a very good public speaker. I spoke at my high school graduation to an audience of over 300 and have generally felt very comfortable speaking to audiences before this incident. 

Back to the story - I walked up to the podium, began to utter the words that marked the beginning of my presentation, and then had a sinking feeling that I'd never felt before in my life. It was so strong that it brought me to a kneeling position behind the podium followed by a complete loss of words. For the rest of the presentation I was frozen. I couldn't utter another word - I was completely and utterly stunned by the mistake I had just made. For four or five minutes, I struggled significantly to mumble the rest of my presentation with only my group members pulling me along to the finish line.

Ever since this incident has occurred, I've had this reoccurring sinking feeling that leaves me speechless in every. Single. Conversation. It doesn't matter if it's my best friend - I feel some sort of panic overcome me when I try to converse with people. As a very social and outgoing person, this has been extremely distressing and I don't know what to do.

NICE ~~GUYS~~ (PEOPLE) *DO* FINISH LAST – BUT  THAT’S NO REASON NOT TO BE ONE

By: Simon Templeton

  

I’d always thought that I’d been suicidal before… Until the night I actually was. In the midst of a sticky divorce situation, navigating a complicated but incredibly passionate and healthy relationship for the first time in my life. Dealing with parenthood, and the issues of navigating the custody battle while remaining cognizant of the dangers his mother poses. None of this is new, however. I’ve been navigating the separation and the issues its caused for almost two years, now. But that night it just… got to me.

I’m no stranger to mental health battles, either. I’ve struggled with depression since I was very young, as young as seven. I’ve dealt with many, many obstacles in my life. My parents short-lived marriage. My mothers first battle with cancer. Bullying. Self-esteem issues. Poor grades. My mothers second battle with cancer and early death. There have been people that suffered the same or similar trials. Even those whom have had far worse lives than I. However, a recent meeting with a counselor with he department of Veterans Affairs looked into my past a little deeper than other counselors had – and I was diagnosed with Severe Catastrophic Anxiety

I’ve known about my anxiety issues for a long time. Most of my life, in fact. I told her the truth – I used to suffer crippling stomach aches thinking about things. If my mother was late even 5 minutes I would think ‘’oh god, she got into a car crash and died, I’ll never see her again.” In fact, that’s the reason I believe I was able to navigate her death more deftly than my sisters. I had been worried she would pass for over ten years at that point. And living with her, taking care of her 24/7, balancing graduating high school and managing her health and treatment had prepared me for the possibility of losing her. Really, when she passed it was a relief. Not that I wanted her to go, but finally her suffering was over.

My point is, I’ve been seeing counselors for over twenty years by the time my first brush with suicidal ideation. I learned recently, at that point, that there is a serious difference between ‘’thoughts of death’’ and ‘’being suicidal”. And there is. This can’t be stressed enough. It’s normal for the brain, even one that isn’t depressed much if at all, to consider what the world would be like without it. ‘’What would happen if I died?” “Ugh, this would all be easier if I just wasn’t here anymore.” “God what a relief that would be.” These aren’t even on the same map as being suicidal. In fact, the thought first came to me right smack dab at the beginning of a concerted effort to improve my life, my self, and by extension my depressed state by getting back into the gym and being active and responsible.

My girlfriend and I had made a decision to get back into losing weight, improving our fitness and working out every day in the month of January. Then, after some light frustration at with her for being hard on herself and my slacking performance in bed – blaming it on her having gained some weight, I was having trouble sleeping. I had eaten relatively well that day. A little too heavy on the lunch, I was hangry when we stopped at chipotle for some relatively healthy food. In response, I had chosen not to eat any dinner that night. Things with her weren’t bad, I just was a little frustrated that my sexual performance was so affected by my depression – I was even having trouble masturbating. I was sad that she was feeling guilty for my own B.S. I told her goodnight and continued to watch Netflix for a bit – vowing to sleep when I was a little more tired. This spiraled into some hunger, and a little extra depression than before.

It even spurred me to make some incredibly unhealthy snack choices, causing even more bad juju in my mind… My 4-year-old son got up, as usual (a little earlier than usual) and I put him back to bed. But I knew that at this point he wasn’t going to stay there long and I’d better get to bed. I still didn’t though, and it was only when I heard him making his way back downstairs that I decided to go to bed. I grabbed him up, gave him a few sips of water accompanied by a reminder to get up and go potty if he needed to pee, and donned my CPAP machine as I turned the TV off. I settled us in and closed my eyes. I was certainly tired enough to sleep. My mind wasn’t overactive – a well known cause of lack of ability to sleep for me – and I began concentrating on my breathing.

“What if I just put a gun in my mouth and…”

Whoah. What. The. Fuck.

That came out of nowhere. I was rattled… I ripped my CPAP off and laid there, wide eyed and breathing heavy. The dread came over me like a nasty, sticky warmth – my skin burning hot, flushed and hyper-sensitive.

My son hadn’t moved the whole time, he was already starting to doze. I turned and put my arms around him and he cuddled in… But for the first time, it didn’t steady my nerves. Now, when I alluded to thinking prior to this point that I had been suicidal before, my one claim of strength was that I may have *thought* it, but I had never really considered it. *Hence the statement about the difference between thoughts of death and suicidal ideation.* I’d always stopped that train of thought by thinking about what it would do to my family. And when I was married and had kids to take care of them, thoughts of them and their safety rallied my senses.

But tonight those thoughts felt… Empty. Forced. Ineffective. I think that’s what scared me more than anything.

My son stirred, asking to snuggle more. I grabbed him almost *too* vigorously, panicking  now. I figured if I snuggled him harder I could squeeze out this fear of that stupid, fleeting thought I just had. But I couldn’t… For the first time in my life, the thought of my loved ones didn’t bolster me.

I should be clear – at this point I wasn’t having *more* thoughts of suicide. And I’ve got such stupid, ridiculous anxiety that there is a chance this was just all some weird falling-asleep-brain thought that didn’t mean anything and now I’m working myself up WAY more, but still.. I was scared. I lay awake, cuddling my now-restless son, alone with my thoughts – as I’ve always been afraid of being.

After making myself throw up, a let-me-rectify-this-eating-mistake-because-i-clearly-need-some-shock-and-awe-methods-to-get-my-mind-right act, I decided to shower (another classic mind-rectifying method for me). I masturbated there, but it was pitiful… My mind wasn’t into it. I got very little pleasure. It was… Hollow – the same way I felt about every feeling I had since that strange thought.

\-

The reason I’m writing this is… I’ve always been overly empathetic. Horrifically so. I used to write lyrics an poems and use word-play in my mind and I would always come back to calling myself em-pathetic (with emphasis on the pathetic). I almost can’t function because I am constantly worried about everyone else’s feelings and sacrificing my own. I’ve always been told by women I’ve had love interests with, friends an family that I’m incredibly nice. That I’d do anything for anyone. And I will – if they ask. Often even if they don’t. I’ve been urged by counselors and friends to stand up for myself. To make sure my needs get met too. For the most part, I’ve been working on that. But the events surrounding my divorce, and every shitty relationship I suffered through in the past always led me to be a little hard on myself… Like.. Fuck. I guess nice guys really DO finish last.

Yet looking back on it… I don’ think I would change a thing. Sure, I could be more functional in the way I address the world and the people around me, but I’ve won in the long run. Hence the title of this work… (updated for the truth of its universal appeal) Nice people DO finish last… But only in the battles that don’t really matter. The races. The competitions. The Bullshit…..

Nice people win at life.

  

Now, I am in no way comparing myself to Dr. King, however when you look upon the most famous good people from history – you see that they faced adversity. I mean, to call the unbridled hatred, racism, discrimination and assassination Dr. King faced adversity is a tremendous understatement. That being said, I believe it to be Dr. King’s continuing to uphold his beliefs and his character during all of these to be the greatest sign of a truly good person.

In fact, it’s easy to be a good person. Most of our parents spend time trying to teach us to be from the moment we can walk, talk or use our hands. Most of us have, in one sense or another, some understanding of the generally accepted ethical and moral  agreement that humans have collectively made. You say excuse me. You hold a door for someone. You help someone that appears to be in need. The tasks involved with being a good person, a nice person, are not difficult. What *is* hard is continuing to be one when life and the people around you give you every reason not to be. *True selflessness is* *the single most powerful state* *the human spirit can attain, and one we should all* *strive for throughout* *our short lives.* 

And the truth of the matter is it is not a battle that is won or lost with a single decision. Mistakes are always made, opportunities missed and decisions rushed or affected by external and internal sources. Just like the  way nice people lose the battles, the more important goal is the war. At the end of the day, it’s about accepting these losses and *not letting* *them*  *jade* *you into giving up the fight*. 

I’ve been telling friends whom are suffering hard times themselves for years – we are not our mistakes. We are not our scars. We  are who we make ourselves with those scars on us. And you are *not* your mistakes. You are who you continue to try to be knowing you made those mistakes in the past. You can’t let your luggage define you. That’s what depression is, in my unprofessional opinion. It’s when you let your baggage take the wheel and drag you downhill. You give up on your beliefs or your desires and you justify them away - telling yourself that you never had control over them anyways. Or why try to be good when you keep getting screwed over?

The simple fact of the matter that It’s *easier* to be a bad person. And it’s just what other bad people want. All of us have a million reasons to be bad people. Or even just to be ‘’okay’’ people. Yet there’s only one reason to be a good person – it’s the right thing to do. At the end of the day we, or rather the world and those around us, reap what we sow. Certain belief systems call this karma, some call it fate, but realistically the world is what *you* make it. A smile can change someone’s day, or even their life, and it cost you nothing at all. When we put good in, we get good out - that’s the bottom line.

Bad things will happen. You will lose loved ones, we will find reasons to be hurt. This is the price we pay for sentience. We’re just animals that became far too smart for such a bleak existence. So why would you waste your time on empty self-gratification in being a bad person. This is the exact reason people are so depressed, so nihilistic. It’s so easy to be even just an ‘’okay’’ person, and all it cost the people in your world were a few sleepless nights, a few tears. But these people are not rewarded. They suffer their brief time in this life, beginning to end – and often alone (in one way or another). We lie. We cheat. We Steal and kill and rape – but mostly we ignore. We think of this as being nice to oneself, but really it’s just selfishness. We don’t act right, and therefor we don’t have what we truly want. Because we don’t have what we want, we act like the universe owes it to us – so we treat the others around us in a negative way. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I’m still here… Awake. Shaking from the fear of what just happened to me. I’m scared, and I think I need more help than I’m getting to get through this… It’s all new to me, even though I’ve suffered these afflictions before..

But I think the key is… I WANT to be alright. Not that those whom have lost their battle with depression or given in to suicide as a release didn’t, I just… I want to empower myself to be able to handle this on my own, and to be able to ask for help when I need a little extra push.

Be good to one another… This whole world needs a little extra good in it. ",mentalhealth,Nice (people) DO finish last - But that's no reason not to be one...,2019-01-04 01:29:06

2799,0sureal,1546522855,1,"  

Hello all,

So first of all I want to apologise for this post as it will inevitably be long.  
 I have been with my husband for 13 years. We are both 28.  
 so a little background first.  
   
 

I suffer from clinical depression that went undiagnosed up until about 5 years ago. This put my husband Matt through a tremendous amount of stress as he had never had hands on experience with this sort of thing. I used to self-harm, had awful mood swings and was generally not a nice person. Fast forward to now, I am mellow and clear headed (mostly). I am on antidepressants that work for the most part. I have been through various therapies. And Matt has stood by me and encouraged me this whole time.

Now for the point of my post; Matt has always struggled with his own emotions and has said on previous occasions “I don’t understand emotions, and I wish they didn’t exist”. He is very intelligent and super logical, sometimes to a fault.  
 The other night, he came home after drinking and admitted to me that every time he does something wrong/upsets someone/has an argument his first thought is “I should kill myself, I am worthless”. He then went on to advise me that he talks himself down from this and has this internal argument where half his brain says “why are you down, you haven’t got anything to be depressed about”.  
 Matt says he wouldn’t act on this notion of killing himself so it’s fine. I explained to him that having that thought process is not positive to himself and I think he should speak to someone. 

Matt refuses to speak to anyone or get any support, because in his own words “I looked it up and I am ok now”. He has previously said that although he supports counselling/seeking help, he personally won’t do it because it’s a weakness.

I don’t know what to do. It breaks my heart that he has these thoughts, because he is such a good human being, but I can’t force him so get help and he won’t talk about it when he is sober. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you",mentalhealth,Husband refusing help,2019-01-04 00:40:55
2800,sadsugarbun,1546522655,1,"Hey there. I've had quite the hard life...plagued by nearly 6 years of anorexia with three relapses, anxiety, OCD, depression, and suicidal thoughts. In high school, I had some friends, but my ED made me isolate myself, and my friend group quickly dwindled to one, not so great ""friend"". In my first semester of college, I made a TON of friends. I had a close knit friend group and a best friend who I felt like was my sister. Of course, my ED worsened and I began to isolate myself again. I am now on a leave from college to recover....AGAIN. I currently have no friends. No one from college is going to stay friends with me, since I'm back at home. My best friend has texted me, but I know we are drifting apart, as she is getting into the partying crowd and I am not going to see her since she's at college and I'm home. I literally have no one. My sister and I constantly fight, my parents and I have spats, my cousins occasionally snapchat me. Other than that, I am completely alone. I have no one to text exciting news to or talk about my hobbies with. I have no one to call and chat to. The only interaction I get is from family, my treatment team who I have appointments with two to three times a week, and cashiers when I muster up the energy and courage to venture outside of my house (which is becoming more and more anxiety provoking). I want so badly to have friends. I am, or was, a social person. I feel most myself when I'm with other people. I believe I am kind and funny and loyal. Yet, my ED has drawn me into a dark corner where I am alone and have no one. If anyone relates or has advice, please share. And if anyone wants to be friends, and I do think online friends count as real friends, then please reach out! I'd love to make friends and get to know anyone who would like to get to know me. :)",mentalhealth,Extremely lonely and isolated,2019-01-04 00:37:35
2801,SomeWeirdThingyThing,1546521009,1,"For years, I've talked about how my anxiety and depression cause me to lock up, go mute, lose focus, struggle to do basic, easy things, and more. I've had panic attacks, a couple of which happened right in front of them. At one point, my mental health and the situation with my family got so bad that the only thing I could think to do was run away. So that's what I did. My SO at the time came and got me in the middle of the night and I went to live with her, two states away.  


These are all clear signs that, even if I'm wrong about my mental issues (which is possible, since I'm not yet professionally-diagnosed and simply going by my own research and the observations of people who HAVE been professionally-diagnosed) that SOMETHING is wrong. I don't BENEFIT from making any of it up. In fact, it's hurt me, and put my life so far off track that I'm not sure I'll ever recover...  


So it just baffles me how my family seems to think that just telling me that ""I can do it"", or, ""It's not that hard""/""Not that big a deal"", will make any of my problems go away. They act like I can just 'man up' and do things when I essentially have brain damage inhibiting me most of the time. I can't IMAGINE, as practiced as I am at 'playing normal' that my issues are well and truly unnoticeable, especially since my mother is the most intelligent and perceptive individual I know.  


So... I feel like they just... don't want to accept that maybe I have problems that they can't fix. Or maybe they're afraid that admitting I have serious problems might cause them to wonder whether they're responsible for them in some capacity.  


I don't know what to do about it. I desperately wish I could see a doctor to get diagnosed properly, maybe even have them explain it to my family, but we're in a tight situation (homeless after Hurricane Michael and still looking for a place), and there's no way I'll be able to see a psych soon without some kind of emergency, and even then I can't bear putting that kind of financial strain on us...

I was excited, planned it so my mom would accompany me and everything was fine. Then I get a call, turned out to be the therapist. She seemed nice but after greetings cut to the point of how I needed to change my appt due to the New Year. My mom is a secretary for a neuro so I understood and changed it to today (in lieu of Monday).

Now I have taken a huge step towards my dreams and I'm in another country, studying abroad for a year ( I'm now on the vacation period as my first semester here has concluded). 

The thing is, I'm feeling VERY out of place, I'm struggling, I feel I don't deserve to be here, that I don't belong to such a prestigious school (in this country, it's considered the top University). 

I'm also struggling with money matters, since I'm on a scholarship, but it has not been enough to cover all my expenses (everything in this country cost 3-10 times more than in my home country) and have almost ran out of money, I haven't told anyone because I don't want my family to worry. 

I'm in a really bad place now, at leat mentally, can barely sleep and when I do, I don't want to get up. 

I feel like a failure since I have not been able to secure a scholarship for the next semester and don't know what to do, I'm planning on starting to work, but legally, I can't until March, so my future terrifies me.

2806,TheTenthElement,1546515991,1,"(On mobile, please excuse formatting)

For context, I'll explain everything I can first. About two or so years ago, one of my parents started acting completely different.    Strangely it all started after an ""eye infection"", ""fibers coming out"" of their eyes, doctors not finding anything wrong, and self-diagnosing on Google. After all these years, it almost seems like it was mostly hallucinations? It was like they did a 180 mental switch.  

They didn't sleep as much as usual and would mostly just seem to be in a daze, not paying attention when people are talking to them and delayed or unrelated/incoherent responses.  They always leaned towards argumentative but now snap over any little thing, causing serious confrontations in the house. Even then, I wasn't too concerned, just thought it was stress related. 

About a year ago, they began talking about electromagnetic/radio waves and hearing voices (people cursing at them, a woman saying they were going to fight them, usually threatening voice) or sounds (beeping, buzzing, etc). They smashed and changed phones constantly because they were ""hacked"". Occasionally, they would unplug certain appliances, like a microwave. They said someone supposedly hacked our WiFi so we would have to change the password (and couldn't say what it was aloud) or were sitting in the driveway with some sort of laser device listening in on us. They wouldnt talk to us sometimes because they thought someone was definitely tapped into the house listening.

 Very often, they walk around wearing earphones blasting full volume, sometimes crumpled pieces of aluminum foil as earplugs. Their room is always trashed, they use those thick, car foil soundproof liners all over the wall, dozens of mirrors on the walls. At night, they occasionally spray the windows  with alcohol. One incident, they've hit themselves and mentioned a bleeding spot on their head (I never saw because they had a good up) and claimed something fell on them. 

Often, these episodes don't start until about a day or two after not sleeping and then they switch. It's hard to discuss it when they're not going through and episode because they just vehemently and througly deny it and get upset, but during an episode, it causes a huge argument and sometimes nearing psychical altercations. 

The police recommended we have them evaluated but never gave any bit of help or resources. I am over 18. How can one go about getting their parent evaluated? How can I convince them to get checked willingly? I'm at a lost and just want to do what's the most helpful. We are decently poor so we wouldn't even know where to start for treatment. For privacy reasons, I didn't include my state or city, but you can PM me and I can further discuss that if necessary.

2807,AmbassadorPistachio,1546515618,1,"I'm currently living at home while I go to a local university. This is my first year in college, Im 18, and I'm planning on moving out in 2 years. I just don't know how to manage my feelings right now, which is weird for me because I'm used to being able to manage my stress and anxiety pretty well. I have a lot of conflicting feelings right now that I guess I need perspective on/just need to vent about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start out by saying I have great parents. They are incredibly supportive of me and my goals. They genuinely want to make my life better. I'm very grateful for that.  However, this has been my main issue lately and I don't know if I'm just an asshole for feeling the way I do or if this is normal.  For a while now I've been feeling guilty about the help that I'm receiving. They've been very supportive, letting me use one of their cars to get back and forth from campus, which is about 15 minutes from my house. The thing is old and needed a lot of work before I could drive it. Most of this work I didn't see, let alone help pay for. Same goes for on going care for the car. If there's any problems with it, my parents are the one's who usually handle it. From what I gather, they're also planning on letting me take it with when I move onto my university's main campus, for my last two years. I've been feeling pretty guilty about the help they've been giving me. I have a bad habit of trying to be smallest burden on people, especially my parents, both emotionally and financially. I don't  understand why someone would want to go out of their way for me  the way my parents do. I totally appreciate the support, but don't understand why someone would want to do so much for me. I'm paranoid that I'm lazy and free loading even though I have a part time job, had a really good first semester that I worked hard for, and help out around the house when they need it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I've felt pretty bad when I am at home. During the semester I'm no up to very much, usually studying, working, or playing video games. Most of my time I spend at home is spent in my room. I feel bad spending this amount of time in my room, and feel like I don't spend enough time around my parents. However, this again causes a problem. I'm probably the asshole for this one, but I haven't been enjoying spending time with them lately. I'm mostly home at 9pm+, at which time their usually watching TV. This is usually pretty boring to me but don't mind watching some TV. They're the type to be pretty vocal about their politics, which I unsurprisingly disagree with. I don't really care to talk about politics after I'm finished class and work. I get anxious when I'm sitting down with them, hoping to avoid anything that could get them going. It's a walking on egg shells type of feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilty about all the help my parents give me and how I can't bring myself to stay out of my room for more than an hour a night. I feel like such a burden to them and don't know if I'm justified feeling like this. I never want to me a free loader and try my best to get good grades and have my own life/ save money to be independent. I can't tell if I'm a bad person or not. They really care about me and all I can do is feel bad about it.

2808,supershade,1546514195,1,"I'm worried my father may have some sort of mental illness. 

At first it just seemed like he was prone to getting upset about money. Growing up he and my mom would fight often about finance. He used to be a heavy drinker. It was a huge issue in our family. When he would get drunk he would often act rude to everyone, and that caused a lot of tension between him and the other members of my family.

After his 3rd DUI, he cut back on drinking. Honestly, he's been very good about it. Occasionally he has too much, but overall I'm very proud of him. His bouts of anger still exist though. 

He's usually triggered by money, and if he isn't he brings it into the argument almost immediately. He often claims my mother and I are leeches who only use him for money, and that we contribute nothing to the family. My mom has a full time job, and I work part-time as I attend college. He also claims that we do nothing around the house. My mom does all laundry, dishes, and cooking. In fact, I could easily argue HE does nothing, but that isn't the point (he contributes in other ways, like car-stuff and house maintenance). I'm barely home because of college.

He has a hard time accepting responsibility or acting like an adult. He flips out whenever bills arrive (even though they are paid monthly), and he constantly starts projects around the house without finishing them.

Sometimes he is fine. It's almost like he is a different person. He gets into these moods were he's so rude at the slightest provocation. He says how much he hates his job (he claims his coworkers are rude to him and he is irritated that they do their jobs inefficiently). He wants to go back into business for himself again.When he tried this before, he didn't have enough money or knowledge to run his own business. It was very hard on our family, and it made money tighter than ever. He can be so toxic and angry, and it is always something little that sends him over the edge.

Sometimes he skips work and sleeps all day. Literally he sleeps all day (18+ hours). This is becoming more frequent, and is one of my biggest concerns. 

I'm not sure if I should be trying to get him help. I'm worried about him, but I'm also worried about what will happen if he is fired or quits his job. My family relies on his income, even with mom working her own job. It's true money is important, but I honestly don't understand why he acts like we don't appreciate him for it.

I want to know if I should pursue trying to get him to see a professional. Does this sound like a mental illness, or is it just something personality-wise. Any ideas on what it could be? Any general advice? I'd appreciate it.",mentalhealth,Does my Dad have an Undiagnosed Mental Illness?,2019-01-03 22:16:35

My mom was diagnosed with  leukemia, she needed all the love and support from us so i stepped aside because i thought my problems weren't important enough.

Hi redditors,

Recently I got into a physical fight with my dad. To be honest, it was more like me, abusing him physically.

I think there was a long built up to this point, frequent fights; him yelling, hitting me (when I was young), and else.

I don't know if this is necessary, but let me tell you how the fight started.

So, I lost my wallet and had to buy a new one. Me and my dad were looking at different wallets via my laptop.

We were looking at couple of brands he suggested and he boasted about how he was helping out the company when it was at its infancy and how important he was.

So I said, ""you are fine with this one?"", and there he changed his tone saying that he dosent have enough money to offer such a wallet.

Before thinking that I am a spoiled kid beating my dad, because he refused to buy me a wallet, the problem is not that he refused it. Rather, it is the way he talks. Conversing with him is often convoluted and very stressful to me. In fact, the wallet that I was using was a 20$ wallet from amazon, and I was proud of how cheap and good the wallet was. I was suffice with that wallet. It was him at the beginning, who said 20$ wallet is too cheap. (I asked him for a price point, and he refused saying just show me some wallets so I showed him wallets from every price point imaginable)

Anyways back to the story, I was little bit annoyed at how the conversation was going. My dad, sensing my frustration said angrily, ""Why are you mad at me? I am buying you a wallet. You should be grateful"". Knowing how such a conversation goes (he said something like this all the time. How I only like my mother. How I don't like him despite the fact that he is buying me stuffs). I went to my room and locked the door. I started overwatch, trying to escape him. He banged the door and yelled something (I couldn't hear him because of the earphones) shortly he turned off the internet, shut down the power, and dressed up with a room key. He proceeded to try to kick me out of my house. He did the same thing to my grandmother, when they fought. My grandmother now lives with my uncle instead. This is another long story.

Something just snapped in my brain, and I became crazy. Maybe it was the fact that he always used to say, I am so scared that you may hit me (I never hit him in my life), while he was always the one who got angry and screamed, threw my stuff, and hit me (at least he dosen't hit me anymore, maybe due to my size.)

So there is that. I hit him. I choke him. At first he was screaming, ""kill me kill me!"", and later he apologized. Then I stopped. I locked my door after that incident. Since then, I never saw him again. I feel disgusted when I see him. Its not anger or hate, I just feel sick in my stomach when I see him, or even when I think about him. I don't go to the house as often, because of the fear that I may see him.

I got a news from my mom that his left leg's tendon got little weak because of it. Also, he is re-doing his eye surgery today. It's been a week since that incident and I am not sure if the fight caused it or not.

I haven't had a chance to talk about it, till now.

I dont know what to do, or who to talk to. It's a horrible thing to do as a son.

Maybe Reddit may help me. After all, you guys helped me with a lot of things in my life.",mentalhealth,I need help handling my relationship with my father,2019-01-03 21:32:51

The time is 12 am - 1 am, ok, I know this time is lunch time, but I am only trying to talk to the lady inside the management office for quick 1 min to 2 min about the key situation, they I will just leave, I am not going to completely interrupt her lunch time. (later on I talked to the lady asked her if I was rude, I wasn't)

And then this security guard from outside looked at the camera then talked to me extremely rude ""It is lunch time, blah blah blah"" very rude gesture, not even a freaking please.

After I talk with the management lady, I went to the security guard place, I talked to him, I said I am looking for my key.

Then he respond with ""So...? How does that related with me? Again, kind of rude.

(The situation is every time usually when someone loses their stuff, if some one found it they will turn it in at the security guard place, that's why I need go to the security guard area to find my key)

I said ""I think I lost my key I want to find the lost and found box"" He said ""That box have been sitting there for a long time, no one has ever been turning recently""

(There is 3 security guard at my building, so there is a chance some one might turn the key in, that is why I want to do a double check to see if my key was there)

So this situation got me extremely heated, in the security guard head he might think I am a stranger, but every day I drive my car to the building he should recognize me, and when we talk each other about this key bullshit it really got me in the head, I even said some negative word to him, every time I see this security guard I want to punch his face, like today when I walk by the security area he even stared me again, he still think he is a punk ass tough dude.

Like even if we fight I don't think I am win because this security probably have his own weapon. I mean I am taller than him and more muscular than him, if he finish his shift and walk into the build and saw me I really want to aggressively attack him.

My solution to this is simple, security guard makes just little more than minimum wage, in the end I will find a way better job than him, I am not going to waste my fucking time with this kind of low level pathetic human being.

She's having trouble leaving the house, keeps her room dark and has been ordering a lot of takeout food. I can hear her crying from the next rooms during the day some times.

She is seeing a therapist on a regular basis.

However, an enquiry into how she is doing if she looks upset can lead into a 45 minute plus monologue, with many many tangents. It's really draining to listen to. I've given it a shot but sometimes I don't have the energy to be a therapist. It's like she's piling all her stresses and anxietes on me, and I'm being slowly crushed under the weight of it all. It can really impact my mood and eat up a lot of time. It's really hard to keep her on track / get to the point of her long, rambling, detailed stories. I want to be a supportive friend but I don't have the energy to listen to her for hours every day. She doesn't seem to register that I might be in the middle of something when she launches into one of these epic stories. 

And perhaps this isn't a crisis, but something she does all the time? I haven't known her for more than 4 months but the whole time she's been in the house, it seems like some major shit has been going down in her life. I can't tell if she is genuinely suffering or perpetuating drama at this point.  I find it hard to understand this pattern of behaviour / emotion processing - I'm more of a represser myself and I'm aghast at the thought of imposing my emotional turmoil on others.

Can anyone offer some words of advice, or suggestions, on how I can help my housemate without getting sucked into the spiral? Or help shed some light on her way of dealing with things? I feel like such an asshole when I avoid her and run to my room and I feel like she could really use a hand.

The bodily location of this feeling is hard to pinpoint, but I would say it occurs at the bottom of my neck/throat and top of my upper chest (the point where the two meet). In a sense, it feels like excitement/an anticipatory happiness feeling that has gone too far and hurts. This feeling would come out of nowhere, and led to a lot of discomfort/worry. This symptom still occurs every day or few days, both when on meds that resolve the panic attacks, and when off meds.

2840,Savassan,1546485451,1,"So, i have suffered from several mental illnesses, AvPD being one of the big ones, Depression, OCD, PTSD few others. I have had thousands of hours of therapy, in and out of mental hospitals and went from unstable to stable. I have managed to root out roughly when all my problems started. Age 12. do too extreme bullying-Some doctors suspect i have PTSD from the bullying. I managed to put it all behind me (so i thought) until my mental breakdown at age 21. The thing is, my memory simply is... broken, from all the bullying in homeschooling age 12-14, i simply dont remember. I can track the root of my issues, the lack of self worth, the anxiety, the depression, the mistrust, the desperation to be liked by everyone, the fear of criticism to age 12. I have one friend from middle school who remembers the bullying and a lot of details, yet i... i simply dont. I mean i KNOW i was bullied, i have a few memories but mostly its just ""i was made fun of"" or ""i was beaten up a few times"", i DO remember going to bed crying praying for death, i do remember having almost no friends. But thats it, which is the main reason i even know my bullying was bad because why i go to bed crying praying for death if it WASNT. seriously. My friend from middle school, T, said he wasnt surprised when i mentioned i may have PTSD from that time, he would talk about how bad it was. He could tell me about these horrible things that happened to me, and to me he could be making them up, but im positive he isnt. I have tried to straighten my life out, i live on disability and have become stable. But i cant manage to make any more progression. I have hit a point of simple apathy and stagnation. I suspect some of it comes from feelings of not thinking i deserve to be happy and a bunch of other stuff, all of which stems from self worth which was mostly affected in middleschool. I have tried to simply accept that im an adult (now 30) and that i should be able to make/change my life and become happy, but its like building a house in a swamp. Everytime i try and build, the foundation gives out and i end back at square 1. I dont know if its possible to move forward without rebuilding everything from ground up. But at this point... i dont know how. How do you fix issues that formed who you are, to the core, when you cant remember it, and HOW cant i remember it? you would think things so important would be easy. My memory is one of the worst i have ever met, I dont remember when it got so bad, but even things from last week i tend to not remember, stories from past my family tell me i dont remember, highschool i dont remember much, my one relationship (5 years) has some memories but i would expect id have more- but again, its REALLY hard to compare if i have a bad memory or a normal one, because everyone is different. to me it FEELS like mine is terrible. I have been in and out of dozens of mental hospitals and again, its like a mist. I Know the facts that i have been there, but i cant tell you many stories from them.

To go along with my memory is my attention, which also is almost 0. But not from like ADHD, i just dont... notice things or keep a thought. Like my parents can go ""pick up the clothes on the stairs when you go upstairs"" and 30s later ill go upstairs ill walk right past the clothes, not notice them, not remember my parents asking me.

2844,TerminallyOdd,1546484115,1,"...when that friend is being a total a-hole to me in the process? Long story short, a friend I've had for many years had some bouts with depression years back along with a physical health scare and we were worried he was going to harm himself. We all rushed to be by his side and did what we could to help see him through it, myself included. I don't think he ever fully recovered psychologically, and has never quite seemed like himself since. This was a guy I enjoyed being around for many years, and the feeling was mutual - we would hang out and have a good time. Nowadays, he is going about getting help, but is very hush-hush about the means he's taking to do so.

Anyway, over time, he's gotten the idea in his head that I only care about myself and constantly takes jabs at me about this. I believe he's basing this on a few seemingly minor events where he needed me to show I cared about him by doing him a favor (that's the test he gives everyone), and apparently I failed. I explain those situations since I do believe they're explainable (we were running late for a movie one time and I couldn't make a detour, for example), but he constantly brings them up, neglecting to recall that I was there for him in his darkest time. I'm not even sure he remembers that.

Either way, if there wasn't a group context involved, I would probably suggest he and I go our separate ways - neither of us needs the toxicity. If I try to have a convo about it, it would be passed off as being said in jest, but a few times when drunk he's been more serious about it, and I can tell it's legit. Quite frankly, the feeling is mutual at this point, and he's being coddled by others in the group since they feel sorry for him and are worried about what he might do if called out for his antics. I'm pretty much done feeling that way. He basically asks to be coddled, as his big thing is the group looks down on him and the only way to show you care is to abide by his requests for favors. I tried for a long time to be sensitive to his issues, but I'm not interested in doing this or coddling anyone. I'm also very different personality-wise as he seems hell-bent on spreading misery to others, whereas I'm someone who would never unload my grief on anyone.

Saying I don't want to be around him would ruin a group dynamic we have with others who are very close to me and who don't get together all that often. They wouldn't accept us alternating hang out sessions, and me coming out and saying I don't want to deal with it would just throw a monkey wrench into this group thing, that is important to most involved as we are lifelong friends. We also chat constantly as a group over text...so yeah, I'm really not sure how to go about handling this without potentially blowing the whole thing up.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety by pcp 20 plus years ago. But I want to get real help. I have been to therapists and it usually just ends up with us staring at each other. I believe I do have a problem that needs addressing. I’m a 44 year old male and know I have potential.


So background, I believe I have social anxiety and it hinders me. I have had one girlfriend that I married out of convenience for both of us and we have a 10 year old son. I make a decent living at $100,000 a year, yet have no money and and always have to find a way to pay bills. This is due to me always spending money in the moment to make him happy and me.


I can know something is coming up but will put it off. Example; ski trip in month that will cost $2,000; I will figure out how to pay the week before for necessities to join and payback who I need to when they demand it. Car needs to be fixed, I will drive it to the ground and just buy another one. Not driving nice cars, paying less than $1,000 and hope they last.


I really don’t know that I care for people. Had my best friend die and it did not bother me, but there is more to that as it was my brother in law. We had known each other since we were six.


I self medicate with benzos, weed and alcohol.  When I am off them things go great and then I figure I can enjoy them again. I can’t and things go rough. I control them enough to keep my job. I’m good at it and employers overlook it because I make them money.


Anything I have an interest I do will and then get bored of because I am good at. Except my job because I know I need to make a living. But I do let my job slack and then take it a notch above everyone to keep job.

So I’ve struggled with depression for the best part of 2 years now. It started when I was with my ex girlfriend, who also suffered with various mental health issues. She had depression, anxiety, eating disorders and psychosis which made her see and hear things which weren’t actually there. I loved this girl more than I’ve ever loved anyone, I had my life planned out with her, she was my future. 

I tried and tried to do what I thought was best for her, I was there when she needed me, I made sure she was eating, I made sure she knew I loved her and was there for her, however, she was struggling and it wasn’t enough. I couldn’t do it alone and I was spiralling fast. Although all I wanted to do was help I was pushed away and accused of not caring about her. I think this is what broke me the most. All the time spent, staying up all night looking up her disorders and seeing what I can do to help. All of the horrible things I had seen, self harm, suicide attempts, they hit me like a train each time. I fucking cared more than anything, and it angers me that she would think otherwise.

I look back on the end of the relationship and I feel incredibly guilty about what I did, even though I know to some it was a reasonable option and maybe the best thing for my health. After she was in hospital numerous times after attempting suicide, I told myself I couldn’t do this anymore and I broke up with her. I look back and ask why the fuck I did this, why I was so fucking selfish when she was in such  crisis.

As previously stated, I have struggled with depression for a couple years and I’ve always tried to remain strong, I haven’t let it affect my daily life too much, that is until recently. I’ve dabbled in drugs and alcohol for a while but recently it’s gotten worse - I woke up in hospital after a ketamine overdose after a particularly hard night, which to this date is the lowest I’ve ever felt. I’ve always kept my mental health quite private, my close friends know what I’m going through but my family have never had a clue, however, suddenly, it was all out there. My drug use, my depression, everything. It was incredibly hard for me to explain everything to my parents however I am now going to get the help I need. I’ve seen a doctor who has prescribed me some antidepressents and I’m on a waiting list to go to therapy. Since the overdose however I am at a very low point. I have been having suicidal thoughts and have begun isolating myself and keeping away from social situations which I would usually go to. 

I guess if anyone has any tips to deal with this shit until therapy is available that would be great.

If you made it this far thanks for reading, and if anyone else is going through a hard time, I really wish you the best. I’m not a religious person however for what it’s worth you’re all in my thoughts and prayers. Mental illness is like a cancer of the mind, and we need to work together worldwide to make it less of a taboo subject

2860,Scroje,1546473283,1,"I’m a 16 year old male, 11th grader. 3 years ago I was a severe anorexic, got down to 71 pounds by eating as low as 200 a calories in vegetables and running 5 miles a day. I thought my life was living hell at the time, I had plans to jump off a bridge but for some reason I ended up talking to my dad and he helped me be normal again after about 6 months of therapy and forcing me to eat. This point in my life is what I think kickyed off my anxiety and depression, I lost all my friends that year and didn’t feel like I’d ever come back. After 2 years of mild mood swings, fairly normal I guess. I ended up getting a girlfriend, dated her for 6 months and she had what self diagnosed “anxiety”. I really think she mentally abused me, and completely ruined my idea of people with anxiety. Ever since then, as my anxiety became really severe I never told anyone because of the impression she left in me about people who have anxiety, I don’t want to be like her. The day we broke up I started smoking weed, and drinking a few months later. Flash forward about 6 months until May, I did those 2 drugs every weekend, fairly normal for people my age. I ended up getting another girlfriend with actually diagnosed anxiety and depression. I didn’t want to say it because I unknowingly began having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts but she was the most meaningful part of my life, she was so sweet and I feel like I loved her, but how much can a 16 year old feel love. We met when we were both drunk at a party, throughout our relationship I started drinking daily, just like my dad. My dad has a really big problem with drugs when he was younger, as did almost every one of my relatives. I guess it ran in my family, but one night I had 10 beers and cheated on my girlfriend. I never would have considered this if I was in a clear head, but she found out and it broke her heart. I know she struggled just like I did, and I couldn’t forgive myself. That day I ordered a large amount of opiates, and became hooked on them, which I accepted would happen. Less than a month after we broke up she started dating my best friend at the time, and after hearing that I stopped drinking and started heavily dosing with my new stuff. I also used acid once shortly after. After many months, towards the end of summer, I was running low on my stash and figured it was time to stop. I tried quitting for about a month before I finally had 2 clinic seizures in one day directly after the drugs wore off. I swore to myself would be the last time using them, as I ran out that day luckily too. It was the toughest week of my life up to that point, I really had no one to talk to during this time, I had no real friends outside of those who I smoked with, who never talked to me sober. I downed a whole bottle of what antidepressants I had, and had a beer which I hoped would mix with them to make it fatal, the withdrawal and loneliness was too much for me to handle. I woke up the next night, not dead and I’m extreme pain. I realized it’s incredibly hard to overdose on antidepressants, and at that point I realized how hard it was to painlessly and effectively kill yourself. After this I ordered a lot of phenibut and Xanax, the withdrawal wasn’t worth it to me. I used that for a few weeks, at this point I realized I had severe mental issues. Although my dad helped me many years ago beat anorexia we no longer had that relationship anymore since I started using drugs. Rather than talk through issues my parents gave me Xanax and edibles to cope, which I wish they never did that and talked to me instead  because that made drugs my coping mechanism. I don’t want anyone to make a big deal out of this, I don’t blame them for resorting to this. Me and my parents haven’t had a full convo in years, and I am the hardest person to talk to because I forget what I’m saying is sentence and mumble, I know I would’ve ended my life much sooner if my parents hadn’t done this. My life is so fucked up. I ordered about a $100 of weed dab carts, and used that 5 times a day for 2 months rather than solely rely on Xanax and pheni. After I ran out, I decided it was time for me to get clean. I started drinking coffee throughout the day so I could feel motivated to stay awake long enough to go to school etc. Throughout the year my friends could see my mental state declining, I’m not sure exactly what schizophrenia is like but I’m sure I have it. I hear voices yelling at me all the time and see things out of the corner of my eyes at times. Sometimes I will realize where I am and have a panic attack, like I zone out and realize I’m at school and get nervous. I confuse my dreams with reality and it’s seriously affecting me. Flash forward to a few days ago, I have been taking a lot of xans and pheni, life has never felt worse. I lie in bed all day long crying and screaming in my pillow. Every noise makes me angry, I’ve broken a lot of things. A month ago my best friend broke up with his ex, and I heard our mutual friends have completely abandoned her. I know her life is like mine, minus the drugs and dissociation but like anxiety and depression/loneliness. I decided to start talking to her, not because I want to get back together, but I’m sick of feeling so lonely. I reunited her with my friends and it felt amazing until this morning when my life all came back to my realization. She stopped talking to me and I’m lonelier than ever. I feel like that was my last attempt to help myself feel good about myself, I’ve heard that if you make others happy you will be happy yourself, but it just didn’t work. I ordered $100 of Xanax and I am considering either taking it compulsively or just taking it all with a beer to end my misery, I can’t do an in between. I can’t deal with this deep feeling of emptiness inside me. This might be my anxiety kicking in but I’m afraid someone reading this will somehow find out who I am and call cps or something, please don’t, if you could rather try and talk to me it would be better than putting the blame on others, I’m much more comfortable with my life being ruined than others, I’m hoping this post won’t affect my life in the future aka background searching, idk how they work.

2861,LividLibrarian,1546472487,1,"Throughout my entire life I've always been extremely lonely. I am underdeveloped socially (bad social anxiety, mostly gone away now), I don't really know whether I like to talk to people or not (assuming I wasn't anxious or uncomfortable around people). Anyways, one of my earliest memories is of me crying to my 3rd grade teacher, I specifically remember telling her that I hated myself. My mind has always felt a bit foggy and my emotions less intense than other peoples, but I assume that's just my personality, and it's normal to feel a bit foggy. There's been a few days that I can remember where I've been able to feel present in the moment, like able to actually focus and fully understand whats going on around, but most days I just kinda do stuff and it takes a lot of conscious effort to do even basic things like make small talk with my girlfriend, who I've been with for 2 months and don't feel too nervous around. Is it possible I've actually been depressed my entire life. Recently (about 2 months ago, because having a girlfriend meant I couldn't just hide from the world anymore, but I think I pushed myself too far too soon) I've started having serious suicidal thoughts, they've always kind of been there, but only when I've gotten really emotional, and they've gone back to that way now. I've always had an inability to really genuinely laugh at stuff, there were a few times but they're rare.  I always just assumed that's my personality. I'm thinking about this because recently I had a good day, I felt present in the moment and simple things were simple to do, I genuinely laughed at some things, and I want to know if that's how a normal happy person feels most of the time or if that would just be considered a good day. Is it possible I've been depressed my entire life or most of my life? I was actually diagnosed with social anxiety and depression about a month ago.

Even if no one is talking to me (which is most of the time), I'll sit there and scroll through all of my social media time after time for hours. I'm constantly refreshing even though I know nothing knew has been posted. I downloaded Reddit a week ago and honestly, it hasn't helped the cause because for the first time in my life I feel like I have supportive communities. So I've been posting constantly about every question/issue I have, and trying to help others.

This obsession is so bad to the point that it's affecting my ability to regulate my sleep, which is already an issue. I'll be on my phone for hours...I'll look at the time once and it'll be 11pm-midnight and next time I look it'll be 5 or 6am. It's like I space out and lose track of time. If I put my phone down and try to go to sleep, I start thinking of things I need to do or look up. Then I go get my phone and I go down the rabbit hole again. It's also an issue in social situations...even if I'm out to dinner or at a party, my attention is on my phone and posting pics instead of on the people I'm with. I even sneak to use my phone at work (I'm not working right now, but when I was).

I've tried literally *everything*. I've tried putting my phone in another room or putting it down before bedtime...it doesn't work, I'll just get up and go get my phone. I've tried deleting my social media apps or deactivating my accounts, but I either redownload them or reactivate within a few days. Even during those few days, I can't put my phone down-if it's not social media, it's videos, games, or looking up stuff online. I'm at my wit's end.

I have a top-of-the-line smartphone that I saved up for a while to buy, but I've actually considered selling my phone to get a generic flip phone. Problem is, I feel like then I'll be even more isolated from people because I rarely call or text...I don't even have most people's numbers because I just use Messenger or other apps. I know in this day and age I can't just not have a phone at all especially while I'm job searching, but at times I feel that's the only solution.

Does anyone have advice? Is there treatment that is specifically targeted for this issue? I need help. ",mentalhealth,Phone addiction,2019-01-03 10:39:51
2863,holdenducks,1546472096,1,"I'm not sure if this the right place to post this, but I'll give it a shot. There are this aspects of my personality that now that I acknowledge I feel are ruining my life. I have a tendency of ruining every relationship I have kind of just for the hell of it. I keep either running or pushing people away, and I dont know how to stop. Even when I think Im doing shit right I end up realizing Im again repeating myself over and over. I have to say, before I go on, that I have a depression history. I felt really blue since I had conscience. I've been depressed my whole adolescense and even further. I was so mistrusting, everything seemed so dark to me. Had many shitty relationships and got fucked over a lot by people I cared about. My depression, I never acknowledge it until it started going away. My perspective of life and reality was changing so much. The way I felt, how more physicly lighter. This is the only reason I got to realize about my it, while it faded away. This wasn't long ago, maybe 2 years (I'm 21 now). I was living abroad. I left out of desperation. I had to leave my reality some how, and since I had the means I just went far away, inst ead of the only other alternative. While I was there, after feeling very lonely and hopeless, being at my lowest, considering to leave this world for good, I ended up surrounded by people who made me feel good, people I cared about and that cared about me. They made me feel I was worth something. Loneliness had always been heavy on me. I came back home so I never had the time to fuck that up. But since I came back I do nothing but ruin things for myself. I get scared of loving the people I love. Some people I'm scared I'll hurt so I run away, some other people I'm scared they will hurt me so I hurt them first. When I'm sensing I'll get hurt I get obscure and out of control and I do fucked up shit. I start drinking a lot. I'm probably one of those people that people refer as ""toxic"", but I'm truly just so caring. I feel so lonely but I keep pushing everyone away. It ruins me. I usually just feel happy when there's someone I feel are special around me, but it scares me and it makes me feel my happiness isnt real, and that it wont last. I even feel it kind of extreme, maniac. I have a therapist, and she helps me acknowledge all this things, but I'm so tired, I dont think I have the energy to keep trying. The road seems so long, and the finish line so far away. I really try, and when I feel I'm making the right choices I end up realizing I am totally not, and then it is too late. I get so obscure and angry and sad. And my drinking is gets heavier. How come I feel so broken and fucked up? my family is alright. I have two very loving parents, two sisters that are just not fucked up at all. But me, I've been always so sad, always seemed everything so upside down. How did I turn out like this? How do I go on?

I can't stand when my personality changes. Every time I go from one phase to another, I'll be struck with regret and desperately wish to go back to who I used to be. It doesn't even have to be a major change. For instance, for the past few years I've been literally grieving the loss of my favorite band. I have no idea what happened and why I lost interest in their music but being a depressed individual and having lived with mental illness for so long, I often find relief im things like movies, bands and hobbies. This band has been a huge part of my life for many years and I used to listen to them everyday...moreover than that, the time I discovered their music was the only phase in my life when my depression went away completely. So because of this, I kept clinging on them until I eventually probably burned out/lost interest in them and I've been regretting this for almost two years, waking up every day and wishing that I could go back and feel the same happiness I used to feel when listening to their music. This is just an example, but I've been through the same process with many other things. Basically, I find something that I adore, I invest all my emotions and energy in it, then I lose interest in it and I feel like I've lost a huge part of myself that I will never get back. I really don't know what to do. I don't even know whether me losing interest in the things I've adored so much is a result of depression or just regular change. Either way, I hate it and I haven't found a way to cope with it. Every time I lose something I love, I feel like I've lost myself.

2868,BetterMyself42Morrow,1546467900,1,"With the start of the new year, I’m looking to buckle down and tackle my mental health. I know Reddit is not a therapist, and I plan on making an appointment and seeing one. But before I do that, I’m hoping to at least gather some insight into my situation and hopefully hear from people who can relate and their experiences. (Please let me know if there is a better sub for this).

For starters, I do everything fast. I eat fast. I drink fast. I walk fast. I work fast. I play fast. I drive fast. Everything. I can never take a moment to “stop and smell the roses”.

I have a hard time with commitment. Not in my romantic relationships. My relationships are usually pretty good, but if somebody “burns” me, I might be quick to “drop” them. 

Along with the commitment issue, I have a very difficult time finishing what I started. This is the reason I have pretty much no hobbies. As soon as I try something, I get bored and quit. Or I have a hard time devoting my time to even trying in the first place. This might be why I’ve never held a job for longer than 2 years.

I always have anxiety. It’s usually quite manageable, and I never really realize it’s there until I think about it. 

I’ve also struggled with depression my entire life. Nothing terrible, again mostly manageable. I’ve never felt suicidal to the point that it was a concern. Some days the depression is worse than others, usually it’s circumstantial. 

Other days I’m super motivated, and can get a lot of stuff done around the house. Again, usually doing it quickly running around like a mad man going from one thing to the next (and finishing them). Not entirely sure where the motivation comes from some days, but I definitely try to take advantage of it. 

I also find myself being very cynical of everybody/everything.

Some days I feel like I’m only depressed. Other days I feel like I’ve got ADHD. Or bipolar. I’m hoping that therapy can help me sort through all of this and help me tackle my issues. But for now, is there anybody here who can relate to these symptoms and have gotten help? What are your experiences?",mentalhealth,Looking for insight,2019-01-03 09:25:00
2869,nerdie11,1546467704,1,"My mom’s mental instability started when I was in 6th grade. She got fired from her job and everything went down hill from there. She’s never been diagnosed but judging by her symptoms I believe she is schizophrenic. I know 100% she is depressed.

My parents would fight constantly. I remember I would cry at night almost everyday and barely get any sleep. My mom would fight about the most random things. Sometimes she would talk and talk and talk and all of it wouldn’t make sense. It’s like she would make up problems in her head. She was also very paranoid, maybe now so much now. Didn’t trust cell phones or computers for example. She would sit on the couch almost all day. Now she does a lot of knitting. 

So of course it was very hard on me growing up. I started hating my mom. Started getting depressed when I was a teenager. I just wanted to get out of that damn house. I’m now 29F. Have my own house and it’s been a few years since living at my parents.

Now I’m living with guilt. I feel like I need to do something but I don’t know what. I still have lots of hatred for my mom. She can be very mean and toxic.

I believe need to talk out strategies to manage spiraling, anxiety, and  common ADHD compensation patterns. My baseline is usually pretty happy when I manage my stress well. I’m fairly driven in my work, but I also think my workaholism is to exhaust myself beyond the option to think about my own feelings of self hatred and loneliness. 

I have only occasionally gone in for one-offs (courtesy of my school, where consistent scheduling is nearly impossible). On one occasion, the psychologist said something about my fear of failure having validity in the actual failures I’ve had, so I never went back to her. The other one, although he was likeable, was hard to see because he was never available.

That they can't help me if I won't help myself. I understand the logic of that, but I just can't do it.

I also have a reoccurring fear that people can read my thoughts, or that my thoughts were being exposed to a group of godlike beings that watched over and judged me for my bad decisions. 

Now, present day, I’m constantly checking my windows to see if there is someone in the yard, I have a concern that there are cameras watching me in my bathroom vent that can be viewed by my family, although I never have bothered to check if there were actually cameras. 

I also have a constant reoccurrence where I firmly believe that if I don’t make myself uncomfortable or give away something valuable to me then bad things will happen to me because of my selfishness.

My mind is scrambled, on top of a bad sleeping disorder, a lot of anxiousness and constant sadness, half the time I cannot put a simple sentence together without stuttering, sometimes I have a hard time comprehending basic things, and (now more than ever) I feel dissociated from reality.

I started a relationship towards the end of my recovery (a year and a half ago) and that also helped a great deal as he was/is great and patient and supportive with everything. While I never felt good about my body I was able to fight off invasive thoughts and accept myself for what I looked like. 

A year and a half later, everything is the same. No eating disorder, same awesome boyfriend, I'm actually in a better place (away at college instead of in my home that was toxic) and around him more instead of being long distance. I would think that my situation would improve, but I gained weight. Not much, about 10 lbs, still at normal weight and healthy, I'm excercising more than usual, getting outside, eating healthy, all the things that should improve mental health. The weight gain just seems to be hurting more than it should.

I have never gotten jealous in my relationship before, I trust him 100%, I've never been jealous of his ex or other girls or been afraid of the future or thought I wasn't good enough for him, or anything. He has given me no reason to change this, but all of the sudden I am feeling all of these things, and it sucks. 

I feel ashamed of my body, like I'm not good enough for him because I'm not attractive enough/smart enough/happy enough/too stressed out and that he's gonna leave me, and it's not just him. I worry my friends are gonna leave because I am not as funny as I used to be or not as fun. I am a lot more negative and argumentative than I was just a bit ago and I'm not sure what to do. Every little thing my boyfriend does that I don't 100% approve of my brain goes into victim mode and I have to pause a second and convince myself that he did nothing wrong and that I'm overthinking things, and even though I can see this logically and on the surface, the bad feeling (that is uncalled for) doesn't go away. 

He is very supportive, and we've talked and he has been checking up with the insecurity thing every day, and he said I should bring up any anxieties I'm feeling that he might have caused even if they aren't logical. I bring up some but I don't want to overwhelm him or chase him away with this because he doesn't really know what he's getting into. I'm honestly just not sure what to do, therapy in the past has not been helpful and I've only gotten better on my own if I'm being completely honest.

I cant bring myself to leave the house and go food shopping, I haven't had any proper food in a while resulting in ordering takeaways instead of buying proper food.

I am putting off my work and revision constantly as a result of having no energy or just pure laziness.

I cannot bring myself to do the simplest things like going down to the corner shop for a lightbulb, buying food, pretty much the only time I go out the house is if in going clubbing, since I enjoy being drunk way more than being sober at the moment. This whole situation has occurred off and on during my first term but I've suddenly taken a massive hit in these holidays.

I'm in my mid 20s and was abused growing up. Typing this out is hard, as I'm finally being honest with myself. My sister opened up about the abuse we had growing up and it devastated my mother that she feels that way. IDK if our father knows how she feels. It lead to me finally acknowledging my upbringing. I felt like I always made excuses for how I was raised.

I won't get into details, but both physical and emotional abuse was regular, and I grew up under insane stress. Fundamentalist religion justified their behavior (they still don't know I'm pansexual) Maybe this isn't the right place to post, but no place is the right place.

I'll just lay out all my social problems to any kindhearted soul who wishes to hear, and maybe we can determine what is just normal social ineptitude, my own selfish personality flaws, and what might need addressing with therapy.

I'm constantly terribly paranoid about making people around me happy, and worry they are angry if they don't reply to my texts, even if it is totally unsubstantiated. I constantly lie, habitually, to keep people happy. It's usually about stupid stuff that I immediately regret after saying. I spark conversations with people just to check that we are still good. I know they feel like their space isn't respected, and I wish I wasn't like this. I feel weird when people sit behind me at restaurants, so I opt to sit where my back is to a wall. My memory is horrible, I can't remember basic events from my childhood.

If I do need a therapist, what does that even mean? There are tons of different kinds of therapists. Does insurance cover that type of therapy? I'm privileged w/decent insurance...

How would I even start looking for therapy? I'm not religious, I don't want religion to be a part of my therapy.

I moved out, have a stable job, and am otherwise safe. I am in a relationship that's near 6 years running, and thinking back I know I was emotionally abusive the first 6mo to a year. I saw my dad in me. I'm typing this with tears in my eyes. We are better than ever now thankfully, my partner was very patient with me.

I managed to graduate with a popular music BA despite dealing with depression and having a panic attack right in front of the uni’s arbiter for deadline extensions, thanks to two excellent therapists that I saw.

It might sound cliched but a little while after those experiences I had a complete reversal in my outlook on life. I went from feeling that everything, including my own existence, was pointless, to being determined to try as hard as possible at all of the things I wanted to achieve.

Well, a shitload of failed music related job applications and flaking bandmates later, I find myself dissatisfied with my professional life (I work in retail/warehousing) and still desperate to achieve my aspirations of being a successful songwriter and musician.

I’m really proud of my ability to write music, and i feel like I was meant to do it. Despite not having a band or much free time anymore, I still try to record my songs as quickly as I can because I’ve always got a backlog of stuff I’ve written but not recorded, and I want to be prepared for when I am leading a band again.

The thing that’s concerning me is that I get really frustrated with myself and go to bed feeling pretty shit about myself on those days when I haven’t managed to find time to record/produce/write anything. 

Last night my girlfriend said that I shouldn’t tie my self-worth to my creative output, but that’s basically what I’ve built my life around by this point. I spent 6 years of formal education on it, a shitload of my time, money and effort on it, and I only really feel truly pleased and content when I’ve just finished writing some lyrics or recording a guitar part or something. I identify myself as a creative person.

Is she right? Because in a way that would put me right back at the start again.

2891,CentrifugalFarts69,1546450628,1,"Dont worry about offending. I can take it. Just be honest.

Bit of background info first; I'm a 29 year old male who lives alone. About 4 months back I was diagnosed with this thing that causes all the cartilage in your ribs to become inflamed (and in turn a lot of the muscles and soft tissue around the chest also become inflamed). At its most mild this results in a slight discomfort and dull ache throughout the day. At its worst it gives you pains akin to that of a heart attack and makes breathing quite painful.

About a month after that I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I know I've had depression for a long time but officially I was only diagnosed with it recently because I hadn't bothered going to the doctor about it before and tried to just ""man up"" and deal with it myself (mostly by bottling up feelings and smoking lots of weed). 

The anxiety was totally new to me (although now that I've read more about it im beginning to think it's something I've been dealing with for a while without really knowing it). 

_(This next part isnt that important so just skip past it if you cant be bothered with the details) The three issues have sort of being playing off each other. 

The problem with my chest prevents me from exercising or doing too much outside of the house as the more you exert yourself the more those muscles are being worked = more pain. Which in turn means I spend a lot of time in the house which doesn't help the depression (and might be pushing me further down the anxiety rabbit hole so to speak). 

The depression prevents me from enjoying the things I normally enjoy in the house (video games, books, tv shows etc). While the anxiety and chest issues combined are preventing me from sleeping properly, which means I'm awake for at least 20 hours per day which means more time spent sitting around the house feeling depressed and trapped in my own head unable to do the things I would normally enjoy_ .


Here's the part I need your opinion on; 

I live a 20 minute drive from my parents. This past Saturday all my siblings came into town to celebrate new year and we all decided just to stay at my parents house for a few nights (which my parents were ecstatic about, having us all back together). 

Now new year has passed. I'm still staying at my parents. They are aware of my problems but I've downplayed the mental health side of it a fair amount. They've offered to let me stay for the rest of the week because I said I've been sleeping better here and they're happy for me to stay if it means I'm getting some sleep. 

I went back to my place today to pick up something for the dog and as soon as I entered my house I started feeling overwhelmingly depressed, intrusive thoughts (suicidal to be blunt) and generally just exhausted, weakened and hopeless. 

I want to stay at my parents for another night. Maybe longer. But not only do I feel like a burden I feel completely pathetic. I'm pushing 30, I own my own house, have a mortgage etc but all I want is to live with my parents again. 

The thing is part of me feels like the longer I stay the more dependent I'll become on them again. Also I'm not sure how much of their offer is just out of politeness/a feeling of obligation.

There's an element of loneliness here if I'm being honest with myself. I'm a heavily introverted person so I normally like being alone but recently (not sure if this is related to the anxiety) I've began to lose trust in my closest friends and I'm even beginning to wonder if they see our friendship the way I do and if I actually have any real friends at all. This has really been fucking with my head and making me feel more isolated than usual I guess.

Is staying with my parents for a few more days being totally pathetic? Am I potentially doing myself a disservice by leaning on them even more?

2892,lalaxox,1546450319,1,"Background info: brother (age 21) has been a chronic weed smoker since the age of about 14/15. Has been increasingly volatile and has been exhibiting signs of delirium for years now.

Examples of his delirium include:
- thinking we're all part of a big conspiracy thats out to get him.
- that people walk past him and deliberately scuff their feet at him to annoy him.
- thinking our house is being watched 24/7 and there's recording devices and we all know about it.
- thinking people want to burn the house down.
- thinking he's invincible and his thoughts/perceptions transcend everybody else's.

Auditory hallucinations include:
- thinking we deliberately make duck noises then deny it to convince him he's crazy.
- hearing clicking noises that ""correlate with his thoughts""
- thinking he hears us walking around the house and talking when we're all asleep (hence why we get woken up by him shouting ""cunts/shut the fuck up"").

So thats my brother. We've had many a 'domestic crisis' because of his behaviour and episodes and we've finally gotten to the point where the police have informally diagnosed him and recommend that we get him to a formal assessment that could lead to treatment.

The problem is he won't engage. He is ridiculously arrogant and believes there is absolutely nothing wrong with him. So the only alternative is that he gets sectioned.

Sectioning him would require an offence/outburst from him (physical of course) which would only happen if we aggravated/goaded him into being physical which in my opinion is manipulative and i'd rather not.

2904,nosidamadison,1546435675,1,"My roommate is going to kill himself and I don’t know what to do.

I’ve been trying to help him for about two years now. We recently just moved all the way across the country thinking if we changed our surroundings to a place with more opportunity, we could get better jobs and make new friends.

However,  he did not. 

He works a job he doesn’t hate but he hates his higher ups. He has a HUGE problem with authority. He has made no friends. I’m his only friend. One of my friends has tried branching out to him to befriend him but he’s putting no effort into it, making it kind of impossible.

Last night he posted to a Facebook group that’s pretty much just a ton of depressed teens and young adults that talk about suicide, post self deprecating memes, etc. He had posted about suicide before but I thought maybe he was just expressing himself to likeminded people for support. They’re just encouraging him to “do what he wants and end it.” A VERY toxic community but he got mad when I brought it up.

He told me previously that I was the only thing that made him happy and he felt like me hanging out with my new friends was me abandoning him. I’ve explained *numerous* times that I’m not abandoning him. I don’t even really leave the house anymore because I was afraid hanging out with my friends would push him over the edge. 

I can’t keep living like this, but if I don’t, I’m afraid he won’t be living *at all.*

I don’t know what to do.

He won’t see a psychologist. He doesn’t have insurance and he doesn’t believe in spending money if it’s not for what he wants. 

At this point, I woke up this morning to a message asking me to find a new place to live because he didn’t want me to be screwed when he eventually killed himself.

I don’t get paid until the 11th, so even if I talk him into a therapist if I pay for it, it’ll be two weeks before I can. I’m almost positive a therapist will put him in involuntary rehab. Though at this point, I think that’s our last hope. I just can’t afford to pay for it myself. Do they let you make payment plans?

2905,stevesmithisalegend,1546435086,1,"

I am very confused and flustered with my sexuality at the moment. My whole life I have been very turned on by women and identified as a straight male until recently. I used to be so horny thinking about having sex with girls every hour of every day. One day  I became good Friends with a boy from school. He is very good looking, gets all the girls, popular, has a nice family is in the state team for basketball, but compared to me who is average looking, fairly popular and average at sports. We both got along well with each other until I started to get a man crush on him. Not in the sexual way but I would always try to imagine how good his life is, what it would be like to be good looking and get any girl you want. At this stage I still believed I was 100 percent straight. After fantasying and sort of being obsessed with this boys life it eventually made me see him in a sexual way. At first I imagined holding his hands, than hugging him, snd now to giving him a blowjob. This is when I understood that I was probably bisexual. In the past I have Sometimes get slightly interested in some boys but they have to have tanned skin, be small and feminine, but never to the extent of this boy. This has happened like 3 times but never fantasised about it (He Has those features).

When masturbating I can still get off to women but it’s not the same as it used to be. I would never watch gay porn it’s disgusting and gross and would turn me off. Instead I would wank to his Instagram and imagine hugging and kissing him and giving him a blowjob and shit like that. (He’s the only guy that’s ever made me feel this way and I know a lot of good looking guys that I do not find attractive. When doing this I feel like I’m sinning and never orgasm to his face I will switch it to a hot girl to make myself feel better.

My theory is I’m 90 percent straight and 10 percent gay but me fantasying about this boy caused me to fall in love with him causing all women to seem less attractive.
If in fact you believe I am “turning gay” and you say “what’s wrong with being gay” well where I live they are not accepted and tolerated where I live and to be completely honest being gay would destroy my life. Secondly I am trapped as no males are attractive to me except this 1 boy and women are no where near as attractive as they used to be. As if I don’t have many friends that are girls or talk to girls maybe my absence from them cause me to “forget” about them.

Maybe I am just overthinking and don’t allow my brain to fantasise about girls because I don’t have the self belief and worth to believe I can ever pleasure a woman, can’t see myself doing it so I disregard it for lost hope. At a party recently hugging girls made be slightly turned on but not enough to seek out their attention to try and talk to them. To compare this to before my “libido” hugging an attractive girl would give me a boner. Maybe I am just growing up?

To some this all up this one boy is my only passage to being turned on, all girls seem 5x less attractive as they used to but wanking to them doesn’t have the same “feel” if you know what I mean. This is affecting my life so much right now as I get less urges to go talk to girls at party and get a hook up etc or hit up girls on Snapchat.

Please help me out... has anyone had a similar thing happen to them. Can your sexuality change? Could smoking weed around casually once a month be affecting my mental state( I’m 2 month dry now though)? I am not a feminine person and would say I am quite manly.

I suffer from a couple of illnesses and it has been very difficult for me not only to get the help I needed, but also to feel validation for what I was going thru. Part of it was that I didn't know how to express myself, bevsue I didn't understand what was happening, and answers were hard to come by.

Now I'm in a better place and would like to compile important questions, get answers and record a video about everything.

I push people away constantly. I’ll always make plans with the one or two friends that I have left, and then bail in the last minute because I can’t bring myself to do anything. I’m numb.

2911,lexikruser,1546430480,1,"Hi all, I’m a 20 y/o woman with long-time major depressive disorder, anxiety, and recently (as of March ‘18)  epilepsy. I have been having trouble putting into words what goes on in my brain, the last year or so I have not been myself and it gets worse daily. I finally got out of a very toxic relationship a year ago and believe I might have a bit of PTSD as I regularly have nightmares, flashbacks and memories linger in mind almost all day and I have trouble trusting and believing almost anyone. I have been making lots of rash decisions at the spur of the moment that I wouldn’t normally make, some of which could really change/effect my life. I butcher about 50 % if the words and sentences that come out of my mouth, stuttering, missing words, mashing words, or using the wrong words. My doctor had also told me I had a cognitive disability or ‘short term memory loss’ around the time of the depression diagnosis as well. That I have felt has gotten worse with my age. More and more often I forget what I am talking about literally mid sentence-and have to regain my train of thought to finish what I was saying/typing. I’ve had ADD for as long as I’ve had depression and anxiety, so the attention issues I’ve had I chalked up to that. Otherwise I can be looking you dead in the face while you’re talking to me and miss every word you just said. I was dubbed ‘random thought girl’ around this time because random topics of discussion often popped in my mind( they almost always have nothing to do with the current topic of discussion). I’ve never had a filter, I try not to say dumb stuff but words just kind of come out of my mouth.  My mind feels like it’s on overload 24/7 and I either sleep for 15 hours or I don’t sleep at all. I have been suicidal most of my life, and I fight myself just to brush my teeth or take a shower. When people don’t respond to me the way I want it’s almost like my world is ending? You could just say ‘ok.’ And I’ll get upset wondering why you hate me. When people aren’t talking to me or being friendly to me I blame myself for all of the problems in the world, wether it makes sense or not. I feel like I lack self control, and don’t know how to gain it? No matter what I try. I normally have the most patience in the world but now I cry or scream when I’m upset over spilled milk. The bad moods have become a daily thing for me as well believing almost everyone is out to hurt me. I’ve never been good at decision making, I just don’t know what I like or want to do. I’ll like something but than if you ask me again an hour later I’ll tell you I don’t like it and why I don’t like it. My feelings fluctuate between good and bad very often, very, very, very, very, very often. I believe that’s also why I can never decide on anything in life. I’m tired of feeling like this, does anyone know what is going on in my brain ?

2913,carebear7853,1546426604,1,"This ended up being more of a jumble than I thought, so TL;DR: girlfriend is struggling mentally, but supporting her is wearing away my mental health. How do I talk about it without making her feel bad? 

I've tried asking Google, but I haven't been able to work out how to word it so that I get relevant results. It just keeps referring me to pages about how to talk to someone who is depressed. Helpful-ish, but it's aimed at someone who is healthy themselves.

I adore my partner and want nothing more than to help her, but thanks to a few unpleasant experiences in recent years (before we met) my mental health was only just starting to get better when we met.

She's spent the last 6 months looking for work and trying to get into a proper career rather than just taking any old job that comes along. It's a great idea and I want her to get that opportunity, but it's also causing her depression to deepen and her anxiety more acute as she struggles to work her life out.

It was fine at first. But we haven't been together long so it's been an intense start to the relationship. And now being the breadwinner is getting to be too much for me when added to trying to help her improve her life. I'm going back under water. My own depression and anxiety are getting difficult to manage and I've realised recently that I probably have an eating disorder.

So I'm at a point where I know we need to talk and I'm working on what I need to say about how I've been struggling and how we can find ways to change so that we both can heal. I've read a good bit about how to have difficult conversations, but how do I approach it so that I don't make her feel worse  and spiral further into depression? I don't want it to become a vicious cycle where each person depression fuels the other's.

I also need to approach it sensitively as I know she'll feel like she's backed in a corner. She has very little support. Doesn't really have family that she could live with or anything (I would never ever make her leave, even if this were to go badly. We'd just live as room mates or something. I just mention it because it will factor into the conversation)

2925,adnawahs,1546414518,1,"How would y’all feel about a letter/pen pal subscription? 

Basically you write letters of encouragement, positivity, venting to others and they write back but it would be in a subscription box and come with other knick knacks like essentials oil calming spray or something (things that ease your stress/mental pain). It would be weekly and you would have a nickname. It would start off random but eventually people can request to send letters to you and you can deny or accept. It’s a way to meet people, connect, vent and spread love in a traditional way. 

Essentially I find it best when relating to people and it’s something about receiving a letter with someone’s thoughts on paper. Obviously a problem would be the longevity of it but it’s an idea.

Van wants to take medication if it will work, but his anxiety disorder makes him terrified of side effects, particularly permanent dependence on medication or permanent negative side effects. He medicates with weed and nicotine just to get himself through the day, and recognizes that he has the personality type that takes the dosage to an addictive level (i.e. constantly increasing, always dabs rather than herb). Every time he decides he wants to try medication, his family talks him out of it and makes him increasingly afraid of the side effects. Meanwhile, I've noticed he isn't taking care of himself at some pretty basic levels and I'm worried that he's just suffering more and more. I feel awful that sometimes aspects of his life outside of his control are contributing to his depression as well.

I don't want to get involved with the family, so this post is for Van so he can read everyone's responses and make his own decision and feel more empowered to do what he thinks is best. What medications or treatments (doesn't have to be traditional medication) have truly helped you with severe depression?

2928,Whatamidoinghere55,1546410885,1,"Hi, posting from a throwaway account because I know people on here.

I'm wondering if this is serious or not.
I grew up with a very Nmother and a not such a parent father. My mother didn't let my father be a parent so he mostly was an observer. My mother loved to be pampered and tended to. She raised me to jump at the snap of her finger. Any request she had, I would have to drop what I am doing to help her and if I don't I am berated for being a disobedient child that was disrespectful. Sometimes this would lead to strange punishments like hair pulling, getting hit in the mouth or whoopings. If I embrassed her she would get physical.
Anyway, she would call my name non-stop and I would run and answer her. Sometimes, I would hear her and come to her call. She would look at me when I appeared waiting for her request.
""I didn't call you.""
She'll then say it's God because she's religious.
It happened a lot.
Years later I still here her voice. I ignore it thinking it's not really her. 
My parents break up and she moves out. The calling of my name turns into her screaming my name or her screaming in the loudest voice for help.
It happens when randomly when I'm just chilling and it takes some focused task to get it to stop. The screaming sometimes happens when I try to go to sleep or when I'm waking up (something I found out is Exploding Head Syndrome).

Recently, sometimes I see something in the corner of my eye and when I look nothing is there.

I'm a little confused.
My mom calling my name has calmed down, but her voice just turns into a random woman's voice.
With me trying to sleep it turned to my mom's voice again.

I still visit my mother every so often. If that matters.

Any thoughts and ideas are welcomed.",mentalhealth,Not normal but...,2019-01-02 17:34:45
2929,bless9,1546409734,1,"I am 10000000% sure that my sister has either Borderline Personality Disorder or Bi-polar disorder and I’m not sure how to help. She’s been on at least five 72 hour holds, she’s seen about 3 therapist and no one will diagnose her with anything. I know that when she goes to sessions that she’s lying to them (pretty sure she genuinely believes her lies too). But no one ever ends up diagnosing her with anything. She has called the cops on my mom and claimed that we were all abused (we never were), and my mom even lost custody of us for a while and went through a year long trail to get us back. Fell into a deep depression and relapsed. When we got a little older, my sister started telling her friends that me and my mom abused her and she even went as far as to give herself a black eye. I told it might have been her boyfriend when I saw her eye but told me that she fell down the stairs. The next day at school she told everyone that I gave it to her. 
She lied about her first boyfriend raping and abusing her. I didn’t want to accuse her of lying because that could be traumatic for someone who survived rape, but her stories never ever added up and I became suspicious. I still stood by her. One day she never came home from school and we filed a missing persons report. Literally the entire city was looking for her and she was just staying at a friends house the whole time. She started sending text to us that didn’t make any sense and then turning her phone right back off. Whole time we were worried sick and then she just showed up 3 days later and acted like nothing happened. Later on, she got another boyfriend and I started to catch onto a pattern. Whenever she got dumped, she would accuse them of abuse and/or rape. She told me so many stories about this boy and me and my boyfriend planned on meeting up with him to fight him. The boy was terrified and sent us screenshots of messages from my sister threatening to frame him and to kill herself if he didn’t call/text her back. Videos and pictures of her cutting herself included. This is when I started to catch on and became terrified. She eventually started stalking this boy. One night she told him she was going to kill herself and left the house. He called us and her friends and we all went out looking for her and the police got involved. She came home and had no idea that he told us what she said so she was again acting like everything was normal. I called one of the detectives and told them she came home and they came to pick her up. She started cussing me out as they took her away. When she got to the hospital to get checked for drugs in her system, she called me. She had my number memorized. I spoke to her almost everyday while she was on a 72 hour hold. A couple days later her ex boyfriends mom calls me and tells me that she won’t stop calling him and she was telling him that he was the only person who’s number she had. They asked me to please contact her since they thought she couldn’t reach me. Another time she physically attacked my dad after he said something rude to her. He held her down but never hit her. Me and my mom witnessed it. She went to the bathroom a few minutes later and gave herself a bloody nose somehow. She called the police and told them my dad pinned her down and beat her. My mom went into a coma after an accident and my sister never went to see her during the 3 months that she was in the hospital. I didn’t have an issue with it because I figured my sister just couldn’t handle it. However, now she claims that she was there every week. And she genuinely believes that she was there...

Tonight I reached my limit and we got into a physical fight before she drove off with her new boyfriend. As she drove off, she was yelling at my grandma that she was a bitter old bitch. We were all confused because my grandma was never involved. I feel bad because I truly think she needs help and I didn’t want to hurt her. 
I have begged cops and her therapist to please get her real help every time this happens and somehow it never happens. What can I do? Some kind of intervention? I am so lost and so afraid that she is going to really hurt someone else or herself one day. 
I don’t want to enable her but I also don’t want her to feel like she isn’t supported. Please help

I’m diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I did something terrible in med school. I’m not denying it. It’s my fault. I see the school guidance counselor from time to time, and for a time I consulted with a psychiatrist (the one who diagnosed me) but she eventually had to drop my case and refer me elsewhere cause I was her student and that would be a conflict of interest. 

The guidance counselor was pretty cool until there was time I mentioned some troubled thoughts. Just some suicidal thoughts that bothered me for a while but I quickly got over them. 

She went ballistic and called my parents (who didn’t accept, understand, or support me in my mental health struggles) and asked them to pick me up from school. 

Imagine that, a 21-year-old with a college degree, needing to be picked up from school by his parents by order of a school guidance counselor. Absolutely embarrassing. 

When I confronted her about it, she was all self-righteous, playing the moral high ground and crap, saying that it was because she was concerned for me, it was either that or my parents would find me in the emergency room of a hospital from a suicide attempt. She even went ahead and said that she’d do it again if she had to. 

When I saw the psychiatrist again, she said that the counselor overreacted and apologized on her behalf. (I wish the counselor had apologized too) Supposedly, the psychiatrist talked to the guidance counselor about it. 

Now, the counselor is contacting me asking for a follow-up. She’s done so only twice within the past few months, and I’ve ignored her both times. But now I really want to be able to tell her I don’t want to see her and that I’ll look for professional help elsewhere. Any advice? ",mentalhealth,I don’t want to see the school guidance counselor.

I feel like I'm the world's most boring and socially inept person. I'm barely able to have a proper casual conversation with anyone, even friends I've known  for a long time, because I have no idea what to talk about. I really want to be social and around other people, and my social skills seem alright enough when I'm with people I'm comfortable with, but go totally absent around anyone else.

I always feel like nobody actually likes me, and worry too much about what people think of me and how I'm perceived, to the point of often feeling anxious in social situations and keeping to myself in fear of doing something wrong.

I'm such a burden to my friends and everyone else around me due to being quite emotionally unstable and social situations often causing me a combination of anxiety and gender dysphoria. I'm honestly surprised anyone of them even bother to invite me to things anymore, and often when they do I feel like I should rather stay home to avoid being a problem for them.

I have no interests anymore, I simply don't have the motivation for anything, and all my free time consists of endlessly browsing Reddit and being on Discord trans groups. Can't even get myself to play video games or anything like that anymore.

For the longest time my attendence has been completely awful, I often have no motivation to get up in the morning and everyday things feel rather meaningless in general.

Transitioning has been a very mixed experience for me - I know I've made the right decision, but every step of the way has made my gender dysphoria worse, and for the past 7 months I've been on HRT with awful hormone levels and that too has very negatively affected my mental health and left me with even less energy and motivation than usual. And living as a non-passing trans woman certainly doesn't help.

Before starting HRT I felt totally emotionless and disconnected from my emotions like they were someone else's, or as if I was faking them. HRT has helped with this, but also often made me quite emotionally unstable, I now cry much more and gender dysphoria has much more of an impact on me emotionally, yet at the same time this feeling that my emotions are fake is still often there.

This is my first reddit post. I feel that I have reached a point in life where my mental health has gotten out of control. I am constantly anxious, ridden with guilt, and worried.  

A little back story before I begin. I am currently in my last year of college. During my sophomore year of college I had a very bad experience. One night during the fall semester, I smoked a bowl of marijuana with a few fellow students.  I didn’t know these people very well.  However, in an attempt to fit in I joined them in smoking. At first I felt fine and the evening was going good. Then out of no where the drug kicked in and made me feel horrible. My heart was racing and I felt like I was going to die. The whole experience was like nothing I had expletives before. The next day I felt a little off, but overall fine. Cut to a month later is when things get bad. One night while laying in bed I began to think about my bad drug experience. These memories sent me into a full fledged panic attack. I had never really experienced a panic attack before so I thought I was going crazy. 

Ever since this panic attack I have obsessed about the thought of going crazy. In 2018 I googled hundreds possibly thousands of times about things such as psychosis, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and a plethora of other illnesses. I stay in a constant loop of worrying about having a serious mental disorder.  I worry that I am loosing touch with reality. Also, for the whole duration of 2018, I have experienced depersonalization and derealization. This past year has been mentally taxing and draining. I constantly am asking family members if I seem “normal” and coherent. 

I have always had obsessive traits like repetitive thoughts, scrupolicity, and guilt. I am wondering if I am simply obsessing that something is wrong with me or if something is actually wrong? ",mentalhealth,I am not sure what is wrong with me...HELP,2019-01-02 14:42:50

2946,MellinaCh,1546398326,1,"Well, I really didn't know where else to go... 
I'm not sure how to efficiently explain my situation but I'll try.

I want to tell you, there might be holes in my story because honestly I don't have the courage to write it all down now.

Basically what's going on is that nobody cares about my mental state (ironically they seem to fight to worsen it). I've been going through a mental breakdown, crying nonstop and contemplating suicide for hours now (it's 5 AM where I'm from) and I'm treated like the bad guy in this story. To give you context, we're on a family trip for 4 days and we all sleep in one room with four beds side to side. I don't like it here, the lack of personal space and having to see these people I despise all day long has taken its toll on me.
About three hours ago I was sitting on my bed, silently crying about not wanting to be here and not being able to sleep for the second day in a row due to hearing their snoring (yes it's ridiculous but you can't imagine how crazy it drives me not being able to do anything) when I saw mother get up and murmur stuff to me. I didn't hear it all but I caught the last phrase ""I know what you're doing, you're not going to ruin my holiday every time"". I asked ""what?"" but she ignored me so I got up and went to the bathroom and sat on the floor.

An hour passes, I'm still there crying my eyes out, thinking why I have to go through this shit every time and why do I deserve such treatment. She comes in, steps over me to get to the sink, does her business and then promptly throws me out to pee. After she's done she tells me to get the hell to bed and I say ""can't you see I'm not ok?""

                            ""I don't care"" 

I  went back in the bathroom to wipe my nose. Two minutes later her husband came in to throw me out once again.  They told me to get to bed but I said I couldn't anymore. Then there was a little 'fight' which I can't remember exactly but I can tell you the highlights:

Honestly, I'm so disgusted by these people. How can you treat your child like that? Why does she have to make everything about herself, and why make me feel guilty? Why beat me when I'm down? These people are sick.

But alas, I'm a coward. I never do shit. I just sit there and cry, too afraid to shout, too afraid to run away.

I'm 25 and I've always bottled up my feelings and only shown a happy side. It's always been okay since I typically ignore/cut out things that stress me out--I never get to the point of exploding. 

Now, though, I'm dealing with family issues which are causing me stress that I can't ignore. I don't recall the last time I had an emotional outburst (maybe when I was like 13), but I feel like this stress is overwhelming me to the point where I might just lose it. 

I don't think it'd be healthy to bottle my frustration further, but I'm also unsure of how to let it all out...I've found that I pretty much can't even cry at this point, even if I want to.

2953,Redrogue2291,1546395305,1,"When I was 19 (yr 2010-2011) it was suggested by a therapist that I was depressed. I was a student, and obsessed with my failing grade in a course. The APN working out of the school health clinic put me on Celexa which I took intermittently for 5 years. I had to stop taking the medication at times due to lack of insurance and funding. 
In 2015 I began having frequent ""episodes"" that after several ER visits and finally a consult with a psychiatrist was determined as panic attacks. I began seeing a psychiatrist regularly when the panic was daily and I was paranoid of my surroundings. I have always been wary of relationships, but I was becoming increasingly avoidant and depressed. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and [possibly] mild ADHD. I have seen 3 psychiatrists now who all agree on PTSD being primary, though I am unsure of the dx sometimes. 
There came a time in 2015 in which I attempted suicide following a panic episode. Medications were changed to high doses of Effexor and Wellbutrin to take daily. I hate taking medication. I hate paying for it and all the maintenance, and I hate feeling dependent on it. Every time I try to wean off the medication, after about 3-4 months without them I am a severely depressed and emotional wreck. I have been told by my current doctor that I may never not need the medication. 
So what is the problem? I guess my battle with it is despite its effects on my mood, while on medication I have brain fog and I can't concentrate or remember things well. I feel like I can't think. This is a problem for me personally because I have always invested the most in my education and work. Some may say that it is unhealthy for me to not invest more in relationships with others, but I love learning and advancing my education makes me feel good. 

I sometimes wonder if it is worth sacrificing my mood just to have my mind back.

2954,mahtabalam93,1546394942,1," In psychology, focus or meditation is a key skill that we need in our daily lives. We use focused attention and mental meditation to attend to both internal stimuli and external stimuli. Focused attention is a kind of meditation which makes it possible to quickly detect relevant stimuli and allows us to do tasks carefully and efficiently in our daily life.

There are different types of attention related to sensation and cognition such as sustained attention, selective attention, alternating attention, and divided attention. Deficiency in focused attention will make other daily activities more difficult and less efficient and cause many challenges associated with attention disorders. In this article, we will discuss how can we asses, rehabilitate and improve focused attention and we will learn the best ways to cope with attention issues?

I had a very weird and constantly traumatic upbringing

my symptoms that really disturb my happiness are the following

1. sexual deviancy- I am always aroused. I had an omegle addictions for years, porn addiction for years and i had really messed up voyeuristic urges that are very heavy on me. 
2. I am really quick to anger, crying, and elation. like a drop of a hat quick.
3. I dissociate intensely and often 
4. I have intense intrusive thoughts, especially about things regarding the past fuck ups. I ruined my previous relationships with my omegle addictions and it haunts me.
5. I get very upset if something doesn't go the way I envisioned it in my head, say I plan a trip to hike and I imagine sitting in my hammock and drinking coffee. If that weren't to happen It would ruin the entire experience for me, regardless if it was otherwise an amazing trip. 
6. I am in a constant state of anxiety, always at a quieter 2 but a roaring 10 when i'm alone with myself, especially at night. 

I've thought about OCD, but I'm not a list-y person, I'm not very adamant about cleanliness and I'm definitely not a perfectionist. I'm spontaneous and I spend money without any real care. I would say i'm very much an idealize-r though.

2962,tlit18,1546390939,1,"
About a month ago I saw a therapist just to vent she said that I suffer from some depression and ocdp and recommended that I talk to my dr about Prozac and abilify. I went and he prescribed Prozac but not abilify. I took it for 3 days 20mg and felt AMAZING. High sex drive and tons of energy. Third day came and I had some depersonalization (which I’ve had for 6 years but it was extremely controllable) but a MAJOR panic attack set in. The depersonalization was more intense than prior and I couldn’t shake it, i stopped taking the pills (dr request) and my mood was changing every 10 minutes.

A week and half goes by the depersonalization would last throughout the day but go away typically at night. I went to my psychiatrist who gave me Latuda 20mg (a few years ago i had depersonalization typically when I was at work, I looked at a computer all day and was a teller). Anyway in the past the Latuda literally worked over night and the depersonalization went away (could of been placebo effect) i Assume. So I took the Latuda for a few days and it just seemed to make the depersonalization last all day with no relief, I went back to the psychiatrist and he told me to stop taking it..... I have found some relief with Xanax but I’ve only taken it a few times because I don’t want to become addicted.

Anyways I guess the point of this post is to see if anyone else has had similar experiences. For the past year I had depersonalization but it was so weak or I had it under control that it didn’t bother me or I didn’t think about it. Last summer I remember it came on and I just said f it and hit the gym for a day or 2 and it vanished. I guess what’s getting me this time is I have SEVERE depression and horrible anxiety which I’ve never had before (this could all be mental because I’m obsessing over it). I keep telling myself it’ll never go away even though it always has or I keep telling myself that those pills permanently messed you up even though both drs and my new therapist explained to me that’s not exactly what happens and that’s more for long term use.

I haven’t been eating, I have been able to leave the house here and there. I’ve gone to a few movies and the casino which SOMETIMES makes the depersonalization go completely away, but not always it’s hit and miss.

At this point I’m just looking for advice guys. I also 27 days no porn i literally have no sexual drive. I’ve been basically laying in bed because the depersonalization feels the weakest when laying down. I went to the gym for 2 days but the depersonalization was just so intense. I’m convinced pills won’t help but I did start cognitive therapy which everyone keeps telling me will work with time. I’m just tired, anxious and scared.

So i used Xanax for a few days and typically after a hour or two of taking the depersonalization would relieve but come back the next day. My psychiatrist thinks that klonopin is a safer option since it’s longer lasting. Any thoughts? I don’t want to be addicted but I need serious help, the anxiety and panic attacks from not feeling normal are so intense and I know depersonalization is caused by anxiety so calming myself should help?",mentalhealth,Klonopin for depersonalization?

I run a discord server. The name of which I won't mention. And I met a girl on there she's around 14. She was really fun to talk to and we started to talk a lot. I've been trying to ""help"" out a lot. A lot of people on my server have mental health issues and I take this very serious. Eventough my server isn't that serious. I tried to help whenever I could. Recommendations, advice etc. To the point I started doing this every day. 

And I know people will say that's not what you should do but I can't help myself. I want to help them. And sometimes it worked to my own surprise and I've gotten fairly good at it. 

This girl like many others also has mental health problems and I tried my very best to help her. Especially since she also was my friend. Then I discovered she had feelings for me. I told her I am not interested and that she's too young in my opinion. But I kept talking to her a lot because she was still my friend. But she wanted me so bad. She got obsessed. Drawing me, taking screenshots when in a video call and talking about me to her friends all the time. 

Recently I found out she cuts herself because she can't have me. I already knew she cut herself but I didn't know this was one of the reasons. 
She says it hurts so much and that she wants to die. I rejected her several months ago. 
Now to be clear she isn't trying to push me or force me. She tried to hide it from me but I eventually found out anyway.

They believe that I’m their little perfect princess that can’t be ill, that can’t be depressed, they believe that it’s nonsense and I am CHOOSING to be like that.

I don’t know what to do. I feel trapped. I can’t tell them how I feel or they’ll force me to change schools and completely stop talking to my boyfriend (for real this time). I can’t tell them that I got diagnosed with depression because they will not believe me.

This group's goal would be to solve this, giving a friendly, warm environment where people can talk about their problems with POIS and find solutions to them.

2976,Casthecat6,1546382833,1,"I genuinely have no idea, I went to see a professional near enough 6 years ago, freaked out at what they wanted to talk about so didn't go back after two appointments which in hindsight was a really dumb move. 

I feel like I'm two different people. On one hand I'm caring, empathetic, advocate for rights, have hope and aspirations but also filled with anxiety and guilt over things that aren't my fault so bad that it genuinely affects my daily life. 

and then I have these weird cycles when I get overly stressed or anxious I'll feel my mood drop and I'll be depressed for a few hours which will slowly turn into complete anger and that's when I just switch I become bitter, distrusting, impulsive and hateful of everything. After the anger cools down a little I feel completely apathetic, I don't care about anything or anyone. 

It's completely exhausting, when I'm in this angry 'mode' genuinely do not care who I'm offending, I'll be passive aggressive and at the time it doesn't bother me that I'm like that but then when I snap back I feel guilty which inevitably repeats the overwhelming stress and repeats my stupid cycle. I hate myself but I also don't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on going back to the professional , I'm waiting on an appointment, I want to change (except when I'm feeling the weird way I get in a way where I genuinely think that my opinions and perspectives are more realistic than anyone elses) because I don't like how I am or my actions or anything, I want to be better for the people around me but I wanted to reach out to see if anyone out there experiences this too because I feel completely alone in this.",mentalhealth,I don't know what's wrong with me,2019-01-02 09:47:13
2977,WonderfulWishes,1546382824,1,"Hello everyone, I've never been on this subreddit before, but I am intrigued about myself and my mental health. The reason I have decided to post on here is because I'm not sure if I was experiencing psychosis. I wanted to ask your opinion on it.

So I was diagnosed with OCD from the age of 8 years old, but I always show OCD tendencies from younger than 8 years old.

I have always been into cartoons - Japanese ones, American ones, French ones, etc. This is embarrassing to say, but I find some cartoon characters attractive. Like, even ore attractive than some real people.

So when I was on only 20mg of Prozac (an anti-depressant) I started getting these really strange thoughts about the cartoon characters. I was convinced that they didn't like my mum for some reason. Basically I thought the cartoon characters (mainly the attractive ones) had real emotions and had a dislike for my mother and sometimes me - I thought they were better than anyone. Now these thoughts did scare me, but I honestly thought that these cartoon characters had real emotions. It was scary.

Without medication, I'm like this. Even a small dosage of medication doesn't work for me.

Thankfully now I'm on 60mg of Prozac and 5mg of Aripiprazole and I do feel better. These thoughts only sometimes come into my head, but they don't feel that real, but sometimes they do.

So do you think it was just severe OCD or psychosis?",mentalhealth,Severe OCD or psychosis?,2019-01-02 09:47:04
2978,Olamina2020,1546382762,1,"I could really use some advice or thoughts. My sister (29) lives in Nevada, which is pretty much across the country from me. She struggles pretty severely with paranoia, very strange emotional outbursts, and delusions. She’s been hospitalized before about 8 years ago, and she did so well then. But as soon as she left she didn’t follow any of the suggested treatments and she went right back. 

Her and I are somewhat close. She calls me every day. I was able to convince her to go back to therapy and for the two months she was in therapy she had a lot fewer panic attacks or emotional outbursts. But then they switched therapists on her and despite my best efforts to prepare her to work with the new therapist she was assigned, she freaked out and stopped going after her third session with the new therapist.  

She has a major freak out just now, screaming about her roommate stealing things.  I can’t keep doing this with her, but she has no one else. She’s been cut off from my family since she was 16 and my family has a lot of other things going on they need to deal with. So there won’t be any support there. She cut off all her friends long ago. I’m it. And I’m at the end of my rope. 

Ideally I would like to move her to my state and work with her more directly to commit to therapy. But there are two things stopping me. One, she takes a lot- the second I give her money or don’t set boundaries things get even worse. Second, She won’t move here, partly because she knows I’ll keep working to get her I to therapy and also because she likes the excitement of Vegas. 

I’ve thought about flying down there, but I’m just not sure what to do when I get there. 

I’m stuck in this constant cycle of she does well for a bit, then has a major crises, and I’m the only person who can sit here and watch while she goes through this crises which usually ends up with her moving which is a huge financial recommitment from me. The one time I refused to financially support her moving she ended up homeless so now I pay the landlord directly wherever she’s moving to. 

She is on Medicare, and is able to get welfare so she can at least get some food. So I know she’s good there. She hops from job to job and easily gets new ones (she either gets fired or paranoid someone at the job is out to get her so she leaves). She generally pays her own rent. I help when she’s short or usually to put a down payment on a place. 

Ultimately this cycle of freak out, crises, rash decisions once every month or so ... it just isn’t sustainable. I just don’t know what to do next. ",mentalhealth,I’m not sure how to help my sister,2019-01-02 09:46:02

&gt;Our outpatient mental health team consists of psychiatrists, social workers and nurses. The team is trained to support you and your family in recovery from mental illness.
Most patients who are referred to our services will be **offered an initial assessment** by one of our clinicians.

1. **Am I getting my hopes up too much in assuming I will be given a diagnosis?** I have been looking for a diagnosis for years and fixate on this issue. 

2. **How long will it be?** I have had one previously, but it was at a mental health hospital specifically. It was supposed to be an hour and lasted 3 hours. 

3. **Is it ok to bring a journal with symptoms and experiences?** I sometimes forget to mention things due to anxiety and want to be sure I am as descriptive as possible.

Elementary schoolers sit in one classroom all day and usually have to sit at a lunch table with their class as well. In the US that’s usually 20 kids, and in most cases kids will have one or two best friends, 6 close ones and then other acquaintances they play with once or twice. Statistically 7% of people have chronic depression (though 20% have a non chronic/situational case), 5% have attempted suicide, and 4% have a mental illness classed as severe such as a PD or delusional disorder. Around 10% engage in serious self harm such as cutting/burning but 30% have subclinical behaviors like picking scabs and biting skin around their nails. Again chronic cases are around 6%. So that’s 1 or 2 kids. They feel isolated and often have to deal with ignorance and often teasing.

Middle schoolers move classes and can choose lunch tables to sit at. They can make friends with their entire grade (300 kids in the US). 5% is 15 instead of 1 and 10% is 30.

Essentially I've begun to get anxious in normal situations (talking to co-workers) and have experienced a strong diminishment in enjoyment of normal activities (my job, sports, etc). 

I believe that multiple life events in a short timeframe have created this situation (marriage, new home, new job - within a 12 month period).

What I mean by ""high-functioning"" are just people that are actually working full-time jobs, have a supportive family, have friends and interests outside of work, are eating correctly, are working out and taking care of their bodies, are not abusing drugs, etc. As the research I have done suggests that SSRIs work significantly better for those in a high-functioning state (but experiencing a depressed/anxious disorder).

- I feel like I'm in danger when I see it.

- I get this pit in my stomach, and my throat tightens up.

- i have noticed I start to develop a cold sweat when i see it, being worn on a person. Like if someone is wearing a lime green shirt I get very nervous

It's always bothered me, since i noticed when i was younger that it didn't really bother me that my grandmother died. I just sort of waited for my mom to finish telling me so i could un-pause my movie.   


It feels sort of gross to speak it aloud. It's not that I'm malevolent- I just feel blank. I also feel that most interactions that I have feel rehearsed, and like i am putting on an act.

As of two years ago I have been feeling like I'm losing my capacity to integrate information into my long-term memory.  Often my days feel like a fog that blend together.  I am continuing to do well in my university studies but feel as if I have nothing important to contribute to class discussions, as I often cannot recall the name of an author, study, concept to even attempt contribution.  As well, social interactions and social anxiety have dominated a lot of my mind which does not help (i.e., thinking others don't like me, not having close friends yet, awkward in social conversations and feeling as if it is obvious).  Other background information that can help provide an answer: I am 26, F, recently moved to an entirely new province (Canadian ehhh!), began smoking marijuana daily (once or twice a day usually) via a small one-hitter as of a year ago to help with my depression and to relax after a long day.  I was concerned it was the marijuana use but I feel that the amount I take is quite low and should not have such a large impact, but I could be wrong.

3017,travelbuggies,1546353465,1,"In many ways I had a great year. I celebrated my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend back in March. I went on my first ever REAL holiday (a week in Alicante). I made new friends. I settled into my first job. Went to Brighton pride to see BRITNEY BITCH. I started to learn to drive. Found out I am going to be an aunty! I was lucky enough to spend my birthday in AMSTERDAM with my amazing boyfriend. 

I know who ever is reading this is like wtf your  year sounds great, don't be so ungrateful. 

I'm not belittling all the good things that 2018 gave to me, I am so unbelievably grateful for them all. But all in all in 2018 I've never felt as ALONE in all my life. Yes, I'm surrounded by some amazing people like my mum, who has honestly been my rock in a number of subliminal ways even with out herself knowing. I've an amazing boyfriend who would go to the ends of the earth for me and I don't appreciate him enough. 

If I had to explain 2018 I say its that feeling when you're trying to speak to someone and everything just cancels out the sound of your voice. Everyone is speaking over you but no one was really listening in the first place anyways so what does that matter. 2018 felt like I was suffocating, right in front of people and they walked on. I felt alone. I felt alone when I was surrounded by people who I thought where my friends. People who were my friends for years. But as soon as someone more interesting pops up I am nothing to them, I'm just someone to talk about but not to. 2018 taught me to not rule anything out. My best friend thought it was funny and a joke to spread rumours about me that I was cheating on my boyfriend and when confronted just said **no one knows who you are anyways not like anyone cares**. I know it sounds stupid just a petty fight but those words stuck with me, I know I should let go and that she doesn't matter. 

September 2018, was when I was suppose to begin uni, however my grades didn't POP and I am back at college repeating. I find it hard to stay motivated and even harder to stay concentrated. Majority of my ""friends"" are away to uni and spread out all over the Uk so that makes it harder to maintain healthy steady friendships. **I miss my friends**. Even the shitty ones. Ive found it hard to make new friends, FACT. I feel like I'm on the outside and just looking in on everyone else. Kinda get the feeling that they just hang around with me out of pity and that they just don't like me. 

My nana has always been a constant in my life. I used to stay over at her house with my older sister and go there after school some days. I hate myself for ever complaining about going to her house because there wasn't wifi.Although any time I did spend there I loved it. My nana is so kind to everyone. She has a pure soul. It breaks my heart that 2018 was the year that my nana would not recognise who I am anymore. My nana is still herself in a number of ways but she doesn't remember her family anymore and it hurts so bad. I went to her house after work by myself one day and she said she thinks she might recognise my face from walking in the street but had no idea who I am. It broke my heart.

I rarely get invited out. ( I know I've turned this into a pity feast of me feeling sorry for myself but this is what goes on in my head but just in text) It's a common thing for many young people. You're sitting at home just chilling on you're phone seeing that all you're friends are out but you're invite is lost in the mail. BUT WHY. You haven't fallen out with these people, you're all still on good terms, you'll have a laugh with each other if you see one another. So why don't they want to spend time with you. Am I just not a thought, maybe they've just forgotten about me or they are just sick of me...

After a while these little things start to build up. And as reluctant as I am to say it, it's had a tole on my mental health. I feel unwanted. To the point where I even question if my own boyfriend even likes me or if he's just being there for me as he can see that he is all I've got. 

I spent my New Years eve in my bed watching youtube and Netflix. I asked my friend if she had anything sorted for NYE a few days prior and she goes ""no! please give me plans"" so I give her two options. She doesn't reply. I've already bought my ticket. But that's okay because my other friends is going and its fine I can just hang out with her. But I felt like a burden so I sold my ticket 2 hours before I was suppose to leave. I said to myself its okay because no one will care if I don't go out, and they didn't they were just like ""okay sweet"". So as I am chilling in my house just with my family on NYE I see a snapchat story (from my friend who ignored my offer) and it kind of hurt me. Again like I wasn't even a thought, she just got a better offer and that was that. No sorry. No invitation for her new plans. But sure no one knows who I am anyways and its not like anyone cares. 

I am trying to make the best of my 2019, I've got a youtube channel that I know I get criticised for by people in my town but honestly I don't care because I love filming and editing the videos. I don't care if I don't get 100,000,000 views. It gives me something fun to do. I've applied to University to start in September 2019 and I am praying that I will get in( the universities are far away from my home so I am hoping I can start fresh!) 2019 I will make it my mission for you to be my year. I hope you bring me a lot of happiness because that is my biggest aspiration. Happy New Year and Thank you to anyone who took their time to read.

3018,sunnyCr,1546351958,1,"Hi, first time poster on this sub. New to Reddit, really. My account age shows that.  

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post. I'm looking for advice, and everyone's opinion. Please if you think you can help, share it. I am desperate at this point.  

   

TLDR; suffer from  memory loss, anxiety, emotional numbness and what i think is dissociation. please help  

  

A short backstory. I'm 19, male. Moved country at 8. Parents divorced at 9. first Step father died at 11 (I may have been 9-11) I saw him on the couch before my mum could protect me from seeing. First step mother was abusive, mentally. Manipulation, verbal abuse and the sorts. My second step father has been my main father figure. I didn't see or talk to my biological dad for years (roughly age 12 to 17). Always struggled with mental health: anxiety and stress mainly, but depression for a period of time and now dissociation, since about 13 years of age. I seem to always feel numb and struggle to show emotion.  

   

Now on to the main reason of my post.  

 I've been struggling with what I think is dissociation for a very long time and bad anxiety which still haunts me from time to time, but is not always crippling as the (possible) dissociation is.  

For as long as I can remember (hah) I have had a **terrible** memory. It's so bad sometimes, that I will forget something, and have no recollection of it until something happens that makes me realize it. I believe this is due to Dissociation of some kind.   

For example, not long ago I watched Mr Robot. I watched all 3 available seasons and thoroughly enjoyed it. I decided to re-watch it a few days ago and upon getting to S2E6, I cannot remember ever watching this episode, If you had asked me about any other part of the show, I could have told you most parts about it, main events, plot twists... you know, the stuff anyone would normally remember without really trying to commit it to their memory. Upon starting this episode though, It was like discovering an entirely new episode that had never been released. It was scary, as I don't see how I could have watched the rest of the show and remembered most of it, but omitted a whole 45 minute episode from memory.  

You may be thinking that I could have easily skipped over the episode without realizing and just made a simple mistake as anyone would. I thought that too... but since I was a kid, I have always been methodical and logical in my thoughts and actions, I take notice of episode numbers and follow the episode count from 1 to 10, and if I had skipped from episode 5 to 7, it would have bothered me greatly. I believe I would have noticed it, even subconsciously (as I have done before many times).  

This is not an isolated instance either. Things like this have been happening more and more often. I seem to go about life on autopilot, not realizing that I've completely forgotten to do something until much later... when I find there's a glitch in my line of thinking.... *hold on a second, I could have sworn I brought my cigarettes upstairs with me, as I* **always** *do*.  

I have once gone to the doctor, checked in, waited for my doctor, walked into their office and then completely forgot why I even made the appointment and drove there. It's like I'm living life on autopilot, physically and mentally present, but not really making *conscious* decisions.  

  

Even writing this post is hard, I keep zoning out and ""stepping into my mind"", almost lost in thought... but not really thinking about anything. I've forgotten most of what I was going to say.  

  

I once booked an appointment with a ""free counselor"" of sorts, something my government offers to young people (16-24 I believe) as a means to get advice or a recommendation to see a psychiatrist if more extensive evaluation and support is needed.  

Upon seeing him, i described my memory issue (and anxiety and stress) and after a short discussion he suggested we try breathing exercises. closing my eyes in a new environment with someone I only met a short 30 minutes ago is extremely anxiety inducing, and he was upset that I commented that I was uncomfortable with it. It was clear that I suffer from anxiety, and two separate questionnaires using the DepressionAnxietyStress system showed i scored on the extreme end for anxiety and stress. I don't understand why he was frustrated with me. I had to cancel all other appointments with him. I didn't feel safe.  

Anyway I'm rambling. What I took away from the hour session is that he said my memory issue was due to an ""attention"" problem. I just wasn't paying enough attention.... although I can look people in the eyes and intently listen (when I don't feel anxious)... I sometimes ""lose consciousness"" of sorts and well... dissociate. It leads to me forgetting entire parts of the conversation. I don't ever get asked to ""pay attention"" or ""look at me when I speak to you"", but i do seem to step away from reality sometimes.  

  

It is for that reason I'm writing here tonight. I believe I may be suffering from Dissociation. It could easily be caused by the traumatic events I experienced while I was younger, and it seems to explain the symptoms I've been experiencing.

3019,2017hayden,1546351425,1,"Hi, I’m a 20 year old male and after about 3 years of doctors visits I was finally diagnosed with rapid cycling cyclothymia about 2 years ago now. Ever since my diagnosis of cyclothymia I have attended regular CBT sessions and tried multiple different medications and multiple different doses of those medications. Finding the right medication, and the right balance of that medication has been a difficult process. As some of you may know cyclothymia is a bipolar related disorder, as in it’s essentially bipolar light with a few variations. You might think oh yeah it should be easy enough to just use bipolar meds to treat it then, right? Yeah no, unfortunately it’s not quite that easy. Because bipolar meds are made for people with far more intense mood shifts, which frankly I can’t imagine how people with bipolar disorder feel because trust me cyclothymia is hell. But anyways let’s get back on topic, the medication balancing. It’s been an issue, any dosage of medication that’s been high enough to eliminate my symptoms so far has left me feeling like a zombie, so what I’ve been stuck with is lower doses that don’t eliminate my symptoms but do seem to help some. Unfortunately it doesn’t help quite enough with some of my more distracting manic symptoms, which is where the increased sex drive comes in. There are days where literally any decently attractive woman I come into contact with immediately becomes the object of some sexual fantasy, and as a college student this is ridiculously difficult to work around. I have to go out and be around a lot of people, and I should be concentrating on other things but when I’m manic even with the meds it feels like it’s impossible to concentrate on anything other than sex. There are times when it gets bad enough I would do literally almost anything to have sex, and I’ve had a few people take advantage of that fact in the past. Anyways like I said the meds do help me restrain myself at least physically, but mentally is an entirely different story and it’s really starting to affect my academic performance, not to mention making me feel like a total creep. Some of these girls are my friends and the fact that I think about them in these ways makes me hate myself, please anyone who can suggest anything to help do so.",mentalhealth,Coping with cyclothymia and an increased sex drive,2019-01-02 01:03:45

3022,HighOnNora,1546342980,1,"i don't know if this really belongs here, but i wanted to space to share it without disrupting the communal peace.

i almost hung myself on december 11th &amp; i suddenly stopped because i lost the driving force. i realized that i didn't actually want to end my life. and whether other people who are similarly suicidal encounter the same revelation or not isn't of primary relevance to this post. i just wanted to share.

but it finally hit me in that moment, how the foremost motivation of my suicidality was never to just make it all stop. it was more along the lines of what i deserved. like i needed to just get rid of myself.

making it all stop just wouldn't make sense. i actually enjoyed myself as a person.

for background, i am a transgender female, and over the last few months i've made unprecedented progress towards transitioning, my standards at least lol. and i came to actually appreciate and enjoy myself, my personality, body image, mannerisms, etc. yet my suicidal cravings wouldn't subside, and i couldn't make sense of them then. and so things deterioated. until i finally took the time to write out all my letters in anticipation of ending it all, for the first time. before it was more of a cursory scribble. like ""sorry so so sorry not your fault mom"" type stuff.

and i had my funeral songs picked out, and i actually poured a little heart into my preparations, and then i was finally just standing there, making sure i had my balance before i pushed the chair beneath me, &amp; i just couldn't. i just didn't feel it anymore. instead, i felt more of this bit of peace that i could simply walk away with and it was unlike any of the other times, because for once it was clear to me *why* i didn't want to die. and that was because i've already begun transitioning, and idk, i just kinda liked myself too much to go.

so in the following days, i had what i believe was hypomania/mania. like a lot of high energy screaming at my dog and running up and down the stairs until my chest hurt and slamming doors because it felt funny and pouring sparkling champagne over my head and giggling to myself and all this batshit weird stuff that i've never thought of. and feeling like i had unlocked some sort of abilities, like i could manipulate people's behaviors with my mind if i thought REALLY hard about it. 

though it was very rapid cycling. twice a day, around 3-4ish and in the evening. back &amp; forth between ""up"" and ""down, down"", for a few days. 

and then after that must've been the ""crash"", because i lost track of time and just got super muted and i thought that i was either separated from my original universe, or i was a ghost that died and had to remember how i did. and i've never entertained any of these things before, or become so out of touch with making sense.

its just all so fuckin unexpected. i've never experienced any mental illness outside the realm of depression, anxiety, etc. before this.

i'm looking to schedule a visit to my psychiatrist once my health coverage plan has been renewed. and i KNOW that i've been leaping to conclusions, but it's how i've been able to come to terms with everything &amp; get by until further attention.

but over the past few days it's been a lot easier. a lot more of me crying the snot out of my eyes until my head hurts. which is better than a lot of things, apparently. 

right now is better than ever. and i've never wanted so badly to simply persist.

3023,DoingBetterForMyself,1546341328,1,"So I'm on Seroquel and Lithium for Bipolar and I stopped taking them both for two days and I'm pretty sure I have some crazy insight in thats short time, or I could just be wrong.

Firstly, I'm a recovering addict. I did a lot of hard drugs and some days I just felt straight up stupid and my mental functioning seemed like it was maybe 50% of what it was before drugs. I had memory issues with lithium when I first got on it but it went away after changing to the extended release version. So anyway, after stopping the lithium, it seemed like I was actually able to function like I used to be able to and I was remembering things much more clearly from further back in time than I could before. So I'm pretty sure that a good portion of that is being caused by the lithium. The memory issues are back now that I'm taking it again.

Second, I threw up and felt extremely sick after being off my seroquel. I couldn't sleep even after taking 3x my prescribed dose of trazadone that I don't ever take anwyay. I was also coughing up blood. I tried to get off of seroquel before because it makes me extremely hungry at night, and they put me on abilify and I had these symptoms after taking it so I assumed it was because of the abilify, but now I'm fairly certain it's actually from the lack of seroquel. This means I could actually maybe do abilify if I taper off the seroquel.

Finally, I started seeing things. I saw the outlines of people in the dark. I could feel the presence of things in the room with me. I could see invisible people, not actually see them, but I knew exactly where they were standing and exactly what they looked like I just couldn't see them. Hard to explain. I used to be afraid of the dark as a kid, and as a teen an adult too for that matter, for this reason. After being on seroquel I can't remember having this fear anymore. The dark was just the dark. There were no more creatures of people or presences waiting in it. But after I stopped taking the pills, this came back, as well as my ability to remember it happening in the past.

Anyway, thanks for reading. If anyone could provide any insight or anything, especially as to the last part about seeing things and what that could be I would appreciate it. Thank you.",mentalhealth,I stopped my pills for 2 days. This is what happened.,2019-01-01 22:15:28

3025,WannaSeeTheWorldBurn,1546337099,1,"I know this woman. I dont like her at all. Shes two faced. Doesnt parent her kids. Ignores one kid and over spoils another. Shes also mooching off one of my best friends. Id like her a lot more if she would be a better parent and actually pitch in to the bills she uses. 

My issue is that I have bipolar disorder and borderline with severe anxiety. Fun stuff. Ive worked my butt off to get to the point I am now. And in pretty high functioning most of the time. She claims to have ptsd and says she manic. 

I have a bachelors in psychology and own the dsm5. No where (yes I may have missed it) have i seen mania as an only symptom. She claims shes never been depressed. I know thats a lie because shes been sent to hospitals for threatening suicide in arguments with her boyfriend. 

My issue though is I spend a lot of time around her. I see that shes high a lot. Not just weed but pills and possibly meth and/or heroin. I can smell the drugs sometimes and others she cant even stay awake and is sluring her words. Plus she looks like she's 60 and shes only 40. And weighs ten pounds soaking wet. 

When she doesn't get her way around the house. Or is asked to pitch in with money or cleaning she freaks the fuck out. Like screaming and breaking shit. Threats and the whole 9 yards. Even upsetting my friends neighbors.

3026,ynot0404,1546335128,1,"Okay I guess I’ll just start by saying on my birthday in 2018 I brought a knife to bed with me and held it to my throat and heart and sliced my arms and I guess yeah I was trying to kill myself. After that I started working harder with my therapist and my extremely mentally unstable sister was brought across the country to a facility to help her mental health. It simultaneously of course helped me too because trying to overcome depression and anxiety brought on by rape is a very difficult task when your older sibling is also suicidal (I’m 16 she’s 18).

Anyway those were the best months of my life when she left. I’ve never felt so free and able to garner the attention towards my mental health from my parents which I always felt I lacked. Well she came home last week. I was already going downhill a bit because of some other things that happened and honestly probably also a seasonal thing but seeing her again didn’t help that at all. Of course my parents were all “oh she’s so much better” and “we’re so happy she’s home” and yeah okay I’m happy my sister is home too but she’s barely any better. Just yesterday we were sitting in a restaurant around a bunch of people and I made a stupid sarcastic remark when she asked me about a football game (it was stupid but it was something that I do all the time). Well she lashed out at me and even slapped me. She literally hit me in public. My parents passed it off said it’s no big deal. They don’t see what I see. That hit wasn’t just it. She’s not able to live normally or with this family it just can’t happen. And of course I feel bad and everything but they just can’t see that this isn’t best for ANYBODY.

Now about suicide (yay), I have a very bad habit just like many of my fellow anxiety and depressioners. When I feel hopeless I tend to go to websites like lostallhope.com that talk all about suicide and different methods and honestly it’s starting to grow on me. I’ve described these feelings and what I’ve done to my therapist but she is telling me it’s something that will pass but I feel in my heart that it’s a really much bigger problem. Last night my body just couldn’t handle the frustration any more and I had a full out cry for help and I woke up my mom and told her pretty much everything I just said: my sister is making me feel like this and blah blah and this family can’t handle it and we’re falling apart and I feel like I can’t take another day of it. And I think you can guess what she said. “It’s okay, I know things seem bad to you, but to me it’s only getting better. Go back to sleep now you must be tired.” Of course it’s paraphrased but that’s what happened. 

I don’t know what to do guys. This is my first time posting here. I’m suicidal and all I thought about when we were counting down to 2019 was “is this the year I’m actually going to do it. Am I going to live until 2020?” And those are scary to me. I don’t like thinking about it but it just keeps happening.

I’m sorry nobody I expect will read this all and I don’t blame you. I think I really needed to vent and maybe also find some supportive words or helpful people but I understand.

I'm 22 y/o male and I just went to a new years party with my girlfriend (it was her work party) and I just hated every single thing about it. Idk if it's the social part that bothers me the most but it feels uncomfortable to me the entire time. I find myself just not wanting to talk to people because of their behavior. Everyone is either drinking or high. But the weird part to me is that I kind of enjoy both of those things from time to time (almost never in a social setting though) myself so I feel hypocritical for disliking people for doing things I enjoy.  I think my greater problem is that I hate groups. I love one on one time with people. I could do it all day, but with literally any more than one other person I feel like shit. (Immediate family excluded).

 Also my girlfriend was really drunk the whole time and I found it really weird that she was a little bit of a ""party animal"". we have been dating for 6 months  and she always seemed like she didn't care for that at all. Now I'm not saying shes a bad person for enjoying those things I just found it surprising to be around my girlfriend while she brags about how many shots shes taken after 6 months of not really hearing anything like that.

I'm just afraid that I'm socially inept for life or something and Its occasionally difficult to deal with. I also feel like I'm kind of an antagonist with the whole situation because I feel like I should just be okay with that stuff but for some reason situations like this really keep upsetting me and I can't shake it.

Since high school (we're almost 4 years into college now), she has always verbally put herself down. She seems to have some unknown expectations of herself and of other people, because she gets upset very easily when you say something 'wrong'. For example, I once asked her why she was using Casio instead TI-84 and she thought I was judging her for being poor. (She is not poor.) I was at a party recently, and she very strongly implied to some of us in the group that she has harmed herself in the past. I didnt really say anything because I have no idea how to talk to her. At this same party, she became increasingly reserved and tried to leave early. She also told me she hasn't made any friends in college. I think she's been isolating herself and people can't reach her. A bunch of people from high school made an online chat group that we still continue to talk in. Whenever she felt bothered by a topic, even if it wasn't personally about her, she'd make an emotional post and temporarily leave. Whenever she hangs out with us, she always shares inappropriate personal information about herself or her family. One time, someone in the group was upset by one of her posts, and made some hurtful comments to her. My friend once again left the chat, but this time she never came back.

3043,KingBowser24,1546323462,1,"20 y/o male. Sorry its such a long post, but feel free to make a long comment, I'll read it. I feel its a good way for us to both vent about bad things and remember the good things.

Here's the last 10 years for me:

2008: One of the best, if not the best year of my life. The only bad thing that happened is my Great Grandma died. I turned 10 years old, felt like a big kid, and things were simple and great. It was the time where I began to understand reality to an extent, but still had that childhood bliss. There were also alot of firsts for me this year. First crush, first best friend, first book I wrote, and more.

2009: Oh boy. Everything flipped for the worst shortly after 2009 began. I mean, everything. My family went from Middle Class to Poverty, my grandma who was emotionally abusive was around all the time while my parents were out trying to keep food on the table, I started getting bullied when 6th grade began (and i dont mean here and there, I mean like 0-100, didn't get bullied hardly at all before, and then suddenly it seemed like everyone was out to get me). I lost almost all of my ""friends"". Plus, my youngest sister was born, which, dont get me wrong, I love her, but because of that, and our lack of money, my parents hardly had any time for me when i needed their time the most. I dont blame them though. Yeah, lets just say it was so bad I basically had borderline PTSD and a multitude of emotional issues for many years after.

2010: Shitty at first, but things started to look up around May. Ill always remember March 8, 2010 as the absolute worst day of my life, but that's a whole nother story. My parents both finally found stable jobs, and my grandma was a bit less abusive than before. Perhaps she was like that due to her stress from our family's situation before. Life kind of went back to how it was in 2008, simple and mostly blissful, aside from my emotional instability. It was a nice relief after 2009.

2011: Pretty decent year actually. Much like late 2010, things were pretty simple. I hung out with friends and did random kid stuff. I also turned 13, so my parents became much more lax with me than before, and i was allowed to do alot more things on my own. We moved to a different town in late 2011, which i really didn't like at first, but eventually got settled into our new home and made new friends. I met my best friend this year too! I also had my first kiss during the Spring.

2012: Awesome year. Made several new friends, and we did alot of fun (and stupid) stuff. Ill never forget the long afternoons and late nights just walking around town with my closest friends, doing whatever, yknow. It was simple, but great. I also successfully pursued my crush that year, and we dated for a short while.

2013: Oof. I dont really know. Early 2013 was much like 2012 but mid 2013 sucked ass. I suddenly came down with Hypochondria. May-August it was basically ""Im dying"" and i was constantly panicking. Yeah, for about 4 months things were terrible, but then I kind of came out of it in August. We moved again in late July, but honestly it was for the better. I think part of the reason i felt so much better is that we didnt live an hour from the nearest hospital now. I know, it was kind of dumb, but oh well. Late 2013 wasnt too bad. I still have Hypochondria to an extent, but not near as bad as mid 2013.

2014: I like to refer to 2014 as the ""Dog Days"" of my life because it was just so incredibly simple compared to the likes of 2013 and 2009. Go to school, play video games, hang out with my friends. That was my life. Had barely any chores, and I got my driver's liscense, so that was very nice. Got my first job in mid 2014 as well.

2015: A really awesome year. My self confidence shot up this year after playing on the Baseball team, and i became quite popular at my school. First time since 2008 that I didn't feel like a weird outcast among my peers.

2016: A very busy, but also pretty good year despite what many people experienced. Still popular at school, Took the hottest girl in my school to prom, endless adventures with my best friend, and graduated high school, threw a killer graduation party, and 3 months later started college. College was great too for the time, made alot of new friends and the classes were much better than i expected.

2017: Early 2017 was pretty awesome for the most part. Had a hell of alot of fun partying it up with my buddies at college, and i was taking some really good classes. But, come mid 2017, I fell out with my best friend. Honestly really took a toll on me, I loved him like a brother. Late 2017 honestly sucked hard. After getting in a bad situation with my girlfriend at the time, and breaking up, my mental health tanked again. Only good thing that happened in late 2017 is that I found a new best friend, who is still my best friend to this day.

2018: Its hard for me to describe this year. Its been a mixed bag of good and bad. I ended up making amends with my ex-girlfriend, but other than that, early 2018 sucked really hard. My hypochondria came back in force, and I ended up really depressed because of it. I had no energy, and my grades tanked, which of course, my parents were not happy about at all. I still partied when i felt up to it and had good times, but my mental health was the worst it has been since 2009. I even got sent home from work a few times because my anxiety would get so intense that i couldn't function. But, come late 2018, my mental health improved a bit and i picked up a couple hobbies. I even figured out how to stop a panic attack in its tracks. But, I ended up dropping out of college because for some reason since early 2018 it also became hard on my mental health. But, I hope 2019 can bring me some new and good things! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My best years are 2008, 2012, and 2015-2016, and my worst years are 2009, 2013, and probably late 2017-early 2018.

I would say 2008, 2012, and 2015-16 are pretty close, I cant decide which one was the best. But, out of the worst, 2009 definitely takes 1st. There would probably have to be a nuclear war for me to have a year worse than 2009. Even though i had 2013 and late 2017-early 2018, they weren't consistently bad really, just had a few really bad parts. 2009 was just absolute jackshit through and through.

What i wanted to get out of this is, is this a mental problem? can i fix it because i am really fucking hating to not be able to sleep and when i want to stay wake at night i have to wait for the fucking sun to rise even then i dont feel as comfortable.

So far I’ve tried:
- At least 6 different SSRIs / SNRIs, minimum 8 weeks or longer. currently on a pristiq / mirtazapine combo
- psychotherapy at least a half dozen times with different people of different ages/gender/modality, incl. CBT
- mindfulness meditation (can’t get into it at all)
- augmentation with anti psychotics
- stimulants for my ADHD which have tended to make the anxiety worse, but the ADHD itself makes me anxious so it’s a double edged sword
- long acting benzos which I’ve developed a tolerance to and don’t want to keep taking them or up the dosage lest I ended up dependent on them

When i was 16 i figured out that i was gay, i gained weight due to cooking school which had a negative effect on me. I never really had alot of friends ever. I've spent most of my life in my room playing games and watching youtube.

the time between 16 and 20 years old i was abused online, threatened, people saw a way too friendly stranger and took advantage. I was hurt in several ways during those years, self-esteem is horrible, i'm negative about myself and i cant stand myself.

I was also in a .. some kind of college thing for a year studying photography cause i didnt get a job after cooking school because i was lied to by people i had been having work experience at. At the college i had a room mate i didnt talk too much with, i did make some friends though we didnt hang every day, i did some exercise cuz of a friend i made but eventually quit when winter arrived, i was feeling really depressed, confused.. might've had some kind of existencial crisis.. started to really wanna change myself and get what i wanted in life.

I missed family ALOT too cuz it was my first time staying elsewhere than home, i went home on weekend sometimes but it was rough, i started just sitting in bed with my laptop watching videos and eating lots of treats to comfort myself.

after college i went to do another school, health- and careworker school for 2 years, was staying home this time.  1st year i had good grades cuz there was alot if useful things i could apply to my life, though i struggled still, went to school nurse.

after the first year, i had to go elsewhere for year 2. what we studied was kinda boring to me so my grades dropped, still having lots of lows in terms of mood. Didn't make friends or hang alot with anybody.

After all of this i had applied for a job too late, so i got help from this Norwegian program that helps people get a job and whatnot, so luckily i got a job at this junior school i work at now. This is my second year out of 3 years.. apprenticeship of some sort, just takes longer cuz i work 50%.

I looked for a proffessional to talk to about my problems, which i found and have been to for half a year or so. Its helping a little but i always feel like my problems are gone when im talking to someone, i cant get things out, struggle with words.

The past 3 years i've been really wanting to get good at something, find a talent or skill. I tried guitar for a bit but gave up, and i always wanna be good at online video games. But everytime i play a game and get angry, it triggers this.. depression i have following me, its painful. I get extremely angry when i do bad or die in a game to something i find is bullshit, the anger goes to sadness, i think about my life and everything that sucks and it honestly makes me want to not live anymore.

I Decided to write on here because I don't know where else to go, I just had a moment of anger and i'm so tired of feeling this way.. thats why im writing here. I wouldn't say im suicidal, but i have had dark thoughs and sometimes i just tell myself i dont want to live.

I've had terrible mental health lately, despite this is am more positive then I have ever been because I adopted a cat 2 months ago, he is the best thing that have happened to me since I lost my dog to old age 5yrs ago. I am doing my best to get better for the kitty, even though it's really hard to even get out of bed he always have food, clean water and a cleab litterbox.

But I am spending energy I don't have, I want to be happy and be able to care for him, but my constant exhaustion and worrying is starting to seep through and while I know it's no good to bottle it up, I got nowhere to get the steam of sorta. Add to that a terrible Christmas. I lost $100, and as someone living on not even disability (sick leave, but for 1.5yr so not enough really), it's all of my non-bill money, a friend went into coma and died a few days later, and now today I was told by my landlord that I need to move out by the end of February because ""change of plans"". My co-pay for healthcare also started up again as it's jan 1st. So while only paying $250-$300 per year in total for all health and mental health sound great, it means I basically have to pay it within 2months due to my intense treatment plan. Oh, and I was hit my a firework today because fucking teenagers are given firework so their drunk parents can be left in peace. 

Financial stress is my biggest trigger of suicidal toughts, because I have lived me entire life barely scraping by and essentially begging for handouts to stay alive - and I do not want that for the rest of my life. But how am I going to cope with medical costs, moving apartments - with the damn cat that makes everything twice as expencive, dealing with my ""backlog"" of owed money now due to the lost$100 (I need to borrow to eat essentially) and then on top of it all be happy and cheerfull and gratefull for the people around me. I can't. But if I hurt myself then the cat looses his home and he is special needs, and finally feels safe for once in his life. I'm just so tired. I want to sleep and never wake up again. I hate people, but I know I need people to help me, so in turn I hate myself too. I know the logical thing is to ask advice from my caseworker, but that will sound so much like begging, and it'll be asking far too much of them.

This year was actually pretty good. Started going to therapy... Probably had the ""kill yourself"" thoughts a little less than usual... But today was bad.

Actually, today was just the culmination of years of low key bad.
Two years ago (my worst year), I was separated from my wife and kids for the majority of it. Long story short, my boss lied to my face about a transfer, so I was stuck for ~9 months while my family moved two and a half hours away. My days off are usually separated, so I could only afford to be home for about 12 waking hours a week with my wife, year old son, and six year old stepson, who spent most of those weekends with his dad. 

Digression of background: I'm an Eeyore by nature. My wife and kids are the only thing that keep me from... Really really dark places.

Needless to say, this was not a healthy time in my life. Toward the end, I called in sick multiple times after my day off, as the thought of driving away from the only reason to exist paralyzed me with depression.

I didn't call in sick once this last year. But I've been carrying that increased depression with me since then. I'm pretty consistently 1 to 5 minutes late to work, which is my fault, but I have to fight so hard to get out of bed every morning... 

I called in sick on Saturday, as I was busy literally shitting the bed... But because I didn't get a doctor's note to tell me that I was shitting the bed, and it was in conjunction with my day off on Sunday, it was a problem. Which I found out after I got to work later than usual this morning. I probably am not going to lose my job right now, but the thin ice definitely broke.

But I realized today, that I truly want to kill myself. It's not just intrusive thoughts that I don't believe or agree with... I am so tired of being in this wretched, broken, disgusting world...
But I have my family. And I love them and need to be here for them. I want to be here for them. Honestly, that's the only thing I have ever wanted in my entire life.
But, as I have obviously put their well being at risk with my unacceptable attendance, I am very aware that, regardless of the fact that I can't, and I won't... I yearn to kill myself, and I've just been laughing it off for years.

Anyway... We're fine. We're all fine here... ... How are you?",mentalhealth,Toss me in the open sea...,2019-01-01 12:00:54

In the Spring, I decided to write a Fan Fiction story for my favorite character from my favorite online game...and that had triggered one of my deepest, darkest secrets that I had been holding in my heart and mind for decades. I tried to ignore it...but it had grown and grown until it became full-blown and took over my life, basically. I am now fighting it every single day of my existence (which isn't actually as bad as it sounds) and I have had some ups and downs since late summer, which is when it had come out full-force in me. There is no going back now, so I sit with this disorder and I am learning how to control it, and I am learning a lot about myself in the process. I am stronger than I'd thought and I have more willpower than I'd ever thought I'd have.  


2018 wasn't a bad year. It was a year of discovery and a little bit of pain (I was in denial for a while before my best friend made me see that I do have this disorder, which I had confirmed with a professional later), but otherwise, it has been a quiet, okay year.

I have a weird habit where I pick my teeth or nose, smell it, and play with it. I really like the smell of my snot and plaque. I also will rub it on my fingers/hands until it dries out and rolls into a solid ball. It's so bad that I bought a dental kit from the drugstore just for the teeth-picking tool. I used to just use anything with a semi shark tip (pins, mechanical pencils, etc). I also won't use a tissue for my nose unless it's running/bleeding badly or I'm in public.

I really try to refrain from doing this in public, and for the most part I'm successful. This has been going on since I was very young (elementary school, maybe earlier). I also had a habit where I would use the back of my index finger to rub around my mouth and then smell my finger...it used to cause a lot of irritation around my mouth area. I still do this occassionally, but not to the point of irritation. 

I want to figure out what's causing this, because it's gross...not to mention I'm spreading germs to parts of my body where they shouldn't be and then touching objects. Could this be an anxiety thing? Or is it something else entirely?

My mom, who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has convinced herself that I’m bipolar too and misdiagnosed. She goes on tirades all the time and screams vicious things at me and the rest of my family and is generally emotionally abusive.


I’m in my fourth year in college and have lived away from my parents for that time. I’ve been seeing psychiatrists and therapists for the better part of two years and have been on and off antidepressants in that time due to panic attacks and depression.


I’m home now for three weeks of break and I’ve been seeing a new therapist who’s really helping. I’m getting good coping strategies and feeling better. I had a really rough semester last semester and have been seeing my therapist twice a week over break to try and work on coping mechanisms for my depression.


My mom is insistent that they’ve misdiagnosed me and that I’m actually bipolar. Never mind the fact that after being on antidepressants for 6 months, I never had a manic episode. She’s now saying that my therapist doesn’t know what he’s doing and is questioning his credentials (he has a Masters from a university specializing in Clinical Mental Health Counseling). She’s also saying that my psychiatrists and PAs don’t know what they’re doing and that I need to get in with a “real psychiatrist” (sure, mom, you know more than these board-certified PhDs🙄).


She’s now also convinced that I’m not telling my therapist everything and that I “rage” (this is projection) and she has to tell my therapist about this imaginary “rage” I have. She even insisted that my entire family would back her up on this. I then asked my family to which they all responded that she was making shit up. One of my sisters even said my mom had accused her of being bipolar as well.


I don’t want my mom to speak to my therapist and I’m not going to allow it. My dad has said wants there to be “peace” in the house and is going along with my mom that she should be allowed into my therapy sessions. Even after telling him I don’t want her there, he’s telling me reasons I should let her come and talk to my therapist. He’s making arguments like “let her come and the therapist will see that she’s projecting.” It’s really frustrating me and I don’t feel supported by my dad. I’ve explained I’m not comfortable with her coming and he isn’t respecting that. I also feel like my mom is trying to insert herself where she’s not welcome. I’ve been away at school for four years and have never had a manic or hypomanic episode and I’m really sick of this insistence that I’m bipolar. And I’m thinking about going back to school early just to get away from her, but I don’t want to stop seeing this therapist early just because she wants to be a bitch.

Without suggesting that I let my mom come, does anyone have advice for how I should handle this?
Should I go back to school and give up this treatment (I’d go back to my therapist at school who’s okay but not great)? Or should I try to suck it up and spend two more weeks here?

3082,Pashera,1546290678,1,"Not reccomending it, but I got a life insurance policy for myself. They have a policy at the company that I got it from that they don't give out benefits from suicide until after the first 3 years. Actually most life insurance agencies have a similar rule. You can EVENTUALLY get your loved ones the money if you kill yourself, but not for the first couple of years, this is done to try and prevent people from taking up life insurance for that one reason. Instead it works as my perfect timetable. As a college student who's only way of getting tuition is by making sure I don't get any grade lower than a B, the first three years serves as a perfect timetable for me to either succeed or fail, and if I fail, then I can at least give my best friend the money and opportunities that I had and didn't deserve that he didnt have but does deserve.

Im struggling with a problem, and beacause of that I cant really maintain any kind of relationship and I can be really rude to my parents because of that. I tried to google it but I couldnt find what I was looking for.

So my problem is following: When there is a girl that I really like(or even my parents when they show kindess to me) and I show her signal that I like her maybe take her to the cinema and as soon as she starts to be like really kind to me or the times that my parents are kind, I just cant help to be a cynical asshole at those moments and be rude to them, I am really self-aware about this problem so most of the time I act consciously not to be rude, but its not what my intuitions tell me to do.

3086,kameronb,1546288879,1,"Hey all, longtime lurker here and frequent poster in one of two subreddits hockey related.

To keep things short, some people on Reddit seem to love bringing others down in a gang mentality, and when they can’t say anything but just disagree they downvote.

If I post something that the wrong person disagrees with in r/hockey, they gang up like a pack of wolves. I posted something in there that abided by their rules (mods never removed it) and people went in there to say how wrong my titling is rather than discuss the video I had posted which was why I posted it- for discussion.
People resort to saying I must have “never played hockey” and people hanging up on how wrong my opinion is on a play in a split-second game. All I did was post a video.

It got to the point where I DMed one of the people who kept looking for my threads in particular. They found that I’d posted again, trying to repost and not “editorialize” and they commented something like “still going on about this, huh?”
Yes I’m going on about it still as I should because I’m allowed to have an opinion.
I called them out asking their problem was, they just responded “😂😂😂😂😂”.

The mods there will ignore any reports or messages in order to lurk threads and pick/choose what abides the sub’s rules. I reported the trolls who still were commenting on my last post, but lol not one of the comments was deleted.

Anyway, I guess today I learned how people you see as comrades on Reddit’s you frequent don’t actually care about your opinion at all; they care about theirs and being correct. Because when they get the opportunity to be correct, they’ll shut you down and make you feel like an idiot about thinking about something a certain way.

My New Years Eve has been brought down. 

I yelled at my parent when I was supposed to help them and I feel terrible that a fucking website can affect me so metaphysically.

I guess I should explain my background. My childhood was very tough so I quickly went from being an open friendly person to quite an introverted and lonely person. As a kid I never really got the affection I wanted but deep down kept it quiet because I knew it would cause issues if I talked about it. I think it was this alone that caused me to develop a kind of bad case of social anxiety and introversion. 

If it wasn't bad already, a while back I discovered I was transgender and it's had such negative effects on my family and friends. Not being seen anymore for who I am has had such a negative impact especially right before going into college. At this point I am so overwhelmed and unable to think straight because of it or go outside and do anything with anyone because I am so anxious and not seen positively anymore.

I had been on the drug about 2 years prior, but stopped taking it due to being bad at staying with medication management. I had NO problems or side effects, whatsoever at that time. 

So back to a month ago, I'm back on Wellbutrin. Feeling fine, not really noticing a difference for about 2 weeks, and very suddenly I felt a sense of being overly giddy. I was in a really really good mood, and I felt like nothing could bring me down. I was bouncing around with energy (mostly belting Disney songs and showtunes) I also wasn't sleeping more than 2 hours a night because I felt like I just had so much energy. I also bought about $500 worth of clothes, shoes, and makeup that I know I didn't need, but didn't think about any of the reprocussions. 

after about 3-4 days of feeling that way, I hit a deep depression. I suffered  from suicidal ideation for a long time, but nothing in recent memory like this. I also struggle with an eating disorder that was well under control until this ""episode"" I was laying on my floor genuinely planning my way to kill myself. I felt like all my energy had been zapped from me from the few days prior and couldn't leave my bed. I didn't eat and was making myself sick on an empty stomach. I was also very moody and irritable, yelling at everyone around me. 

I was also having extremely traumatic night terrors, that I now attribute to this medication. since stopping this med,these have slowly started to stop, or lessen. 

Luckily, I had a medication follow up appointment with my primary care the next day. I told him what was going on, and he sent me to the psychiatric inpatient unit for an evaluation. 

There, they diagnosed me with Bipolar II and said that it is common that a drug can bring out these tendencies. The psychiatrist immediately D/C Wellbutrin. 

I am now on an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer and I feel MUCH better. I have not had such a dramatic ""swing"" since then. I am sad that I now have another mental health diagnosis, but thankful it led me some options that have really helped me. 

I'm just wondering why I didn't experience this beforehand while on the same drug? Anyone have a similar experience? Or words of advice to me to deal with this new diagnosis I have, of Bipolar II? 


TLDR; I was put on a mental health med that induced psychosis, even though I had been on said drug previously, with no prior issues.  Another mental health diagnosis was made from this situation. Any thoughts? ",mentalhealth,Anyone experience medication induced psychosis?,2019-01-01 04:54:46
3099,APHTHARTO,1546277798,1,"  Practical tips include:

• Eat healthy meals

• Get sufficient sleep

• Exercise regularly. Exercise releases chemicals in your brain. They can uplift your mood, increase your energy, and improve your sleep. 

• If possible, try to recognize triggers and early warning signs of a depressive mood and prepare an achievable plan of action in advance. 

• Confide in someone you trust. Have a contact list of people you can call when you’re feeling down.

I’m also a mess myself. I’ve become apathetic towards everything and everyone around me. Empathy is difficult, and I’ve let Reddit convince me that I’m a heartless sociopath who feels no remorse. I don’t think I’m a sociopath, but I feel like one.

What is currently stopping me from therapy are a few things. My GP contacted my mother and told her that I was lonely. She came to me asking why I felt this way and what I was still doing on the couch and I denied it all. My GP telling my family about my mental health annoyed me because I felt a betrayal of trust with my privacy. I think it won’t be long until she tells my family that I tried to kill myself, which would honestly just fuck everyone up. I’m trying to avoid this.

When my brother heard about this, he was understanding about my depression until he told me that seeking therapy was a stupid decision because now it will make me look weak in the future? I don’t like my brother. I’ll never open up to him. I will always tell everyone in my family that I’m fine to keep the peace. 

What’s started to now make me really think about Therapy is that my dad is also now starting to catch on. I know that I can’t talk to my family about this stuff, and that I don’t have friends either. I need to speak to someone because right now I don’t want to speak to my family about this. They will never understand other than tell me that I’m “stronger than that”.  My brother said that.
