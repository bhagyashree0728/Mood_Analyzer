3,phantomtroupe-thief,1548921585,1,"I look like I'm not lonely on the outside but I am. I hover near people I've spent years honing our friendship only to realize none of them realize I exist. I'm there, but nobody talks to me until I insert myself into the conversation. No one remembers me or thinks to ask me out. I don't even cross people's minds when they make plans. That's why I'm always so eager to make plans with others, but even when I ask, I'm still not put in the loop. 

Recently, all my friends got together to do something big we've been planning for a while. I was the first to ask what our game plan was. I get that I have an Android and can't be in the group chat, but not a single one of them thought to ask me... During the entire planning process the thought of me didn't cross any of their minds. I asked this girl who is known for being incredibly kind how she could forget about me and she brushed me off and said she was busy and forgot, like it wasn't a big deal. I kind of feel bad for having my feelings hurt cause they're not bad people so they'll feel bad but it's not like that means they'll remember in the future. I poured my heart and soul to this girl, texted her how I felt lonely and that no one remembers me. She hasn't responded. I saw her in person and I saw her go on her phone and she knows I know she got my text. Didn't say sorry in real life even tho we sit right next to each other. Didn't even mention the situation. My other friend brings it up, and she still doesn't apologize. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like my life is a lie because I really felt like I found friends and now I realize I'm on the outside looking in.

I suffer with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. I've reached a stage of loneliness that I feel that I can't bring myself to try anything anymore. I'm so tired of feeling let down and hurt by people that I'm beginning to dislike everyone and everything. I haven't vocally spoken to anyone in about 3 weeks now. I live alone and rarely see other people unless I have to go and buy food, I won't even go to a regular checkout just so I don't have to speak to anyone, I just use the self service. I don't know what I'm doing anymore in life, I have no goals, no passions, I just feel empty and void of everything that a person should feel.

I guess I don’t know if this belongs here, but I’m terrible at talking to women, and I’m not attractive enough to make up for that. Or even attractive at all.

I feel like my personality is shit, and that I’m boring. I have a pretty strong foundation of morals, but nobody cares about that. 

I’m very alone and hurting. I feel as though I’ll never find a relationship again. If people feel any way the same I feel about myself, then will probably show very little interest.

I'm working on things in my life right now and building a foundation for it and I can't really make a woman happy in real life..at least not yet but I'm working on myself hard so that I can be a stable person that can provide value to a relationship other than being funny and being able to make someone smile b.

16,Booyaboy11,1548893397,1,"This is a throwaway account because people could pretty easily find my real account and I don’t feel like I have anyone I could actually talk to about this. Anyway, here we go. 

I guess I’ll start a few years back. My wife and I bought our first house after saving for a few years. It was a little more than we should have bought but if we kept saving and being smart we would always be fine. Well we weren’t always smart. She kept buying things to put into the house even though I told her we should take our time doing that. So over the next few years this continued, we had a child, I lost my job and we were in debt. When we found out we were pregnant I told her we should sell our house and move. We couldn’t afford it and the area we lived in was a hard place to make a living. She refused so I cut everything in our budget that wasn’t necessary. We were barely making it. 

About two years later I lost my job. Now it was really time to move. Again, she flat out refused. She would always tell me we would be homeless if we sold it and yes that makes no sense. So now our credit card is maxed out, we are barely making enough to pay our bills and on top of that both of our vehicles were getting pretty old and starting to cause problems. Same with our house. It was nice but was now 12 years old. Things were in need of repair. A family member of mine found out what was happening and despite my refusing, they paid off our debt. She still wouldn’t leave the house. 

Fast forward another year. She’s gotten involved in an mlm company despite me being against it (we were desperate for money) and I’m working again but it’s only part time and our debt is rising. There’s no reasoning with her about moving. It’s like she was paralyzed by fear and couldn’t make a rational decision. So things are pretty bad and come Christmas time, we have a huge fight. She had been asking me to go to couples therapy off and on for a while and I always refused. I thought if we could both just try harder then things would get back to the way we were. Well she never tried. In fact she got worse. She got so hung up on Internet likes and comments from strangers that nothing I did or said made an impact on her anymore. So after this big fight I finally realized that I was not going to get through to her and agreed to the therapy. 

So we start seeing someone who was highly recommended to us. We go a few times together and a few times alone (at the request of the therapist) but things aren’t getting better. In fact, she’s getting even worse. She’s becoming more distant, lazy and apathetic. She wouldn’t even clean up after herself so our house looked like a hoarders paradise. She would complain that she needed help but would become angry when I tried to help. It was like I was living with Jekyll and Hyde. 

Despite all of this, I still felt like the woman I married was in there and I still loved her. Plus our son is amazing, was pretty oblivious to everything going on and I love him to death. Then, about 10 months ago, I come home from work one day and find that no one is home which is strange for that time of day. I look around for a few minutes and put up the food (she had asked me to bring a few things home for dinner) and then I see a note taped to the tv. It was a letter from a collection agency about our credit card debt and she had written “figure this out, we’ll be at my moms”. So I tried to text and call and got no response. I was so angry that she had taken off and was acting like this was all my fault. I let it go and assumed I would hear from her soon and that they would be back in a few days. 

She never came back. For a month she ignored me. I tried to speak to her mom and she ignored me. I spoke to her dad and he told me I was no longer welcome at their home and not to come there. I have no idea what she told them but they were definitely against me now. About two weeks later I was checking our cell phone bill to see exactly when it was due. All of our bills were set to auto pay so I didn’t know the exact date and now money was tighter than ever so I needed to make sure I would have it. That’s when I noticed how long the bill was. I had seen our bills before and they were 10-20 pages long. We text a lot and she talked to her mom a lot. Well this one was 96 pages so I started digging. I found the same number over and over again. It didn’t take me long to figure out that it was an ex boyfriend of hers from high school. They hadn’t spoken in at least 8 years and I don’t even know how she got his number again. I’m sure you can imagine the type of relationship they were having now. 

So here I am almost a year after she left. We are on speaking terms and I do get to see my son every month. She never came back, never apologized and didn’t offer a dime towards our debt. Personally, I moved, got a great job I had been chasing for years and paid off all of our debts after finally convincing her to sell the house. The problem is that I’m just so lonely. I I only see my son for a week each month and the rest of the time I just sit around at home not knowing what to do. I haven’t been on a date or tried to get one in almost 13 years. I don’t even know where to start. I just wish I had someone again. I barely even have human physical contact outside of the occasional handshake. I can’t even remember the last time I touched a female since I work in a very male work environment and I desperately miss my son. Even when he’s here I miss him because I know he’ll be gone again soon. I just felt like I needed to type all of that out. Thanks for reading if you got this far. 

TLDR - wife ran up a lot of debt, cheated on me and left with our son. Now I’m super lonely, miss my son every day and really would like some female companionship ",lonely,I miss my son and I don’t know what to do next,2019-01-31 11:09:57

Not sure if anyone can relate to this but lately I’ve been really lonely, I have friends but I feel like only one really gives a shit about me. Every time I join a group of people I’m largely ignored and cliques are formed that I’m obviously never a part of. I’ve ruined so many decent friend groups I’ve been in that I’m too afraid of trying anymore. 

To cope with this, I get very spiteful towards others and non trusting. Stuff like thinking I’m better than everyone even though I’m very obviously not, convincing myself that people don’t care about me regardless so fuck them, convincing myself I don’t need anyone else because everyone else will let me down anyways.

My therapists say I just need to go out more often. I ask my friends to go out. They say no, or they don't answer.
I've been suffering from depression since i was 17, but these two months have been the hardest time of my life. No one to count on, no reason to do anything. I have no dreams and no goals, though I've been thinking about them all my life.

I tell my 'friends' i'm not feeling good and that i seriously need help; they don't answer or tell me I'm sick in the brain. I ask for help in those suicide helplines google keeps showing me, and they just tell me things that seem quoted from the horoscope. My family say I'm just an idiot. My professors are useless. The girls I like say they totally want to help me and that 'we can go out whenever you want and talk about it!', then start ignoring me.

I should be studying a lot in this period. Instead I'm here, locked into myself. All of my friends are out there founding startups, doing projects and researches, or just enjoying their life. I'm here, wasting my life.

I fear I could soon give all of my hopes up. It's not the life I wanted to live. I didn't dream of being 100% happy or rich or things like that. But now I'm scares of living.

I know there are tons of people who suffer like me or even more. It just doesn't seem right. We are humans, we can accomplish anything. Why is there so much suffering?

What should I do? Is there a kind of doctor for this kind of problems? I want to be like the others. I already take antidepressants which help me a lot with anger and panic attacks.

At this point I should probably clarify that I didn't have very many friends but I thought had quality ones. I don't really know how to make friends because I have trust issues from traumatik times in my life.

At this point I've been unemployed for until about 9 months so I have a lot of free time on my hands and I don't really do a whole lot as I stated I only really play Xbox and not much else.

It physically pains me. For reals. 

This is my first ever post on Reddit and, yet, that's just how it is. I actually, truly believe that  loneliness will be the death of me. Like any other terminal disease out there (please, don't get me wrong; I've lost 70% of my family to such conditions and currently going through the seventh time of this bullshit, and I haven't even hit the 23 yo mark yet- I do GENUINELY believe loneliness will be the one thing that kills me, and I don't even think losing people to Death™ every other month or so is even the main reason for it). 

I don't know, this subreddit just sounded like literally The Place to mumble about something like this? Sorry. 

I'm just tired of being alone. 

How do y'all deal with it? I mean, I am a bit dumb, but I'd to give myself some credit and say that I don't believe I'm THAT much of a moron- I just honestly can't deal with it anymore. I've tried reaching out, getting help, but it's gotten so bad that, when eventually IS given to me that glorious opportunity that I find crying like a son of a bitch to be, I can only do it locked up somewhere and being all by myself. None of them expected 'wholely heartdly felt' hugs, no comfort words, no solemn, silence should by my side to cry on. Whenever (which is pretty, pretty rarely) I abruptly break into seemingly never-ending tears, there's never anybody (nobody?) around. I always only end up feeling even worse. 

So, how? How do you cope with this, exactly? 'Cause I feel like I'm pretty fucking close to hitting rock bottom right now (the real one, that one that almost nobody that has ever fallen so deep manages to crawl their way back up from the hellhole alive- they either stay there for the rest of their lives or, welp; y'all know). 

Thnx. 

P.S.: Pardon me any grammar mistake, not only I am not an English native speaker, but I am also currently fucked up on benzos and alcohol (nothing to worry about and, worth clarifying it too, nothing I'm particularly proud of either- but I'm kind of an expert on how much to consume/mix of the two without risking literal life).

I moved 800 miles away from my hometown because it isn’t even home anymore, so much heartache and broken memories are there that during Christmas when there visiting I actually wanted to just be back in my new town... 

But I’m alone... day in and day out. I wake up, work, come home, repeat. I have one friend here. My Dom. And we have both talked explicitly and I want real love and something long term and real... and he knows he can’t offer that to me.. but he is the only friend I have here. He doesn’t judge, he cares, and he’s there. 

If I break it off with him? I’m alone for god know how long until I am finally to a point where seeing the guy is an option. And that could be as much a year... 

I’m so depressed and I just want a live that is worth living. And people to live it with and share it with. But I lay here, on a slowly deflating air mattress (been 5 months now sleeping on this fucking thing) and I just want to die. 

I struggle to survive and I’m so afraid that I’ll slip up and the pieces will fall, but sometimes I just feel like giving up and missing that day at work... or not coming home on a cold snowy night... or not saving that last few bits of cash for food the next day. 

How is it that at almost 21 years I feel the pain  of an 80 year old? 

Why do I have to lay here and “suck it up” cause things could be worse when I don’t see worse around me? 

I’m homeless, sleeping in a relatives house that threatens to kick me out constantly. 800 miles away from anyone else I know. Struggling to get to work to earn money just so I can continue paying for my rides that get me to work. Some days I eat nothing at all, simply because I can’t afford to buy groceries and the local pizza joint is too expensive. The only reason I’ve washed clothes this past weekend is because I finally confessed to my Dom the shit I deal with, and he told me to bring some clothes to wash. I hadn’t washed clothes for a few weeks before then though. 

I’m 20 but I’m dead inside.  I go outside and I see grey. I hear no laughter except when I nihilistically laugh to myself.. 

I find one soul, one fucking soul that feels like a vibrant sea of color,,, and because I can’t stand to fucking be alone even if for a few months longer, I lose him. Because I guess pity sex is better than actual love since I have to be alone for a time before I can consummate that love..  

I don’t really expect to get comments or to get any likes for this post, but I just want to scream out to the world about my pain somehow. When i try to talk to people, I get pushed away, put down, belittled. And I have no one to tell my pain to who will listen.

How appalling, this is, that I am saying these words; That I have to renounce you and your culture. You and I couldn't be Kin, during this lifetime. We couldn't be one with each other.

I know that I am different than the others, but are my differences so worthy of the isolation and avoidance that you put forth, just to not have to ask about why I am the way that I am, or why I act and think the way that I do? I know that I am different. I am, fundamentally, different, in such a way that you will never understand, or be willing to accept. Perhaps, that is why you cast me to the shadows. You cannot and will not accept me for my differences - The very differences that are a core part of my being, and that I cannot and will not change. It is what makes me, me.

I understand what makes you and your societies tick, now. I know what drives you to do the things that you do, and why you think the way that you do. And, knowing this, I fear for my well-being. I fear of the barbarism of your culture, and the primitive notions that drive you to perpetuate a false system, and a false way of life. I fear for my own well being and sanity, but I, also, fear for your future, as a living species. Call it a stereotype, but unless you change your ways, and shed the need for these false institutions and false economies, then you will, surely, perish. Just, another one of nature's failed experiments.

...I can't guarantee any degree of future, while I am among you, sadly. This is why I am telling you that which I wish that you would see. The more astute of you will have, no doubt, picked up on my differences, and put two and two together. I make no attempt to veil my actions and intentions. I do not hide, behind walls and false flags, like you do. I come, as I am, and my words, actions and intentions speak no degree of subtle language. I am who I am, and I am what I am.

I am among you, for a time, as one of you. You see me on the street, and in your grocery stores. I eat at your restaurants, and I repair your broken electronics. I walk, among you, as plainly as I am, and I make no attempt to hide myself from you. Perhaps, that is why keep your distance, from me. You know that I am different, but you don't know what makes me different. You may wish to ask me, but fear offending me, out of virtue of your culture's propensity for political correctness. Maybe, you see all of the signs, but are too afraid to approach me, to ask the question. Well, my American brethren, for whom I must watch destroy themselves, each day... Allow me to bring clarity to your suspicions.

I'm not, actually, one of you. I never have been. I was reborn of your flesh, almost thirty two years ago, but I am not of your origin. I come from another time, and another place, and if you were to look into what makes me tick, then you would see that I am, still, an otherworldly being - The same otherworldly being that I, once, was; Only, now, continued as a human being. I look like you, but I am not one of you.

Perhaps, it was the differences in my psychology, and the ability for me to experience emotional ranges that you can't, as well as advanced forms of some of your own emotions, that led us to be so astray from each other. I can understand how that would create a rift, but we are, still, of the same flesh. By all respects, we are supposed to be Kin. We should be one with each other, instead of tearing each other apart with false systems that prey on people's petty differences. 

If it helps, human beings, then you would do well to know that you experience emotional ranges that I am incapable of experiencing, and that your psychology is not like mine. Perhaps, that is why we could not be Kin. I am a Xeno-Human, yes, but should my differences be what casts me into the pits of loneliness and despair? I thought that America was supposed to be a land that embraces people's differences, and that strives for a diverse mosaic of human potential. I guess, in the end, that we weren't meant to be. We could not be Kin with each other, and I could not be one of you. I have shown you who I am, and I have accepted you for who you are. Why will you not accept me? Why must I be relegated to the outside?

...I've, about, completed my purpose for being alive, on earth, as a human being. I have, only, a handful of tasks left, before I can await my end to strike me down. I have no desire to engage in your culture or way of life, anymore. Too much time and isolation has passed, for me to be able to integrate into your society. I would be unable to function with you. You've made your position clear, human beings. You have no room for an Alien in your world. I understand your decision. It's a petty and inferior choice, but I understand that I have no place. I thought that America was supposed to be the land of opportunity. I guess that that was a lie, too...

I'm going to rebuild my old dwelling unit, from before I was a human being. If I cannot take solace in your world, then I will retreat to my old life. You may have denied me of my humanity, but you cannot take away my extra-terrestriality. If I cannot be a human being, with you, then I will return to being an extra-terrestrial being. I will live in my prior living environment, and live my old life. When nature determines that I've lived enough of my life, then I will die as an old Alien, in my bed, in my proper environment. Then, when nature reincarnates me as a new form, you can rest assured knowing that I won't be showing myself on earth, again. I, already, know what I will be recycled to somewhere else, as a something else. I am incompatible with you.

It is a shame, that it has to be like this. I've long-suspected that I wasn't, actually, a human being, but it wasn't until my re-awakening that I was made aware of my roots. I've been socially isolated for most of my human life, but over the course of these last six years, my apartment has become my chrysalis, and I have been the metamorphosing caterpillar. Between my thirteen years of spiritual experiences, and my spiritual awakening, I will never be able to live a normal life with any of you. With the wisdom and perspectives that I carry, I fear for all of creation, in light of what you are capable of.

I understand that your ways drive you to seek the acceptance of a higher power, but take it from an Alien... You are not a species that is worthy of its god's love. You are, eternally, doomed to failure and repetition of your past, until you can accept that you are no different from each other, and that you need to put others before yourself. Sadly, I do not think that you will, ever, learn that lesson. That is why you are doomed to fail. That is why I am not like you. That is why we could not be Kin.

I do wish that I could have some form of solace to take in you. However, it seems that my human reality is one of withering hope. I am to rebuild my prior dwelling, and die in it, alone. Perhaps, then, I can bring closure to my last life. I wanted this life to be filled with happy memories and many smiles, but it seems that humanity is too dark and barbaric to comprehend a higher way of life. I wish that I had nice things to say about you, humanity. Sadly, I don't.

I look forward to my next life. Given, the work that I've done in this life, I can look forward to a more-pleasant form, as well as a better culture. I would, still, share my time with you, humanity. You may have shut me out, but my door is open for you. Surely, there must be someone of your ranks that is above and beyond the need for this primitive behavior? You can't, all, be like this... Can you?

Can you?... I await any willing member of the species that wishes to put our differences aside, and embrace what bring us together.

Until then

The intention of this server is to provide people, specifically people without friends, who are seeking friendship, a community for which they can embrace, find people to talk to, share a connection, and participate in activities with.


Discord link: https://discord.gg/EmxyzC9

The activities in this sever are planned to be diverse and various.

Examples of potential activities include.

* Story Time (Reading novels to each other, perhaps turn by turn).

* Gaming (Games the community can access will be defined, or streamed to others via remote desktop through a member's computer).


* Music (The creation of musical compositions through relative software co-opted by members).

Theatre (Acting sessions where members create scripts and attempt to portray a story through voice acting).

* Story writing (Sessions where we group together and write and read stories we either write together or individually).

* Roleplay (Like that of dungeons and dragons).

* Watching tv shows/movies/anime etc (where we collectively enjoy content together).

*Art (Where we create, design and build, structures, models, or drawings etc, of things through relative software, together), (be it requiring no experience, or a learning curve that will be accumulated as a group).

There are a numerous amount of activities that can be undertaken by us, as the internet is a tool that can allow us to access a multitude of opportunities, so for as long as we share a common interest, and the internet provides a means, we can engage in it.

83,throw_away_whiner,1548716590,1,"""Hey! Did you hear about this new taco place? They make the most amazing guacamole. Nothing will ever compare to what they've put together. Seriously. Your life will just not be complete without it. YOU GOTTA TRY IT!!!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever hear something like this from a friend or coworker or whatever? Maybe it's a burger joint, or a roller coaster, or a new app for your phone. Somebody talks something up like crazy, and you're inclination is to want to try it. If a lot of people are talking about how amazing that guacamole is, now you kind of have to try it. Just to know what they're talking about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well this certainly isn't limited to tacos and traffic apps. It applies to relationships too. Our entire lives, movies, books, TV, commercials, as well as every other person and their grandma has told us just how incredibly amazing relationships can be. How it enhances your life so much, and can make you weep with joy. ""Seriously. Your life will just not be complete without one. You  Gotta try it!!!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. I'm definitely interested in one. When I get off work, I think I'll head on over to the girlfriend-store. Pick one out, bring her up to the cashier, get the extended warranty, the whole deal. This will be great! Everyone says so!!!

&amp;#x200B;

But not so fast. There's no such thing as a girlfriend store. Getting a girlfriend is going to be a bit tougher than getting some guacamole. I'm going to have to be charming, or sexy, or interesting, or super humorous. My awkwardness will also repel them. And that deep desire I now have will dramatically hinder my chances. They can smell my desperation under the layers of humor I try and wrap it under. The interactions I've had with them have made it pretty clear: they are just not interested me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well that sucks. Everyone I know is experiencing what is apparently the most wonderful thing in the history of ever. But some personality defects in me keep me from experiencing that. Everyone else at the table has their guacamole, but I don't cause I didn't ask for it correctly...or something. Hell I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever. I can live without. I still get sad a lot, but I don't take it out on others. (At least, I hope I don't). Nobody ever said life was fair. There are kids in Africa being born with AIDS. My little problem is kind of petty compared to that. I'm an adult living a fairly comfortable life. All in all, I don't have much too complain about really. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I still have this desire. And I don't think I can just will it away or anything. I can try to ignore it. But unless I live the life of a complete hermit, eventually I'll hear someone say ""My SO is just the best thing ever!! I love them so much!! Hey, you should get yourself a girlfriend!  Your life will be so much better!"" So now that desire has been reinforced. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when I see someone on an advice forums or something say, ""Stop putting so much emphasis on relationships"", it's not just me doing that. ",lonely,"""Stop putting so much emphasis on relationships"" rebuttal/rant",2019-01-29 10:03:10

It takes time to find out If other people are your true friends but sometimes you just know If someone is for you.

We all need friends..we all need someone to talk to.I get messages from other redditors every once in a while but some of them disappear and with most of them I just don't get along but we don't always get along with others because we can't please everyone.I'm different than most people because I don't really care if your interests are the same as mine and I don't want to talk only about common interests.I want to find someone with the same personality type.

I need someone who knows how to keep a conversation going and who'll always be here for me

I put others first If they're important to me

I want to talk to someone honest.I'm not into short meaningless and shallow conversations.I want to find my happiness..And I don't care about your interests

It doesn't matter to me If you like different kind of music than I do If you're a good person

I honestly want to give up sometimes but maybe there's still someone for me :) You never know.You can't see the future

I have a lot of free time because I don't have any friends in real life,I'm jobless and I'm able to talk on a daily basis.I want to talk to people who want to talk to me daily but only if they want to talk to others,everyday.I would never force anyone to be here for me and I don't want to talk to anyone out of pity.

We should stay true to ourselves. Everyone is dealing with their own set of problems,their expectations,their rules. We have to find for our dreams if we want to achieve something.I really want to change my current situation.

Good friends are hard to find but life is a huge surprise.What makes a true friend? No one wants to be friendless. A good friendship is **based on give and take.**

I'm a very talkative person and my messages are usually long because I want to express myself.I want you to know me better.If you don't have any friends and need someone to talk to I'm here for you and always will be.Our personalities just have to be compatible

PS.I'm a huge animal lover

I'd love to meet someone who wants to find the same thing.Don't be afraid to open up.I'm a good litener and a good talker.I love long messages and I'd love to help myself by helping others :)

Stay true to yourself.Good friends are hard to find but true friends accept you for who you are.They don't try to change you.

Don't ever give up and fight for your dreams.I don't believe in my luck,anymore but I don't want to give up.The best way to find friends is to meet as many people as possible and then mutually choose the ones that best fit your personality and requirements,seriously

**Close friends support you through thick and thin.**

* I'm into long messages
* I'd love to talk to someone on a daily basis to (At least one message once a day) If you want to be my friend try to make time for me.Friends **make time for each other**
* I want to talk on reddit first to get to know you better
* I don't talk to people underage and people way older than me because it makes me feel uncomfortable (18-29 age limit)

Some people don't want to open up because they don't want us to judge them.Words can be really hurtful.I'm not perfect and I'm not world's most tolerant person but I try to understand people's problems so if you want to get something off your chest I'm here for you.

94,MrAMGamer,1548682776,1,"I've never talked about this before, but I need to let this go to hopefully not feel this way anymore. 

I recognized that I was lonely about a year ago. It has been a dark time, especially since I don't live in a place with people around my age. The problem is what I've recognized how defensive I've become during this time. 

None of my friends from college talk to me unless I start the conversation, and I haven't been in a relationship for three years, which ended horribly and during the worst times of my life. Since then, I have become cynical and defensive, which is making it difficult to reach out to anyone. This feeling of defense is destroying me, making me a bitter asshole who doesn't feel that any relationship will ever be meaningful in life. I hate living like this. 

For anyone who has/is going through this, how do you cope with it? For anyone who hasn't felt this way, I hope you never do.

I live with my dad but he often works or goes to spend the night with my mom even though they’re divorced. I have no one to talk to about my emotions and even though I have good friends none of them are the type of person I could turn to if I needed anything. Even when my dad is here we don’t get along and even though I crave human touch of any kind I never really receive any. To try and hug my dad would be super weird because we haven’t hugged in probably 7 years.  

I have a tinder but I come off too strong and always fuck it up. Being average looking and 5’5  with 0 self confidence makes it impossible to meet anyone on campus or in person at all. It’s not that I’m too scared to approach a female I just don’t want her to think that I approached her cause I figured she’d find me attractive and her respond poorly to that. Even when I’m on campus I rarely speak to anyone. I don’t talk to my class mates unless I’m in my lab where we only even have time to talk about science. Like I said my friends are kind of shitheads and don’t even go to college near me so I rarely see them st all. I’ve been feeling super anxious for no reason to to the point where I just wanna stay in my house in my room. I feel scared to go into public and idk why. I’m not scared to see others or communicate with people but I don’t feel safe unless I’m at home in my room.

97,WhiteAsianHybrid,1548662681,1,"This might be kind of odd for this sub, but I feel very lonely. I see people at school, but I just have had fallout with friends in the past, or I just can’t connect with people on a better level than just “acquaintance” (for the most part). 

I’m looking for a bro to talk about bro things. I’m 19 years old, soon to graduate high school. I’m planning on enlisting in the US Marine Corps after graduation. I love bands like American Football, Mineral, and Penfold, although I listen to other alternative and indie artists a lot. 

I live in Asia and love niche manga and TV shows. For example, for manga I love Oyasumi Punpun and I Am a Hero, for TV shows, I love the Big Lez Show, that recently ended. 

I also love movies. I like movies like Drive, The Place Beyond the Pines, the original Spider-Man trilogy, Treasure Planet, and Saving Private Ryan. 

Probably the oddest thing about me is that I feel lonely, but I don’t really plan on staying that way. I don’t want to sink into depression. I try to better myself physically, mentally, and spiritually. I value people and relationships over all other things.

The only difference is the mean things I said weren’t true about my SO but what they said about me were.  

I’m lonely, I only have one real friend and they’re not always around as they have their own life. No one ever hits me up and If I’m not working I’d be home watching tv or reading.  Sometimes I’ll join my SO and hang with their friends but at the end they’re not my friends.  It’s hard for me since my SO’s phone is constantly going off because they’re always talking to people. Wether it be work, their group of friends locally or virtually (they play FFXIV) or computer friends. 

It’s my fault though, I don’t really try to make friends.  I guess it’s because I’m an introvert and being around people feels exhausting sometimes.  I hate being alone but sometimes I don’t and long for company from other or just wanting people to want me back.   Sometimes this loneliness just feeds into my depression which makes it worse.

Interestingly, I find that the longer I have been lonely, in a way the easier it has become to deal with the loneliness. This is because when you are alone for many years, over time you will forget the wonderful feelings you get from  meaningful relationships. You will slowly adjust to being alone and it will become your new normal. You know that you’re alone but you forget exactly how amazing it is to be close to another human, to be vulnerable, to love another being with everything you’ve got.

my current problems are the most pressing, but thats not to say that my past doesnt haunt my every waking (and dreaming) moment

lets start at the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

this summer, most of my family got sick- myself included. i just had strep. my other family was bombarded with numerous deadly conditions and im honestly shocked that they're not dead by now. 

while this was going on, my girlfriend was pissed at me for not making any moves on her to progress our relationship and not asking her out on dates or not caring about her (i loved her a lot, but i was physically unable to do anything because of my depression and illness). she didn't care that i was sick in bed. she wanted attention. she wanted me at school. she wanted from me but never gave.

school started. we broke up. she outed me and bullied me and ridiculed me, and now the entire school knows most of my secrets.

i've been shattered ever sense. 

i feel like a shell of a human. i cant classify myself as anything other than broken. I have no purpose. i am empty. i dont love. i crave attention to see if i can finally feel something. any fucking thing. i used to be so reserved but ive changed. i seek the love i know ill never recieve. i'm different, but i havent changed. i dont know. im honestly just so done and alone and confused. 

school fucking sucks, i have no friends, everbody knows im gay even though i deny it because i can never have any secrets literally ever.

 

and that's the backstory to who i am right now. a loveless shell with a name.

my problems right now? I have nobody to talk to about any of it. 

for a while i thought i could tell my sister or my best friend, but im too horrible to them. I constantly give and do everything for them because im a clingy bastard but honestly i know that if i was gone theyd be fine.

im not even my best friends best friend, she has a list of like eight.

i'm not sure if im trans or not.

im not sure if i want to be alive or not. 

i have a huge ass presentation in front of 400 people tomorrow but i dont have my speech memorized and i have no public speaking experience.

&amp;#x200B;

nobody understands how ive felt. nobody ever will. my ex kinda did, but she would also always get mad at me for my issues. i feel that i wasnt good enough for her but i also know she was horrible to me. but regardless i seek validation from a shitty forums website. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

honestly, im really close to snapping and running off into the woods to drown.

127,MIL3SIAN,1548601500,1,"Created a Reddit account for this.  Will try not to get into too much detail. Hoping I can get some like-minded advice as this is a pretty unique situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been pursuing my dream job since 10th grade, finished high school last year and made enough to get my own place in a new city with less crime (Cape Town). I work from home and I don't have any friends or family here. I don't speak to anyone from high school because I didn't have any close friends there to begin with. They all have their own lives now and hardly any of them replied when I tried asking them how things are going. So be it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've spent two months on my own trying to figure out everything from cooking to paying bills, I think I have my life in order and I'm doing great financially. Through this time I haven't noticed until recently that I have not spoken to a single person outside of cashiers at the grocery store and the delivery guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have a decent social life. No super close friends but enough ""friends"" that I always had something to do and someone to hang out with. Not having a girlfriend is what's hitting me most, because nothing compares to how happy that makes me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I don't really have any hobbies outside of playing the occasional game on my Xbox and an interest in fashion. So I don't have the means of finding a ""meetup of like minded people"" type thing. People who typically play games aren't the type of people I enjoy hanging out with (personal preference) so that's out of question. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has left me wondering how the hell I'm supposed to make friends, never mind find a girlfriend. I'm too young to go to bars and most social settings are for adults, I'm 19.

I met this amazing, beautiful girl, basically my dream come true. She has a boyfriend tho but they are in the process of breaking up. I thought she really liked me too, but I guess I was wrong again because she already has someone else. 

I just don’t know what’s wrong with me... 
Why am I not love able? Am I that ugly? Am I that dull? It’s this constant up and down between telling myself that it’ll happen soon and just nights where I lose all faith and can’t go on anymore.

Anyways; 

The hardest part about being in your young to mid 20’s ; is finding someone who has the same interests as you. 

When everyone is set on doing one task and you just cannot fathom doing that task. 

I hate alcohol. Hate partying. And hate going out clubbing and bar hopping. 

I don’t know if I hate partying out of pure spite that people have friends and are having fun and I never got to experience that. But I also know, that my social anxiety will never allow me to enjoy that. 

Now,  I do know I hate alcohol. It’s absolutely disgusting , in my opinion. 

But 

*Everyone is so engulfed in the South with drinking their life away and going out. 

*Finding someone who doesn’t party or drink ; is harder than finding “a needle in a haystack” 

*Seriously, does no one have future plans? Do people generally love just blowing their money on not remembering anything? 

*There’s so many women dropping their kids off to go party. So many men ignoring their kids to go party. 

*No friends. Hard to find a relationship. No one to turn to. No one to talk to. 

——————————————-

(Before I get too deep, yes I am focused on me and my childs future, But it gets hard when you have no emotional , moral or mental support or just even someone to vibe with) 

Let’s start off by saying; in no way am I a manly man. I’m a little soft hearted bitch at times and get beyond lonely all the time when my child isn’t here. 

I am a 23 y/o male; with a beautiful 3 y/o little girl. Me and the mother have separated a long while back for the sake of our child, but unfortunately since then; having friends or even a relationship has been a journey. Even before my child; I’ve never been adapt to the party scene, drinking, or anything like that. I’ve always been one for deep discussion, conspiracies, nature, and more. Being 23; even at 22,21,20,19,18 and so on; and hating the culture that I’ve grew up around; has always made it difficult to find friends and relationships. I get classified as boring or I really don’t stick around to find out. I’m very picky when it comes to a relationship. I don’t want a girl who parties, goes out or drinks. I might as well settle for a 85 year old woman at this point. I feel like I’m very much different from the society I grow up in today. I shelter myself because I enjoy it. But I am growing miserable with the pure silence since my ex and child no longer live with me. I see my child on the weekends, but during those times she’s not here, I am on the near edge of break downs. I’ve met women since then, but they seem to always be married, have a boyfriend, liars , cheaters, or just drop me with no explanation in general. I’ve tried to make friends and well...I get left on read constantly; even just with friends. It sucks .. really does .. feel different from society .. no one giving you a chance because of your interests conflicting with theirs. They label you as boring or a weirdo.

I'm sorry if this isn't the correct Reddit to ask this on, but I don't have anyone IRL to talk to this about. I'm a sophomore in HS and I used to have a pretty okay social life but ever since last summer I haven't hung out with people outside of school. Needless to say, socializing and talking to girls is not one of my strong suits, and I feel a little pathetic talking to my friends about it so that's why I came here.

So as a question to guys and (mostly) girls, what should I do? I don't know what to say and I get really nervous especially if its a girl I like. I know the basics of being respectful and all, but I can't seem to break the ""friend"" barrier. All my friends my age talk to girls all the time on FT and in real life, so I feel a little behind.

It's almost 5pm on a Saturday and I haven't got any idea what to do or where to go. I drove out of town to see a live show and came back home this morning. The whole time I was away, I was alone with no one to talk to. I stopped into a bar next to the venue and didn't know what to do with myself. It's the same thing when I am back home. I don't know where to go, where I won't feel awkward and out of place. I have always struggled with meeting new people and talking to strangers, so I just fail completely at making friends or getting dates.

My days off are spent at home, mostly in front of the TV or laying in bed. I would love to go do something, if only there was something that appealed to me. I don't care for crowded places, I get too self-conscious and begin to feel uncomfortable. It's like it has gotten worse and worse as I have gotten older.

I cone from a fairly wealthy family. My father started off at the bottom and became a very wealthy man with an amazing executive position and a major company. I go to a good school and have been told I'm quite attractive. But I've always felt like no one is really my friend. 

Even the people closest to me feel so distant and sometimes I feel so lonely I push them away for no reason. They're great people and I feel worthless compared to them, but they like me. I consistently wonder whether it's all some elaborate pity ploy because I'm really pathetic, but that's unrealistic, people don't care about me that much.

I'm terrified I'll never be able to follow in my father's footsteps and I'll live and die in his shadow. My father is amazing, and I want to give back what my family has given to me. I want to provide for them and show them that I was worth it. He is successful, smart, innovative, and influential. I want to show him how I've learned from him and how I too can make my own success.
  
I feel like I'll grow up being a nobody with no friends, completely alone in a decent house on a street named something generic. I can crack a joke and get barrels of laughter, I can hang out with my friends and they leave telling me they'll can't wait to see me again, but I don't know why, I don't feel like I'm all that funny or special.

I struggle to control my emotions and sometimes find myself lashing out for reasons I later can't understand. I feel like such a burden on the great people that surround me, I am their tumour. How do people put up with me?

I can't help but feel terrible, yet I have a life that so many people dream of. I have no right to be feeling this way but I'm here making this post. I wish I had some magic answer for why I feel like this, but maybe that's just my twisted desperation hoping my suffering isn't a result of my own instability.

If I died tomorrow I be sad, but not because I'd dead, because the people around me would mourn me while I'm undeserving of such. Has anyone here found the cure for chronic worthlessness?

No one has ever given me a chance though, and the more you get denied it just keeps getting harder and harder to gather up the courage to ask anyone out.

I understand that I have to be more outgoing, it's something I've been told my entire life, at the same time I feel like that's not who I am and if I have to put on this act of being outgoing it's not someone liking me for who I am as a person.

I'm just so sick of being alone all the time. When I'm not at my crummy job in a kitchen I'm just sitting at home or at the gym by myself. I mention my job because that's the one place I feel like I have friends. It's embarrassing to be 30 and working in a kitchen, but it's hard to leave when I feel like that's the only group of people I have. The one girl I work with is also the reason I'm writing all this out. I get along with her amazing and we've always been close. She's the one person in my life I feel relaxed around and as if I can just be myself around her and I can just talk to her without feeling anxiety. I tried telling her how I feel and she didn't feel the same way back. I know she'll never feel that way about me, but I can't get over her. It's something I think of each day and is constantly adding to my feeling of loneliness. 

I just want someone in my life.

Currently I have two best friends. One that goes to an uni 3 hours away (let's call them S) and one that lives 4 minutes from me (and B) . I've been best friends with S for probably a little over 2 years and B for about half a year. Ever since they started uni, I see them maybe 30 to 40 times a year. We plan to move a major city close by in a few years and we usually don't have problems. The only issue is I don't  see S that much, and we just don't talk too much, that's just how we are.

The issue has been with B. I see them almost every single day because I drive them to school and work. That'll change when get get their car insured but I don't mind most of the time. Lately I've been confronting them about how little they seem to care about being around me either hanging out or being their chauffeur. When I do that, or confront them basically about anything, they always turn it into a heated argument. I know they didn't grow up in a great family. They get in arguments with their parents and is neglected a lot. I just don't know how much longer I can deal with having to deal with all the drama that's caused. In the course of about 3 months, I've been loaning then money and I've gone as far as to sign up with my family's phone plan just so they can have a contract with AT&amp;T. As of right now, they owe me just a little over $500 and I've probably helped them pay for three times that amount.

I'm in probably over $4,000 in debt right now. No one knows that. As far as anyone knows, I owe just a little over $1,500. They're ok with me spending less money on them because they understand the situation.

Funny enough, they're not the first person I've spent thousands on. It's how I was raised. That's how my panrets show their affection for me. In the past 3 years, I've spent well over 40,000. I'm only 20. I'm more than positive over half of that has been on someone.

I'm just tired. I can't just leave my friend B because I care about them too much. And as much as they frustrate me... They need me as much as I need them. ",lonely,Lost in the pursuit,2019-01-26 13:37:29

173,bioacidshock97,1548459065,1,"Ay. Got no one to vent to, and figured a nice text block may be in order.   


My life is pretty... packed. I've got two jobs, a mother I look after as a full time carer, and I'm an undergrad (third year) on top of all that. Despite it all, I'm full of ambition, full of drive, and it's pretty difficult for me to stop working at trying to be better and better. Self-improvement is definitely my thing, yet there's always something so huge and impossible to overcome for me despite it all.  


Loneliness.  


It's something that started to be a huge problem after my last major relationship, about 3 years ago. It was great - we were together for two years, nothing special, but it was my real first experience of what a 'soul mate' was like, I feel like it started there, after.  


Ever since, I've craved human contact, emotional dependancy, and generally just having someone that close to me. Back then, when my life was arguably more chaotic, it really held me together. It was great. These days, that deep desire for someone to hold close is something that makes me feel so low when I'm unable to quench it. I'll get so depressed for days at a time over the most minuscule of things - from a date not going well, to feelings not being reciprocated, and so on.   


It's not like I've had nothing since - I've had a few FwB situations, shorter hook-ups and dates, but nothing like that one 3 years ago, and yet it's as if I wouldn't have the time to have a full relationship anyway. So, why does it make me so sad? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been sure, but the feelings that stem from my loneliness are ones I've never been able to settle. It's always there, and so, distracting myself completely from it and suppressing such feelings have been the only way forward. I have too much going on to ever address it, yet, even after today for example, where I've been planning to meet his girl IRL after talking for ages, that she's turned around and revealed she's hooking up with a guy before we were. I'm not angry at her, and we were planning to meet as friends.   


Still, a small part of me hoped that maybe something could hit off? That was enough, and thus, I'm here sulking like a fucking idiot, and my thoughts are spiralling into things far more depressing. All these feelings are suddenly returning, and yet tomorrow I'll forget it all, and end up forgetting for the next few weeks.   


Not sure if it's ever something I'll be able to overcome. Maybe it's because I'm quite an emotionally dependant guy? Maybe it's a complex? Who knows. It's fine when it's not all in my head, but during times like this, it pretty much paralyses me. It makes me feel so low and undesirable, yet I know that's not true, and I know things are fine in actuality. It's still there, though, regardless.   


It's an integral need for a partner - not just friends, but someone to be so close to, share warmth and comfort with, console with, and to make said person happy as fuck - all that cheesy, spunky bullshit. I love it, and I guess I still really miss it, even after all this time. Can't get my head away from it once it all surfaces. Nothing really does the trick except obtaining what I want. Without it, I can only suppress these feelings.  


r/lonely, how do I cope with this? Is there a way to finally file this need away? Even when I'm aiming to pursue a masters degree, learn all these things, and make myself the best I can be, I can still never get away from this hopeless complex of mine. Any advice? Similar woes?

174,DeputyShotVideo,1548458211,1,"I have extreme social anxiety thanks to childhood bullying and abuse. It's so bad that I've even forgotten how to show emotion, so everyone just thinks that I'm completely apathetic and they never have any sympathy. Even on the rare occasion that someone asks if I want to be included, my mom (she especially was always emotionally controlling) just butts in and says ""oh don't worry about him he doesn't like socializing"", even though she knows how lonely I really am.

One particular family from church is like this. They'll always get into conversations with my parents while I have to sit and watch, frustrated. Their kids will greet them, but they'll only smile politely at me if I'm lucky enough to be noticed. This past Sunday, they invited my parents over, and the only reason I got to go is that my parents went there straight from church. Of course, my parents got all the attention while I rotted on the couch, watching TV. Then when we left, I heard the wife tell my mom, ""Sorry about DeputyShotVideo, I was going to give him our wi-fi"". First off, why not just tell it to me? I was sitting right there. Second off, when you have a guest, you don't just throw them onto your Internet and be done with them. Third off, again, she's around my age and she's talking about me like I'm two. I'm angry at the circumstances, not the family (not their fault I'm broken), but she was being incredibly rude with that statement.

It's really humiliating and hurtful that all I am to these people is my parents' weird son. I know that the only thing I can do about it is to just suck it up and initiate a conversation with one of them. I'm really considering it the next time I see them, but just the thought of it makes me hyperventilate and my hands start to shake.

Compatibility is more important than I first thought. I don't trust you, even if I wanted to. I don't think anyone would be this way if they had a choice.

198,Imthatguy0029,1548371670,1,"Hi guys. It's been a slow day.

Woke up around 5am, walked in the pouring rain to grab a coffee and reach a bus stop at 6, to arrive at college by 8 for a class. It ended at 9:15 and I went and just did a few school related things to settle down the semester until another class started at 11. That was a tough class, and they're using some mcgrawhill Connect online thing so it sounds like Im forced to pay for an expensive book with money that doesn't exist, on top of whatever other academic costs there are this semester. Sadly found out the bus leaves 2 min before class ends at 12:15, so I waited around until the next came around 1pm. In the middle of getting home, I have to transfer to another bus, but it never came so I had to wait a total of an hour in a crowded, humid area with ppl asking me for change. Once I finally got home by 3pm, I was drenched. Everything in my backpack was wet, and my pants look like I stepped out of a pool. My shoes will still be soaked through tomorrow. Nothing healthy to eat, my mom bought Chinese food again. The house is also a cluttered mess due to us emptying a storage cuz we're low on money. Went to go play Eve: Online, a spaceship game just to get killed the moment I got on unluckily by a guy who was cloaked(hidden) in a weird spot and just came back from a smoke break. Switched to league of legends, lost a game before it even started cuz people chose characters that were too tough for them to use or just bad. So now I'm downstairs to get away from everything and sit on here cuz I got no one to talk to. Commenting on other people's posts and trying to make them feel better usually helps me feel better about myself.

It's not that I'm so lonely I can't take it- granted I have those times where it does feel that way. Honestly, I feel like I have it better than a lot of people on here. Maybe that's harder for me to judge than I realize. I don't hang with anyone in school. I don't know how to approach a girl I want to talk to without feeling like a weirdo (also, she's been around some other dude so it's hard to catch her alone). I sit around listening to music or watching anime on a bus all day. 5 days a week this is my life.

I don't know where I'm going with all of this. I appreciate anyone listening. Sure it's been a tough day, but i don't care all too much. I want you guys to stay encouraged. Message me to talk, about whatever you feel like talking about. I'm gonna go look through more posts to see if I can lend some helpful advice or make someone feel better who deserves it (almost everyone deserves it haha)

TL;DR - it's been a slow, difficult day for me, but it doesn't matter as long as I can help someone here out. Try to have a great day guys",lonely,Just a Rainy Day,2019-01-25 10:14:30

Either, if they are 18 I start thinking I missed out or if they are 20s I feel I will be too inexperienced to even date now or girls won't like me if they got to know me. 

Envy does us harm, so I am trying to prevent it from getting to me deeply. I know why I am not in a relationship and feeling quite lonely and that is my lack of socialisation and meeting new people. So, I am working on that.

I see many pretty girls with nerdy guys too (I don't want to sound conceited here but I am a bit nerdy, but would consider myself the handsome type). I just think, ""how did they manage to get that girl?"". And the answer to that is probably the fact that they just go out more often than me.

I also see posts about couples talking about their sexual activities on /r/sex or success stories on /r/dating and it just seems like they get it so easy, and I'm here with no female friends even in my social circle. ",lonely,I am starting to feel some jealousy...,2019-01-25 02:02:01

Over the last few years  i have gradually changed my outlook, i realised i was telling myself i was okay with all that as i am scared of letting anyone in, i have some friends i would call brothers, we would die for each other, they accept i am awkward and have problems saying exactly how I feel, yet they have never turned their backs on me.
I lost my job and have had trouble finding a new one, but that was okay as i convince myself i will find one in time.

I met a girl, fell for her, she fell for me, we had a relationship after knowing one another for 8months, it was long distance and i devoted everything to getting to her, not just a visit, but to move to her.
She left me as December began, said she needed space and time, then she said she didn't know how to be my friend, then stopped talking me and eventually blocked me on WhatsApp and deleted my number. 
I miss her.

Over the last few weeks a lifetime of feeling alone, unwanted, awkward, unable to be myself for fear of rejection and ridicule...everything that i have bottled up and put aside has hit me.

I was so excited to go, I had a vision in my head that it’s a fresh start and I can meet new people and get a whole new friendship group with like minded people. It’ll be ok because there’ll be people my age there, i can join a mature student society and it’ll be so much fun and life changing.

The reality is far from that. There is barely anyone my age there and all the other students have big friendship groups and spend all their time together. There is one person who I hang around with while I’m there but aside from that she’s clearly not interested in spending time with me and I do not want to be the clingy friend that asks her to hang out all the time.

My housemates aren’t really that friendly/sociable either. Well two of them were already really good friends so they just hang out with each other. The other one goes home to see her boyfriend every weekend.

222,Pikabluee,1548299659,1,"I’m about to be 21 years old in a little over a week and I’ve never dated anyone, had sex, not had someone love me romantically. 

I’m so tired of wondering what it’s all like, being jealous of people, having to turn away when a couple is holding hands, kissing, calling each other playful names. I’m tired of getting advice from people that have already done those things and then saying “You just haven’t found the right one yet.” or “There’s no rush.” or “Society makes it into a big deal.”

I don’t give a fuck what society thinks. When you’ve lived more than two decades and you’ve never had genuine love for someone and especially never had someone genuinely love you, how the fuck do you think I would feel? I’m so sick of being a fucking virgin that I sometimes wish I could meet someone I trust and have them take it from me so I can know how it feels. 

In this stage in a human being’s life, that’s what most would crave. People that have had sex are still telling me I shouldn’t rush and all this bullshit when they have enjoyed it themselves and experienced it. They don’t feel the pain and frustration that I do.

It’s like being a millionaire and telling a poor person “Money isn’t everything,”

I hate going through my days and going through hard days, wishing I had someone to cuddle with or even text me that they love me sometimes. This fucking generation just wants hook-ups and doesn’t give a fuck about getting to know me first. 

What if I become 25 and I’m still a virgin or even still without ever having a relationship? 30? 40? 50? I don’t see myself ever having anyone. I don’t know if I’m picky or unlucky or if I’m just too different and not compatible with most people. I’m so sick of it. 

The only place I can meet people is on tinder and those people are sick and shallow. 

I try to put myself out there but don’t know how. I just keep to myself a lot. But I sometimes just sit in my room, wishing someone would just randomly come over and visit me or ask me out somewhere. 

I don’t get how some people do it. How people have been having relationships since like 15. I don’t understand what they’re doing to have people actually falling head over heels for them at least a little. 

Every birthday I have is another year without someone. It’s not even fun getting older anymore. It makes me feel old as shit.

One of the basic elements of human existence I haven’t even experienced.

People say you have to learn to love yourself and be comfortable being alone. Okay but humans are social animals. Most of us don’t want to be alone too much. My desire to have someone in my life is valid. 

It makes me feel like someone is wrong with me. I ask myself sometimes “Why me?”. Guys have told me I’m pretty, funny, smart, etc. Friends have told me the same. I don’t get what I’m doing wrong. The guys that show a serious interest in me, I have little to no interest in them. Every single time I pursue a guy, it ends in disappointment and embarrassment.

I'm not that overly sensitive person when it comes to being alone. I actually quite enjoy it most of the time. I'm an extrovert with a tendency to stay alone. Wich means that I have no problem approaching people, but I don't run after conversations. If I had to describe myself I'd even go as far as to call myself entertaining when needed but quiet otherwise.
However, as much as I enjoy being alone, there are moments in wich I dread it. When noone responds. Everyone's busy and noone thinks about you. And you can't even blame them. I think that drags me down so much because throughout my life, I've never really had friends. A few here and there that vanished before I could notice. But I do have one friend that stuck around. Don't know what I'd do without him. I sometimes think that if I didn't have him as a friend I'd go insane. You probably know that feeling, when you have so many people around you, but noone seems to matter to you.

That feeling took it's highlight a few weeks ago. I'm currently in an apprenticeship. Me and the other apprentices have a whatsapp group for information and casual talk. At the end of december one of them asked the group to go to the christmas market in the city. Meeting in seven hours, drink something, have some fun, etc.
I replied with an 'ok'. Several hours pass and I drive down to the city and start waiting for the rest to show up. Ten minutes. Fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes. I send the group a message. ""Where are you?"". No response. Another thirty minutes pass and one after another says that they can't come. I'm asking the one, whose idea it was to come out in the first place ""you're coming though, right?"". No response. The last person of the group says he doesn't have time and guess who came out of hiding. The one with the idea. Letting me stand there for almost an hour before telling me that she won't come.

Sounds like something that can happen, I know. But stuff like that happened to me all my life. I'm surprised if anyone shows up everytime. I've also never been invited anywhere. If someone asked me to go somewhere it was always after someone else was invited while I was in earshot. It was always a mercy invite.

But back to the point. I've gotten used to that. I rarely, if ever go out outside of work. And that works just fine for me. But I sometimes feels that thorn in my chest. That damned feeling, or rather realization of being alone. If I wanted to talk to someone right now, I'd be fucked. If I wanted to do something, I'd have to do it alone. You get the point. I don't get it. I like myself and I like the company I can give myself. So why do I still feel this ache in my chest?

Sometimes you give it a try, sometimes you don't. When you message them, that kind of relationship will die out with time eventually. You know they don't really care, because they never message first.

Same thing if you meet someone irl. Even if you have a good time once or twice, it never lasts.

It's boggling my mind right now what a situation it is. How many variables are there taking part in this? How many things lining up such that one is so physically, socially, emotionally isolated? It's ridiculous!

And the intensity and magnitude of the situation! I literally have no one to speak to. No other being to communicate with. It's such a feeling! My brain doesn't know how to process it. Is there even anything  to process? I'm going to lose it at this rate.

Even here, posting this, it feels like shouting into the void. Maybe a few upvotes and comments. A shred of interaction trickling back from the abyss. Maybe this will be a popular post - but even then, what is the result? A few morsels of acknowledgement from the world, glimpses of how it could be. Swiftly back into isolation.

Thus the realisation that there is no true respite. No escape. Alas even within a community of lonely people, we are still lonely people. Together, individually.

Recently my husband has been having some... issues? He lies, basically. And drinks too much. His job is very social and he's constantly meeting new people and the like. I've decided to leave him emotionally, until I can figure out my next step. I don't really have any friends where we used to live, so I guess I'm just isolated as a whole.

249,Express_Watercress,1548250532,1,"No matter what I do or where I go, I feel like I'm intruding.

This goes way back, back to my middle school days (over 10 years ago). I really should be over it by now, but instead of dealing with it, I've just pushed it down. Over and over again, just like any healthy person does /s

I was with my so-called 'friends' after school. I'd gone off to the bathroom, and as I was coming back I overheard those words. ""Things would be so much better if \[my name\] wasn't here."" I don't remember what my other friend said, but it was something about me doing all the work when we had group assignments.

I think that day a part of me died. These people had been my 'friends' for years, or at least I thought they were. They'd just been using me, and I'd been too blind to see it.

I started spending more and more time alone. I found a kind of safety in indifference. If I didn't let anyone near me, then no one could hurt me.

The rest of school, it was easy. I would sit in the back of the classroom and throw myself into my schoolwork, and at recess and lunch I would escape into whatever book I was reading. A fake world was less painful than the real world. To be honest, it still is.

At university it was even easier. I would just go to class, and then go home. I didn't even know most of my classmates' names. And until now, it was easy at work too. I'd just show up, do my work and go home. I was working on my own most of the time, so it was easier still.

But now that I'm here, in my new job (\~1 year), I don't know what's changed. I guess being around the same people day after day, it's getting harder to maintain that wall of indifference. Or maybe I've been lonely for so long that I just can't keep it contained any more. I want to have friends, but the thought of letting my guard down scares me.

Either way, my social skills have atrophied past the point of no return, so I guess it's pointless to even care about any of this. Nothing will ever change.

A kinda preachy, pitying tone, sometimes condescending, usually offering some sort of trivial ""solution"" to people's issues. I think this is quite disrespectful to those who come here genuinely to vent or share their experiences.

So often I come to this subreddit and the first thing I see in response to someone's heartfelt post is some armchair psychologist swooping in with some semi-spiritual wannabe-Sigmund-Freud quote, dismissing everything the OP said. For example today I see a post about someone who didn't feel important to anyone and the first comment is one sentence of some almost philosophically oxymoronic stuff like ""focus less on what you do for others and more on what others do for you"" (but much more condescending and abstract - you can probably guess the post I'm referring to). *Clearly* everyone else follows that advice and that's why the OP is lonely and others aren't. Does the poster of that comment follow that advice? It's simply not helpful.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure if you are someone who posts these responses you are trying to help, but I'm also sure this is not the kind of responses people here will benefit from hearing. The same dead horse discussion about shitty ""normie"" mental health advice applies here too. Throwing out some 2-second ""just do X and Y"" response does not fix anything. It doesn't conjure up a friend or fill a deep emotional hole. Invalidating someone's experiences and evaluations of those experiences especially does not help.

First semester started of quite ok. I made a couple of close friends and we ended up forming a friend group. We hung out, drank, ate out, and I even smoked weed for the first time with them. But then some drama happened between people and we all kind of went our separate ways. Second semester was lackluster. I hung out with some people on my floor, but we never really did anything other than do homework together in the common area or watch sports on tv. I never really saw most of the members of old friend group after that, but that really didn’t bother me. 
Third semester comes around and I start to feel good again. New semester, new me, and a fresh start to finding friends. I got into a new, more modern dorm building and couldn’t wait to meet new people. It wasn’t what I thought it was going to be. 
No one really comes into the common area, and everyone kind of just stays in their room. I thought, maybe this semester I’ll meet new people in my classes. I managed to become friends with this one guy in chemistry. We were lab partners and we also had a psychology class we were taking together. I thought we’d be good friends, but I was wrong. Whenever I asked him if he wanted to get something to eat, or to just hang out, he said he was doing something with his other friends. Later in the semester, he tells me that him and his friends are planning on getting an apartment. I low key got jealous since he was a freshman and managed to get a good friend group and I am still stuck with just acquaintances. I tried joining some clubs as people would say to do if they want to make friends, but the people in the clubs I joined already had their friend groups figured out. At meetings, I would just be the one guy in the back with no friends while everyone else is chatting up with their friend groups. I became jealous, depressed, and lonely. On weekends I stay in my room all day. I manage to keep in touch with my friends from high school on discord and we would get together to play video games for hours on end. Gaming with them is the only time where I don’t feel lonely. But I get jealous every time they can’t play because they are hanging out with their other friends. How come they can make stable friendships while I can’t. I’m stuck with acquaintences who just want to be friends for the sake of the class or lab and have nothing to do with me after. I try to vent to my parent about this, but all they say is that I’m there to study, not to make friends. While that is the case, I can’t help but feel jealous of all my friends back home and also my cousins. All my cousins who are in college, or have graduated college, have made the best friends of their lives there. They tell me stories of partying, or getting or taking road trips with what they call their lifelong friends.

So she moves on from me instantly, joining another group of friends, which is understandable. But ever since we stopped talking, every time I’ve thought of her I’ve had the feeling of being punched in the gut.

A few weeks ago I apologised to her, I started off with a simple “I miss you and I’m sorry”. She screenshotted it and sent it to my old friends who she’s now close with. So I sent her a lengthy text saying “ there’s no need to show everyone what I sent, I want to have a 1 to 1 conversation and make up” But guess what... yep she screenshotted that aswell and sent it around. 

We were just such good friends before and I just fucked it up by being so jealous of her. I just want to be everyone’s best friend, and even though she was my best friend, I know I wasn’t hers. Just like everyone I know.",lonely,I seriously just want to die,2019-01-23 17:11:35

On top of that, I feel so socially deprived. I lost an amazing loved one and nothing compares to the way we used to talk. He didn’t even have to touch me, his words were enough to drive me wild when he wanted and soothe me when I was upset. I miss him so much. Everyone else sounds like a distant mosquito buzzing in an empty room. He was the only one I had meaningful conversations with. Every conversation now feels shallow. It’s almost more fulfilling to sit in silence and imagine a better conversation in my head. 

I’ve been all kinds of distraught lately. I get lost easily, I’m never fully in the present, I can’t focus, I’m not hungry anymore, and I cry around once a day. This has been going on for around 3 months, with a few 1-2 week breaks in between.

274,throwaway126372,1548200891,1,"I feel deeply unlovable. And this is probably going to be one big fat “woe is me” diatribe but...I’m just done. I’m angry, hurt, frustrated, and lonely and just...done. I don’t really know where to begin. It’s really as simple as “no one likes me, and the loneliness is crushing”.

My mother has severe untreated mental illness, and has been emotionally abusive all my life. Lately, she most enjoys spending her days sending me scathing hate mail (particularly on holidays, or when she knows I have an exam coming up). Without any response from me to fuel this. It’s been 2 years of no contact on my end. She actively tries to destroy my relationships with other family members, friends, and professional contacts (eg telling people I’m abusive, sending me emails stressing how the friends I have “don’t really like me” and people only “tolerate” me). I’ve got pretty low self-esteem to begin with/serious self-doubt, and it really doesn’t help. I’m now seeing a psychiatrist/have been in therapy which helps a bit, but it doesn’t really undo the damage. It kills me that my own mother despises me. 

My dad doesn’t care to know me or my life. The only time he demonstrates concern for my “welfare” is when faced with the prospect that he might lose his bragging rights (eg I had to take a medical leave of absence from medical school, and suddenly he cared a lot about “making sure I didn’t get lazy!” and “this is just temporary - right? RIGHT?!”). He never calls. He never visits. He doesn’t work and has all the time in the world.  When we do talk, all he’s concerned about is my educational progress (“New scholarships? Where’s your MD at? How much longer before your Master’s is finished? How about that (highly identifiable diploma program in a particular area of specialization)?”). He used to drive out of town 2 hours (one way) every week to see my brother in prison. I’m along that route/only one extra hour away so I’d repeatedly volunteer to meet him in the town where he meets my brother. He would never call to let me know when he was coming up, nor would he ever commit to dates. I’d only hear about it later. Yet everyone under the sun hears about “how proud” he is of me, and “how much I take after him”. I end up in the hospital and he doesn’t even text. He ends up in the hospital and I head out day or night (several times over...). He hardly knows me, and has no desire to. If I want to see him around the holidays, I have to practically beg him to make time for me (and naturally, I’ll be the one to drive down to visit). This year it all just made me feel worthless. 

The latter statements can be applied to most of my family. I exist, but no one ever calls (I’m always having to do the calling, and heaven forbid I leave a message for someone to “call me back when they have a chance!” because I’m younger therefore it’s my place to be doing all the calling, apparently). Few ever respond when I call or text. It’s not like I don’t try. It’s not like I don’t make active efforts to be in their lives (attending grads, bday parties, just wishing people “happy Monday!” Or “good luck on that interview!” Etc). People will tell me about their lives but never ask me about mine. I remember their significant dates, but hardly anyone remembers my birthday. And it’s not like they don’t even care sometimes, more like they actively dislike me, for reasons I don’t fully understand. Like, I never participate in gossip about other family members (my family is quite drama-prone/gossipy...), and recently I’m hearing that my mother, grandmother, and one aunt are saying terrible things about me. Crazy stuff too. Like, that I accused other family members of arson (?! Oddly specific). Or that I married my husband only for his money (?! I worked before/saved, and I go to med school...when I graduate, I’ll be more than capable of supporting both of us!). I get there’s a lot of untreated mental illness in my family but...I mean really? I’m not even in the same city as everyone else/contact is pretty distant and pleasant on my end, so just...why? I mean, I do have one supportive aunt who I love to death...but that’s more or less all I have going on for “legitimate” family. Yet I elope, and all of a sudden everyone is up in arms because “weddings are for the family!” (quote-un-quote) and “clearly you didn’t care enough to have us there!”. Sigh. 

That more or less applies to all my friends as well. I’ve always taken the “if you want to have a friend, you have to be a friend” quote to heart, and I really do try to be supportive and engaged in people’s lives. I thought I had made some good close friends in high school/undergrad - people who I thought actually knew me as a person somewhat. Especially my high school best-friend. When they moved elsewhere for university, I made every effort to make sure I was staying in touch...texting weekly to check in, calling them, making sure not to miss important dates/life events etc...and then one day they just stopped replying (yet were still talking to mutual friends/even visiting with them when they were in town). And deleted their social media (fair enough, I mean I get a “social media cleanse” as much as the next person). They have the same phone number as they did in undergrad (listed on their LinkedIn) and I text it every once in awhile (“hope life is treating you well - we should catch up sometime!” “Happy birthday!” “(Bob) told me you scored a job at (impressive company)- a huge congrats! They’re lucky to have you!”). I’ve been sending them e-birthday/Christmas gifts for years (small donations to charities they supported in their name). I don’t want to pester/harass people, so it’s not like these are inundating messages...just every once in awhile. I gave up this year. I have one true friend from junior high, and we keep in touch, but she lives far away and we don’t get to see each other often (when we do, it’s great!). I occasionally try to reach out to friends past via Facebook/ask about what’s going on for them, with highly variable responses...most recently, I reached out to a formerly close male friend to ask about his life, and he wanted to meet up for a “friendly catch up coffee”. And then tried to pressure me into a romantic relationship (despite knowing I’m married, and that the meeting was intended to be strictly platonic). It was uncomfortable, so I just sort of thew in the towel with Facebook. 

I have a lot of acquaintances at med school who I care about a lot. But that’s all they are - acquaintances. I could tell you lots about them (whenever I meet someone new I always try to find 1) something to remember about their appearance so I don’t forget them 2) something to remember about what’s going on in their lives so I can ask them about it next time we meet, and 3) something to genuinely compliment them on), but I doubt they could tell you anything about me. Because we never talk about that...no one ever asks me how I am, or what I’ve been up to. People I’ve known/seen daily for 2 years don’t even seem to know my name (as was recently revealed in one very awkward interaction).

I try really, really hard. It’s been 2 years with this class, and so far no luck as far as making legitimate friends. I tried taking the bull by the horns and organizing a few social activities early into med (eg a hiking day out, a pumpkin carving/horror movies evening for Halloween) for people in one of our ongoing project groups, and while people showed up to the first one (and all sort of bonded with each other while I played hostess...I should have been more present in hindsight), out of 10 people who committed to the latter event only 3 showed up the day of (one for 15 minutes to say hi before heading out to another event, one to drop off snacks because they felt bad they couldn’t stick around, and the remaining one hung out for a bit then left within the hour). There was a lot of crying on my part later that night, and a ton of food gone to waste. No one said anything the next time we were all together (not that I acted dejected or anything, or brought it up). Just didn’t seem to matter to anyone (and clearly at least 3 people were aware that the event totally bombed for lack of attendance). Worse, more than half the group ended up coordinating to go on a holiday to Mexico later in the year. Turns out it was an opt-in thing, and everyone heard about it but me (“oh...I thought they told you...we’ll take pictures...”). I didn’t say anything about it but...I was (am) really hurt. I do everything I can to get people to like me. I smile and say “hi” to everyone I know in the halls. I volunteer to take notes when people are sick/away. I volunteer to coordinate meetings etc for our group (which isn’t fun, with like 10 people with conflicting schedules + busy preceptors). I share my summary notes/good resources I find on our class social media pages. I house and pet-sit for free (a bit of a touchy point for me right now...I’m currently missing school to stay at home with our critically ill pet, and asked these same people if they’d mind sharing their notes from a few upcoming non-recorded lectures with me. Not one person said yes). I even started bringing in baked goods for meetings etc...people seem to like the baked goods, but are pretty indifferent about me. I eat alone at lunch every day, usually holed up in an empty classroom somewhere, which is at least good for getting work done on my laptop. I used to try to casually join groups of people I know when they were eating/playing video games or whatever in the student lounge, but I was always a third wheel (not really included in the conversation, couldn’t really easily enter the conversation aside from playing the part of enthusiastic listener, etc. Literally people would make plans to meet up after class and check the availability of everyone but me, while I was standing right there awkwardly. It wasn’t even a “it’s implied you can join us” thing...more like a “alright I’ll call ahead and make table reservations for 7/8 of the people standing here, to finish the conversation 8/8 of us have been having for the last hour...”). I just gave up after awhile. It’s like people see right through me. Same goes for sitting with people in class...I don’t even bother anymore. Everyone has such clearly established “groups” they talk to and sit with (honestly it feels like high school all over again). I enter and exit lecture halls through the back doors so I don’t have to walk awkwardly up the aisle in front of everyone, desperately trying to make eye contact with someone who would invite me to join them. Because I inevitably end up sitting by myself in the very back row anyways. In the past I’ve tried striking up friendly conversation with people I know (when the lecture hall is just filling up) and eventually asking them if they want to join me...but they always have somewhere else to be/need to save seats for X many people. I don’t want to be paranoid, but...there’s a pattern. For awhile I became too anxious to even go to class, because it just feels like I’m someone no one wants around/a general inconvenience, and I’m embarrassed to go outside because I feel like something is deeply and inherently wrong with me. Going to class just makes me feel like a lesser person, not good enough to associate with everyone else.  

Alright, so my family is dysfunctional (lots are), and my class is cliquey (as many are), old friends are too busy (reasonable), no big deal, says I. I’ll find friends elsewhere. So I join a free friend-finding app thing...looks like Tinder, but your profile is just about you and what sorts of things you might like to do with a friend (eg catch up over a coffee, go skiing, etc). I put so, so much effort into my profile. My husband and best friend (recall: the one who lives out of town) proof-read and approved it, because at this point I worry that I just don’t come across as normal/interesting. I was on it for months before I finally had some mutual responses (not for my lack of receptiveness). All of those have ghosted. Recently I made two contacts over the last few weeks (looks like a lot of people were joining over the holidays). One has seemingly ghosted, the other ghosted after one (what I thought had been really successful) meeting for coffee. The latter was so much worse, because we had been talking really frequently for 2 weeks and actually got into some relatively deep stuff (eg our rather compatible thoughts on politics, why we went into our professions, that her parents didn’t approve of her path in life etc), had met up for a few hours, and then all contact promptly ceased. Like, maybe I was ok enough on paper, but something was wrong with me in person? I’m super attentive to my hygiene, so I know I don’t smell or anything. I’m also super nervous about offending everyone, so my sense of humour is pretty mild and I’m not prone to discussing controversial stuff, or making unkind remarks...I just don’t get it. I tried my very best to ask her about lots of things going on in her life, because I’m taking “How to Win Friends and Influence People” to heart. I’m admittedly disproportionately devastated. I’ve sent a few “Hey, how goes life?” and “there’s some event going on at blablabla...want to join?” sort of follow-up messages since...she responded weeks later with “oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to meet up before my (3 month long) upcoming trip. We’ll have to wait until I get back”. Writing’s on the wall. 

I feel like I’m a good person. At least I really try to be. And that I could be likeable/interesting if people tried to get to know me. I really try to make people happy (maybe I’m too much of a people-pleaser?), I’m empathetic, and I’m flexible/open to trying new activities. I really do genuinely love getting to know people. I know I’m a bit socially awkward, but (at least according to my best friend) I come across as “really shy” vs “weird”. I’m not socially inappropriate, I’m positive, look happy, and I try to listen more than I talk. I volunteer with a crisis line and I’ve only ever gotten really good reviews for my interactions. My reviews from our standardized patients at school have always been good (“good rapport, clearly empathetic, a little shy but was a great listener...”), and my anonymous peer reviews at school too (perplexingly, I’m thought very likeable/empathetic according to those metrics, but not liked in person?). So while I know I’m a bit socially awkward, I don’t think I’m socially off-putting. I know I don’t share much about what’s going on in my life (I’m always afraid I’ll talk too much about myself/seem arrogant) so I probably come across as a bit boring/distant. But even if I’m boring, I don’t think I warrant being ghosted etc. I mean, it’s not like I’m exactly a volatile personality type either - I’ve never been one to let others know when I’m upset (eg even when everyone bailed on my party), because I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. I do know I’m quiet, and I do know I’m introverted/not the most outgoing...but I really do make efforts. I “get out there”. I have lots of passions and am in the community doing lots of things/engaging with fellow humans. There’s that saying that “if everything around you stinks, maybe it’s you” and I’ve taken it to heart. But when people have an anonymous means of communicating any social issues with you (peer or patient reviews) you’d think you’d hear about it. I’ve asked both my husband and my best friend to please tell me honestly if they think anything I’m doing/not doing is off-putting (to clarify, my friend is pretty brutally honest). They’ve both told me I’m really shy, but otherwise totally pleasant/normal. Maybe they’re just being kind? 

I just give up. I’m so lonely. I know that’s probably less justified than many on here because I have my husband, but it’s how I feel. I legitimately look forward to my psychiatry appointments (anxiety disorder) because aside from my husband and best friend, she’s pretty well the only person that knows the real me/actually wants to know about what’s going on in my life (though I appreciate that she’s paid to do that). And it’s not like I’m wholly alone, and I get that (my husband is my everything, I have my best friend who I text, my in-laws are nice to me)...somehow I just wish that I had a broader social group. Like, I love my husband more than life itself and I love coming home to him every day/having him near...but he’s the only social support I have in town. It might be nice to have a school friend. Or a gym friend. Or someone I could drag along for cheap pedicures. I dunno. He knows I’m lonely and encourages me to try the friend-finding app etc. Sometimes it feels like he’s the only one who has ever really loved me, and I am so grateful for him. I just wish I had some other people who cared about me too...friends at school or at my volunteer placements or what have you. I feel like if I were to drop dead today, the only people who’d be at my funeral would be my husband (and I guess in-laws), best friend, and one aunt. I’m like a mid-20s Eleanor Rigby. And I’m trying everything.

I have a fine life. I have a big family that likes me just fine. I have a home with food, netflix, and a car in the driveway. I have friends that I've know for a decade.

I feel alone. Its not that I believe I could die and no one would care. In fact I would definitely kill myself if wouldnt be such a big deal for everyone. It's not like I feel lost and hopeless. Just really alone and not willing to settle for anything less than someone that makes me feel connected. Its not that no one cares for me or has never. It's that I've never cared for someone who would care for me in the same way that I want someone to care. I don't know what it's like to be loved by someone that didnt have to say it. Sure no one ""has"" to say it but undoubtedly there is love for the familiar (family) and LOVE. LOVE is that other part of you who you never leave out of your thoughts and whose thoughts you're never left out of. LOVE might be made up, could be something that is just in my head. I've never seen it in all honesty. I know people in ""love"" but not in LOVE. I feel a powerful empty space inside me thats pulling toward an infinite empty center. I'm being crushed by nothing from within. Maybe I'm a tuning fork for universal agony.

282,whytfamisad,1548186755,1,"It all began this summer. We were texting all day, honestly it was amazing. It was the first time I ever felt that someone was genuinely attracted to me. This went on for a month. She didn't want to meet up in person. She always had an excuse. That is until later she told me she got a boyfriend. I was so heartbroken. I felt betrayed and this whole thing destroyed my self image. A few months of self doubt and hatred followed.

In october we ran into each other and after that she texted me. She told me how shitty she felt and how much she regrets what she did in August. I forgave her... She then broke up with his boyfriend and we started talking again. It was going fine. I started feeling those feelings again I felt in Summer. This time we even met. Twice. Once we were at her place. Watching a movie. We were cuddling and laughing and it was amazing. I really never wanted that day to end. Before I went home we kissed and hugged eachother (it was my first kiss so I was probably pretty bad). After that I felt like she started losing interest. She didn't respond to my texts that quickly anymore and postponed our third meet up. Eventually she told me she didn't want a relationship. Told me she needed space. I felt like shit. Again. But I could have dealt with this. We talked through it. She told me she still loved me and missed me. However, a few weeks later one of my friends showed me a screenshot of her on Tinder. I felt so crushed. Again. Why is it that I'm never good enough? I genuinely feel like this was my only chance at a relationship and it didn't work. I still can't get over her. I still peep her instagram/facebook profile almost every hour. I'm honestly so fucked up and I don't know what to do. I have lost all my confidence and my trust towards women as well.

Also they think im mentally incapable because I always make stupid mistakes, mainly due to my depression caused by having no close friends.

310,Radkein,1548120928,1,"Anyone else has trouble getting rid of it ? As far as I can remember (I dont remember anything of my childhood before age 12-14 except some flashes), I always had this overwhelming fear of being left behind by anyone I liked having around... This is probably tied to the fact that when I was a child I've been moved here and there a lot, cut away from my mother, and sometimes from my whole family. I also didn't know my father for long, probably lived with him around for 3 to 5 years in total - note that I still deeply loved him despite the fact I didn't get to know him much - and he passed away nearly 4 years ago.

I am now 26. I'm doing my best to be a good person. I am very honest and never lie - talking about real lies here of course. The thing is I think I have been through a lot. Therapists keep telling me what I have lived must have been unbearable.  It seems like I unconsciously minimized and / or hid every traumas I came across in my life. 

I just know that when I was younger, I was a very introverted kid and had like a couple friends. Before I forget, I should probably state that I am highly intelligent and have ADHD, and both of these don't really help with extended social interactions... I also have hyperempathy, which makes me very sensitive to some people's emotions.

When I was 15, I started making friends because I couldn't bear the loneliness anymore. I also met my first girlfriend at this time, and I stopped going to school. I went through an 8 years gaming session almost never leaving my room from this moment. 
In the meantime, I had 4 relationships, and 3 of them ended very badly for me - the first 3 girls cheated on me before dumping me. The first one even got me to the point of committing suicide, not because she broke my heart - which she did, but this I could bear - but because she kept crushing my self confidence for almost 6 months after she left me (our relationship only lasted for 4 months), to the point where I was sincerely looking at myself like dogshit.

All of these social failures didn't really help me getting rid of that fear. The last relationship I had lasted for 5 years. This girl has probably saved my life. She put me back together and pushed me forward as much as she could so I could think of myself as a human being and start building myself a future. Seven months ago, we broke up for good reasons. Our vision of happiness was very different and our feelings had slowly disappeared, so I just left and found myself a new home. 

From this time, I've been working like hell to keep it together. I'm slowly learning life by myself. It is hard but it is a good teacher. Sadly, my self confidence is still pretty bad even if I am now aware that I can achieve success with some things. 

I have noticed that I tend to attach a lot to emotionally wounded people. They make me curious and wanting to help. The problem here is that most of these people in the past took my behaviour as socially inadequate  (Or seemed to, at least) because I always ended up losing these people. Thing is if I get this bond with a girl, I just can't find interest in any other person anymore. It's pretty unhealthy and I'd like to get rid of that (well it already got better but it's acting on my thoughts here so it's hard to get away from it completely). I don't think I have enough friends or activities to get out of this thought storm most of the time.

321,throw_away_whiner,1548099642,1,"I've been going to meetups a lot. Mainly to try and improve social skills. I don't think its working. 

&amp;#x200B;

Little conversation groups will form. I'll  feel like I'm kind of intruding if they don't form naturally around me and I try to insert myself in one. Even if I manage to be part of the group, I usually have very little to say about the topic. There's always like 2-3 people who kind of dominate the conversation. But fuck, they keep it interesting. If it fell on me, there'd be very little conversation and a lot of awkward silence. So ultimately I'm just kind of sitting off to the side, listening to everyone (if music or something isn't too loud so that I can even hear). If I do manage to come up with something to say, I'd have to interrupt someone else to say it. And by the time I've got an opportunity, the subject has long since changed or 

&amp;#x200B;

On a hike to watch the eclipse last night, I went through all of this again. People chatted, I listened. Didn't have much to say. People were doing side activities while waiting, making cool patterns with lights and long exposure cameras. I just watched. A few times, when someone wondered aloud about the eclipse, I chimed in with what I knew. But I think I just annoyed people. After like an, ""oh"" or something, they kind of just walked off. I don't think I came off as a know-it-all or anything, but now I'm not so sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

These meetups seem to be confirming that there is something very wrong with me. Too boring? Talk weird? Act weird? Some combination thereof? Fuck if I know. They're kind of making me depressed. But if I didn't go to them, I'd just be sitting in my condo by myself doing jack shit, feeling like crap anyway. ",lonely,Can't connect,2019-01-22 06:40:42

325,ill_cago,1548094747,1,"I’m a male. I’m 20 years old and I’ve never really had anyone to call mine. I’ve only ever had 2 girlfriends. One of which lasted a month and the other lasted literally less than two weeks. I’ve prayed, time and time again over this for as long as I can remember. Getting no Valentine’s Day cards in elementary, all the way to having no date to school dances in high school. I prayed and prayed and yet he never answered me. I continued being lonely all throughout high school up until I got to college and I figured, “I should give more effort now that I’m in uni, why not?” Every girl I showed interest in either wasn’t interested, pretended like they were, or subjected me to heartache. Since then, ive gone after few girls. I’ve been in college since fall of 2016 and I’ve had 3 hookups in 3 years. None of which actually went anywhere. I became clinically depressed in the end of 2017 but no amount of prayer really seemed to help.  I completely gave up on finding a partner in mid 2018 and just recently I actually met a girl through unique circumstances that I thought was the answer to my prayers. She was interested and so was I, and after a month I made her my girlfriend. She’d told me how much I meant to her and how she’d never want to lose me. After a week and a half, she became distant and told me she didn’t know if she wanted to be with me. After so long of forcing myself to feel nothing for girls, I allowed myself to because I thought he was finally looking out for me and I was crushed. I do not believe that God has a plan for me when it comes to finding my soulmate. I don’t believe that this is happening to me because there’s a bigger picture. I believe that he either enjoys seeing my suffering or wants to see how much he can do to me before I completely break.

I tried joining a few things but recently due to some family issues I’ve been unable to find time to try things. I instead turned to a popular MMORPG I’ve casually played for years. Always been a solo player but decided I’d join a guild to make friends in the game. 

I joined a guild which was advertised as a social guild and the first two days were awesome! They were friendly people, talked about films, books, music and the game. 

I’m two weeks though and since day two I’ve been ignored. I log in and say hi, ask how people are doing only to get no response. Other people log in and they’re greeted by name, have a little chat but if I join in it’s ignored. ",lonely,Apparently I can’t even make friends in MMORPGs!,2019-01-22 04:52:50

He has that new posh girlfriend that he spends all his free time (not much in the first place) with. I got buddies that I play games with, online buddies to be precise, so I'm not all alone. It just sucks because with this guy we used to spend a lot of time together, talked daily. Now it's like talk weekly spend time together almost never. All thanks to that bi\*ch. I never actually spoke to her and have no idea if she deserves to be called that. I just hate her for existing, okay? I'm glad he found someone but I hate how it impacted our friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

Myself, I never had a girlfriend. Hits me sometimes too. I'm way too old to be a virgin... turned 24 in December. Not kissless virgin so at least I have reached that point. Sometimes I think about the only girl that wanted me. She was CUTE, don't know what she had seen in me. The only person to ever say she wants me. I kinda fu.ked that one up, I don't really consider that a relationship, well it was 6 weeks, thats all it was. She was depressed and I was too, so I told her about it and she got scared, cause I told her I sometimes have suicidal thoughts. Big mistake I guess? She dumped me the same day. Oh wow, when I put like that, she sounds like a total b.tch. So she can have depression and gets to cry out on my shoulder but I am somehow not allowed to have it? Uuum?

337,BronxBushido,1548041250,1,"I know men are supposed to be the ones who approach women and 9.5/10 a woman doesn’t approach a a man but when you’re an ugly person  it just puts you in a loop. I have low self esteem and people say to get into a relationship you need to be confident and self assured and shit like that. Since I’m ugly my confidence is already low so I can’t approach women and I end up being alone because I couldn’t talk to the girl in the first place. 

I just worry because people always say shit like, you’re gonna have a family one day and how I’m going to have to provide for them. And then it makes me feel like shit because I’m too ugly for a girl to even want to speak to let alone kiss,  I literally stopped leaving my house for most shit because in the mall some girls were looking at me and thought I saw more and more looking at me. I started shaking and sweating and I couldn’t fucking deal with it. I hate when people stare at me because I know they are processing my appearance and think I’m Ugly  I had to go back to my parents car and wait for them to finish shopping. I can’t sit next to girls because I’m afraid they’re gonna think I’m making a move on them or something, 

I’m afraid.

I don’t want to be alone because I’m ugly, It’s so depressing that the only people who Complement my appearance or want to spend time with me are my family and that’s horrible. It’s so depressing that instead of going on a date on New Years I would have had to have stayed awake for New Years with my family.  I’m glad I took those sleeping pills so I was out before midnight.

What can I do anymore? If I can’t talk to women I don’t think I’ll be able to learn to do it in college and I don’t think I can handle being alone for the rest of my life because I’m so ugly that it holds me back from talking to women. I’m turning 17 next Week and I don’t want to do anything involving a party or food or family.

I’ve been down to one meal a day and exercising to lose weight. It’s been working so far because I’ve lost 30lbs.

I just want somebody to like me. But it’s fucking ridiculously hard to even talk to girls with how I look I don’t know what I can do. I can’t just “be confident” because you can’t pull it out of your ass. And I can’t fake confidence because I instantly fold. Don’t tell me to work on my personality because I can’t really show it to anyone if I know for a fact a girl wouldn’t wanna waste their time on a guy who isn’t cute. 

I get all women aren’t like that but who’s to say I’ll meet a girl like that in reality and if I do, who’s to say I’d even be able to make friends with that girl?

I do want to talk to people, and I do want friends, but I have no drive for it. I don't see anything amounting to anything. I get bored with people easily or my mind likes to think I *know* when I won't get on well with someone / if they don't like me.

Or maybe it's just all the effort that goes into keeping up with people. I wanted to think I'm content with just having one person I can talk to everyday / spam with things as it's therapeutic and ""enough"". But no, it's really not? Like, generally that person (this isn't the first time this has happened, it's always only one person I can focus on) has their own things to do and others they talk to. I don't want them to be the only thing that makes me happy everyday or the only person I ever really interact with. I dont want to rely on another person for my happiness. Or have to feel ""greatful"" like they pulled me out of the depths of hell and despair or something.

Why can't I branch out to others and magically be in amazing friendships with multiple people? I guess I'm also already drained from putting my all into one person that doing it again and waiting months for it to become solid is so fricking daunting. 

And what I fear most is that if I do find more people, if I do try to reach out to the people that have tried to be friendly (since I like to make so many friend posts rip)... that they'll turn out to be crazy. Or that I'll trust them and eventually be screwed over. Because that's also something that tends to happen. Bleh. Idk how to feel.

In the past few years, all of that is different. Especially since I graduated college 2 years ago, I’ve seen those around me fade away from my life. I have 4-5 lifelong friends that will talk to me, but it feels like an obligation for them, and we rarely hang out. My family is so close to one another and I’m just like the odd man out. I’ve had 3 really tough breakups in the last years, and that makes me feel pretty insecure. Now whenever I start to like a girl, they stop talking to me after hooking up a few times. It’s like I can put on a good show for people, but once they start to see the real me, they back away.

I don’t know what I’m trying to accomplish with this post. I look at this sub a lot on a night like this (Saturday, alone), and it helps to know there are other people that have these same feelings.

Well, here we are in January and I've never felt this alone in my life. I've yet to really find a group of people I get along with in school, I've started to realize this city really isn't for me (maybe I'm just biased because my overall experience has been pretty negative), and I'm just isolating myself more and more, it almost feels intentional at this point which I hate. I literally just go to class, go to my internship, study, eat, and sleep. Nothing else. No new friends that I hang out with, a handful of restaurants that I eat at every so often (alone), and I'll walk around the city every so often just to kill free time by myself. I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm certainly an extroverted person, love making new friends, but I just haven't been able to click with anybody - they all have their friend groups and I don't feel a part of any of them - and I haven't found anyone, personality wise, that I click with.

399,nutdemon,1547918158,1,"7 years ago I got out of a very hard relationship. My ex girlfriend broke up with me and in front of me, walked away with another man whom she swore was ""nobody"".

Even though I had a large group of friends, no one comforted me through my break up. I was 20 at the time, and dealt with it on my own with alcohol and cigarettes. I travelled the world after that, to help get my mind off of her, and it helped build my confidence again.

I started dating again, but just when I thought I could take things to the next level, I was met with rejection. I then began watching romantic dramas and movies, just so I can fantasize about how great it would be to have someone who can reciprocate my feelings.

I'm 27 now, my friends and family think I'm gay when in reality, I'm just invisible. It bothers me being called gay, being set up with other men as ""a joke"". It depresses me because I often don't know how to fight back, or if I even should fight back when my sexual orientation is mistaken.

My friends around me are getting married and I'm here, living paycheck to paycheck, craving for love. I feel like my life is heading nowhere and that my existence is invisible. I'm lonely and I'm tired of being lonely. ",lonely,I feel invisible,2019-01-20 04:15:58

They then didn't understand that I was mad at them. 

My friends are starting to get real annoyed with me and my bad habits and way of thinking. They won't be my friends sooner or later and I'll be alone. I want to rush this period of awkwardly having my friends be annoyed with me but maybe I can get better.

405,MyLifelines,1547897605,1,"It’s just this feeling of unease. Going forward, I have all this fun stuff I’m doing. But, I’m doing them alone, and I have no one to share the experiences with. I have shared the good news with family, but I don’t really have anyone else to share this stuff with. Not to mention... someone to tag along. Some of those things includes traveling. So yes, I am now traveling by myself (and looking forward to it!). 

Another thing that bothers me is how I can’t imagine I will ever be in a romantic relationship. I’ve tried, but it just doesn’t work. I also get instantly demotivated when it comes to this. Most people would probably go on a date, and if it doesn’t work, go out on a date with someone else. Me? I need about a year. Say about eight months before I can start to think about it and feel like I can give it a shot. The other months are all about setting up profiles (if I’ve deleted them) and trying to find someone to go out. Finding someone to ask out can take a while... maybe it’s my looks. Maybe I’m boring. At this point, I feel so demotivated that I’m convinced that this simply isn’t meant for me (I’ve felt this way A LOT in the past as well). It’s a fact (or “fact”) I cannot accept, but... what can I do?

I don’t know if my loneliness is returning, but I don’t feel so well either. At this point, it’s more like a feeling of unease. Sometimes it feels like I might end up crying soon, but I’m not quite there yet. Since the summer of 2018, I’ve been distracting myself by just doing stuff. I’ve tried new things and joined clubs, and it’s been great. This year I am traveling on my own. I also have a few other things I intend to sign up for to learn new (potentially) fun activists I can do. However, the relationships I’ve forged with people through these activists seems a bit meaningless. It’s fun, but it’s not a real connection.

410,BobdaPirate,1547877853,1,"I moved to a (small) city 3 years ago, and have since grew increasingly lonely. I've been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years, have been through a few jobs, and adopted 2 dogs in this time. I've had terrible managers in 3 of the 4 jobs I've had, so I decided to try and start a business a year ago, but found myself even more lonely and more unhappy (currently looking for a job again). Outside of business interactions, I haven't made any personal friends. Every time I feel that I'm getting close to making a friend they start avoiding me, ditching on plans, and altogether ignoring me until I give up, which makes me feel like I'm being annoying and in turn makes me reach out less. I do not have family in the city, and do not have a close relationship with my family as is. So for 3 years the most interacting I've done personally has been with my boyfriend and my 2 dogs.

 I sit at home almost daily doing chores, or work on the computer, and hardly leave the house. My bf works 8-5 and comes home exhausted and falls asleep almost instantly, so even when he comes home, I'm still alone in a sense. I've noticed myself becoming more angry, more depressed, and not being able to handle my emotions as well as I used to, along with (basically) breakdowns every once in awhile. I'm cold a lot, so I take a lot of showers and baths to warm up and not feel so lonely, I'm always wearing sweaters and under blankets as well. 

I've been seeing a therapist who has helped a little bit, but its hard to fight this feeling when I don't always feel like I have support like friends and family. 

I've become increasingly conservative with interactions and decisions, and have a hard time busting out of the shell I've receded into. I'm not entirely sure how to break this bad cycle of sadness and loneliness. I question myself a lot, I'm self conscious most of the time, and just feel completely stuck in life.

This may seem like, “oh whatever, you’ll find other friends and it’ll be ok”, but seriously NOBODY understands the level on which our friendship was. 

We were perfect. I feel like even trying to explain our relationship isn’t doing it justice...there are no words to describe how much he meant to me. 

He not going to college this semester, and being a senior in high school in his home town, I was sorta glad that I’d get to see him more often. It was really enjoyable for about a month. And then, 2 weeks ago, he stopped talking to me. 

I don’t know why. Or what happened. I don’t remember doing anything to him...I’ve tried soooo many times to talk to him, and it doesn’t work. He doesn’t answer. He ignores me. 

I talked to his mom, because she and I are just as close, and she said that he’s trying to find himself, and he’s shutting out a lot of people. Which is true. But he is also not friends like we were with everyone he meets. She also said that it might just be because our relationship was too complicated for him to handle at the moment. Which I guess I also understand. But then she said that we may never be friends again. And that’s where I panic. 

I can’t live without him in my life. I don’t want to live without him. He’s the brightest parts of my days and he’s the only person I was able to confide in completely. We know everything about each other, and now he’s gone...perhaps for good. 

I feel more lonely than I ever have in my entire life. I don’t like being left alone, with no real explanation (from him) and without any control of the situation. It’s so frustrating. I cry myself to sleep now- no joke, every night for the past 6 nights I’ve fallen asleep and woken up crying.

I don't know why exactly, but this has been keeping me up at night. I'm almost 19, pretty young, but i'm terrified of getting old, cause time passed so quickly and honestly my teenage years are almost over.
I've had the regular pretty messed up childhood, i'm in an okay place now ( i don't want to seem ungrateful for what i have, even tho you don't know me, but still, i'm guilt tripping myself so that you don't have to) but the one thing that saddens me the most, especially during the holiday season, is how even tho i have a family ( my parents are divorced,shocker! ) we are not really close. My parents are not on speaking terms to say the least,but i love them both, and my brother too, yet nothing ever felt right, let me explain. My parents' families are really messed up, no one is really close with eachother. I have uncles, grandparents and cousins, but no one i can say i'm close with. And it really, deeply hurts me, cause i'm a really loving person( or so i'd like to think) and this was not my choice. I see all these shows and movies showing cozy family gatherings and dinners where people spend time together,the lovely grandparents, the parents in love, the adorkable uncles and the quirky children, usually during christmas time images like this keep popping up everywhere. And it makes me really, really sad because i don't have any kind of meaningful relationship with my family, and have never experienced such situation, yet everytime i think about it i feel melancholic, as if. I mentioned my teenage years being over in the beggining, cause i now know that i will never get to experience a family gathering from a child's perspective, and it scares me. I lost that chance and it wasn't my choice/fault. I know no one gives a shit( it's cool )and this is truly too long.

422,benmale1,1547854951,1,"Over the past several years I feel like I have bared witness to all whom I considered close and important in some way, leaving. 

And not going anywhere either, just leaving. There are some obvious exceptions to this rule. Primarily my decision to quit doing drugs after very nearly dying on a bus at 10am on a fucking Monday morning. Having escaped from a previously highly abusive relationship and becoming temporarily estranged from my newborn child (all sorted now btw, she's asleep upstairs, truly the light of my life), I felt like I had no other options. My friends and my work, performing music in bars across town at the time, revolved around them. This was around three years ago now and is a whole other story, so I'll cut it here but basically - clean for 3 years and I quite obviously don't see any of them anymore. 

Fine, good. Lovely. Healthy. 

But more recently, I don't know. I find myself sitting in the same bar I used to gig in all the time, drinking the same drinks, listening to the same music and having the same conversations. Smoking the same cigarettes in the same little shelter wearing the same shoes and the same jeans with the same coat and the same uncut messy tangled hair and suddenly I look around and realise that not a single person remains from the nearly 4 years ago I started drinking here on a regular basis. All gone, every single one, with exception to a couple of musicians who I know from when I played frequently and perhaps five members of the bar staff. 

People whom I considered my friends. People who I was close to and shared my time with. People who I was always there for whenever they needed anything, my ears were always open and my mouth was always closed. People trusted me and I was always honoured that they did and happy to help them in any way I could. I'd put myself out, constantly for all of them. All suddenly absent. 

Slowly people moved on, changed jobs / moved away, across the channel in a few cases and into the rest of Europe. I've had a friend die from an overdose and others come close. Some just completely took off and others moved on with their lives. And I look back on those days and I think about them all with love in my heart and then I'm desperately trying to recall who picked up the phone when I called. Who talked to me when I needed them? Who made sure I was okay? None of them. Not one. 

There's one exception, I have one friend who I have known since college and though we never so much as shake hands, we're like brothers. You know those people who you feel are going to be in your life until one of you dies? Yeah, that's him. 

Anyway, all this time I'm recovering from the abuse. From the previous relationship and from a further trauma before that. I deleted Facebook, which accelerated the entire thing. Fucking hell it was like I'd just vanished off the face of the planet. It feels as if I've been sat at my usual spot in town, drinking coffee and watching the world go by - you know those moments in films when the subject is in focus and moving at normal speed and everyone around is all blurry and moving really fast? Feels like that - and gradually it's all fallen silent. The cigarette has gone out and the coffee has gone cold and I'm just kinda sat there, frozen. 

I have become this sort of invisible man. People know me when they see me and performing music in my city I do get recognised, but nobody stops to say hello. Nobody knows who I am or what I am like. And not in a narcissistic way, just in the way that you know what your friends are like. The obvious exception here being my college friend I was talking about, but he's just moved out of town and is now working a full time job, so we hardly keep in touch. We do when we can though, had a beer last night actually which was nice. But I cannot escape this feeling of loneliness. Of needing real affection. Conversation and coffee. 

A few weeks ago I finally cracked the wall I'd built. I let someone in. I say I let them in she kinda took a sledgehammer to the entire thing over a kitchen radio and a cup of tea. It was a while ago now, seeing each-other for around 6 weeks. I was terrified. Especially for the first two weeks, hell I wasn't quite sure what was going on. Just panic from my previous relationship 3 years prior, but full of determination to make it work. Beautiful, in every way. Truly she's gorgeous. I spent half my time thinking ""Is this really happening?"", and then with a certain inevitability, it stopped happening. She said she needed some time to herself having only recently broken up with her long term boyfriend. I was devastated, but accepting and understanding and didn't push for ay other outcome after our final talk over coffee. 

Two weeks later she's plastering her new man all over Instagram. More money than me, better looking, the usual story... The wall is back up now and I am where I was before hand. Think I prefer this to the pain and anger I had a few weeks ago, and had indeed been trying to cope with 3 years ago when I found myself utterly broken. 

I think this final event has kinda sealed the deal for me. I'm done. Everyone has gone, except one and I am fine with that. I have my daughter back and I have my best friend, my immediate family and of course endless subreddits to enjoy. You lot seem to be more human than the people I meet in real life. 

I've found for all the love I gave out, I never really got anything back other than abuse. Being used. Leant on and then dropped. Etc... I never expected anything back. You don't give to get, but I thought maybe giving good brings you good. 

I'm gonna wrap this up cause I've just realised how terribly long this post is. But to conclude; it feels like this past year has been like watching the credits at the end of the film. Flashbacks of all the moments you loved but nothing in front of you but a list of names, all in black and white and all scrolling past you and up into the abyss. 

If there is anyone out there who gets it, who is more comfortable being alone and for the most part enjoys it, know that you're not alone. 

Except we are cause we like it that way.

442,smallsadpeanut,1547787074,1,"I apologize for this. It probably won’t make any sense. I feel physically in hell right now and I can’t stop crying on my balcony. It feels stupid to me to write in a journal because no ones listening (lol) so sorry for the dump here. 

I would like to blame my lack of friends on difficulty forming relationships due to my isolated upbringing (was homeschooled) or having (quiet) borderline personality disorder but the truth is I don’t have a problem forming friends when I’m involved in group activities and I’ve had friends in the past. 

I’ve had several groups of friends that turned into my family over the years. I met them when I was involved in certain sports and we trained together and competed together and got margaritas after competitions and helped each other move or paint houses etc etc. I’ve actually been part of what some people call a “squad” in the past. Looking back I don’t even know what it feels like anymore. I would love to be able to experience that again. 

I quit playing said sports because training and competing in them was too big of a time and money commitment for a college student. At the time I was a pre medical student and I needed much more time to study for science courses. I also started getting some “adult bills” and needed to work to pay them. So I had to quit this sport. For a while, I tried to keep up with these friends on Facebook and by going to some events with them every few months. But I stopped doing this because every time I saw them it wasn’t the same at all. It just felt awkward and I knew I was out of the loop with their conversations and whatever was going on in the group of friends. I was irrelevant to every conversation. New people had joined this group who I didn’t know and I didn’t feel replaced but that it wasn’t the same, and I couldn’t just reappear every few months and feel the same level of friendship that I did. So, I stopped interacting with them, because it made me feel worse when I did. 

The closest person to me out of this friend group, my coach and my mentor, someone who helped me through extremely hard times and was always there for me, started to make passive aggressive political comments on nearly all of my Facebook posts. Now, we had two very different political viewpoints, but never talked about it. And I respect most people’s political views as long as they’re respectful of mine. But he started using this tone in his comments that implied I was stupid for believing the things I do, or that I just don’t understand some things because I’m young and he’s not (I’m 20, and this person is old enough to be my parent). After getting into several arguments with him, I decided to block him on social media because his comments were aggravating to me and destroying our friendship. Since then, I have not spoken to him or any of the people in that group. 

I’ve never had problems getting into romantic relationships. I’ve been with my current boyfriend for a year now and although we’ve had our ups and downs we have a fairly healthy relationship, other than me feeling the need to hang out with him more than what is probably necessary. (I should also mention here that he physically cheated on me several months ago, and I have chosen to move past that, as I believe he is truly remorseful and he has done a good job being transparent with me since, but this has put a dent in my already damaged self esteem). I realize that he needs his alone time, so I try not to be with him too often. Unfortunately, it’s getting increasingly harder to be alone, even for 1 or 2 nights per week. Without him, I talk to no one outside of my coworkers, who I am not close with and do not intend to invite into my personal life. I talk to the internet and my cat, Apollo, and that’s about it. I don’t mean to sound like a cliche, but having a cat is probably one of the reasons why I don’t cut myself anymore and haven’t attempted suicide. I think about what would happen if I overdosed in my apartment or whatever other method of suicide and I wouldn’t want him to see that, like it kills me to think about him meowing and trying to get my body to respond, and not having food or water for several days until someone found out. 

Anyway, being alone is not bad, temporarily- I mean for several hours, and when I’m asleep. I like having alone time to shower, clean my apartment, and drink coffee, but after that’s all done, I can’t handle it, and I unravel. I love cleaning and having a clean space. Some people say it helps them to think clearly to have a clean space. I feel like it causes me to think too clearly- after I’m done, I’m just sitting in my clean apartment with my cat and some candles, and maybe some music, but what the fuck for? Why did I even clean? Most people clean before people come over, but no one, except my boyfriend will ever come over. There is no one to clean for. When there is no more cleaning to be done and I’ve worked out for the day and eaten and showered, I have exhausted my list of things to do and I start to disconnect and feel like I don’t exist anymore. Like I’m in this limbo with nothing to look forward to and no one to talk to except my boyfriend. Sometimes I lay on my bed unable to fall asleep, just suspended in this feeling of non existence. My existence, I feel, is relative to my relationship with others. If no one can hear my thoughts and words or even interact with me, do I exist? It sounds crazy but this is really how I feel.

For being depressed, I get a lot done. I’m very organized and clean. I work out at least 4 times per week and I’m making progress with powerlifting and running. I’m applying to nursing school right now and will hopefully get into a program soon. (When I’m in school, I’m less depressed. Having a lot of things to do makes it harder for me to be alone in my thoughts. If I don’t get into a program I feel like things will get much, much worse.) I work 3 times per week doing 12 hour night shifts. When I’m not doing a lot of activities, I get extremely sad, extremely fast. It makes me wonder if all my “accomplishments”, grades, and experiences are just a result of me running from my loneliness, and not because I’m actually talented at anything. 

For a while, I was using materialism as an escape from this. I would buy things I didn’t need when I was lonely as a distraction, and it always worked for a few hours but when I got into debt from this coping mechanism, it had to stop. There is nothing more depressing and stressful than being in a bad financial situation, so I promised myself I’d never buy anything else to fill the void in my heart. 

I’m turning 21 next month, and it’s probably just going to me me and my boyfriend. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I’m embarrassed. This is supposed to me the time in my life when I have a group of friends to go out to clubs and bars with or just have a good time together.  At this point, I’m not even sure, what do friends do? 

I haven’t reached out to any of my old friends to hang out with in a while. But when I do, I always feel like they’re spending time with me out of pity, and it makes me want to jump off a bridge. It’s starting to feel that way with my boyfriend. I’m trying to give him space because if I was normal, I’d appreciate that. It’s always harder than I anticipate to stay home with nothing to do. I can’t even find interest in watching tv anymore because I know I’m just using it as a replacement for human interaction and being self aware about it ruins it for me. I can’t enjoy it, I’m just staring at a screen thinking about how I wouldn’t be doing this if I was social and didn’t leave all of my friend group. I can’t read books, because I know I’m only reading the book because I’m lonely and need something to occupy my time. I would like to be able to read a book and watch tv because I want to, not because I’m trying to avoid spiraling into a pit of despair. 

I tell myself that after I graduate and become a nurse, I will have the time and money to get involved in the sport I was in again. It would be in a different city with different people, but I know - or think - I can make friends easier in a group setting. But now, whenever I’m in a group setting like aforementioned, I get nervous. It’s like I don’t even remember what having friends was like, and I am terrified to have some again. Just afraid of the awkward getting to know you process. Afraid that they won’t like me or that I will be the outsider in a clique. 

I realize I’ve probably limited myself in that I avoid a lot of situations because I don’t want to feel more lonely than I already am, and have probably missed out on friendships because of it. I berate myself for this too. I know I need professional help, unfortunately due to my health insurance coverage right now I can to afford mental health care. The future looks brighter after nursing school with money and coverage for psychiatric meds but I have to figure out how to live in the present and survive until then. I’m really struggling right now.

446,Interpreters_Dilemma,1547782216,1,"I am disablingly shy. I get most of my ""socialization"" fix from the internet.


However, I recently got out of a bad relationship with a guy I met on the internet. During the relationship he somehow got the passwords of ALL my emails, social medias, reddit accounts, etc. and now that we're broken up, I have to be completely ""dead"" to him. 

He's blocked on everything. I got a new number. I can't post on my favorite hobby subreddits because he will figure out its me. I have to be very careful about where I post and what I post about.


He has no job and all the time in the world to visit the corners of the internet that I frequent (and he knows all of them since he found my emails and such) so he has the ability to be very persistent. He kept tabs on me for 7 years before we met, so who knows how long he'll continue now that we've been together. But I think it's safe here. I've never visited this sub before, and he doesn't visit it either. 

So I feel like I've lost my ""social sphere"" and now just feel really lonely. Not to mention he was my first boyfriend and first person I was ever intimate with and now I really crave that attention from the relationship. 


I am really relieved that I am no longer with him and I am doing really well with ignoring him, but part of what scares me is that some part of me enjoys the fact that someone is obsessing over me. It's like I want that attention, and he is now the only way I can get it, since he is a road block to my usual fixes. I keep checking his ""blog"" that he created to talk about me and checking my emails to see if he's tried to contact me.

I kind of worry that this is what he is trying to do. Isolate me from afar so he is the only thing I can think about, even if what I'm thinking about him is not good.


I honestly feel like the next decently kind, intelligent, and healthy guy that throws attention my way will be in a world of trouble trying to get rid of me.

I've tried making friends here on Reddit as well as other places by writing posts, trying to socialize, I think I failed again and again. So much that it doesn't even hurt anymore. I just do it again because the voices in my head get louder and louder, crying for help since I'm trapped. I have massive social anxiety and trauma, so I feel disconnected from every friend/classmate I ever made or met IRL.

Everyone ghosted inevitably. Maybe it was because I was bland and uninspiring at best, without an iota of charisma. Or that I'm a doll of darkness. I'm also heavily inclined towards deep conversations, small talk doesn't interest me as much, so I understand why they would have left. But they never gave me a chance. They never listened to what I had to say. Maybe I should have tried harder to try and understand their passions and interests... but I didn't know what to say anyway. Did they even care about me?

Although, it wouldn't matter. I'm extremely bad at starting/keeping conversations and tend to drift away when not talking about anything that lies out of my league... and since my interests are very specific, I see why that's a problem. I'm also quite unstable and lonely so I don't take it very well when people don't respond to me quick enough or are willfully ignoring me (which happens to me all the time.) so I end up cutting them off before they inevitably ghost.

Recently the day before new years eve i met  and made a new friend.  Ill call her jane. It was such a weird and uncanny feeling it was like i genuinely had known her in the past even her family and friends.
We chat every day and have met up 4 times and the other day she said things were moving too fast. 

When we talk about meeting up in the coming week or so its the highlight of my day and to hear that catching up next week is too soon it just crushed me inside and i dont want to loose the 1st friend ive made in person in about 15 years.

I feel useles and lonley as a person. Ive made 1 friend who i can physically spend time with in 15 years and i feel ive been over excited and willing to chat and spend time togther that i feel that pushing her away. 

Do i tell her this ? Do i man up ? I dont know. I just feel so lonley and only want people to hang out with and i feel if i say that i will seam desperate wich i probably am.

Thank you for reading kind stranger.
Typing this has helped a little.",lonely,I just realised i have only made 1 friend in 15 years and i might have stuffed it up.,2019-01-18 01:34:32

Not just sexually, but someone I can be open with, someone I know will always be there. Friendships are great, but I just want something more intimate. It’s such a strange feeling that has been killing me a lot more recently, and a feeling that isn’t going away. The obvious solution, getting a girlfriend, is near impossible, at least for me. I’m an average looking dude, of average intelligence, and everything else about me is just that, average. So meeting new people is tough, let alone meeting a girl, and if by some miracle those two things happen, the girl that I meet needs to like ME, which isn’t a strong possibility.

I seldom get texts unless I text first, when I do is usually about school or something like that. I can have a wonderful day with someone and if I never contact that person again, they just disappear.

Is it too much then to be paranoid? To think, somehow, people see something I don't, that makes them stay away from me? I've developed resistance to protect myself. If I invite someone to do something, I know most likely I'll get the default no answer. It's even worst when getting ghosted.

I look forward to therapy but then I’m aware of how limited it is. It feels like the only time I have someone I can connect with but I remember it’s outside of my life &amp; isn’t really what I’m looking for.  

I feel like all I will ever have is my career &amp; until that is flourishing in the way that I need it to, I just hold my feelings down &amp; try not to spill them all over the first person who seems interested in me. 

Starting my day early makes me aware of all the hours I will spend alone. I find it strange how people I used to have “relationships” with will tell me how attractive I am or that they think I’m all sorts of positive things, but they don’t want to hangout or actually spend time together.  Which only confuses me because what was the point of talking to me in the first place?

I feel bad saying to the few friends I do have that I don’t feel like I have friends. I can’t help that feeling because they’re all wither far away, have started families of their own, or really are just busy with school/work. Also I don’t want to sound like a broken record about my loneliness. 

I’m not sure where I land in this world. Somewhere between too much &amp; not enough. I feel like my art is something worth sharing &amp; following to its fullest potential, but I’m just a vessel.

476,vengeful_omniscience,1547701955,1,"Like the title says, I'm am a loner. Some of its not by choice but most of it is by choice. My circle of friends is small, and I'm usually off the grid a lot due to work. The loneliness really stems from a lack of a girlfriend. I wanna be clear, I am very mentally stout. Based on poor middle school and high school experiences, I decided you had to earn my trust. I'm very easy going, friendly, but pragmatism and mistrust of strangers means I'll usually stay shelled up. This mindset of making sure I don't get hurt/burned means i don't usually go out of my way to approach the girls I do find attractive. Moreover, I like getting to know someone before I decide to let her through the wall I've thrown up, so to speak. I realize that meeting people is a risk vs reward, because a good woman is truly something to treasure. And you have to take risks to find those people that make you say damn, i really do care about you. I guess i havent met all that many girls who do make me wanna open up.  and the ones i do get to know well usually and deservedly find boyfriends by the time I've made my mind up. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be for me. And, for the first time in my life, I'm starting to say I'm okay with that. People can say i should lower standards or whatever else the life coaches say. I definitely could be more decisive. But, I realized I don't want just ANYONE around. I want that person who's gonna make me want to get out of my shell because she cares about me, and i care about her. Its a give and take. And the fact I haven't met that person pisses me off because I know I could be more outgoing when it comes to girls but I chose not to be because I haven't found that person who I want to let inside. The anger builds because I berate myself for complaining about myself being the victim.
I've realized that I have lived my life independent/alone and have come out stronger for it. I realize that right now, only one who's gonna be there for me is me. I realized the world is gonna keep turning round and round whether I wanna be on board or not. 
I define who I am. Not girls. Not my friends. Not anyone. It is my life. It's the only one I have, and I should be allowed to live it happy and free.  I don't have to settle.

I know most of the people on this subreddit are sad as well, and I do not mean to diminish what they're saying. Their situations are their own and not mine to judge. I don't know what they went through, but I wish them all the best. I wanted to say this on the off chance there are others who may have been feeling what I do about being alone, and maybe have reached similar conclusions of their own, that life is meant to be lived, and when all is said and done we should have lived it like we enjoyed it.

Its destroying everything...It used to be that a nice girl married a nice guy from her village or the next...

507,joselober,1547599128,1,growing up I always felt like I was just always lonely. I grew up with my two sister mom dad and grandma even my uncle at certain times. my household was usually full but i’ve just always felt like i never connected with them. even to this day i can’t even have a real conversation with them.  as i grew up i would just have my face glued to the tv or maybe even play basketball in my front yard. and my parents were always strict on me where whatever we talked about would just be an argument on how i’m lazy or don’t pay attention in school. also whenever i would explain to my mom i had ADHD she would just say it’s a normal thing on how i just wasn’t trying even sometime saying i don’t have it. my parents are really closed minded also whenever i was a kid i would try talking to my parents about everything but i would never get a good response and it would always turn out negative like bat shit crazy. anyways as time went by i would speak to them less and less where i felt so numb to anything. (there’s also some traumatic events that went on in that time which had a huge role on that. but there’s a next time for that. ) now we’re here 2019 and i still have no real connection with my parents. things change rearrange and tada there you have it springfield. ,lonely,Feeling lonely,2019-01-16 11:38:48

510,Biz5150,1547592574,1,"Hi. I'm Biz. For quite a while I've considered ending it, but not. I'm torn between leaving and staying. Honestly, it sucks. Living in this limbo is probably the worst place to be in, but that's not the main reason why I'm writing. I'm writing this to look back at myself and see where I've come from and maybe see if I can help another along the way. So here it is.

The earliest memory I have of myself is when I was probably around four or five years old, playing Jak and Dexter on the PlayStation 2 trying to get over this dumb fishing mini-game that seemed impossible to accomplish. That's where my Dad came in. He was always the one to help me through it and, with his lightning speed reactions and marksman-like accuracy, he somehow beat the level every time. I always wondered how he could beat such a fast-paced level with such ease until I got older but right then and there I knew he'd be my hero forever.

Back then I lived with my Mom and Dad in an older wooden two-story house. We had an elderly couple that lived next door who would have barbecues and invite us over to eat all the time. They were nice, I forgot their names but they somehow stuck with me. Their hospitality and friendly nature is something I could never forget. When my parents were away the couple would let me come over and babysit me until my parents got back. They were good people and now, sadly, they're probably gone. Anyways, as I can remember our house had three rooms and one bathroom upstairs and the living room, dining room, and another bathroom downstairs. Though I don't remember the color or distinct features of our house, I can remember shards of experiences I had in them. Like the one time I positioned my fingers so that the only one up was the middle finger pointing at my Mom. As I asked her what it meant she got upset and told me to stop it, but I was relentless. I wasn't putting that finger away until she told me what it meant. Of course, she only got more upset at my insubordinate behavior and yelled at me to put it down. That's when I began to cry and ran over to my Dad, who was working non-stop at his, what's now ancient, computer, and told him what happened. He shrugged it off and that's all I can remember. There was another time when I was up in my room playing with toys. I had this shopping cart while ran around like a marathon runner picking up and dropping off groceries in certain spots of my room. One corner was the store and the other was our house. The most potent thing I can remember from that time was my happiness. My childlike nature and innocence were there. Everything in the world was blissful and perfect. It was heaven.

Fast forward a few years and my parents divorced. I was probably five to seven by the time this happened and was confused, probably like most kids, for a majority of it. ""Was it my fault?"" That question lingered around my mind constantly. All the time I would ask why ""Mommy and Daddy didn't love each other anymore,"" in which they would respond with the usual ""We still love each other buddy, we're just taking a break."" That's where the backseat became a familiar landscape for me. For most weekends I'd travel up and down the state of Michigan to see my Mom or Dad until I was fourteen. The drive was about three in a half hours to get downstate and it was dreadful. The boorishness of sitting and watching the same things go by and by for so many years of my life was a real downer. My PsP was the only thing that made the trip somewhat bearable but after 2 hours of looking down at the screen your neck starts to feel like a knife was lodged in it while your eyes began to feel like they're drooping. So I drugged through it. Later in life, I got to be free of the constant car rides when my Mom moved to California where most of her family is. In between that time I felt as if I had two lives which molded the very foundation of me. Though, before all of that I had to make the biggest decision of my life.

One day as I was playing GTA San Andreas for the Xbox (yes, I may have been too young at around seven years old to play that but I was damn good at it) Mom came into the room with Dad on the phone. She had tears rolling down her face as she asked me who I wanted to live with for the weekdays. In other words, she was asking who I wanted to spend the majority of my life with. I sat there baffled by what was happening. One second I was shooting animated gangsters on the street with a controller and the next I was making a life-changing decision. I broke down. I sobbed and sobbed for what felt like an eternity. The pain I had was something I never felt before that moment. The millions of icicles that jabbed repeatedly turned in my heart. It was too much. I wanted to disappear. I wanted to go to a black void where it was only me. A place where I could be alone. A place where only my thoughts existed, nothing else. I couldn't though. I had to make my decision. To be honest, the reason for my choice, looking back, was funny. I don't remember thinking about who was the better parent or who I even liked more, though that may have been part, the most vivid thing I can remember was that my Dad was a guy and I'm a guy so I should be with him. So I chose my Dad. Weird right? I chose my Dad because he was a dude like me. Looking back, it's funny how things could've been so much different. I feel like if I was a girl that scenario would've been opposite. At the same time though, I guess my Dad never yelled at me for no reason which probably helped. Of course, I never told either one why I chose my Dad (for obvious reasons) and that's broke my life into two pieces. Two semi-parallel but at the same time intersecting lives. Mom and Dad.

My father's part of my life was enjoyable for the most part that I can remember. We lived in the northern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan in a small town with my grandparents for two years starting from second grade. My grandparents were the kindest people I could ever know for my childhood. Grandpa had his own business and wasn't home much while grandma was home always cooking up something good to eat. When Grandpa got home he'd give me a big ol' hug which squeezed the breath outta me. He'd then sneak me a Popsicle here and there when grandma wasn't watching. He was that kind of guy. Kind and sly all at the same time. I loved them and I still do. My Dad also had two brothers and one sister who were different in their own ways. My aunt was brown-haired, large, and always had an arrogant tone in her voice. She was kind but intimidating to talk to. My two uncles, one blonde and the other dark-haired, stood at about the same average height with medium size to them. They were like older brothers to me. One playing Modern Warfare and Black Ops with me while the other talked to me about life whenever he could. They're great, probably some of the best uncles I could've ever asked for. Then there was my Dad. He was the guy that got me into video games. The man that beat that annoying fishing level on Jak and Dexter. The man that stood next to me all my life. There were other parts of my Dad's side of the family, a funny uncle here, a crazy aunt there, but for the most part, they were awesome. And boy did my Dad and uncles play the guitar. Almost every day it seemed like my Dad would pull out his chocolate brown Peavey Wolfgang and completely shred. He'd play songs from Metallica, Avenged Sevenfold, Dragon Force, and bands I've never even heard of and he'd just go to town with them. My uncles were great musicians as well, I'm honestly surprised they aren't in a band right now. They were so talented. I, on the other hand, played the violin. I always thought it was so cool to see the bow move across the strings almost like an engine's pistons pushing and pulling vigorously within a transmission. I wasn't too good at it. I played from middle school up to freshman year in High school and sat fourth to fifth chair most of the time (not too good). Anyways, I digress. This is mostly about my father after all. He was and still is a good man. He always tried to make me smile and play catch whenever he could. He'd make spaghetti and steak because that's all he could really make but damn it was good. He loved me with all his heart. Really, after Mom left him I think I became the only thing he cared about. Later in life, I started to push away from him as most typical angsty teens do with their parents and it's changed everything. That's for later though, now's the time for my Mom.

My Mom is a complete flip-flop of my Dad even in terms of family. She lived down south almost at the border of Michigan and Indiana. The drive down, as I said before, sucked balls. Being there wasn't the best. Now the more I try to analyze my relationship with my Mom I start to feel that I'm too hard on her. Most memories I have about her really aren't the best and I know that we've had better times but I can't seem to get them into focus. It's like trying to focus on the moon when it's full but a dark cloud rushes to block it every time you look up. I can't find the good parts. She never liked me playing video games and worried that I ""was too young,"" and would ""turn violent,"" if I kept playing them. She had a point, I'll give her that, but the way she conveyed it was all wrong. Every time the issue would arise it would turn into her yelling. I don't know how it'd even get that way but it did. She'd yell and yell and all I can remember is me sitting there taking it one blow at a time. I know there had to have been better times like going to Disney land or some shit like that but I can't seem to remember it. She used to have a cool boyfriend though, I'll call him H for now. H was a great guy to me. He had a messed up back so all he could really do is sit on a chair and recover, but as he did that he'd ask me to play video games for him. No one's ever asked me to do that before. He wasn't too good at most games but loved the story so he enjoyed watching me play games like Batman Arkham Knight and Mafia II. It made me feel appreciated. It was a symbiotic relationship we had. He'd pretty much be watching an action-packed movie while I was playing an epic game. I loved it. I miss it. H was always nice to me too. Never the type of boyfriend that ignored you or didn't really think you mattered; rather, the type to actually care about you. He was like another Dad. After about four years of knowing him and his wonderful family, he proposed to my Mom on Christmas day. She said yes while tearing up. It was funny because of how oblivious I was to the whole situation. We were at H's parent's house opening gifts and I was the hat wearer (the person that handed out the gifts) and while he was proposing, I was looking for the next present while loudly shouting ""WHO'S TURN IS IT?!"" then turning around to see H on one knee proposing to Mom. It goes without saying that I was pretty embarrassed, but they didn't seem to mind. All they did was smile at each other. It was the first time in a while that Mom wasn't upset. Five months later my Mom told me she was moving to California to be with her family over there. The two things she forgot to mention was the real reason why she left and that I wasn't going to see H ever again. I was around twelve at the time and when I grew up to fourteen it really started to hit me. Looking back at their relationship, they did tend to fight a lot. Yelling and screaming about God knows what while I tried to play video games or sleep in my room. I blocked it out I guess. And then it all started to come back to me. I traveled to California for the Summers following her leaving and confronted her about it. She dodged the question here and there which was frustrating to say the least, but one time her sister (my aunt) slipped and said H cheated on her. Ouch. I began to understand my Mom. I could finally see her angle on the world and understood her reasoning. It still hurt though. He made a horrible decision and now he's gone. At times I'd think to myself that yes he did a bad thing, but he was still my friend. He still cared about me, right? At least that's what I thought. His family was awesome too. I wanted to see them all again but Mom wouldn't let me. I guess now it doesn't matter. After another few years, we did start to visit H's family, but not him. He apparently stopped interacting with them and vice versa. Jeez. Why do I write this? Whatever. To continue on my Mom, she went to California around the time I was twelve and had two kids, my half-brothers, with a guy we'll call O. O isn't H at all. He's the kind of guy that'll say ""You're either a football player or a pussy,"" that kind of guy. The kind of guy that makes fun of gamers like me and had some sort of animosity towards a good bit of the world for no reason. At least Mom loves him. That's when things started to take a turn.

When I turned fifteen my Mom wanted me to come out to California for a part of the Summer. After a long talk, we agreed on me staying out there for a week and things were fine. Come to find out she sends the emailed tickets to me and I see that she arranged it so I'd be in California for three weeks. Now I know that may not seem like a big deal but that's how my Mom tended to work. She'd make plans with my Dad to meet halfway to pick me up (back when she lived in Michigan) and bail out or make him drive the whole way. After so many times of that kind of shit, it got aggravating. She was breaking an important principle to me which was keeping your word, and I called her about it. I asked her why she got the tickets to be three weeks instead of one like we previously agreed upon. That's when she started to break down and cry. She told me about how when she was my age her mother died and only wanted to spend all the time she could with her. She essentially made me feel like a piece of shit. A person who didn't appreciate his mother the same way she did. I started to tear up and agreed that I'd come out for the three weeks, and after she hanged up I began to sob. I entered the conversation feeling confident that she couldn't dodge her way out of this one and left with tears running down my cheeks. She got me. She always knew how to. I vented this out to my Dad and grandma which they saw no wrong in what I did. Yes, we can all agree that one week for the Summer may be a bit short to spend with your mother but we both made an agreement. An agreement she didn't have to slither her way under to break. An agreement that was concrete. It didn't matter I guess. I went for my three weeks and left feeling resentment for my Mom. She's the only person in the world to make me feel that way. The way no parent should make their kids feel. She used the same tactic again and again and sometimes clumped my two new brothers in there to really sweeten the guilt I had. Don't get me wrong, I love my brothers with all my heart and for the times I went out there I wanted to save them from becoming anything like my Mom or O. My efforts were futile. No matter how many times I go out there I know I won't be able to save them. They'll probably end up being jocks with self-entitled attitudes like their parents.

This sucks you know. All of this. Life. I know it's not supposed to be easy but God damn it hurts. Why are you here? If you've read this far then you obviously care but why? Doesn't this suck? Isn't this boring? I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, I just don't understand anything anymore. My friends, my relationships, myself. I haven't even gotten to those parts yet but how can I? I know I said this was for me to look back on but it's for you too. For you to escape I guess. Thank you for coming this far, as boring as it is. I've never really enjoyed English class. It was too wish-washy for me, nothing like numbers. Math makes sense to me. Finding the tone of a piece of writing is so much more difficult for me to wrap my mind around unlike solving the integral of sin(x). I guess what I'm trying to say is that writing isn't my strong suit. Thank you for bearing with me. Let's continue.

Let's get more into me as a person. My academic life has been decent so far. I struggled in some areas like English class, but after putting in the hours of studying and rewriting, I'd say I've overcome most of those struggles. Besides academics, I wouldn't say I'm a selfish person. My grandparents always taught me respect, confidence, and honesty when it came to interacting with others. My Dad reinforced this while my Mom showed me how to be sly, rude, self-entitled, and a liar. I always tried to stray away from her personality but to be honest, I've probably appealed to her sly and liar-like traits more than I should've. Deep down, though, I've always liked to help others with their issues. I don't know exactly why, especially since I've got plenty of them myself, I guess seeing that smile on someone's face warms my heart as corny as that sounds. It's weird. Maybe it helps me forget about my own problems. I really don't know, but I always have the urge to help. Even when I can't exactly help others directly I always try to smile and be humorous around them. It's crazy to think that when I'm alone I almost never smile; there's nothing to smile about then. When I'm around others I notice that I'm always smiling even when I'm severely depressed. It's like a paradoxical mask I can't take off. I started to wonder if everyone does that. Maybe we're all wearing that same mask. ""The saddest people smile the brightest,"" I believe I heard Robin Williams say this (or something like that) and I've thought about it a lot. I really shouldn't be smiling but I do. I don't necessarily want to but I do. I want to say that ""I can't handle it anymore,"" but I don't. We all don't say it. Why? Why endure this torture? Is it because we're scared of rejection from our peers? Is it that we don't want to burden others with our problems? Is it that those above us will give us drugs or a cheap pep-talk to keep us going? Sorry. I ramble sometimes. These are what I worry about constantly even though it's nonsense. Whenever my friends are down I want to hear them out. I want to help even though I can't help myself.

Really, the biggest issues that hit me right now are my relationships. I do have plenty of people that I'd call friends but recently I've started to drift away from them. After drugs and alcohol came into our lives, I started to contemplate myself critically. Did I really need this in my life to be happy? Is this going to be the norm of our group for long? How do I quit this? Many other questions passed my mind like if I'm going to get caught doing something illegal, but those types of questions didn't bother me as much as the ones stated earlier. It seemed like every time I went out to a party, the only way to have fun was to get destroyed. At first, I liked it, it let me escape the stresses of life by finding a void. A void that made me feel light and weightless. A void where I lost myself. After a while, getting wasted became depressing. I reached the epiphany that this high/drunk version of me wasn't really me and shouldn't be my idea of ""fun."" I mean, there was a time when my friends and I used to have fun. A time when we were still, at least, somewhat innocent. For example, before drugs came into our lives I remember going to the playground to play soccer and having LAN parties and playing board games. We used to be happy together...without this. Without substances, we used to have real talks like this one which actually grew our maturity and ways of understanding each other. I miss it and it'll probably never come back. That isn't to say, though, that everyone fell prone to these substances.

My best friend, P, stayed away from it all (him and a few others, but he's the key player in my life). He was the type you'd expect to be the stoner kid with his crazy hair, exuberant clothing, and hipster personality, but he kept on the straight and narrow. He never did anything wrong and his parents gave him plenty of opportunities in terms of freedom, so lying to them and going behind their backs to do something they believed wrong wasn't appealing to him. I was almost envious of his self-control. Almost every friend he had, including me, tried to get him to do it in varying degrees. His girlfriend, E, seemed to be the Queen of Pressure to him. She'd play this game with him to guess a number at the same and if they guessed the same number then he'd have to do said activity which usually involved hitting her vape (What Are the Odds). You could tell he hated it, but he never lost. I never understood them even to today, but that's a whole different can of worms. All of these snippets are a can of worms barely open. My Dad's transition from father figure to stoned ""bro"" living in the same place as me, Mom coercing me to live with her, Grandma being the Mother figure but rarely being around, having so many friends yet so disconnected when around them, never finding true love, being alone. Alone. That's not true. Plenty of people enjoy my presence and want to go out but I push them away. I go online to sob about my problems but they're self-inflicted. I did this. I want attention. That's why we post this right? We're looking for help that's, in reality, superficial instead of real. Authenticity is faint. It's something I wish I was throughout my daily life. This smile. This happiness. The life I want. I know it's real and there but why can't I feel it? I went on another tangent didn't I? Damn it.

I know I've said this too many times but I apologize. If you've come this far I truly am grateful. I've been writing this for a span of a month in random intervals. Half an hour here, five-minute refinery there, and sometimes two hours of looking at it. I realize that these tangents I go off on most likely hinder my story in terms of cohesion, but nonetheless, they're still important. They're what comes to me in the moment. My true thoughts unfiltered. They're the voice that builds me up and destroys me in the same moment. They're me. Anyways, I've had an interesting time writing this. Though the snippets I've given are only scratching the surface layer. Maybe I'll write a more in-depth look at these short ideas in the future, but for now, I think I have to end it. Like I've said before, I enjoy helping others and when I think about what really helps me, it's this. My thoughts are digitally materialized for both myself and you to see now. Even though I'm not a fan of writing or analyzing literature, reading about other people's problems and writing about my own are the exemptions. I don't think I have the vocabulary to describe this but if I could put it into one word it'd be everything. Despair, depression, pathless, dubious, lonely, frustration, melancholy, happiness, pleasurable, innocent, cathartic. All of these words I'd use to describe this process of my look back on life. All of that, and hope. The one thing I think We can do to keep to stay alive is to hope life will get better. Hope that this kid can make it out. Hope that his Mom would stop using him as a social pawn. Hope that his Dad will come back to being a Dad. Hope that he's not crazy. Hope that this arrogant teenager's ramble won't just be another piece lost to the endless space of the internet but as something to truly help others. Hope that we'll find the dream job we've always wanted. Hope that our wounds will heal. Hope that a shred of our innocence comes back. Hope that when we fail we can get right back up again. Hope that we're not alone. Hope that we'll finally find love. Hope. That's all I can really say. I know it's cheap, it's cliché, but it's why I'm alive. It's the one thing I escape to when I'm alone and at my lowest point. It's the place that lets me imagine a brighter life. A life filled with romance and wonder. Hope is my void.

All of this is disgusting my mind, which is lost in all the frustrations that the nights have given me over the past months.


As I look through the window, with tons of blurry lights on the city and sad songs playing over my headphones, the weight of the loneliness hits hard, along with the wish that everything just didn't go away and out of my control, all the smiley faces that brighten my days, all the bad pop songs that made me want to dance, all the chatting that I've had with friends and other people, all of which I wished just came back. Yet they all won't.


And for a moment, when the lights came off and I came back dragging myself to my bed, hoping I could finally sleep and all that misery would go on, I though about ""what if"". What if I told her I had a crush on her? What if I got to know these people that I've barely talked to? What if I just vent off to that friend instead of saying ""everything is fine""? What if... fuck. I didn't. Things have been done, I can't change them.

     This might seem childish but ever since me and my ex broke up I’ve felt no connection to anyone. It’s been two months and she still won’t talk to me. I’ve constantly tried to make things right between us again but she doesn’t want it to happen. She was like my best friend and I lost that all because I cried on the phone when she asked for a break. I know I’m a bitch for that whatever, but all I’m trying to do is save the one connection I had with someone before it’s gone forever.

      I have to see her and sit next to her in school every fucking day and sit there like shes not the only one i want to talk to. Everybody calls me a bitch and to just move onto other people but it isn’t that simple. I don’t want her to like me or even want me anymore, I just want my friend back. Is that too much to ask?

530,EatingRawMaca,1547509056,1," 

I'm  in my 30's. And since I was 16, 17, I've struggled with mental illness -  crushing shyness, bouts of deep depression, self harm and alcoholism,  non existent self confidence, etc. My brain has never worked properly.  I've made an embarrassment of myself so many times, and done so many  regretful things, out of an ongoing sense of despair. I've never had any  help for it, nor have I sought it. I don't think there is any help to  be had.

I'm not interested in the brain fog of anti depressants.

I  think of what I've made of my life, and it is a complete disaster. I've  almost always been isolated, feeling alienated from others, looking in  on life. And for so much of my life I was full of bitterness, a real  soul destroying hatred toward the world, feeling that life had dealt me  such a awful hand which I had no real courage to play. Misanthropy is  pathetic and shameful. And now that I have matured beyond bitterness  there is nothing of value remaining. My life has been emptied of any  real content. No hope, and no happiness, and nothing worth struggling  for. I've never thought that life should be about some sort of bland  happiness. *Suffering and struggling is good*. But when the treadmill just won't budge, life becomes a listless affair. I've been going nowhere for 15 years.

I enjoy so very little, and so many things I once enjoyed I seem so distant from.

I'm  so incapable of opening up to people because for almost all of my life  there has been no one to open up to. So, there is no meaningful  connection in my life, at best a pretence of it. And I'm capable of  feeling such extreme loneliness. I hate to admit that. I go through life  repressing that, because there is no value in letting it rule my life.  And this sense of loneliness is beyond being sated, it can't be cuddled  away, or soothed by friendly words, it is rooted deep to the core of my  being. I've been alone and lost in the world since I was a child.  Loneliness, a sense of not belonging, a lack of anchorage, is a fixed  part of my personality and it will be with me forever. And trying to  connect to others risks leaving me feeling more lonely because of the  impossibility of the task. There's a brick wall around me, keeping  people out and keeping me buried away in solitude.

I'd  love to meet someone who would at least try to break through that with  me, though. Someone who thought it was worth the effort (it isn't and  will never be worth it). A nice girl who I clicked with, who accepted me  as the messed up man I am. Just someone to cuddle up on the sofa and  share tears and snacks with.",lonely,Mental illness has ruined my life.,2019-01-15 10:37:36

But at what point do I stop viewing this desert as an obstacle I’m moving through and start just viewing it as a familiar home? I can live without love. I’m thriving. I’m making shit work and keeping the mortgage paid and the lights on. Hell, I even put together a group of people to hang with from time to time. This desert is MY desert now.

I like to build and I like to put my hands and mind to the task if fixing. I think the thing I want most is to help others build a life here too.

So, I broke up with my girlfriend Friday night. She wanted to stay with me at first, but eventually understood me and accepted it the next day.

Sounds a bit weird, huh?

The thing is, I still love her. And, she said on multiple occasions that she still loves me.

I just wanted to break up because there was many issued that stacked up together. I would get angry quicly and she could start arguments easily. We were a LDR, and, tbh, it ain't easy everyday. We had massive culture differences that I believe would have corrupted our future together.

There were other minor things, but yeah, despite that, we still loved each other. But I know that there would be issues long term, so I just went what would other qualify as the easy route, breaking up.

She will probably have a bit of trouble moving on at first, but I will be happy once she finds someone more similar to her.

But me, damn. This relationship made me grow a lot, and actually helped me tone down my anger issues, but I still feel like I am not enough mature for a relationship.

I live abroad, and while I have a couple friends here, due to cultural and language barriers it's difficult for me to expand my social circle - it's why I rely so heavily with online interaction. 

Over the past few months, I've gotten involved in chatrooms, subreddits, and discord servers. Too many hate really toxic and hateful people, and way too many people totally okay with incel lingo, general misogyny, and racism. I'm a part of this sub's server, but it's so large and the chat goes so fast and I...just can't connect. I'm also older than a lot of people on this sub, and so that adds another layer of complexity (I just turned 30). 

Because of my weird circumstances, I made my own solitude solidarity server, and have slowly cultivated a few people I have gotten to know on a deeper level. I think the size is OK, but we have a lot of inactive days, so I'd like to open it up for anyone who would like to join that is also seeking authenticity.

I have zero friends. By that, I don't mean I have friends that I feel lonely with, or friends who I don't feel comfortable with, I don't mean friends who are always going out without me, not friends who I secretly wonder if they dislike me, or anything like that. I'm also not trying to say that I have friendly acquaintances who I can't take the next step with. I mean zero friends, zero people to talk to, zero people to hang out with.

I live with my mom and dad, they're both kind of as friendless as I am so we just stay at home all day. I used to talk to my mom a lot, but now I honestly can't anymore, because I realized that the way she dismisses everything I've been through and all the difficulty I have in living a normal life was making me resent her a lot, and I don't want to stop loving her. So now I just avoid her, last time we sat down and had a conversation was several months ago.

Having no one to talk to and all this free time is, to put it shortly, painful. This is pain like I've never experienced in my life, and I've been through some shit. I sometimes read a book, other times I watch a movie or a video, usually without enjoying it, and as soon as it's over I just sit and try hard to think about what to do next. Most of the times I can't think of anything, and I just feel like crying.

Obviously, like everyone, I have plenty of things I want to do in theory, but I don't want to do them in practice anymore. Loneliness completely destroys your drive to do anything. It makes you realize how we're all social beings deep down, and it feels pointless to perform tasks in a social vacuum. I realized our brains are wired to only enjoy something if it can somehow connect it to a social purpose, otherwise it feels pointless. The last man alive on the planet wouldn't be able to enjoy a movie or a videogame, and that's how I'm feeling now.

I honestly don't know what to do until march. I'm honestly terrified that I might go insane.

589,kon-el99,1547340098,1,"I started uni this past October, meaning I graduated secondary school last summer. By my second year of Sixth Form, I was fed up with my situation and just wanted to move on. I felt like school life was a dead end for me and that I’d be better off making a fresh start at uni. Since then, I’ve made one friend and two acquaintances and have met no girls I’m interested in. I’m an introvert so I don’t really like clubbing and all that. It’s a shame really because I thought I’d meet some like-minded people and maybe, just MAYBE, find a girl I like, one who likes me too. It’s not like I haven’t put the effort in. I’ve joined some societies. I go to pub quizzes. That kind of thing. I know I shouldn’t give up hope already. And I won’t. I’m pretty strong-willed. Resilience is my middle name. I suppose you could say it’s a muscle I’ve built up after years of mental and emotional exercise. But it is kind of disheartening that I have made so little progress. Maybe I overhyped myself a bit going in? I dunno.

Now it’s weird, because I find myself reminiscing about the glory days that never were. I suppose it’s more what could have been?  The fact that my future was so bright back then, when I was under no pressure to work or function like an adult or anything like that and I could just live in the moment. Don’t get me wrong, I know everybody has to grow up eventually but I don’t feel ready yet. I feel like I have to gain more xp before levelling up. It’s not what I accomplished that makes me sadly nostalgic but rather what I might have accomplished had I taken proper advantage of the opportunities I was given. Yes, those opportunities were few and far between. Yes, they just so happened to appear in the wrong place at the wrong time. Yes, I know it’s not ALL my fault so I can’t let it eat me up inside but still... 

Anyways, now I’m feeling conflicted. It baffles me that I’m now yearning for the lifestyle I couldn’t wait to abandon just one year ago. I was always largely indifferent towards most of the people in my year group but now I kind of miss them. I wasn’t even close to that many of them. I guess I wish I made more use of that time while I had it. The last few days I’ve been listening to “That Way” by the Backstreet Boys, not because I like the song necessarily but because it’s the final song that was played at our prom. I remember the DJ announcing that this would be the final song. I was sitting there with a couple other guys who don’t really like to dance while my friend was up dancing with his girlfriend. At the time, I felt a pang of emotion and didn’t really want the evening to end, even though I didn’t really socialise with anyone that night, just stayed in the corner with my few friends. When the song ended I thought to myself “Oh, that’s it...” 

It really was the end of an era, for good or ill. I was kind of in shock but was convinced I’d get over it. And I did... for a while. Now “the feels” (I hate that phrase but I’m gonna use it anyway because it best illustrates what I’m going through) are back with a vengeance. I don’t usually get all touchy-feely about stuff like that (didn’t bat an eye-lid while everyone else was crying and hugging each other when we graduated from primary school). I chalked it up to “a moment” at the time but now it’s more than that and I find myself replaying the song over and over just so I can feel that horrible heart wrenching “butterfly” feeling in my chest. If only I could turn back the clock just 5 years. I know it’s not healthy to dwell on things and I know I’ll probably make the same mistakes again if I spend too much time distracted from the here and now. I know all this. And I’m determined to push through. But this is just how I feel right now. Kind of lonely and I wanted to share.

590,ctrlaltdel_,1547339499,1,"I'm nervous--scared--that last night's encounter will end up being a one-time thing. I was high from the feeling of being wanted. He said he would come back later in the evening to continue. The later it got, the more pessimistic I grew. I heard nothing from him. Grief overtook me. I cried myself to sleep.

There have been numerous times I've felt soul-crushing sadness after masturbating. It's a vicious cycle. My thoughts tortured me when I would lie in bed post-orgasm. I wanted to be partnered. I wanted to be kissed. I yearned to be held. I wished for someone to come into my life without one foot already out of the door. I yearned to have someone in my life for the long-haul. It's fucking torture. The shitty part about that is I need the release I get from an orgasm. I'm moody when I go too long without a release. Damned if I do. Damned if I don't.

Opportunity presented itself yesterday. We exchanged messages. I didn't think he was serious about wanting to see me. I really didn't think he was serious about wanting to have sex. He likes to joke around a lot, so I really didn't take him seriously when he said he desired me from the day we met. We met a few years ago, but we've rarely talked. It turned out he wasn't joking about wanting to have sex. *What could go wrong?* I figured sex would be more enjoyable as opposed to self-pleasure. I was right about that. 

My thoughts tortured me at 3 a.m. As I cried myself to sleep, I prayed to be strong. I prayed for my bitterness to set back in. Bitterness had worked beautifully for me in the last ten years: bitterness turned into anger, and then I felt as cold as the world around me. I ended up not giving a fuck about being alone *for the most part*. It's really nice to not constantly think about loneliness.

I can't shake this sadness today. I'm seriously thinking about letting him string me along if that is his intention. I feel it would be foolish of me to believe that he would stick around. No one in my past has cared to stick around. Anyone who had made verbal indication of wanting something permanent had shown otherwise. I should know better by now. Still, there's a small part of me that hopes that he would see me as someone who could be a permanent fixture in his life. I like him. I find him attractive. He's the complete package. I feel I'm being stupid about this. I don't want to fall flat on my face in despair. I don't want to feel utterly depressed weeks after being cut loose. I don't want to create a fantasy out of nothing concrete.

I have to remind myself to be strong. I need to be strong. I need to not give a fuck about wanting someone to love. I have others who depend on me. My family needs me. I can't let myself fall apart. Fuck.",lonely,My toe is dipped into the water,2019-01-13 11:31:39

614,somewhereinside,1547247808,1,"Hi. I'm 17, college student, haven't ""made"" a friend once in my life - I had friends but only because they approached me, introduced to friends of friends, playdates and classmates etc. Never have I actively connected with someone and I honestly don't know how to; there's a chance I may be on the autistic spectrum but I'm not that impaired and my parents went against me seeing a specialist when younger, I can function in every way properly except socially.

At the end of yr6 (age 11) I had lost all my primary school from breaking up and going to different secondary schools, it stung for a little bit but within the first month of secondary school I became the school bookworm: spending break, lunch and spare moments in lesson reading books. I was bullied a little but I don't care anymore. When GCSEs neared I swapped generic books for revision and course-related material, by combining this frequent early revision with my excersise routine by my dedication to wake up at 5:30AM; optimised lesson time due to no school drama and, what I considered mental harmony by never having to deal with other people's problems or lust or romance I thought of myself as a streamlined modern human: The Ubermenschen 

I was legitimitely happy with being alone until yr10, had my first and only girlfriend (she asked me out similar to my friends only befriending me) causing me - for the first time - to crave being with anyother human being. So since we broke up after she cheated four months in I've been trying to integrate back into the solo life but it just hasn't fit together right. I started seeing my future, I'd see apparations of what I would look like as I slowly decayed and became forgotten. But after so long I know the reason why I haven't been able to get back to my old self.

A couple of months after my breakup I was still destraught but tried to make ""friends"" for the first time, whereby I was Facebook messaging classmates, these faulty desperate friends fell apart quickly, ending even quicker than my only romantic partnership. But when that managed to stay around was who I will refer to as W.

W approached me to make friends, as they all have, as word got out that I was ""finally opening up"". Secrets my ex released about me had become common knowlegde by this point but I could confide myself into W whenever my inner feelings were hurting me, something what was only a minor issue before my ex despite the contents of my anguish not changing. Besides me talking through my issues with W nothing else really happened, I would send a meme and get a nice thumbs up in return, we'd exchange words sometimes in school two: but as my affections for them grew I wanted to talk more, even to be physical in some way. However I could see the truth, either I'd humiliate myself by trying to asking her out and maintain a embarrasing plutonic stance, or have another relationship that would eventually end - I saw no other way and I hid my feelings.

I've been in college 4 months now. Since the summer holiday 3 months prior (total = 7) me and W had gradually talked less and less, only getting a thumbs up if I sent a meme: humans words getting little response. A week before the start of college I got hospitalised and got brain surgery. In my near death moment all I could think about was W being with them for eternity in eachother's arms, so much that in my first moments of conciousness all I could do was tell my nan that I needed her to tell W what happened. For the rest of my hospital stay all I could think about was talking with W, at one point crying so hard because I loved W, crying myself to sleep imagining I was lying with them. 

Upon discharge I got onto social media and found I got message by W, they told me they loved me (interpreted platonically) but just hoping I'd get well soon. I was thrilled to talk with W, we had a bit of a stable conversation, its rare for me to manage that with W therefore anyone. We found out we would share one lesson together. By the time I was deemed fit for college I had already missed the first week, so everyone else was settled into friendship groups, seating plans, the way college and courses work (what I'm still struggling with). But I got there and was anticipating the lesson I shared with W, to have real life interaction after so long and so much. And I was very much dissapointed in that when lining up for the lesson and in the lesson they didn't speak to me at all, W definately saw me but we wouldn't even message on the internet unless I intiated communication like always, with W leaving me on ""seen"" until it suited them or ignoring me indefinately: I remember one time I caught them out on this, we had a test but I got pulled out of lesson to see my neuro-doctor after completing before I knew what I was missing for the rest of the lesson, after asking W they left me on seen for 3 hours; I replied ""oh I'll take that as nothing then"" finally getting back a ""no we just marked the test"".

A couple of days ago I was in a canteen on my normal solo lunch break, collecting my lunch what is the same everyday when I see W  with a group of new friends they made and left me for to excitingly be. I'm gonna be honest and say I was angry, despite trying to be the best friend possible and have so much love for this person they had phased me out of their life to start over. So I have had the resolve to shut off communications forever, before she replies to the meme she's currently ignoring; the thumbs up I will recieve from it will send endorphins to my brain and reinforce my love for W so I need to break the viscious cycle now. I'm just going to type ""no more friends, don't talk to me anymore"" but that in itself is attention-seeking, maybe I should just unfriend them and be done with it.

I'm sorry for writing this, I just felt like I need to and I know I'm about to feel the struggle of getting back into the loniliness again, just this time without the false cover of a fake friendship. I'm sorry this is so long. I'm sorry for wasting anyone's time I'm sorry",lonely,Think I'm ready to cut off the loose ends,2019-01-12 10:03:28

After this day I actually knew what people thought of me. Time went by and I kept becoming introverted, widrawn from friendships, talking much with people. This happened for years till where I literally never told anyone or talked to any new person. but I acted like I was interested in everything and did all the things my so called ""friends"" enjoy. Some of it even included ""bullying"" ( I just hate this, whener I see bullying I just want to leave so bad). Time goes and goes and alevels. I totally fk up and drop out of high school 1 after 1 year.did nothing for 1 year but gaming. My gaming addiction is became worse. O relied on games thinking I can make some friends there but I could not find any? All that matters to people are if your a girl or that you are a god at games. My gaming addiction got worse at the time of high school that in some test papers I kept repeating words like ""it goes from root to root"". I just don't know. My life's so fucked up. I decided to join collage and it's been 1 year and I don't know anyone in class. I just hate myself.i wish I could kill myself because I feel like no one really wants to be friends with me.

I told couple of other people they laughed at me as well. 

My parents: all they tell me is I need to see a doctor and keeps scolding me. I don't need a doctor I just need a bullet in my head. I'm addicted to gaming cause I wanna find a friend who will play with me atlest for few minutes. Sure there's many cool online communities but whenever I type instead of talk no one replies. They just leave after playing with their friends. I actually tried speaking to people but I just can't.

619,Stoner_sandwich,1547239255,1,"So basically, I've been dying to get into a relationship for the longest time, I've been trying to clean up my act for as long than I can remember, because I've always been the forever alone guy and I wasn't ok with it. And the entire time I could never shake the feeling of inferiority and burning jealously of people who had it easy in dating. That along with my dwindling social circle meant I was having a pretty rough time. 

And then it finally happened. A few weeks ago, I hit it off with a girl from my college, someone I thought I could never get with because she was so shy and distant. I can't describe the feeling, the most relieved and relaxed I've felt in ages. Fucking finally, I was good enough for someone. I actually felt confident and good about myself. 
She seemed very excited about the whole thing too, because she apparently had an eye on me for a while and we shared interests so we had tons of stuff to do and talk about. We did have a deal to give each other some space, cause exams are coming and we both really need to get our grades up.

And then suddenly... radio silence. No fight, no disagreement, no awkward moments, the time between replies just kept getting longer. As of writing this, I haven't heard a word from her in 2 days. I'm not even that clingy, I don't need constant messages or anything, we both agreed that we don't like texting, but this isn't ok. Its one thing to take your time and study, but I can see she's been active everywhere online, she's just ignoring my messages. I have no way of confronting her about this eye to eye, since she lives on the other side of town and our schedules mean we never run into each other in classes. 

So now, after all that weight dropped off my chest, its all back there again and I feel much worse than I did before. I'm scared to just give up, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to put my foot down and go back to the single life again. Just the thought makes my stomach turn.

626,HentaiBaka100,1547225406,1,"I woke up late for class from a dream about my ex who never seemed to actualy like me. Now I feel too sick to even leave the house and I'm lying here trying not to cry.

We went out for a month, we never even kissed but it's the only relationship I've ever had in my pathetic life and it feels like the world is just toying with me now.

I must be an awful person right? I have lots of friends... I think. But In 22 years I'm still a fucking virgin, I'm still constantly lonely, and despite how much I've improved myself I'm still a fucking loser.

I looked down at my dick this morning and wondered why I even have the fucking thing. I'm be a useless virgin forever right so what's the fucking point?

I honestly wish I was born a woman at some points. Yhey don't have to put the effort into finding boyfriends, they just have to let them walk up and say yes or no. Why can't I have it that easy? Why can't a girl come up to me and ask me out? That's what gender equality is all about right? So why does the guy have to do EVERYTHING.

I just needed to vent... I'm literally lying here crying after I woke up. I'm a pathetic awful person and I'm probably not loved for a damn good reason.",lonely,I woke up crying today.,2019-01-12 03:50:06
627,ChestnutSlippers,1547217639,1,"Me and my four best friends are incredibly close, or so I thought. We are always happy and kind to each other, I absolutely love them and I thought they loved me. We never had any arguments or issues with each other, always celebrate each others birthdays and texting/facebooking when we are apart.

As we all work full time now, a couple months ago we all decided to arrange 1 day a week we could meet up at a local pub. We were all pretty flexible due to having day jobs and living close to each other. I said I couldn't do Thursdays due to having my niece that night, but any other day would be fine, we thought maybe a Tuesday or Friday, but nothing was fully decided.

Over the past couple of months we saw each other around as we live in a smallish town, and continued to text and facebook and they would keep saying to me ""We will have to sort out our weekly meet up sesh soon I can't wait!"" I rarely go out so I was really hyped for it.

Then today one of them put something on Facebook ""Weekly sesh with the girls!"" and a photo of the four of them together. I was shocked and confused. I'm friends with one of the bar staff and asked him if they went regularly, and he said ""yes they've been coming here together every Thursday for the past 2 months.""

I couldn't believe it and I don't know what to do. There was no signs at all that they disliked me or wanted to cut me off, as far as I knew we were all good friends. There wasn't a single moment when I thought ""Maybe they dont like me as much as they like each other."" 

How should I react to this? I'm actually heart broken. I don't want to see or talk to them again, but at the same time feel like I can't trust anybody now. I don't want to make new friends because no matter how sure I am that they are real friends, this is always going to be in the back of my mind. It's really ruined me.",lonely,Friend group been hanging out weekly without even telling me.,2019-01-12 01:40:39

629,LehGeek,1547214704,1,"Besides the obvious answer of “I’m lonely”, I mean. Why have you found yourself on this side of the internet? I personally have two major reasons.

First, I really enjoy listening to the plights of others. I find it beneficial to learn from the actions of others, and love offering my own perspective when I can. The more opinions there are, the more likely it will be for a solution to be reached. There are a lot of opportunities to do that here, and I find it enjoyable.

Second, I’ve recently lost all of my friends from my main friend group. I’ve assessed for a while, and realized it wasn’t much my fault, but it has heavily impacted my daily social interaction. I was already distancing myself before losing the group, so it’s only become worse since then. I am trying to get back to trusting those around me and interacting more, but I’ve found it hard to reach out to people in this transition period. Here, I have found a place I can air my grievances and concerns whenever I need it.",lonely,What brings you to r/lonely?,2019-01-12 00:51:44

it was weird but for some reason his voice kinda comforted me...? like someone was actually talking to me even though i dont even know them. 

after the call ended i just kind of laid there on my bed and thought about how nice that was. how nice it would be to listen to someone's voice and have someone talk to me...

634,MountainManJoe2,1547197888,1,"I'm extremely depressed. I have really bad social anxiety and an introvert. Making friends is next to impossible. When I do manage to talk to someone, they get bored of me that same day. I get ghosted constantly. Just got ghosted last night, thought things were going smooth. Nope.

Work is becoming a complete shit show for me. Honestly thinking of quitting tomorrow, just saying fuck it.

People don't check up on me, people ignore me, people just generally don't want to be around me. I get it tho, I'm boring. Everyone says just be yourself, if people don't like you for it then move on. How can I move on when it happens with everyone? it's gotten so bad I can barely hold a conversation since I have so little communication with people now. It's getting worse too.

I'm looking to move states this year. Why bother though? Same shit, different state and no money after leaving.

635,capotado,1547196348,1,"I have a group of friends that care about me, and yet I still feel like they push me away or don’t care about me. I have a decent family, but the second I see they’re less lonely than I am I feel cut off. I don’t understand how people can just be so out there, and the thought of crowds terrifies me. I’m always so scared of what people will think about me, that I end up never opening up to anyone. I’ve never tried to actively pursue a relationship, even when I am interested in one. 

The worst part about my loneliness isn’t about myself being lonely, but my awareness to how my own attitude affects my connections to other people. How I push other people away, even when they’re trying to help, has always backfired, yet for some reason I continue to do so. 

And I don’t know why I can’t stop. I tell myself that it’ll get better, and somehow as time goes by I’ll get more extroverted and somehow I’ll grow to fully appreciate my connections, yet I’ve been telling myself this for years and nothing has changed. In fact, things have only gotten worse. 

So here I am, writing this post on my second account at 3 AM because I’m too insecure to fully admit I have insecurities, fully knowing that even if I receive help, I’ll only push it away more. And as immature as this entire post sounds, I would really appreciate some advice.

641,Malammore762,1547185185,1,"I feel completely derailed since holidays ended. I was at least semi-happy and was able to not focus so much on not feeling lonely. The transition into 2019 is making my head spin. 

New Year's Eve I had a nasty fight with a family member. Even though it was resolved I feel it kicked off the year with negativity.

I had a pretty decent friendship going with someone. They disappeared for a while and now they're back. Something feels missing and empty now. Things were going so well with them and now there's a major jam up. What the fuck is going on?

I had a really bad disagreement with another friend. I feel that he's been extremely selfish and immature about things I was able to ignore before. Even though I haven't brought it up to him I no longer feel the same as I did. 

I'm having painful realizations now about someone else. I'm not as important to this person as they were to me. Even though I called them on it and we had an argument that was resolved I still feel like shit. We made a ""truce"" and I'm right back to acting like everything is fine because I hate looking weak and losing face. 

2019 has me all fucked up. I used to think New Years meant nothing...just another calendar in the trash...But I feel like I've woken up on a different planet. How did I get here? Where is everyone? How do I find myself or anything else? I  was already fucking sad and now something is just making it worse.

All I can think of now is how badly I lack any human affection. My creative writing is changing. I feel like I was stabbed in the chest until the tip of the blade broke off. I'm dying on the inside internally bleeding. 

The little solace I had left has been snatched away from me. My hours at work are even being cut. It's just all hitting me at once.

I think I should try to calm down now before I have an anxiety attack. I seriously feel the blood being sucked out of my body. Out of my soul. I just wish it would stop. 

I didn't mean for the post to be this lengthy. Thank you for reading.

643,ProgressIsALifestyle,1547180425,1,"People often say that small towns are the least lonely places, and maybe that's true if you grew up within the community, but not if you move into it. I live in a tiny rural town, and my days have become crushingly lonely. There isn't a single meetup group around me, there were like 50 potential people on Tinder when I used to be on it, and there are next to no job opportunities outside of retail. This is compounded by the fact that I can't afford a car, or really even to go to a bar right now. My relationship of over a year just ended, and every single person I was acquaintances with, I met through my former girlfriend. I've never felt more lonely, and I don't know how to meet people - especially without money or a car. Right now I'm trying to focus on my own health and on saving money, but it's so fucking lonely and repetitive I want to blow my brains out. I created a meetup group where people can meet new people and play board games, but I'm so broke trying to get rid of my cc debt that I can't get games or snacks for the meetup. I also don't even have a table for us to play on, other than a tiny coffee table - and I don't know of any places where we could meet alternatively. That, combined with my usual anxiety, has prevented me from actually scheduling a meeting. Thanks for reading, I'm just super tired all the time and feel like I'm half machine most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone has the problem of having literally nothing to say when in a group of people that are socially superior to you?  Like being there with them, listening to the conversation and have no way to add value to it.  I'm not talking about being shy or reserved, just being there silently observing and feeling like shit because you know that eventually leads to people avoiding you.  

&amp;#x200B;

The rare times that I have something to say, literally no one listens to me, probably because they're used to me never saying anything.  It feels terrible.  That's why I've always liked 1 on 1 conversations, but in 24 years I've only had a handful of people I've clicked with.  For some reason I always end up driving them away.

It felt like for the first time, someone actually understood me, my anxiety, and my loneliness. She said she was going through the same thing. So we decided to start dating. Everything was going well. It was as if my life had purpose now. This whole process took about 3 months. But all of a sudden, she stops texting. She won't pick up my calls. She keeps posting stories on Instagram tho. After a week she finally responds saying she feels forced to talk to me and this whole thing feels like a responsibility. 

So that was it. A 3 month buildup and an abrubt ending. I feel horrible and it's worse than before.

674,throwawaywhatever767,1547128662,1,"Hi everyone,

This is going to be a long rant and I’m sorry if it’s not the right place to post this on. I don’t even know where to begin, but I guess I’ll give some background information first because I have quite a lot to say.

I’m from Romania basically, there’s no need to hide that since it’s not like somebody can figure out who I am. I’m 18. As you all know, Romania is very homophobic and anti-gay, plus most of my family is like that, including my own parents who would kick me out if they found out I’m gay.

I think I should start with what really triggered everything. I was talking to this guy and somehow we got to talk about meeting guys and relationships and he has a strong belief that physical attraction is the same as lust/sexual attraction and that each human interaction’s purpose, with people that one is attracted to, is sex. That totally pissed me off. No matter how hard I tried to explain that there are people out there looking for friends or relationships (like myself) to whom sex is one of the last things they think about, he wouldn’t get it. If I’m attracted to someone, I want to get to know them better, see what they’re like and see where we’re headed and if eventually I get into a relationship with that person, then yes, sex will matter as well, but it’s not the only thing that matters in a relationship. And also, there are guys who I’m attracted to just sexually maybe, there’s a difference if I see a guy and say, “He’s so good looking, I wonder what he’s packing underneath all that” and if I see another one and say, “He’s handsome, I should make a move or say hi” but I still wouldn’t have sex with a stranger or someone I barely know - not that there’s anything wrong with that. I’m in no position to judge anybody. Everyone is free to do whatever they want. Ultimately, I asked my friend what was her opinion on what I had talked with that guy and she surprisingly agreed with what he said.

How I got to chat with this guy is I’ve decided to try dating apps with people from here again, I tried Tinder where I matched with him but that’s about it, I had 4-5 matches and no messages except from him and this other guy interested in FWB. I downloaded Planet Romeo again where except for 2-3 messages from guys who actually wanted to chat, the rest of the messages, at least 20, were from guys asking me to have sex with them or offering me money for sex and unsolicited dick pics when I specifically said on my profile I’m not looking for that. What I am looking for is friends and a relationship. I thought I’d give the apps a try again, thinking that maybe things will be different, but they were not. This is how most guys from Romania are hence why I am currently using Yubo (for meeting people all around the world) and Gaysir (Norwegian dating website because I like Norwegian guys)
I never really liked using apps with guys that are nearby since none of them are looking for something serious. Also, yes, things are way more different on Yubo and GaySir and usually on most dating apps I have been on, with few to no Romanian guys, I have rarely gotten unsolicited pics or requests from people asking me to trade or any of that. They actually read your bio and respect your choices.

As I said, I’m looking for friends/relationship and when it comes to dating, I want to date someone long-term, grow and build together, help each other become better people, not just for fun or for solely the purpose of having a partner. I don’t want to waste my time. I am not going to date somebody just so I could pass time. Moving on, after that talk with that guy, I kind of completely lost my hope that I will ever find a boyfriend, there was still some left though. Before my break up with my ex a few days before Christmas, I used to like myself, love myself, be confident, I used to be positive and happy and just laugh it off and move on whenever life kicked me in the butt. After the break up, there were a few days where I needed to pick myself up and things eventually got back on track - I was myself again, positive, happy, content with who I am, realizing my worth and all that. 
A little bit of information to give some insight as to why I felt that way is because it was a long distance relationship - I was supposed to go to Norway to see my ex-boyfriend in July but we went separate ways. Basically, he got bored of me and became distant, he wasn’t as affectionate, he stopped acknowledging the things I said to him, brushed me off, went on a dating app behind my back while he said we were on a break but apparently then he changed his mind and said we were not in a relationship anymore. I put so much effort into the relationship and always communicated what bothered me and tried to explain why I feel the way I feel but it was the same, things never changed. Apparently, I had changed and I was the one who was a different person and who was crazy. The amount of love, effort and affection wasn’t reciprocated. Whereas I was doing whatever I could to save money to come there, even started selling some of the stuff I didn’t use anymore, he was buying himself expensive stuff like AirPods for example or expensive clothes and he didn’t know whether he was going to come visit me as well since he said he didn’t know if he was going to have money. So I finally decided to end it after having been gaslighted like that; I initially begged him to take me back but after having seen that he went on a dating app again - I got the app where we met to see if he’s back on it again and he was - that was the last straw for me , I had belittled myself and promised that I would actually try and change just for him but enough was enough.

This is how all my relationships were. I ended up being cheated on, got bored of, being called crazy and told that I’m too needy and clingy, being used because my first true love admitted to having used me just to get back to his ex, another one of my ex's ghosted me, another one of them kept calling me crazy and that there’s something wrong with me (he eventually realized that it was his fault and he regretted his actions but I did not get back with him obviously) and my last ex, well I have already told you. How lucky could one possibly be!! Lol.

Anyway, my last relationship kind of screwed me up somehow, I’m scared of getting attached to somebody else, I’m scared of opening up to people again, I’m scared of starting over with someone else and I’m scared of trusting people again because I feel like in the end they will always leave me. There are days when I don’t feel as beautiful anymore, I don’t feel smart, I don’t feel like I have a nice body anymore, I feel hideous and like a failure, I don’t know anything anymore. That might be also due to the fact that my dad always drags me down almost on a daily basis telling me that I’m not even capable to do this or that or calling me an idiot or dumb or stupid and just insulting me pretty frequently, I try to avoid him most of the times. However, don’t get me wrong, I don’t always feel like that, I am aware I’m not as ugly and dumb as I think I am. I love myself and I love my body and I become pretty confident and try to get out of comfort zone a lot of times.
From my POV, it’s hard to find a boyfriend because nobody is really that interested in me, guys talk to me and then they just stop out of nowhere or block me or leave me on read, seen, etc. I’m not picky or anything like that, all I want is a decent-looking guy (I’m not expecting an Adonis since I’m not one either) who’s going to love me for who I am and the way I am, who’s going to care for me and no matter what happens, be there for me at the end of the day, who won’t have to second guess whether they want to be with me or not. I don’t care about money or social status or any of that crap. I don’t know what to do, I’m not desperate to find a boyfriend, I’m not trying to rush it, but I feel alone and really lonely. I crave intimacy. I’m not on here looking for pity but I’m confused as to how to deal with everything.


Thank you in advance. Sorry for the long read too.

680,0mega_Nebula,1547099569,1,"You ever had a girl who you really, really loved? Was that girl also one of your best friends? Thats where I am right now. 

We hang out a lot, make jokes, and have a decent amount in common. But no matter what, I feel unsatisfied with it all. I know it's selfish, but it's the truth. We've only gotten closer recently, and I can tell that things are tense, and not in a good way. It's all my fault too. 

I've asked her out a few times. She always gives the same, vauge answer of ""maybe/I don't know"". I understand when she says this, because I'm the absolute worst at timing. It's thanks to this that the rides home she gives me after practice are just awkward talk and silence. All I can think about during those rides is asking her out again, but there's no reason at all to trust my instincts, so I don't out of fear. 

She's the only one I can really open up to but at the same time everything that I want to open up to is about her. Hell, even as i write this i cant stop thinking about her seeing this, even though it wont ever happen. Opening up, while necessary, usually makes everything terrible.

Like when you talk about how you never kissed anyone before and she goes and gives you a kiss and it's the most amazing feeling in the world, and when you ask why she says that she just wanted to give me my first kiss before college. Like how knowing that the kiss was a one time platonic thing and it didn't mean anything to her. Like how that hurts so much more than never having kissed anyone. Like how you forget how that kiss felt and your desperate to remember. Like how you realize that even though you didn't mean to, you effectively guilt tripped her into kissing you and now you feel like a monster. 

Like how she constantly talks about how bad her past boyfriends have been and you want to make her happy and be with her but you can't be ""that guy"" who pounces on any opportunity to ask a girl out. 

Like how you're the least preferable option out of all of the group she's in and for good reasons. 

Like how you want to talk to her about all of these things so badly but you can't because you'd make her uncomfortable and that's the last thing you want to do. 

Like how... you know this is all because of your selfishness.

I was 6 when I was raped and couldn’t tell a single soul for the next 10 years. Growing up, being a feminine, bullying was a big part of my life. Which made me hate myself. More years to that I already saw depression knocking on my door. I was 14 and 15 and begging to die every single day. 

Things changed when I decided to come out at that very age of 15. Turns out it a big deal for people around here like I care. It gave me hope, confidence and unapologetic approach to life. 

I don’t consider myself much of complaining kid but there’s just things which gets wired in a way when you have to live life in so much for the most of your childhood. 
First, of never ever being able to felt loved for who I’m, first by parents then by friends. I can realise they do care and stuff about me but it will never be for who I’m. And you feel that blankness in their love.
Second, loneliness, oh my old friend, it is fucking lonely even before I came out and after I came out with a little unexpected support. That loneliness is just wired. And this is what I want to complain about. 

I fought everything I went through all alone and it made me a strong person. It’s been months I recovered a lot and finally was able to love myself, my life’s been changed ever since but the loneliness it grasps every night and there’s no one to complain about
I can go to my straight friends and they will never shut up about their relationship problems 

And for me who had to grow without a single day of feeling loved is paradoxically unpleasant.
When I say how much loneliness kills me I mean I literally mean I can kill to feel being loved by someone just for a single day for who I’m

I can go around fucking 30 men from grindr but the feeling never. I don’t know how to help myself here and I’m sure rest of our generation out there.

We are The Glory Hole, a group of nerds and loners from around the world with ages ranging from 16 to 35 that get together every day to hang out and pass the time. We are a voice-active server for meeting new people and making friends. We run a popular weekly movie night as well as clubs &amp; competitions, and have a variety of channels for great conversations and plenty of laughs.

**Our Philosophy?**

While we aim to facilitate a fun and welcoming place for online strangers to meet and make friends, our core philosophy rests on the concept of free and open discussion. This means the staff takes a hands-off approach in regards to the opinions of the users and the language used. At the end of the day, The Glory Hole is all about hilarity and friendship, nevertheless, if you are easily offended, this probably isn’t the place for you.

**General Life?**

The server consists of text, media, and voice channels where users share their interests, pets, favourite videos, etc, and have discussions of all varieties. Most of the action happens in the voice channels however, where we have rooms for watching movies, listening to music, and playing video games in addition to large rooms for rowdy discussions and smaller rooms for more quiet conversations. Sometimes we’re all in a big room together, chilling out as we play video games, and other times we splinter off into separate rooms to partake in differing activities.

**Should You Join?**

We have a great group of friends already, but we are always open to welcome newcomers into our fold. A group of people like The Glory Hole is an amazing way to make new friends and to fill those lonely evenings up with lots of laughter and other voices. So if you're 16+ and at all interested in joining our group or poking your head in to see what’s up, I welcome you to follow this link: [https://discord.gg/H4w58Px](https://discord.gg/H4w58Px)",lonely,"The Glory Hole, a fun group of friends on Discord welcoming new members!",2019-01-10 01:42:49

705,UnusualInvite2,1547036519,1,"I've been reading some of the posts here, and I felt somewhat lonelier, instead of feeling that there are people out there like me. And I don't blame anyone for that!  
I'm a nearly 30 years old gay man, and I feel ridiculously lonely. It's true that I have my brother and my mum, but it feels like they have this thing of theirs now, and I'm just an occasional visitor in this niche.   
I have very few friends too, but I don't feel like I belong in their world. All of them except for one is straight, and my only gay friend, well, we just are different, and being with him makes me feel like I might have missed so much of life, and this makes me feel like crap. Perhaps I'm a bad person who's jealous, I don't know. But I like it that he's able to live his gay life fully, it's just that it saddens me that I've had virtually no experience with men. I even wonder if I do have any friends at all.  
Now, this will sound like a sob story, but I have never had any real friend my entire life. I mean, not even in Kindergarten. I used to talk to some kids, but I don't remember playing with them or being in their groups. I just remember daydreaming a lot. That would be a world with lots of magic and stuff.  
Things did not really change when I joined elementary school. I was gay, and it was in the mid 90s, and there wasn't this 'gay' thing yet. Hell, I did not even know why I preferred playing with the girls, or why I wanted to sit next to the prettiest boys, or why I liked it when the guys treated me as a sissy back then. So I wasn't really with the guys, and not really with the girls, so kinda on my own.  
Things were worse at home. I did not go outside to play because I was not allowed to. And if I ever played that would be with the cousins who always beat the shit out of me, but I still liked playing with them, but it wasn't until I was 10 or 11, that I felt like, 'Damn, I'm not even their friend'.  
Ironically my father had me admitted to an all boys High School. While I somewhat did 'man up' not to be the victim, I never fitted with any group. I was not with the nerds, because they had all sort of games and stuff, and I had none. Not with the athletes because I was overweight. Not with the 'normal' because I was weird. Just alone. I desperately tried to get into groups. I even tried to join the bullies, and I am extremely ashamed that I even bullied some of the guys, despite getting bullied myself. Years later, I would try to find some of them and apologise. But it wasn't anything harsh, like getting physical or severe psychological abuse, but it was still bad of me to do so. Anyway, I have yet to apologise to 2-3 of them. I have even crossed path with them, but never gathered up the courage to apologise.  
Now this is going to sound like some serial-killer-in-the-happening story.  But it was around my time in High School that I started realising that I might have OCD, and I used to have these really foul thoughts ([intrusive thoughts](https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/unwanted-intrusive-thoughts)), and for years I have struggled whether I deserved to be alone because of the nature of these thoughts, which I felt like were really my 'inner desire' or something. I couldn't talk about it with my mother because she was herself kinda damaged (because of my father - abusive, psychotic and violent), and I did not have friends, so I just lived with it, and this kinda impeded my attempts into being social.

However, it was also around that time that I met someone ONLINE. I kinda really liked him, and he was my only friend for a while. It might sound pathetic, but I also feel like I kinda fell in love with him. I did not meet him, because he was still in love with someone, but that someone had left the country for his studies, and also because I was overweight. So I tried losing weight, trying to look pretty for him, and which I did, but I got lots of stretch marks, and which just destroyed my already miniscule self-esteem, so I was terrified that he wouldn't like me because of how my body looked like now.  
Earlier on, I joined one of those chatroom, this was a time when we did not even have mobile phones with colour screen (early 2000s), and I met this guy for something 'casual', but when he saw me naked, he just said that he had to go, and this kinda remained with me.  
Anyway, I did not feel like I needed anybody because I had this guy, even if it was all online, but it just wasn't real, so it just faded away, and it's been probably around 6 years or so that I have not heard of him. What is even more pathetic in all this, is that I never met him; there are days when I feel like what if he was just imaginary, and that I'm mad. It sortof hurts to think of him, 'cause I had allowed myself to think that he was THE ONE.  
Anyway, so I did not meet anyone else; I was always sickly (actual sickness which required surgery in 2016 - but I'm hopefully cured now), depressed, moody, and I felt ugly as fuck.   
Regardless of all this, I actually tried meeting with guys. I was now a 6'2, mixed brown guy, who was lean, and who got lots of attention from girls. I mean a hell of a lot of it.  
So much that I felt like as I wasn't getting any guys, I should really try with girls, but it was hard. I tried it once, twice, and thrice. But I felt so bad about not ever being able to return the feeling, that it was all finished in a one-date thing.  
Yes, I did try to meet guys. Lots of them. We now had Facebook, and there was Skype, technology just opened millions of doors. But it just did not work.  
At one point, I remembered that I was so bitter after he was gone that I shut myself down for a a year or two. Then, when I started looking for guys, nobody seemed to like me. I must have chatted with a thousand man, but nothing came up from it.  
I felt like perhaps there was something wrong with me, because I was already so fucked up you know, not as fucked up as an ISIS victim forced into sexual slavery, but just fucked up.  
I met guys; I tried to be nice, but nothing. I once went to meet this guy, and after a movie, he told me that he got a call from his mother. Then another, who told me that I had dead eyes. Then another, then another, then another.  
I even started meeting with creeps, people who said they were 20, but were really in their 40s, just because I felt like probably life was unjust with them too, and that these people were really me after 20 years or so.  
Anyway, after my surgery, I gained tremendous amount of weight. But it was also a time when my father wreaked havoc at home (told everyone he was going to kill himself because of me and my mum: LOL), and I felt like perhaps this is how I was meant to live. Perhaps there was no ending to all of this, so I did not even try to lose weight. I, of course, did not get any attention at all from guys anymore.  
Back in the present, I have by now lost around 30 pounds or so, and I'm kinda looking better. I'm trying to work on my appearance, and even got myself a half sleeve done, which masquerades the very old and thin stretch marks magnificently. I feel like I have to give myself a chance again, because if I don't, who will.  
But now, it's been quite a while, since I have been feeling different. I feel like I'm too old now. I feel like that who's going to want a guy, so physically and mentally damaged like me. I feel like a freak, a freak who's still a virgin at 29.  
So this is why I feel ridiculously alone. I'm the kind of guy who sometimes hugs a pillow, and cries himself to sleep. But there are times like when I like to imagine I'm hugging someone who loves me, and I could hear his heartbeats and his warmth, and stuff.

711,TheEternalLoser1,1547017442,1,"I'm a lonely dude despite of what I appear on the outside. I am on psychiatric medication (setraline) and yet I drink alcohol because I feel I have to match my (few left friends) . Everytime when I drink alcohol my head hurts like crazy and I sweat at night afterwards. My liver and kidneys sting and I feel very dizzy. I was able to put up with it like two years ago but now it just damages my body to the point I'm not able to work anymore

Besides, I always make stories in my head of revenge and comebacks while I don't do anything to set straight the things in real life. I took the Jordan Peterson's personality test turns out I have a very high rate of withdrawal. Which is very true because I usually quit after very small period of time of what I'm doing and I lose ambition and hope very quickly.

Whenever, I'm chatting to girls I'm imagining possible outcomes and I'm just locked into staying put to the phone or the PC because (she may respond, she may come to me/I can go to her to fuck) . 

Ofc, that very rarely happens and I often waste my valuable youth doing nothing but looking in the mirror and imagining I am some sort of a great dude . That is despite having a job and a decent image outside of the society. But that took a great toll of my health since when I drunk while I was on meds I usually overslept and had a very chaotic program. 

I don't feel like I have to be accepted the way I am and that's why I took up to drugs, ciggies and alcohol. Smoking brings me closer to people in a break because I'm always home alone and few people (at least my parents do) care about my state of being.

That is , shall I say my fault because I sometimes stay stuck in a state of (I don't give a shit + Too anxious ) to initiate contact. I have very-low confidence in myself although I can't say I'm bad at all. 

But the attitude I have in regard to women it's what pushes them way (in most of the cases). Ofc, apart from my very low height\[5.10/176\] and dick size\[6.3/16\]cm  (if we reach that)

Days go by I don't even wash and I reek because I'm just too tired. Not physhically, but in my head . As soon as I get some proposal of going out, I get my head clear and start doing things for myself. 

Other than that, I just stay in the house like a badger and I rarely initiate. I wish I can change that but in my head I think that if I don't have ALL that's needed (car, ability to drink, smoke) people are going to reject me even though I get pretty decent feedback from them.

I'm just a mad man with a made-up life story which piles up like interest on a pay-day loan.

712,Riverhailed,1547011988,1,"Sometimes i wonder if anyone ever liked me. I use to have lots of friends that cared deeply for me. The kind that follow you everywhere and hang on everything you say. I had to go to parties or people wouldn’t even show up. That kind of devotion. And i had that for 10 years.
Then i got my first crush.
We dated. He abused me. He pressured me. Cheated on me. Yelled at me for getting upset about it. Never answered me. Yelled at me for asking him to take me on dates. stood me up for female friends four weeks in a row and yelled at me when i cried about it. It lasted three years. Just constant abuse. Nothing i did would make him care it didn’t matter how much i cried or begged only what he wanted mattered.
By the end i was a shell of what i was. I didn’t even fight the things he did anymore. I just let it happen and cried on my own.
I went from being miss popular to being a ghost that flinched at noise and had to constantly check her phone. I gained weight, my skin was terrible, i barely slept.
My friends watched the descent and didn’t really do anything. I had spent the last ten years doting on them. I was at their beck and call the second any of them got even a little sad.

It did not go the other way. When i got depressed they got distant. I wasnt “fun” anymore. I didnt have the energy to comfort them i didnt have the energy to be present when i was at parties. I was still trapped in the bad place. They all started looking down on me. Calling me weak. Looking at me with pity. Ignoring every text i sent. I got suicidal and my best friend i grew up with left my messages on read.

Now I’m looking back and wondering if i ever had any real friends at all. And the longer i think about it the more i realize they were there because they “liked” me. Not because they cared about me at all. Almost every single one of them had asked me out at one point. But after he was done there was none of me left.

They won't even acknowledge me (this happens regularly) and yet they have the audacity to claim I'm being dramatic and looking for attention when I say I no longer feel close to them, and that I feel I don't have friends all while in confidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't understand why I'm the one friend they all seem to hate. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I try to be everything they want me to be. Am I doing something to hurt them? Do I even bring anything to the table? If I don't, why are they just stringing me along and pretending they like me or want to be my friends? Do they keep me with them just to use as a punching bag? To laugh at me? I've literally heard them call me annoying when I left the room to go to the bathroom.

I feel like I am drowning, I sink down and I meet the people who are sinking, I cling onto  them  and i push them away, they go up to surface or move away from me, not necessarily sinking again but I sink more, with a lot more speed because of another person who i push away. I want to cling onto but too scared. And I drown more, into what seems to be a bottomless pit that goes on and on and on while hurting me for every inch that I drown. 

I am scared and hurt to make new friends because I will push them away at certain point, not because they made me but because I don't know. Somewhere along the way I stop sharing my feelings and feel that letting them know would be a bad idea and I drown. I drown. 

Is it the side effect of being lonely for long that you are lonely and yet push away those who are close to you away everytime?

724,collosi,1546985553,1,"After a lot of thought I figured the reason I'm so depressed might not be emotional attachment but physical attachment. Here is some background. 

I'm pretty hardcore weeb and frankly have relatively misogynistic views, such as prioritising fidelity and being against liberalisation of female sexuality. While I can imagine myself compromising on these values in a real relationship, I find it harder to imagine myself being in a real relationship in the first place. 

I've been working on myself a lot lately and trying to find solace or happiness in being single, and by myself. To this end, I've embraced once again the hobbies that I've neglected before I went to a phase of really trying to find a relationship. I've recently started watching anime again, reading novels and playing games. I've overall become a happier person. I feel this is indicative that some forms of happiness can be extracted from ones self, while we can grow more and more independent from other forms of happiness extracted from the company of a loved one. The question would then be: to what extent?

What kind of happiness can I not get while remaining single? Here are some propositions. 

Emotional affection. What is emotional affection in the first place? It is perhaps a longing to be number one in another persons heart. I don't fully understand it myself and I struggle with the lack of emotional affection towards me in my life. 

Physical affection. I feel that this is carnal. There is some overlap with emotional affection that I cannot deny, but I feel this is mostly carnal. These include how I like thighs of anime girls and have a fetish towards East Asian women.

With that in mind, to extract certain sources of happiness that cannot be attained while single, the idea of a love doll, or a sex doll, or an inanimate object in the shape of a beautiful ideal women that you can make love to seem to be a good source of physical affection. 

Love dolls are a relatively pricy investment. High quality ones are above USD1000. Therefore I'd like to have some discussion with other with similar or opposing thoughts before re evaluating my understanding. 

Here is what I think love dolls will provide. 
1. Physical affection from your ideal woman. This will fulfil your sexual desires that often distracts you from productive work. 
2. An outlet for all sorts of fantasies. For example, coming home to someone who is waiting for you st home, inanimate as she may be. However, I imagine it is not difficult to impart some imaginary personality on a visage that is so similar to a human woman
3. Company. I talk to myself a lot. So I don't think it will be difficult to imagine myself speaking to a love doll
4. Cuddles and hugs. But it's cold because they're made of TPE but I want to work with what I can get. 
5. A love doll will not grow old with you and will stay beautiful 
6. A love doll is loyal to you by design, because her personality is what you impart to her in your fantasies. 

What do you think about love dolls? Have you considered procuring one? Have you procured one? Have they helped you with loneliness? I'd love to know. 

Thanks

I've talked to a few people since then, but it never lasts more than a few weeks, if that. They get bored of me and they leave. Probably because I'm so quiet and awkward.

734,Sayanss25,1546955245,1,"There is this girl in my life.

Each day, while on the way to her work, she visits me- to give me the delicious handmade food she makes for herself, and for me to have breakfast. She enters my room while I am half asleep, goes to the window and arranges the curtain to one side so sunlight can enter and then, then she comes closer to bed, leans over and kisses me.

There'sno greater joy than being woken up by the kiss from the woman you love.

She begins to mess with my hair playfully, at which point I sit straight.

I have told her countless times that it isn't necessary to make food for me. But she's adamant.

""You're planning to eat fast food again, aren't you?""

I assure her, that's not the case. In fact the food she cooks, is worthy of delivering to any high class restaurant. But it's just that there's no need to wake up so early to make breakfast for me and again to deliver it in my place.

""Fine, if you don't like my food, I won't come."" She drops the carefully wrapped 'love' shaped box on the table and storms away through the door.
The next day, she's at my room again.

She texts me various times from her work. ""Did you have lunch?"" ""Are you focusing on your studies?"" ""Did you take shower? You won't impress me if you stink like yesterday :) your love xoxo""

On most days, she comes straight at my place from work. Then we watch Netflix a bit. She sits on the sofa with popcorn, while I lay my head on her lap. She takes a few popcorn and puts in my mouth, the rest, she eats herself. You don't know how magical that is until you do it. There is a sense of being cared for.

She's the only one I can think of as my social circle, and she knows it very well. On weekends, she stays with me on my apartment. She tells me everything. How she got those new shoes at a discounted price. How her friend had a huge fight with her spouse, how she would like to visit this new restaurant that opened up with me. I listen to her with equal fondness and amazement. Her voice is so calming and soothing. I feel like I can almost sleep with that tone in the background. And she realises this. She comes over on me and kisses my forehead. I hold her. Then we cuddle. Time passes and we both go to sleep.

Sometimes I wonder- why is she doing this? What have I done to deserve this woman's love? I am a forgettable face among the millions of people out there. Why is she spending her time with me, when she could have fun with her friends somewhere else. But she's with me, every weekend, every month. Whatever the reason, I am very thankful to her. I can only think of how lonely I would be without her. Thanks to her, my inbox is not only filled by messages from the bank and phone company. Thanks to her, I have someone to wander the streets with on Christmas and New Year's eve. Thanks to her, I can have fun on my birthday and not spend time crying and pondering about my existence.

736,Mikomiji,1546953861,1,"Less than 6 months ago I moved away from a town where I had lived for 4 years. I had a very tight group of friends there who I loved and felt very close to. We worked at a local pub together, went out every weekend, spent lots of time hanging out and I thought we were inseparable. However due to job situations I moved to another town (not too far away, I can get there in about half an hour by train) I've tried to stay in touch as much as possible, but felt as though it was always me making the effort and when I stopped we began to lose touch.

However, out of the blue one of my old friends called me a few weeks ago to tell us another friend had passed away. He was a little older than us but he was a wonderful person who we were very close with and used to hang out with regularly. We had a pub quiz team together, he came to all out birthday celebrations, he helped me to move house when I couldn't hire a van in time, he was possibly the nicest person I ever knew and his death really really upset me. They told me there would be a funeral this month and I asked them to let me know as soon as they knew when it l was, and two of them said they would. After not hearing for a week I asked them again, and still they said they would let me know. I told work I would need a day off for it and had to fill out forms to arrange for cover, but due to not knowing the date it's still in a pending process.

Then today I went onto facebook and saw posts about how they had lay him to rest. No one had mentioned it to me at all. I feel really hurt and disgusted. I was already feeling super lonely as I live by myself and don't get to talk to anybody, I'm also alone all day at work. Now knowing my old friends didn't even let me know about a funeral for another old friend has really made me feel horrible. I want to ask where he's buried so I can visit the grave but at the same time I don't want to message them.

My ex seems so much happier without me in his life and meanwhile, I am literally crying every day and night because of how lonely I am. Everyone has their ""go to"" person except for me. I have tried reaching out to people but everyone just cancels or they tell me ""yes let's hang out!"" but never reach out to me again. I feel there is something wrong with me. Am I not funny enough? Am I not fun enough? Maybe I am too dramatic and oversensitive which leads to people not wanting to hang out with me. Sometimes I feel so shitty because I wonder if I had been chiller my boyfriend wouldn't have left me. I wake up, go to class, go home, and repeat, repeat, repeat, then I work during the weekends in order to not feel excluded when my friends are doing plans and they don't invite me. Sometimes I get into these weird hibernation/depressive moods where I literally won't talk to anyone for days which leads me to slowly lose more and more friends every day. I don't get what my other friends have that I don't but people always chose them over me. They always want to hang out with them, and not me.

764,TheParonomasiac,1546850444,1,"I dunno why I’m here. It’s 3:00 AM and I have to wake up soon. Hopefully this is all coherent and not just the exhausted ramblings of some lonely internet lady, but I can’t sleep because of how horrible I feel, and I just need to type it all our. I’m so lonely and isolated.

I don’t really have anyone. All the friends I’ve known for years really only treat me like a friend if we’re in a class or performance together. None of them ever want to spend time with me outside of that, and none of them respond to my messages. I feel like I’m a friend out of convenience for them, and unless they need something, they don’t really care if I’m around. And it’s not just one set of people either. I have three separate social groups that treat me the exact same way. They all seem really happy when I’m around, but that’s as far as they care. Like if I was a dollar bill sitting on the sidewalk, yeah they’d pick me up, but if I wasn’t immediately in front of them, they wouldn’t go out of their way to get me.

It’s always been kinda like this for me, but recently everything in my life has been pretty challenging, and it’s getting really hard to keep moving forward all alone.

Over the past month I’ve had some pretty dark nights, and I’ve been having a really hard time with finding reasons not to give up.

With this upcoming semester, I’m not even gonna see any of those friends in classes, and based off of past experiences, I’m not honestly convinced I’ll ever see or hear (or hear back) from any of them again.

And I don’t know why it’s like this. Maybe I’m just broken, or maybe I’m just not worth spending time around, but I’ve tried really hard to make things get better, and so far they just keep getting worse.

I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I don’t know if I’m gonna be okay.

Recently I’ve been trying to make some new friends. I’m not sure how well it’s gone. I’ve only interacted with any of them twice, and they seemed okay with me, but I’m really scared it’ll end up just like everyone else. I’m really scared that it’ll start out okay and then none of them will end up really liking me and will kinda just move on. I’m scared that maybe it’s just something fundamentally wrong with me

I’m really scared that it’s always gonna be like this. And I’m not really sure how much more of this I can really take.

The past few months have been so hard. And I am so lost and afraid, and I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it through any of this

I have a counseling appointment lined up through my university, but those are gonna be fairly spread out and will only be able to last for a few months. After that, I’ve got no way to get more help

After that, I will be cut off everyone

I’m so alone and afraid and I can see what’s coming down the road and none of it looks good, it all looks like it’s just gonna be more of the same and worse still

I’m gonna try to get some sleep. That might help temporarily. But I always feel this way, when I’m around other people, and when I’m actually alone

I just want to feel better

I just want to feel like I have anyone that cares, that cares about me, about what’s going on, if I’m around

If you're into very calm, soothing melodies that can help you sleep at night, I heavily suggest listening to Elliott Smith. Give his song ""Twilight"" a listen if you're interested. If so, there's a good chance you'll like many other songs of his as they are similar but creative.

- my therapy group, but it’s a therapy group. the only person i sort of talk to outside of it is outside of my age range (discussed later)

I actually like the way I look and have maintained consistent ""confidence"" I guess you could call it at 29. As an almost 30 year old man I feel I have a little bit more control over my life but there are some huge things I just don't understand.

I feel ready to commit to a partner. I'm doing pretty good everywhere except in my relationships. Instead I feel incredibly lonely. I haven't felt a woman's skin in over eight months. The empty inbox and quiet house I return to feels more and more like some kind of sentence. Like I did something to get where I'm at and have the mark of Cain. I can say with honesty I've done more good by others than bad in this life but something is jamming the door. I know that sounds pretty crazy but I'll try my best to explain.

I get so close to having a significant other and life just takes me for a ninety degree swerve. I'll find out the individual was already involved with someone, they'll pull a last minute friend zone, or just outright become ignorant. Sometimes it gets so bad that they don't even initiate conversation anymore. I let go of these people and try my best to move on...but there are so many of them. Life feels like this big giant obstacle course. Jump. Run. Crawl. Roll. Climb. Repeat. It's an accurate although sad similarity and contrast to my personal relationships.

This is coming from someone who sincerely and has consistently tried every resource available to make myself better. I know that self improvement must first come from within, but what if it still doesn't ""click""? What if some individuals are lucky and some are just destined to suffer? I don't like to compare my life to others but it just feels more difficult than it should be. Like the deck of cards is rigged.

I want someone to sleep next to and share my thoughts with, holding hands. Not just sex. Someone who will take the time to check up on me and send a text. Someone I can cook dinner for and vice versa even when I'm beat to shit. A significant other that will applaud my victories and chant my name. Somebody's favorite.

I used to feel angry but now it's just got me left feeling sad. Like everywhere I go leaves this invisible blood trail. I hunker down and just let it bleed in silence, hoping for a change. I've let go of negativity and even though it hurts seeing other couples together, I try to smile through the tears. No matter what I do I feel life has deprived me of these things and I'm doomed to live. I may never find peace in this lifetime but I'll go out strong and without complaining.

798,BraidedBerry,1546815000,1,"  Okay, so my parents put me in a cyber school when I was in 3rd grade when my mom couldn't home-school me anymore.  I have been in this school for years, and three years ago I started to realize how lonely I was.  I literally begged my parents to let me go to a public school.  All they do I argue with me.  Most of the time I'll just shut my door and cry and punch my thighs (instead of cutting).  They say that this is the best educational path for me.  In their opinion, school is not a place to make friends, it is a place to learn, that's all.  I go to Girl Scouts, but we only meet twice a month for a hour and a half, and everyone there goes to the same public school.  They always talk about what they did in school that day, and I can never join in.  

  With cyber school, all you do is sit in bed all day and listen to your teachers over a microphone and watch them draw on a digital board.  The only way I can talk to my classmates is using a 'chat box', and teachers always have it locked anyways.  My parents think that this is the best path for me, but it's making me depressed.

  So basically, I only get three hours of socialization a month (none of the girls are my friends either).  I am so lonely, and I have no friends.  Plus, being a teenager, friends are so important to me.

805,PG1143,1546803008,1,"Hi there! I'm new in this sub and I was wondering if someone around here could give some tips on a problem I've recently been dealing with.

So, I've never had a real relationship with a girl that I personally would consider her to be a ""girlfriend"". That ends up being one of the reasons why I've never had high confidence or self-esteem. However, last year in November this one girl from english institute started talking with me via instagram, and as a result we spent the next weeks addicted to eachother in a way and we used to joke a lot about starting a relationship and stuff like that. She wanted it, I wanted it, so in the 25th of that month I asked her, even though I thought it was a bit rushed, but she accepted it. 2 days later she said things were happening to fast and she just wanted a friendship. I wasn't really able to be just a friend, as things were just awkward between us, and I told her that, which basically ended whatever kind of relationship we had by then. 
I tried to move on but then something happened. Apparently this girl had been talking with one of my best-friend's in instagram as well (he knew everything that happened between us), and they started dating on the same day I ended any type of relations with the girl. That shit fucked me up a lot, and as a result I now feel nothing but hate towards her and my self-esteem and self-confidence are at an all-time low. 

Now I don't want my relation with my friend to be affectes but I believe things between us will only be normal again when I stop thinking aout this girl. So I was wondering if anyone could help me on this, as well as on how to improve my self-esteem and self-confidence.

806,LakshmiDelia,1546798676,1,"I'm 17. Not in high school as I went through a trauma a year ago leaving me unable to cope and dropped out. Don't recommend I go back, the school won't take me back anyway.

I have pretty much no social life. I don't think I'm a particularly weird person, I've been told I'm beautiful, funny, good at giving advice etc by people who have been in my life at some point who have now drifted away. But I feel circumstances have been stacked against me. 

Obviously the main place peoole my age meet people is school. That's not an option for me, my truancy record is through the roof and no school will accept me. So that's fucked. And I live in a small village where the average resident is a retired elderly person. Transport links are not that great and I need to wait until I can afford driving lessons. Until then my parents have to drive me everywhere, including the store for basic essentials, further isolating me from the chance of any random social encounters. People just say ""put yourself out there"" and do what exactly? Stand in the street waiting to be approached?

I've joined a few social/hobby groups and found them useless. I've noticed people tend to bond over mutual people thet know. Like they know similar people as they live near each others neighbourhoods, or somebody knows somebody as their step-dad is friends with their dad etc. So then they get talking about those mutual connections. I can't engage in any of that, due to my isolating circumstances.

I've been feeling so empty. I was at some guys house on a Tinder date the other day and we cuddled and had sex. I didn't want to go home that morning as I had needed that human interaction for so long and now that I had it, I didn't want it to end. Of course, with it being Tinder, we've not spoken since and on his Snapchat he's been out with friends etc. I feel like our night together was such a huge thing for me as I had been craving humam interaction for so long and so it was a significant event for me, whereas for him I was probably just some quick sex and now he wants to focus on the people in his life who he has an actual connection to, ie not me.

She also talked to me like I was a moron who didn't know anything . I only continued to speak to her because I was afraid of this very scenario; complete solitude. 

Anytime I've ever had a friend they've always  treated me like shit in some way, the same goes for a ""relationship"" that I forced myself to be in also because I didn't want to be alone, which was one of the **worst** decisions I've ever made in my life and continues to haunt me to this day even though it happened a year ago.

I've been in and out of education ever since I finished school at 16 meaning I've never had much of an opportunity to meet new people. I left there with only 2 ""friends"" because the other ones I had who would routinely treat me like shit decided I was too ""negative"" (I was actually depressed and still am to this day).

Someone who, when I am at my worst, I can think of and say, ""She wouldn't want me to feel this way, I must get through this for her."" Someone I can play guitar to when the sun rises even if she wakes up rating my act as cringey, I'll still do it for the sake of both annoying and flattering her. Someone to stroll down the street with on a lovely day walking dogs. Someone who wants to make me a better person and me the same in return, like improving one-another in a positive manner. (Ex: hey, let's learn a new language together!) Someone who I can share memories with, go out, run through the forest at midnight with no fear, skinny-dip, explore the the world, meet all sorts of people, crack endless, tireless inside-jokes with, have natural chemistry with...

TL;DR: I am a loner.",lonely,Dreadfully Distant,2019-01-06 19:33:41
823,Dependent_Weakling,1546761883,1,"‍‍I remember as a child that I would aimlessly wander the school yard during recess, with no one to play with.

Some days there were expections, but it was never playing so much as it was conversation. I never felt alone during this time left to my own devices. I was so happy and contented in what I would be having to eat later in the day.

It went like this throughout elementary and part of middle school.  I had no problems being reserved and reticent, but of course everyone mistook this for shyness. There was nothing on my mind worth saying.

Naturally, being so dull and yet ""bright"" meant several things. I attached myself to a false identity and would strive to maintain it. That's what I was known for. At least I like to think so.

Deep down I knew none of what they said was true. I was none of those things and absolutely despised anything relating to it. It brought me scant satisfaction, knowing that I wouldn't be able to live up to others expectations. 

I felt like a machine, a thing. Phones rose to prominence. These being nearly owned by everyone meant I was fucntionally dead. Even when I knew I was being used, it felt nice to have someone at least to talk to, you know? 

I can't compete with a phone - an almagation of entertainment and the world's knowledge at one's fingertips, all the while keeping in touch with friends. I was out before it even started.

I handled eveything so poorly, I let it get to me. As I feel this pain recede, I'm left with a clear mind. One that understands nothing matters, that I don't matter. One which understands no one owes anyone anything and thus people are not obligated to love.

I would like someone to help me, but I know it to be hopelessly impossible.

My best friend tells me that I give too much to my exes without recieving the same effort back. I'm described as bubbly and giggly by my friends, but when it comes to problems I chose to hold it in. My anxiety also hasn't helped me, along with the start of another stressful semester. 

All my previous relationship ended in a mess (cheated on or they just can't commit). Also doesn't help that I was cheated on twice by my exes, the same exes that told me that I'm the ""perfect girlfriend"" and  was told ""I don't deserve you."" My mom was cheated on by my dad, and my grandma was cheated on by my grandpa.. I think it's just a family thing at this point.

Sometimes I catch myself wanting attention and hoping to just have someone actually care for me.

Hey lonely gang,

I'm making this post in hopes to find an acquaintance or two to talk with and hopefully be friends, maybe even good friends. Sounds easy right... not so much.

Heres the thing, I'm kind of sort really socially awkward. Talking and just opening up to people gets me really nervous. I've been this way my whole life and it's made socializing a chore. It also doesn't help that I'm not particularly interesting(insert shrugging meme here) Despite my worries and mundaneness I really do want to practice socializing and making friends. Loneliness and I'm sick of it. Plus, it can kill.

Well... I guess this is where I describe myself. 

•I'm a 24-year-old male
•I'm laid back yet awkward
•I work with shoes and these ravenous creatures called customers. I want to smack them with shoes but if I do I'll get fired so I don't

•I like to draw but I'm not very good at it.
•I like video games but my console of interest right now has been The Switch. Smash is currently my obsession. Persona and Pokemon are my favorite gaming series

•I like anime(I'm weeb trash). I'm not caught up on current anime unfortunately, but feel free to recommend shows to me. My top favorite series are FMA, Gurren Logan, Little Witch Academia, and Haruhi Suzumiya.

•I like to collect figures related to video games, anime and other media, take photos of them and post them to the internet because I'm a big man child.

•Speaking of man child, I love animation. From 90's cartoons to new school cartoons, 

•I tend to have a dark/self-deprecating sense of humor.

Well... that's all I have to share.

To break the ice between us, I've listed some questions to get the conversation ball rolling. You don't have to answer all of these. Hell, you don't have to answer any of these questions. These are just ice breaker questions. It's up to you...

•What are 5 places you would like to visit
•What is one of your favorite games/shows/movies and why?

•If you could have any animal as a pet, what would it be and why?

•What is your dream job

•Tell me the lamest pun you know and/or the darkest joke you know.

•What are your top 3 favorite music genres?
•Who are your favorite waifus and/or husbando. Or who is your favorite character(s) from anime

•Who are your favorite Youtubers

Well, that's that. I hope this all works all out. You can talk with me here on Reddit or on Telegram and Kik. Also, when it comes to responding I tend to be slow to get to my messages since I have other things going on during the day. Plus, the whole socially awkward thing. If you have a problem with slow responders, please don't message me and move on.

Well, have a good day and here's to a good conversation :)

They're pushing my friends away from me, and I've had best friends of mine once or twice tell me they haven't wanted to stick around me anymore because of the people i live with. All three of them are nasty towards other people, and have crippled me mentally and emotionally for years, and although I want to live a different life from the ones they've chosen, I can't leave them. I'm working hard right now to try to move out, but it's not going so well as I don't get many hours with my part time job. I also struggle with interacting outside of my home as I it's been so long since I've functioned outside this kind of environment. I'm not trying to make myself sound good compared to them or anything like that, I just don't know how to live with them if they're constantly making me and the people important to me unhappy.

I find myself constantly feeling lonely, and it simply makes me sad.

That's all, sorry to post this, if you have any advice or ideas I'd be glad to know.

Many of them I see less nowadays, many are busy and doing their own thing, and some I'm able to talk to online and play with pretty often. I know they care about me, but there is something I want that they can't give.

At the age of 24, I've never really had a girlfriend. It's not that I haven't had options, but in the past I was either crushing on someone long distance who liked me back for a while, or because I want to get to know someone a little before I decide to have an official relationship. I kinda want my first experiences to be at least with someone I find worthwhile.

I feel weird and embarrassed saying this, but sometime in highschool I did experience a sort-of roleplay cuddling through texts with a girl. It was actually really satisfying. It was like we had our own little world together that we could just kind of be there and feel comfortable and happy.

That is the sort of thing I crave now. I wish I could just cuddle with someone who genuinely cares. I wish I could experience affection, maybe this time in person. I don't even know what it's REALLY like, all I have is that highschool experience that kind of simulated it.

I don't know. It's too bad I'm an adult 24 y/o man, as I'm sure this is considered immasculine or childish or something.

888,swirlcreams,1546599831,1,"So some little back ground here. Took a 2 year break from the whole social media life and this was because of a terrible, traumatizing, and very destructive relationship that I had. This meant becoming completely inactive on Facebook, deleting my Instagram completely, staying inactive in Snapchat, and so on. Additionally, I’m still in community college (not UC/CSU) after 4 years and this was primarily due to my decision to switch majors. And then of course right now, my friends are in high end schools or already graduating. It’s a sucky feeling to feel behind. 

Anyway, so my friends and I went to a club. This is where a girl saw me and asked me for my number because she thought I was cute. After two years being single, this was probably one of the happiest and best feeling ever, not to mention an amazing confident booster. My friends told me to text her first which I did (she called me, so I had her number). So we had a short conversation that lasted for some time and this is where I learned how badly I am out of her league. Her whole life is on display. She asked a lot about me life and my social media. This is where I had absolutely nothing to show off. My friends were trying to tag me in photos and everything but I just refused and let it be. Browsing through her Instagram that she shared, I was just so intimidated. After some honest response about my current situation, she stopped replying. This was right before New Years too and I don’t know... initially it felt like my life is finally changing after being pretty depressed for so long. I don’t know how to explain it but she’s exactly everything that I look for in a person. I just wish that she’d still talk to me here and there and maybe a year or two, it’ll show that I’m on trackZ Also by then, hopefully I have rebuild my whole social media life again. I just recently recreated it and I have embarrassing amount of followers. 

I don’t know how to feel other than being a total disappointment. I’ve always believed that looks are just like the icing on the cake, and getting to know the person is the quality of the cake itself. So in other words, it seems that I’m just a terrible mess masked by all that icing.

Also recently I learned that one of our mutual friends might be in some kind of a relationship with her and that kind of killed me a little. This is not a sexual type thing,I genuinely like her for being a good person and putting up with my stupid antics and yet still being able to smile at me. For the years I have known her we (meaning her,me and a couple of other people have gone camping) have done the usual shit high school kids do late at night like ask each other who likes who and play dumb games like Kill Fuck Marry, every time they ask me I never say who it is due to not wanting to look like a fool and also not wanting to royally fuck the groups dynamics, I always give them hints but they never guess. I have was forced to promise them that I will tell when I graduate (I am a junior,1 older than the majority of them) in 2020 and enlist because I anticipate that I will feel that way after being disconnected for so long or just not be alive.

I have no real friends, I don’t have a significant other, and my family checks in occasionally. I usually have to reach out to them first.

I’m so depressed even though my life is going great and that hurts more than everything else. I have this void that alcohol can’t seem to fill tonight. Online I give off this persona of being this amazing confident human being, but in real life I’m nothing like that. Sometimes my online persona comes out in real life and all the people who know me hate it, but they also seem to hate the depressed sad me. I can’t find a happy medium. 

Sometimes it almost feels like I have split personalities.  I’m tempted to go get medicated because the thoughts of suicide are becoming very strong. It’s just crazy that I can have so many people involved with me yet be totally utterly alone. I just want someone to love me. But I don’t want to settle. Idk anymore I see my therapist tomorrow so I’ll probably read him this post. I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head before I do something bad. 

I just want to feel like someone cares. Like I’m not intruding on their life. I think people sometimes assume that I’m busy and doing something cause that’s the way I make it out to be on the internet, I worry that sometimes the real me will slip out online and no one will like me anymore.

913,AlfromSpain,1546551944,1,"Hey there community.

First of all thank you, I commented for the first time in this sub on Christmas Eve and you made me feel welcomed. 

This is what happens... Social anxiety maybe? I'd call it social digital anxiety. 

A couple of months ago my smartphone died. After that, a period to choose my next smartphone began (I'm a techie guy), without any hurry to get in touch again with 'the people'.

Then, after the purchase of my new phone, days were passing, I purchased several apps, some Reddit client, some games, and some productivity apps. But I wasn't brave enough to download and install WhatsApp and face all the remaining, undelivered messages. Not many I guess, as I don't text many people, but there's the fear to face many messages at a time. 

This is the second time that happens to me. Each time my smartphone dies I begin a grace period without social communication. But after some time I have to install it again, and get in touch again. 

Some people here may be thinking... Well dude, just don't install WhatsApp or get out of groups of friends you don't feel as friends anymore. 

That's an understandable answer, but I cannot let myself fall into the absolute loneliness, with zero contact with people. So I have to face my social fears and install again WhatsApp... One of this days.

This story has a nice part, tho. A friend of mine (she got married recently) called to ask how I was, and why didn't get the messages. This is how you tell who cares about you -even if it's just a little-, while my regular friends, the people I know for the past 10 years, haven't called or asked about me. Never. Maybe they are the reason why I don't want to download WhatsApp again... 

Sorry if this should go into Social Skills subreddit. Maybe I'll post there as well.

TL;DR lonely because I don't want to re-install WhatsApp. Because having that app makes me feel even lonelier.

For the last 3 years my life has been great. Really great. I got my first job. I have wonderful friends. I workout regularly and my mental health is fine. However, I always look forward to a day where I'll move abroad and starting over.

​

It comes to my mind every single day.

​

Despite my life being great, I feel like there's something missing, the one thing that i probably revolve my life too much around. And that's not having a partner. I see my friends with partners, I just want that. I've been single for almost a year now. I don't think I do very well as a single person as it makes me lonely.

​

And I'm not really good at romantic relationship either. Only shots that were successful have been when the women have been really into me and somehow look over my desperateness that I give out. Like, i just scared off another girl with a slight interest for me because I get too attached, too quickly. And it fucking sucks, man.

​

Today I sat being paranoid about being ""too boring"" or ""not interesting enough"" to be dateable, and its sad. But sometimes it does feel like the only time I can be interesting or fun is when I drink.

​

I sit and watch How I Met Your Mother, or Friends, or watch people on stream from other countries and I dream of living in their country because i relate more with their culture or whatever. Like the people there are much more suited for me. Like that the country I'm currently living in has brought me bad experiences that I just want to start the fuck over.

​

The reason why I'm writing all this is because I don't know why i get too attached. I don't know why i cannot bring out a relationship from a slight interest.",lonely,Too attached,2019-01-04 07:54:25

I even turned notification sounds off on my phone because it's rlly embarrassing when I get a rare beep from my phone and she goes ""oh I thought your phone was on silent this whole time"". More often than not that beep is just from a group chat anyway

It's not fair. Why does she get to talk to all these people and have so many people want to.talk to her, when I don't? (We're in the same friend group, but it should be obvious who's more popular).

I know I'm ugly, with a horrible personality, and I never start conversations, or even try to make friends ourside of our existing ""group"", so this is all my fault.

918,kingmadmadg,1546544069,1,"You ever feel sad and lonely for nothing? And I don't mean for no reason but for the lack of having it. Feeling like you got nothing. Nothing that's truly yours.

You see people around you and their life isnt perfect, but they got something. They got someone or they got something that's theirs and you don't?

Having nothing is that sad realization that you're not someone's number 1. Sure maybe you got people around you that care. But how many of those people would put you number 1 on their list? How many people REALLY care. Can you imagine putting someone else first. You care about someone and you show that to them and they just, don't reciprocate it cause they don't feel the same way and that's not their fault.

926,IdealBed,1546516169,1,"I meant to post something here last night, but I was exhausted and couldn't get anything coherent down.

Anyway, I've felt incredibly alone for the longest time. I've always been super introverted and shy, so making friends is hard for me, but not impossible. I had quite a large circle of friends in school, though we've all kind of lost touch at this point, as is the norm for school friends I imagine. They all went to university or something, while I did a media studies course for two years. I hated it and found it difficult to talk to anyone there. I mean, there were some cool people there, but conversations rarely strayed from ""here, look at this meme.""

Since the course finished, I've pretty much become a hermit. I don't go out very much, nor feel a real need to since there isn't much going on where I live. A lot of my days would be spent just playing video games all day or just browsing Youtube. I eventually tried to be slightly more useful and teach myself new skills, like how to draw and stuff. But almost as soon as I started, I got my first actual job, and don't feel like I have as much time for that stuff. Probably not a big deal, I had no real goal other than to try something different, might pick it up again later. 

I thought my job would help me meet people, but it hasn't really so far. There are some cool people there, but either they're twice my age or we get so busy during the day that there's no real time to talk. 

Throughout the two or so years I've felt like this, I've had one consistent friend. She lives in America though, so we only communicate online. Lately, she's been getting busier and days go by where we don't talk. And when we do, she usually talks about her own friend circle, which seems to constantly be growing. I'm not mad or jealous about it, just kinda feels bad hearing stories about the good times she has with them, while the highlight of my day is waking up before lunch.

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. Maybe it's because of the New Year and I feel like 2018 was a complete waste. I'm not really looking for advice necessarily (although it is appreciated), I just kinda wanted to get my thoughts out there. Feels a little better than stewing in self pity and boredom.

So she was a bit comfused but smiling when she saw me. She let me in, and we started to talk. She said so many things about his relationships and family issues. She looked depressed to me.
I stayed for hours. She looked happy to tell her problems to someone and i was happy to. I really wanted to know her.
There were some partys at his house, the last one was Tuesday. I feel like we're getting closer to each other. The smile on his face when our eyes meet, well... Where were she all these years?

I still socialize, but I've never had a relationship. I've rarely seen anyone as quiet as me (both in person and on social media). It's a huge contrast to some other friends and peers who have abundant energy, social life, a good outlook on life, talk plenty and are friends with many. 

Unfortunately due to my depression and uneventful life, I don't have anything interesting about myself. No cool hobbies, no talents, no career to be proud of, nothing interesting to talk about.

I'm too boring and low-energy to use Tinder or randomly make friends. Too quiet and reserved to get closer to existing friends (especially the opposite gender). Combine extreme apathy with low self esteem and the lack of opportunities and you got me.

An old friend told me to give love a chance, but every since I let myself do that, every person I try to be close to, just put me aside like a second option person, and it's just depressing and makes me feel  like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm being used by them.

933,scottmanboy,1546491754,1,"Warning, slightly a rant/load-off

Gonna try to explain my situation as best as possible. I am a 15 year old kid (male), I enjoy comic books, action movies, and browsing reddit. I have no friends, and that does not necessarily bother me. What bothers me is that most people around me are falling in love, while I’m just existing. Sometimes I wish I had a girlfriend (I am aware that having a girlfriend doesn’t fix all life issues, but I think I would be at peace if I had someone close in a relationship that I could connect with). The TLDR with girls in my life is that every single one has turned me down, and left me severely scarred. Hell, even at school there are barely any girls I am interesting in talking with, due to lack of attraction or lack of common interest. The only thing I like doing is riding around on my bike, and low and behold, my physically abusive parents ban me from even leaving my house because they found out I didn’t wear my helmet ONE TIME. Fast forward today, I have been stuck at my house since December 20th 2018 (that’s when my winter break started, I am in high school), and I am not permitted to leave. I have been lurking on this sub since then, and the ‘lonely’ part of me just tells me that I want to interact with another girl, that feels like the void I have.

Anyway sorry for the ramble, Camus sort of discusses what I'm trying to say in *The Fall* but in a more eloquent way:


‘...friendship is absent-minded or at least unavailing. It is incapable of achieving what it wants. Maybe, after all, it doesn't want enough? Maybe we don't love life enough? Have you noticed that death alone awakens our feelings? How we love the friends who have just left us? How we admire those of our teachers who have ceased to speak, their mouths filled with earth! Then the expression of admiration springs forth naturally, that admiration they were perhaps expecting from us all their lives. But do you know why we are always more just and more generous toward the dead? The reason is simple. With them there is no obligation. They leave us free and we can take our time, fit the testimonial in between a cocktail party and a nice little mistress, in our spare time, in short. If they forced us to anything, it would be remembering, and we have a short memory. No, it is the recently dead we love among our friends, the painful dead, our emotion, ourselves after all!’

960,drywaterv2,1546422293,1,"So. 2018 was the worst and loneliest year in my life so far. And I'm glad it's over. But this year I decided to myself I will fight out of this loneliness from last year. So I thought to myself, ""I need to come to my senses"", first thing that came in my mind afterwards was ""I'm already lonely enough, I should just remove the bad people in my life as well"".
And on the new year I finally got rid of the person to blame for the loneliness I've been going through in 2018.
I'm talking about this one guy who I was been friends with for over a year. I've always brought him around all the places where I was, around the people I socialized with. That was the biggest mistake I could ever make, for he is more social than me. So of course he would start talking to the people I was talking to, and he'd be talking to them more than me because he was more social. Now because of this guy, I've lost a great majority of my friends because afterwards they started giving a shit about him more and later they forgot about me. By the middle of 2018 I was left with only two of my good friends (that I still have luckily). All the other ~11+ I had were completely gone from my life because of this guy, which was still friends with all those I've lost. 
But I could never realize I was getting so lonely because of him for the entire year. Worst thing is, I was such a fool to fall in love with him. We dated for less than a day, and of course he dumped me, because I'm ""not serious enough"". He barely even asked me to show him my serious side (that I don't show to everybody),,ever. 
But now, in the new year, he's gone. Forever from my life. Gone. And I don't want to see him ever again. 
Every time I tried to get rid of him, blocking him on social media and whatever (we were online friends afterall) he sent his friends after me, telling me to unblock him and whatever. Just so that they leave me alone I always accepted the request and make up a jack shit excuse to him to avoid embarrassment.
He's doing the same right now. But this time I'm not going to respond at all. He can keep begging to have me back again to keep his ego filled up but I'm not here for his bullshit anymore. He even thinks the fact that we dated (for less than a day, mind you) is a good enough reason to keep me around him. He takes my friends away from me, dumps me in less than a day after being starved of anyone's love for so long, and he expects me to still want to be his friend? Not anymore. It's over. He's gone from my life. Thanks to this now I have some way better friends. 

In conclusion, maybe you guys also have few friends right now, but make sure to rule out those who are a bad influence on you from your life. Keep the people who enjoy your company and of which you enjoy their company, get rid of those who don't. Now that this guy is gone from my life I feel way happier. Maybe you will as well if you try? 

And I want to wish you a happy new year as well. I hope you get what you want in your life this year. Make sure to try your hardest for it. ",lonely,Be careful about the people you keep around you.,2019-01-02 20:44:53

So, I just came back from a night out in Manhatten. Even though I was surrounded by thousands of people, I felt alone. Nameless among people who had families, spouses, and friends to hang out with. I had gone to a Broadway show, and I was desperately looking for someone to join me. Someone who I could laugh with, and someone who I could squeeze their hand at the emotional parts of the play. Someone who would make me feel a part of. Whole, and not just a grain of sand being tossed around. 

After the show, I went to a bar and drank beer to drown out my sorrows. I was hoping that I would spark a conversation with someone interesting and forge a human connection. Alas, that was not to be the case. It seemed like everyone else had a companion beside for me.

969,yvesdesmarais,1546401872,1,"Hi. Throwaway acc.

Throughout the past couple of years, I have noticed a downward spiral of my physical desire for somebody. For example, I had been seeing this girl for a short amount of time recently and while I genuinely enjoyed her company &amp; had feelings for her, I couldn't bring myself to have sex with her when I was given the opportunity. 

I wanted to but I didn't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

(Sorry if this is confusing lmao)

&amp;#x200B;

I left feeling embarassed and I could tell she was hurt but I just couldn't explain it to her when I tried. I kept looking for something but I couldn't think of anything because *I* can't even figure out the reason why. 

I told her it probably was some combination of anxiety, my last relationship, and medication.

We ended up drifting apart and this had made me realize that this is happening to every girl I have any sort of feelings for. I haven't had any sort of actual relationship in two years now. 

I take a lot of medication, one of which I know alters my sex drive, but it doesn't feel like the way it did when the meds had that sort of effect on me. 

The thought of sex with her feels dirty. 

Wrong.

When I truly want to be with someone on a deeper level than physical, I just haven't been able to bring myself to enjoy it. It's never a problem when it's just a hookup and because of that, I'm afraid I'm developing a negative association with sex. 

I had an incredibly long &amp; problematic relationship two years ago and I know that has *something* to do with it, but I don't know why the issue seems to be getting worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Makes me feel pretty lonely, honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, new year feels are still getting to me. Seems like this sub is an annual tradition now. Also finally realized last night that my best friend is incredibly selfish &amp; does not care for how I- or anyone- feel(s?)

&amp;#x200B;

Completely uprooted my life and moved back home last month so there's that too.

Also, if you're feeling down, trust me, I know the feeling. So if anyone would like to talk, I would be happy to see what's up. This is a two way deal here, y'know.

Even though I know theres a lot of people who suffer from the same mental illnesses as me I still just feel so alone in what I'm going through. I mainly use reddit as a source for venting, so I just want to get all of this off my chest.  
It don't really know when it started, I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but the depression started in the begining of 2018, I remember I met a girl I really liked on this app to make friends for all of the hip and cool teens (*as you can tell, I didn't have that many friends considering I had this app*)  so, I talked to her and we had the same intrests and life seemed to be going upwards, but oh boy was i wrong.  


So there I was, having played some overwatch with her for a while, I decided to do something that I didn't really think through. We had this running joke that we would make a bet that someone would get that many kills or get play of the game and ect. and the thing was that we both really liked ice tea. I don't anymore because it makes me think of her but thats beside the point. so if the person one the bet they'd add it to the amount of ice teas the other person owed them. (*this is a needlesly comeplicated and small thing to say but it leads up to something bigger*) 

So this one time she owed me like 3 bottles of ice tea and I told her that i'd come over and collect it from her in a litle bit, she didn't belive me but I was already dedicated to escalating this dumb joke of ours to the next level. But there was one thing. She lived an hour away in a different city. Now my dumb, borderline idiotic idea was to tell my parents i was visiting another friend who lived in my town, Then cycle my way to another near by town 40 minutes away on bike (*our town doesn't have a train station*), take the train to her city, hang out with her for a bit, and leave again. Now long story short I was about to miss the train, i called my mom, told her the truth and she drove me to the train station, I met up with her, she took the buss home. THEN the first bad thing happened, I panicked and didn't go on the right train home. I was in a city I had never been to before, my phone had died, it was dark outside, and I had missed my train home. I built up the courage to ask this friendly looking lady if I can quickly borrow her phone to call my mom. But then she declined. I was panicking at this point. one of my worst fears had come true and I had no idea what to do, I went to a store seeing if I could buy a charger, I tried to get the littlest amount of battery from my phone to kick into action so I could call home. but after what seemed like walking around, panicking and almost crying for what seemed like an eternity, the lady I had originally asked saw me fiddling with my phone and aloud me use it to call my mom. I don't think i ever have, nor ever will be as luckt because the lady I asked, was a cop. I felt the safest I had in ages. A cop was sitting with me waiting for almost an hour for my mom to arrive so that I can finally go home.  


That event is something I don't think I'll ever forget.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my friend, lets call her Nina. So me and Nina talked and played together after that, but after that was when I really started to get depressed

\----TRIGGER WARNING AHREAD----

I started to cut myself, I had never done it before this and I have been clean since july but that time was really fucking rough  
\----TRIGGER WARING OVER----

I dont know if that was uneccersery but I wanted to be sure so I put the warning in.  
I didn't have any friends, and the ones I did have, Nina made me cut ties with.  


The next time we hung out was this sleep over we had when my dad wasn't home and it has many good and horrible memories.  


Through all of this there was the running ""joke"" that I liked her, because in a truth or dare she asked me who i liked ( we were very bored ) and I said her.  


we also went to a convention together, se was mad at me for not wanting to go to a lot a places in the convetion center, which I told er before hand would be hard for me because of my social anxiety  


We kinda lost touch after that.  
she has a boyfriend now.  
I still have't had a girlfriend.  
She invited me to play  overwatch like a month after we stopped talking. after like 3 minutes her boyfriend joins and they talk about how much they love each other.  


I kinda used up all my energy on that super long paragraph, its 2am now  


oh yeah I forgot to talk about school and how far behind i am and just how much I hate it so much and how I have no friends left there and am seriously considering being homeschooled or something because thinking about school is making me panic and  school starts in a day and I dont know what to do and I'm trying not to sleep and distract myself from that so that it takes me time for school to come

Not because she had said anything, but because of the lack of anything being said. Things got a bit rough between us before she left for basic, and I thought that the few weeks that we had completely apart would help to mend and heal that break that we had. I was incredibly optimistic in terms of hanging out together she came back for HBL, and it was honestly one of the only things that I was holding onto to keep myself going for the last few months. Once she got back however, I quickly realized that everything I had hoped for was nowhere to be found. We had planned to take a trip to Chicago with some other people sometime while she was back, that got delayed since she got busy around Christmas, which was understandable. I asked if we could push it back to Friday, thinking that it would give her enough time to make the plans, but there were never any plans made, almost as if she had just given up on them completely. On top of this, I had told her a while before she came back that if she had wanted to do anything to just let me know so that I could call off of work and not have it interfere with anything. I called off that Wednesday, meaning I probably lost around $50 by not working, all for absolutely nothing to happen. It took me constantly nagging her to figure something out before she decided to invite me over to her house on Friday night. It seemed like I was finally going to be able to spend some time with her, but almost everything made it seem like she really didn’t want me there, and only invited me to get me to shut up. She told me to come later, even though there were already people there. Then she hardly even talked to me the whole night. I wasn’t even there for that long either. I was hoping to be there until like 11 or 12, but she made me leave at 10 because she was getting breakfast with a ton of other people the next morning. Not only that, but they had all hung out at least 4 times prior to that. I was never invited to do anything the entire time she was back. I’m just done. She never texts me anymore unless she needs something, so I’ve just decided to return the favor. I realized today not only that I lost my best friend, but that it happened long before any of this ever happened.

I can t think of anything that I might've done to anger her as of late and I have no idea what's going on since she won't let me know.

__________________________

This isn't the first time that something similar of this nature had occurred before. Last March we just stopped talking to each other for a while and I'll admit that I was at fault in this situation. I was dealing with personal problems at the time, leaving me in crummy moods, and I stopped talking to her all around. I should've been more considerate of her.

She expressed her anxiety on social media and how our ""classmates pushed her away from the group."" I wonder if by ""classmates"" she was referring to me specifically...or maybe I'm just being egocentric. I replied to her post, and again, doesn't reply back. I felt bad for ghosting her out and I'm over here making the effort trying to repair our relationship that I had prompt, but she's won't cooperate. I thought she had gotten over me, thus, I sent a message that maybe it was time to split up. It wasn't worth fighting for someone if they weren't willing to do the same.

Two hours later, she finally replied back and pinpointed the blame on me for leaving her. Of course, I acknowledged my own fault and we were able to make everything work afterwards. But, she wasn't exactly innocent in this circumstance either. If she truly cared, why didn't she make the profound effort of fixing our friendship along with me? Why did it take a break-up message for her to finally come to her senses? Why didn't she reach out to me in some measure of empathy or concern just as I have in the past and very recently?
Last month, we finally got around to seeing each other again and had fun hanging out together. There wasn't a single sign of friction between us--just two friends catching up in their friendship. So I don't understand what set her off this time that made her unfollow me or why she's blatantly ignoring me.

__________________________

She admitted that she has pushed a number of people away from her life, both intentionally and unintentionally. Maybe I'm one of the unlucky ones. Maybe she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I unfollowed her this morning and I'm kind of regretting my decision. Maybe I should've stuck around and try to comprehend the state of her enigma and work something out once again. ...or maybe that's it between us. I doubt she's going to want to do anything to restore our friendship... she didn't fight for us before, and most likely she won't fight for us again.

My last friend was a person whom I had met outside the US. By sheer coincidence, we ended up in the same city in the US. We had been friends for almost three years. We would hang out for hours at a time. We texted regularly. I even offered to pay for her abortion. 
A few months ago, she started making excuses to not meet. She always claimed to be busy, despite regularly going out with her other friends. I ignored it and didn’t bring attention to it until last night. I was drunk, so I texted her and asked why she was ignoring me. Long story short, after I had opened up to her about my depression, she said that she felt uncomfortable and tried to distance herself. She also said that my ex cheated on me because I was financially supporting her, the implication being that the relationship was not authentic. That was painful.  There’s no point in trying to salvage the friendship.

But I know that if i say something its just going to mess up our friendship ( It happened to me before ) but the thought of ""what if"" kills me (I overthink alot ) I mean.... 

Theres a selfish side of me that wants to be with her and only her and then theres the caring side thats knows for a fact that she would be (EXTREMELY) happier with someone else and wants her to be happy ( Which she is Btw) Shes really a beautiful funny smart caring and bright person to be around. 

Im the complete opposite and i feel like she would honestly be downgrading if she actually did have the same feelings (or wanted to be in a relationship with me)  which is why I've never said anything ( and probably won't ) now ive told her that i had a crush on her in HS and that was it i mean we're grown now and I dont know if i need to just let it go and leave it as it is and remain her friend or should i risk the friendship and say something...

**Happy New year!!** 

To me, and to everyone out there! &lt;3

So here's how I spent my new year's eve...

All alone, in my room, lying in bed, pretending I'm cramping so I can avoid my parents. meanwhile, people are out there celebrating the new year and watching beautiful fireworks with friends and family. 

**why am I avoiding my family you ask?**  
well, let me tell you. I avoid them because I can't deal with them. when we talk, we fight. and when they see me they latch onto me and start either 1. bombarding me with questions I don't want to answer or 2. asking me to do things for them or 3. reprimanding me on being a bad daughter and comparing me to all the other great daughters all their friends have. so, yes, I go as far as pretending to be sick to avoid them.

Back to my new year's eve, I stayed in bed watching lame Netflix shows and playing a mobile game. which by the way no one was online because they all had new year plans and parties, while sad little old me sat in her bed playing the game all by my lonesome. 

**Why aren't I at a party or watching fireworks with my friends?** 

simple. because my parents won't let me. I am a 24-year-old adult who is still very much controlled by her parents. all the while, my younger brother is allowed to come and go as he pleases. and the funny thing is... that's what inspired me to start writing this post

Every time I left my room, I felt so sad. I saw my brother's room empty and I knew he was out having fun with his friends, while I was trapped in my room because I wasn't allowed to do anything. so I thought maybe I can start writing a blog to relieve some of my emotions and at least feel like I've accomplished something today.

And that's how I spent my new years...

Hope you had a better one &lt;3",lonely,Happy New year!!,2019-01-01 23:48:22
1007,WestonUchiha,1546342079,1,"The truth is I like being alone, I like my personal space and I like doing things I enjoy without being judged or having to justify doing the things I want to do.

Of course I feel so lonely sometimes and wish that I had someone to share things with, to have conversations with or even to be intimate with.

This is a recent realization, I've had a few people in my life recently that I slowly distance myself from without even realizing I'm doing it.
Tonight was finally when I accepted what I was doing and understood why I was doing it.

It's the end of the year and the start of the new one, so I met up with a girl that I had met recently and been talking to a little bit here and there so we could spend New Year's together, it's not like I didn't have fun but on my way home I realized that my new year would have probably been a lot better if I had just stayed home and done my own thing.

I'm still lonely and I still have this feeling like I want to have someone to share my life with but the truth is the social interaction that I get between work and hanging out with the few friends I have every once in a while might actually be all I can take.

 The feeling of loneliness is just a side effect of the way I choose to live my life.

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this here, but I guess maybe it's because I think some other people here might feel the same way and maybe reading this will help them realize it quicker than I did.

I actually enjoyed my new years even though I was the DD I had fun with a smallish group,  but then once I got home it just hit me like a truck. I spent 3/4ths of the year in love with someone and in the end they wanted to try with someone else. And when I try OLD it doesn't work for me. It's like having fun with friends can keep me distracted, but once I get a moment to think I just shut down. I want to love and be loved and yet it's just so hard that I think something is wrong with me. I'm glad I didn't drink, I'd probably feel worse.

1009,Unlovable_Being,1546331236,1,"Tonight something happened to me. It's still fresh, so this hurts &amp; I'm not going into detail. Here's my story;

I went out tonight to try &amp; be with people. I even had a date to the party... Kind of... We had agreed on being each other's New Year's Kiss. We've been dating for 2 months, though not exclusively yet (won't happen now).

She brought a date. Okay, we're not exclusive, not for lack of me trying, but we're not. However, she was completely wrapped around him all night.

Now, I shouldn't have been surprised, but basically he stole my kiss. So I left.

On top of everything else that's happened to me in the last 4 years, it really stung. She was very good to me &amp; asked me to be that kiss, it was the biggest reason I went at all.

If anyone reads my only big comment on my profile's history, maybe you'll see why it hurts this bad.

I feel like I'm a patient person. That I do my best to show how much I care. Yet, all I get is a big buildup to eventually being told I'm not good enough. I don't think it's a ""nice guy"" situation, because it happens over months or years. Unless I'm missing something?

 Feeling this lonely makes me I wish I were dead.
I'm not suicidal, but I wish my heart would just stop.

I hope none of you feel this tonight.",lonely,"It hurts, &amp; I wish I were dead.",2019-01-01 19:27:16

1011,8BlueX8,1546330446,1,"I know it’s long but please read it.

I don’t tell anyone about the loneliness I experience. It feels like glass shards in my stomach. I don’t tell my “friends” how I wish they would include me in the hang outs after school, because they lack understanding and would only ostracize me further. I don’t tell my sister who majors in psychology, because I feel like she wouldn’t know what to say which would only leave me feeling more alone than I was before. She’s home for the holidays so we’re sharing a room. Thankfully, I don’t think she can hear me crying. I don’t tell my parents, because they would weep because they think they failed at raising me. I don’t want them to think they failed raising me, I want them to be proud of me. I don’t tell anyone, no one gets to see, no one gets to hear, no one gets to know. No one gets to help. So I help myself. Or at least I’m trying. I try so hard at making a change to my life but nobody knows how much I struggle. I’m really good at my poker face. And I can never seem to stop myself from crying. I don’t like crying in front of other people, so I don’t unless I choose to let myself. I’ve cried so many nights it feels like each tear burns my cheek. My face feels raw. I don’t tell. I don’t even get bullied at school and I don’t self harm or anything, the reason I’m sad is because I’m completely overlooked, I also feel like I don’t even deserve to cry because worse things exist. People get raped, people lose loved ones, people get paralyzed and I wanna cry because I’m fucking lonely? I feel like a jerk just by being sad because my problems don’t fucking matter compared to the actual, real, horrible things that exist. But I still can’t stop myself from crying. Every time I’ve tried to open up to someone close to me, I realize as I’m talking that they aren’t listening. So I shut up. I hate feeling lonely all the time and I hate the thought of demanding attention like, “Me, me, ME! I’m a sad fucking pity party! Pay attention to my problems! Oh? There are people dying all around the world? Who cares because I’m sad!” No. I refuse to be a selfish asshole. So, I don’t tell anyone. Actually, this is the first time I’ve communicated these thoughts somewhere other than inside my own head. That’s the reason I made this Reddit account. I’ve tried everything to keep from feeling alone except for talking about it online. But only online, no one gets to know in my personal life. So no one knows. I just can’t let them know. No one gets to see, hear, or help me. So I’m trying to fix it myself. Everyone thinks I’m so strong, my “friends” actually come to me for help with their emotional problems. So I don’t bother anyone with my issues. But, sometimes... I really wish someone knew. I know this is going to sound super fucking pathetic, but, please comment or anything. I would really appreciate it, I just feel so alone right now. And sorry for the swearing, I try not to online cause it bothers some people but I couldn’t help myself during this post. I don’t reveal my age online so all I’m going to say is that I’m young. So I’m trying really hard not to be edgy, cringey, or dramatic, because I’m dead serious. I really am lonely. No one knows, except you. And yes I really do want you to leave a comment. Please I want to know if there is anyone else out there like me.",lonely,I Don’t Tell Anyone.,2019-01-01 19:14:06
1012,velvetpupper,1546326224,1,"Hi all. I hope you are all having an amazing start to your new year.

I am a F18 having a little trouble coping with my loneliness from this past year and for a while it was able to go away and I was content with myself but every now and then it creeps up on me in overwhelming power. I crumble down immediately. I loose sense of perspective in all aspects of my life. I truly feel as if there is no one I can talk to because no one understands my sense of worthlessness to the people around me. 

I also have this problem where I feel my loneliness is unjustifiable because I am stable in all aspects of my life . I go to a great university, my family is all healthy, Im financially stable, yet I still feel as if I am not good enough for the world around me. 

Throughout high school I always had friends, but I never considered any of them the so called ""best friends"" I never understood that someone other than a family member could be that close to me until college where I now feel like I have made genuine friendships. Even though I have found and made some genuine friendships in college, I still feel like I am inadequate and undeserving of those friendships. I am scared that those people mean more to me than I mean to them. Over this winter break I can't help but feel as if I am just a nobody that no one prioritizes or values.

I am sitting here ringing in the new years with my so called high school ""friends"" ditching me and not inviting me to hang out with them, many I have not seen for months, and my college friends being much more accepted and validated in their home towns. I do not know where I stand in the world, I do not believe anyone values me more than just a speck of dust. But I am also confused as if my loneliness and confusion on my self value is even justified in the first place. I do not know what  I am asking for out of you guys, I just know I need answers.

I didn't think it would ever get back of any kind of track. I couldn't even imagine a track. I thought it would just come to a halt or something would have to crash onto the back of me soon before something would change. I forgot about the brief moments where I realised how amazingly complex life is. How you can't truely fathom whether or when there's anything to expect from life. When you try to grasp how complex the universe is, you know that whatever you are grasping, it doesn't do it justice. Our minds are just a part of the complexity. Our bodies are ever renewing, you're walking around in a completely new body of cells at least every 10 years. Time, the past and the future are concepts, time is truely and honestly an everlasting now. And new years is actually just another day, as someone on tv pointed out just now. Out of nowhere things have taken a different turn for me. A turn I couldn't have forseen if I tried really hard one year ago. Don't lose hope. Life is something of its own, stick with it till it starts to show you something different. Wishing you all the best. ",lonely,Keep your heads up for the fireworks,2019-01-01 12:26:55

So What is my problem in life you ask??? Lets see


1) Crashed car? Check
2) Got mugged? Check
3) Reject your offer of help on reddit! Check
4) Christmas gifts got you hate? Check
5) Help colleagues &amp; Get hated on? Check

Why the fuck can't I have a meaningful relation in life?

I don't know! I look decent, I can hold conversations and yet I'm alone! Both in real life and on reddit? I'm not looking for relationships, I'm just looking for someone with whom I can feel a bit more engaged.

So I have been a decorated orator, and actor, so clearly my physical looks/oratory aren't the problem. 
For arguments sake even if they were then at least on reddit I shouldn't have had a problem! But I don't know what's going on!!! 

I really waana help people out, in whatever way I can, and I've fucking tried. Almost no one responds! Its like  people can figure out my post! And for the ones with which I initiate contact after 2-3 messages almost everyone seems to waana take my leave (almost because for the second time I got blocked, which makes it an approx  88% ghosting rate. Shocking !!! Right?

If I could post some advice on how to respond to a message from a person willing to help, don't ghost them! It takes an incredible amount of time and effort to prioritise you over whatever it is that goes on in their lives. The least you can do is to NOT leave the conversation unfinished.

So... Any advice on how to get better at this? Nope. Sorry, I would have written something if I knew, but I mean its really shocking how fucked I feel right now. Everything just wants to turn its back on me! I crashed my car, got mugged, got blocked on reddit, took the blame for coworkers in office, bought gifts for a couple for Christmas only to feel absolutely small and useless in life all in 4 days? 

Honestly I feel battered and bruised, both emotionally and mentally. Hopefully y'all have a better year than me.
