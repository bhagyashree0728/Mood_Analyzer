3,mrturtleog,1559301775,21,"For years I felt lonely, and that I had no one. These feelings would come in waves and I'd spend long periods of time sad and depressed, on the verge of tears.
I began dating my girlfriend a few months ago and though she is an amazing person, I didn't want to leave this sub before I was 100% sure that I am not lonely anymore.

So today I say it: I am not lonely.

I don't say this to flaunt but to pass on a message. It's possible to leave this place. It is absolutely 100% possible and many times, all it takes is one person. I read the posts on this subreddit and sometimes I get very emotional doing so. But I know one thing: it is possible to not be lonely. Don't give up on it.

See you on the other side my friends. Thank you for the support when times were rough.

4,cherrycontra,1559301112,24,"My boyfriend and I broke up last week and while I'm not sobbing constantly now, I still wake up and feel utterly alone like I used to before I met him. I look at my phone and realize there are no more good morning text messages, and it makes me sad. I'm copping better through out the day as I try to keep busy with things I need to do and hobbies, but that feeling when I wake up is still there, and I desire to be in his arms again. One thing that haunts me was the first night he told me he loved me where we were laying in bed together after a lovely date. We were holding each other and I said ""it would be wonderful to end and start everyday just like this"", and he told me that he would love for that, too, and that he would definitely never get out of bed and would always be late for work if that were the case! Then I told him I loved being with him, then he said he loved being with me, and a few seconds later, that's when he said it - ""I love you"". No one ever told me those words and I melted. I dreamed of cuddling in bed with someone like this and for someone to show me love, and it was happening. Now he's gone and I feel like I'm going through withdrawls at some point. My body craves his touch like crazy and I wish we were holding each other again. 

So, how does one cope with that empty, sad feeling in your chest when you wake up? That itself makes it difficult to get out of bed sometimes. 

I wonder if he misses me at all. Breakup was very mature but teary eyed from us both. Complicated situation where he isn't where he wants to be in his life, so that's why we parted. I didn't want it to end but he didn't see how he could sustain his part in the relationship with doing what he needed to do.",lonely,"How to cope with that sad, empty feeling in your chest when you wake up?",2019-05-31 21:11:52
5,CanBoysBeWaifus,1559300108,2,"Hello random void of people. I'm sure someone is out there right? This will probably have some random rambling but I just need to get it out of my system. I'm 25 and I really don't know how to make friends anymore. I have one friend who I talk to on a regular-ish basis, and I have my husband. I used to really like interacting and making new friends (at least online), there is some really great people in this world. I feel like all ties to those people have been long cut and there is no remaking a tie to those people though. 

I really wish I could hold onto a friendship, have a group like I once did but I feel like i'm becoming too old. People my age have their group, they have their ties and thats that. The last group who really accepted me and I really loved those people, I stopped talking to them because I couldn't be in my abusive house anymore, so all my time was spent out working, or just napping in my car. We lost touch for months while I saved up and moved out. I tried to mend fences and rejoin the group but by then it felt like everyone ""moved on."" I understand life happens and people move on, I still am sad that I could not spend more time with them. 

Since then though I got married last year, I have moved across the country and been adjusting to a new life. I've lost 40lbs since new year and i'm trying to improve myself, I'm trying to better myself so I can be healthy and happy. A new place, a new me, same old mental health. I've been depressed for longer than I remember, I've developed insanely bad anxiety, and I also might have bi-polar disorder. I never really let out my feelings to anyone. I try to stay positive. I try to find people to play video games with on a weekly basis but none ever stick. I will keep trying but I am losing hope. At least I have my husband and his family and my friend, I know a lot of people are less lucky than me. I am appreciative to my life that I have and I hate to sound like i'm complaining but there it is.

7,johnesqueda,1559290188,1,"I've been smoking since I was 18. I started after I had a suicidal episode and found out I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Weed has helped focus calm myself down and feel incontrol over myself.  I usually smoke about a bowl and a half a day. Less than a gram for sure. She used to be ok with it, and smoke with me when we wer younger  untill recently she started reading her bible again and gave me the ultimatum of weed or her.
 I explained to her I would try my best and I stopped for a week. But during that week i had major mood swings. Suicidal thoughts. Anxiety and I hated myself to the point where I just didn't want to live anymore. I then found some kief in an old jar took one hit and felt balanced after that.   
I explained to her that if I have to quit then I need medication to help me with my thoughts. She agreed but said I still couldn't smoke. I told her I would do my best to stop. I wouldn't buy anymore weed but if I got it for free by working or doing it on the side I could compromise. She stil said no. 
Yesterday I went to help out my neighbor who I work with.  
He has his own company  cannabis catered  events all over Los Angeles and everyone there smokes. I get a call from her saying she's leaving and taking our car and our dog. I told her not to and we'll talk about it when i get home. I get home around midnight and the car is gone &amp; so is our dog, along with her clothes.  I've called her all day today and she hasn't answered me and her mom hasn't answered me either. 
I'm not a bad person. I don't drink, I stay home, I pray, cook, and clean.  I make sure all he needs are met before mine, but when it comes to this I feel like I have to stand my ground for my own self control or at least untill I can get the right medication for myself.

Because either it’s just being newly weds or he’s a monster that so bad but they still don’t understand.

I hurt this person, I like this person and cared about them but continued to hurt this person? What I don't understand is why do I continue hurting people which makes them leave. No matter how apologetic I am, nobody stays and then its back to square one wondering that I can have a stable life where I haven't been super depressed for a few months but I can't have a stable relationship with people. Literally everyone who has met me, they end up getting hurt by me. Before you ask, I have seen professionals about it  (4 different ones) but they don't help but asked me about other questions that are so off topic? ""hOWS YouR SLEep?"" So I'm stuck continuing to trying to figure things out. I'm considering about isolating myself from any kind of relationships except my family. I'm tired of having to take care of my feelings when these things happen, it's just exhausting and at times, I'm not sure what to do. 

I know in time, I will move forward and I will heal but with thinking about my habits how it hurts people, years passed and I still let it slip. I've been in these situations so many times with people but I haven't learned or figured it out. I thought as time pass, trying what I can do to cope with my mental health, I thought I would be okay to have a stable relationship with anyone. 

I wish I could take all the pain away from everyone who I hurt in the past, I've carried this guilt for too long that I can't figure it out, it just continues to poison people who wants to get close with me. 

**To everyone I hurt:** I'll always be sorry for everything that happened between us. I still think about you all at times, I'll sometimes look at your profiles to see how you're doing without me and I hope that it's happier without me. At times, I want to message you and ask how are things but I know it's not my place anymore to do that.

17,emotionsare,1559278619,3,"I'm a 30-something woman who is very fortunate in many respects. I have been married for eight years; I live near my mother and siblings, whom I am close to; I have several close friends, some who have been around since before I was a teenager... and yet, I am sometimes incredibly lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with things that are difficult or uncomfortable to talk about. For example, my husband has depression and anxiety, and when he is having a hard time, it's hard for me to know who I can talk to/be open with. When I feel upset, I don't know where to turn, and I often wind up internalizing my thoughts and feelings, ultimately leading to feeling very alone. It used to be that I had my grandmother. Our relationship was rocky in some respects, but another thing that it was was brutally honest. I knew I could tell her almost anything, and she'd be a sounding board. But, when she passed away two years ago, that openness and honesty void way never filled by anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Another outlet I feel I no longer have is creating relationships and interacting with people online-only, often anonymously. When I was a teenager, I dabbled quite a bit in talking with random internet people. The physical disconnect made honesty and openness easier, and I got quite a lot out of those relationships. However, as I've become older, my online life has increasingly been tied to the real me/my identity (thanks a lot, social media), which has stripped the internet of many of its anonymous qualities for me. That's why I'm here tonight, on a throwaway account, just typing my thoughts. I'm not looking for a solution, I just want to type what's in my brain and put it out there, which I'm hoping will allow me to feel less alone.",lonely,Being lonely even when you aren't alone,2019-05-31 14:56:59

Not really sure where to begin... I'm just tired of doing this all the time. I'm tired of not measuring up, not being good enough, the way that I look, not really any friends, no romantic options (even when not depressed), etc.

I basically go to a bs job, come home, then either try to workout or wonder, why bother, and watch tv/movies until I go to sleep. I've had issues with my boss. Super nice to my face, jokes around with me and so on (thinking he was a nice guy) but found out he has been secretly trying to get me fired. This makes me even more reclusive/isolated at work.

I don't really fit in anywhere. I always am the outsider, looking in. Socially awkward and weird. I have no real friends to spend any time with and women in general really want nothing to do with me, even at my best. After years of being alone I've developed a complex. I hate the way that I look and the problems with my body. I have bad stretch marks from working out and from being previously a bit overweight, I'm losing my hair..., my face sucks, I have white sun spots all over my arms/shoulders/back, teeth aren't great, I'm 5'7, etc... I don't really blame women for not having ever been attracted to me lol.

I've tried online dating extensively in the past but it never worked out. Not really any wonder why... women have so much choice when it comes to dating, especially online. They can easily find 100 better potential suitors in just a few minutes.

I've tried a psychologist but I feel like it's just a waste of time. I went 3 times and couldn't afford to waste any more money. Whatever he said could be found on a basic google search, very generic advice.

I'm just very tired of it all and just want a way out. If I could just press a button to have never existed or to not wake up the following day, I'd press it right now. It wouldn't really matter much to anyone other than my mom. And while that's nice that she cares, it just isn't enough.",lonely,Tired of never being good enough and not measuring up - 28/m,2019-05-30 23:34:16
38,infamlurker,1559223221,9,"Don't come here with ""you'll find someone"" bullshit. I know I won't. 

I have never had a girlfriend, nor will I ever. When you're a lesbian your dating pool is horrendously small filled with the same types of women. Other lesbians say the same thing, how hard lesbian dating is so this isn't just me before you start throwing accusations. 

It's always butch women, or unattractive women. I have never seen a good looking lesbian who looks like a normal heterosexual woman. You're literally not even allowed to have any baggage or struggle with anything when you're a lesbian or else it's a red flag. You have to be perfect or else you're done. If you don't make being gay your personality then you're a self hating gay yadda yadda. Sorry I want to keep my sexuality private and not wear gay pride pins on every item of clothing I have and dye my hair rainbow. 

I don't want to be 30 and single. I don't want to be in the 20's with no dating experience. I'm so tired of being lonely, and I just know it I'll never find someone and get married ect. I'm fucked. I don't want to live life like this. No one gets how it's like to be forever alone when they have boyfriends/girlfriends and date and love. Some people don't get any of that and it sure as hell is a fucking good reason to kill yourself, when you don't even get to have basic human love. 

No one has ever tried to prove me wrong, they all agree with me. The odds are not in my favor so theres very slim chance of me finding someone. Literally my best friend told me he agrees with me. With his perfect heterosexual life and girlfriend. 

I will never get to experience being loved like that. I will never relate to being able to have a best friend that you fuck. And spoil. And trust. Little things like coming home from a event and fucking and cuddling.

I wish I could believe that it gets better. But it doesn't. All lesbians complain about it being lonely.

40,ColoradoMcLovin,1559221087,5,"I’ve been seeing my fwb for about a year now, things have been great. I really enjoyed the relationship and we seemed to have a lot of fun. Fast forward to last week when he abruptly starts canceling plans and making up lame excuses. “Oh, I forgot my sister hamster is in town and we have dinner plans”
I knew what was happening and sure enough the abrupt change of plans lead to him blocking me on social media and giving me no explanation.

Above losing my person who I got physical comfort from, I also abruptly lost my best friend. 
He did eventually talk with me and told me his feeling for me changed and he met someone else with a better connection and would like to demote me to his FRIEND while she takes over as #1 fwb.
He tells me he needs to work on our friendship and he wants to take Alex out of the equation-
I’m a big girl, I can handle a breakup

I’m just so lonely in this town- I can make more friends, sure. But to lose him so quickly and to know someone else is there is painful. I hate feeling this way, I wish I could hold my head high and be ok with being alone and lonely- but I’m not. 
I can “text” him and I can come over- but what good is a cake without frosting?? 

I don’t know why my mind is so messed up over him, I’ve had plenty of fwb and never had feeling this strong and I absolutely hate it.

And the smarter you are, the more messed up your brain is, due to loneliness (cause loneliness basically destroys your brain, humans are social creatures), but it can also mean other things too: wealth, a better life later, etc. Yes, only about 2% of being rich is about intelligence and luck, and 98% is hard work, but still, generally, the smarter the person, usually the happier and the wealthier. If that isn't you, then think about your day or such, see if you're smart or not. Self-analyze yourself. Compare yourself to others. Most likely, you'll do smart things that normal people wouldn't do. If you aren't smart, then know that loneliness is something very common. 33% of adults are lonely. 10% of teens are socially isolated. A lesser percentage have chronic loneliness.

Nobody really ever mentions me nor am I noticed when I reply in chat. I could leave the chat at any moment and nobody would bat an eye. I'm forgettable and I hate the feeling that I can be easily replaced because I'm a disposable friend. 

And even though I have a sub-group of friends from the same college group that I'm closer with (2 others), I never really feel like I'm wanted there either. Whenever we would hang out I would always just feel like a third wheel. They would have conversations with each other and every time I would try to jump in I would just be immediately cut off. I would be ridiculed for small things such as my depression and suicidal thoughts and while I like to think it was all in a joking manner, it still hurts to have something so serious to me and damaging to my mental health be used as a tool to belittle me.

Because I moved so much growing up, I never really had the chance to develop meaningful relationships, only being able to make a couple of friends but none that really needed me as I needed them. They all had their own friend groups and much more important relationships. All I ever had and ever will have are my stupid games and anime that I'm growing sick and tired of with each passing day.

Besides, I feel like if I stopped talking to them they would't even care or notice.

I know that some people recommended me to do stuff outside alone anyways but I don't know... What would you do? I'm afraid that I'll spend the whole summer alone. My parents and other family members are working.

73,polarsames,1559136226,6,"One beautiful April morning, on a narrow side street in Tokyo’s fashionable Harujuku neighborhood, I walked past the 100% perfect girl.  


Tell you the truth, she’s not that good-looking. She doesn’t stand out in any way. Her clothes are nothing special. The back of her hair is still bent out of shape from sleep. She isn’t young, either - must be near thirty, not even close to a “girl,” properly speaking. But still, I know from fifty yards away: She’s the 100% perfect girl for me. The moment I see her, there’s a rumbling in my chest, and my mouth is as dry as a desert.  


Maybe you have your own particular favorite type of girl - one with slim ankles, say, or big eyes, or graceful fingers, or you’re drawn for no good reason to girls who take their time with every meal. I have my own preferences, of course. Sometimes in a restaurant I’ll catch myself staring at the girl at the next table to mine because I like the shape of her nose.  


But no one can insist that his 100% perfect girl correspond to some preconceived type. Much as I like noses, I can’t recall the shape of hers - or even if she had one. All I can remember for sure is that she was no great beauty. It’s weird.  


“Yesterday on the street I passed the 100% girl,” I tell someone.  


“Yeah?” he says. “Good-looking?”  


“Not really.”  


“Your favorite type, then?”  


“I don’t know. I can’t seem to remember anything about her - the shape of her eyes or the size of her breasts.”  


“Strange.”  


“Yeah. Strange.”  


“So anyhow,” he says, already bored, “what did you do? Talk to her? Follow her?”  


“Nah. Just passed her on the street.”  


She’s walking east to west, and I west to east. It’s a really nice April morning.  


Wish I could talk to her. Half an hour would be plenty: just ask her about herself, tell her about myself, and - what I’d really like to do - explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981. This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock build when peace filled the world.  


After talking, we’d have lunch somewhere, maybe see a Woody Allen movie, stop by a hotel bar for cocktails. With any kind of luck, we might end up in bed.  


Potentiality knocks on the door of my heart.  


Now the distance between us has narrowed to fifteen yards.  


How can I approach her? What should I say?  


“Good morning, miss. Do you think you could spare half an hour for a little conversation?”  


Ridiculous. I’d sound like an insurance salesman.  


“Pardon me, but would you happen to know if there is an all-night cleaners in the neighborhood?”  


No, this is just as ridiculous. I’m not carrying any laundry, for one thing. Who’s going to buy a line like that?  


Maybe the simple truth would do. “Good morning. You are the 100% perfect girl for me.”  


No, she wouldn’t believe it. Or even if she did, she might not want to talk to me. Sorry, she could say, I might be the 100% perfect girl for you, but you’re not the 100% boy for me. It could happen. And if I found myself in that situation, I’d probably go to pieces. I’d never recover from the shock. I’m thirty-two, and that’s what growing older is all about.  


We pass in front of a flower shop. A small, warm air mass touches my skin. The asphalt is damp, and I catch the scent of roses. I can’t bring myself to speak to her. She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp white envelope lacking only a stamp. So: She’s written somebody a letter, maybe spent the whole night writing, to judge from the sleepy look in her eyes. The envelope could contain every secret she’s ever had.  


I take a few more strides and turn: She’s lost in the crowd.  


Now, of course, I know exactly what I should have said to her. It would have been a long speech, though, far too long for me to have delivered it properly. The ideas I come up with are never very practical.  


Oh, well. It would have started “Once upon a time” and ended “A sad story, don’t you think?”  


Once upon a time, there lived a boy and a girl. The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.  


One day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.  


“This is amazing,” he said. “I’ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you’re the 100% perfect girl for me.”  


“And you,” she said to him, “are the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I’d pictured you in every detail. It’s like a dream.”  


They sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It’s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.  


As they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one’s dreams to come true so easily?  


And so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, “Let’s test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other’s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we’ll marry then and there. What do you think?”  


“Yes,” she said, “that is exactly what we should do.”  


And so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.  


The test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other’s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.  


One winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season’s terrible inluenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence’s piggy bank.  


They were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.  


Time passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.  


One beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew:  


She is the 100% perfect girl for me.  


He is the 100% perfect boy for me.  


But the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever.  


A sad story, don’t you think?

About a year ago I was shockingly dumped by my boyfriend of almost 4 years. We had spoken about marriage, lived together for about 3 years and owned a  cat together. I’m still not sure why anything changed I was given a bunch of answers that never matched up, only to find out shortly after he left that he was dating a coworker. And since he never fessed up I can only put 2 and 2 together. 

It’s been a while since then and I’ve grown for the better. I had some tinder dates which didn’t end up well and I hate online dating. The last time I dated this wasn’t around and I was much younger. I’ve managed to make some great friends at my new job and that’s wonderful. What sucks is I go home and immediately feel lonely. 

I think it’s only gotten worse since I’ve started a FWB. When we’re together it’s fun and it’s so nice to lay next to someone. But when they are busy or don’t want to stay, I feel weirdly unwanted. A lot of the time all I want is someone to lay next to and cuddle. 

I’m trying not to put pressure on myself and just live my life a little more care free, but I genuinely feel like I’m never going to find someone who wants to be with me forever. Or whatever forever is.

I’m sure there will be people who judge me and my situation because let’s be honest, this is Reddit. That’s what people do here. I’d appreciate any negativity kept to yourself, no one needs it and I certainly don’t at this point. 

Six months ago I was living in TX, I was in a seemingly great relationship, and I was on track to a new career. I was also on birth control and then on Christmas Day I took a pregnancy test and found out that despite the BC, I was pregnant. I told the father fully expecting a freak out and got far more than that. In response the decided he did not want anything to do with this child or with me. I didn’t beg or plead, I didn’t argue, I just accepted that I would have to to this alone and decided that it was probably for the best. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, I realized that I’d never be able to make any kind of living where I was as the cost of living was far too high so, I made the choice to move across the country to live with my mom until after the baby is born so there would be a larger support system, I’d get to be with her for a time after the birth, and the prospect of making it as a single mother are much higher. 

2 weeks ago I got on a plane with the few things I deemed important and moved. I expected loneliness at first but regardless I feel so soul crushingly alone that I don’t even know what to do. I don’t have a vehicle yet, I don’t have a job (I’m used to working full time), I have no friends, I have family but I’ve been away for so long that I feel detached from all of them. My mother has a good heart but she’s also very cold and emotionally detached, this just leaves me feeling unwanted and burdensome. 

I’ve wanted this baby the entire pregnancy and I can’t wait to meet her but I’m also so afraid of the future because of how hollow I already feel.

110,eirangelique,1559071840,11,"A few days ago, a guy from my town went missing ( to make sure no one stress out, they found him,he had run away ) even though I don't really know him, I had a few classes with him, I knew deep down that something was wrong. I felt really bad because I saw it and didn't do anything to help or be there for him. I 've been in this situation before and I wish no one to live in a state of mind that cause you so much damage and sadness. I don't really know why he did it but I think he is  very lonely and don't like to open up or talk to people, he is an introvert. But the thing is that I didn't do anything. I promise myself I wouldn't let anyone suffer like I have in the past and try my best to make people happy and help when they need it! I wish I was there for him and it's been 2days and I can't stop thinking about it. The first thing i do in the morning is thinking about him!

The weirdest thing is that a few hours before I learn about this disappearance, I thought about him while I was driving. I felt so bad i couldn't sleep and take my car and ""try"" to go find him even though I knew I couldn't. I cried so much because i felt I was a part of this problem and that I could have done something. I realized He was never laughing in class when the teacher was saying jokes and he avoid talking to anybody and leave the class pretty fast. He was often in advance and read books alone in the dark in the classroom. Also, he stopped going to classes and that's why I can't get over it! 

( my first class with him 2-3 years ago, he was very kind to me and ask me if I wanted to be his partner and he help me in a way because I thought no one would ask and it makes me happy but still we haven't talk during this class and the ones after! He also don't show up for a few and the exams as well).  I don't know what to do now and I try to find him but nothing, not even on social media, nothing. I really want to be there for him!

111,b00gerbandit,1559069511,3,"We come here because we are lonely. Whether we post in r/lonely or anywhere else on Reddit, we are looking for connection, all of us. We receive it on some level, usually briefly, but it's still not enough. We start posting looking for friends, most connections are also brief. It's the nature of the beast. 

I stay at home with my 2yo, my husband works at a job that barely pays the bills. If I could work, I would. Instead I have a couple of side hustles that fall within my capabilities to make a little cash here and there. Everyone on my side of the block know me and stop to chat. Some of our other neighbors know me and my son on sight, as we are outside almost every day from April through October. The workers at the local Aldi have known us since LO was 3 months old, it's a pleasure to interact with them. I can talk to just about anybody on the street.

BUT! If it involves any kind of stakes- possible rejection, putting my foot in your mouth, not clicking well, potential hurt and/or hardship... I have so many feels and sometimes odd reactions. I'm no longer the confident, affable, engaging person I otherwise am. I'm shy and kind of awkward. I either turn inward or go into overshare overload. I don't have many friends, or my own family. My husband's family *are* my family, but I have maybe 2 friends outside of that. My husband is regularly at work 14 hours a day. I stay at home. God it's so lonely my husband and I are best friends and definitely make it work. Our relationship is healthy. Doesn't mean I'm not alone at 12p while I'm making lunch and there's a whining toddler at my feet. Or in the quiet of nap time, theoretically a time for me to relax, is spent doing the things that I can't do when LO is awake. Or being just too tired to do much. Depression is starting to set in some.

 I'm burned out, my husband is burned out. His bosses are verbally abusive towards their employees. His boss is the VP's son and his mom is HR (small company). They suck at their jobs and gang up on everyone who doesn't let the family disrespect them. The owner either can't see it, or won't do anything about it. Everything is falling apart there, it sucks because we had made a few good buddies and genuinely care about the company. I'm personally hurt, especially when I tried to reach out with my own concerns and never received a response. I have to deal with it's effects privately. My husband is already so strung out over it, I'm his rock. I feel alone in my experience of it all. He's got a job offer that we're very tempted to accept. 

Idk if I need someone to talk to or not, but I definitely needed to vent. Thanks, guys",lonely,"We're lonely, I'm lonely",2019-05-29 04:51:51

But would we pass this same opportunity for a female of the same age? More people I think would talk to a 25 year old female than a 25 year old male and that is because I think a lot of people see this sub as a dating platform. I’m wrong for a few but I really think it’s a majority.

I also see a lot of people just lurking here and message once and then that’s it. It’s happened to me with a few people. I give them access to message me and then when they see who I am they flake away. If you want to ‘help’ then don’t seek out people who are feeling pain because it might make you feel holier that you may have given someone a moment of your time. It actually makes me feel worse when you message once and then never again because it reminds me of how I got lonely in the first place.

I was so depressed about it, because the friends i lost were very important to me, but sadly I'm not as important to them. 
I've been very unhappy for weeks now, until today, I'm finally brave enough to tell my sister about this. Her reaction to this was that she is sad, because im sad and she was unable to do anything to help me. Needless to say, i was very touched.
It is only now i realize that i've been so focused on people that dont care as much about me, i forgot that there are people out there that actually cares about me.

124,KinkyGriffey,1559015999,12,"I am 39 and divorced. I have 3 beautiful daughters and they, honestly, are the only thing that has kept me going the last few years. I try to consider myself blessed. I have my daughters and they are so amazing in every way. Smart, funny, wonderful personalities. They are all beautiful and really starting to hit their stride and find themselves in life. It is a true joy to be there father and to see them grow and develop into  the wonderful young ladies they are becoming. I tell myself that is more then enough. I am greedy wanting more. There are so many others who have it worse then I do. 

I have lived through a lot in my life. I don’t think I’m extraordinary in anyway, but I do feel sometimes like the amount of shit I’ve been through has been excessive. I might eventually write it all down, but it honestly has been a lot. And I used to be strong. I was the glue that held my family together growing up. I was the one. I found the love of my life and I couldn’t have been luckier. We were in love. In every way. We had babies and it was like a dream. And then more tragedy. I didn’t handle it well. For the first time I wasn’t strong. I was weak, so fucking weak. So pathetic. And now, the aftermath is too much to bear. I lost everything. Everything I love, everything I own. Now all I have left is my daughters half the time. It’s not enough. The thought of them not with me at all times is almost unbearable. I tried to give myself time. To adjust, to move on. It’s been almost three years since we split and sure there are days it doesn’t hurt as much as it once did. But the other days? It still feels so fresh. There are mornings I wake up and I look around and think, this can’t possibly be real. I had everything I wanted in life and now I’m alone. 

I tried dating a little. Actually, I have been on two dates and had a couple one night stands. I felt nothing. I want someone. I want to love. I want to find all of that again. I am kind of a sappy, hopeless romantic. And I miss the little romantic things. I miss the goodnight and good morning kisses. The hugs and smiling face when I get home. The little notes and texts. I miss my best friend. I want, desperately to find that again. But I feel so lost. I have literally gone out like 4 times in the nearly 3 years. I have literally no family except my kids. Nobody. My friends are all older like me and have kids and families. They don’t go out. I have tried tinder and bumble and match, but everything is so different. I am nearly 40, I have put on weight, a lot of moms and dads can relate I’m sure. I never had trouble getting a date when I was younger, but now it’s hard to get anyone I am remotely attracted to to swipe right on me. And I know that’s not the best way to find someone. But I can’t seem to force myself to go to a bar or anywhere else alone. It’s so hard to make friends at this age. I don’t know how people do it. 

I have tried repeatedly to go out. I have joined a gym. I work out. I have improved my diet so much. Cutting out fast foods, cooking my own meals basically every day. I have read more then ever. So there are some things I have done better. But the loneliness is killing me. When I don’t have my girls, I am a sad, shell of myself. There are some days on the weekend where I haven’t even left bed. I try to force myself up, to get out, do anything, but I can’t seem to do it. The loneliness only grows. 

I know I messed up. A lot. I made this mess for myself. I let my depression, sadness and guilt consume me, overtake me. And I am reaping everything I showed. Yet my ex isn’t without some blame. During my hardest time she was out with another man. So there has always been some anger and so much hurt and betrayal there. I know I should move on. And honestly, I basically have. From her at least. I mourn the family I lost, the life I lost. I don’t mourn her any longer. But it doesn’t make it easier. I don’t know how to get out of this funk. I don’t know where to begin. I have a good job, but it’s a small company and we just, finally got health insurance. So I will be going to the doc after the first and talking to someone. The last thing I want is to get on medication, but maybe that’s what I need. 

So I’m not sure where to go from here. I never in a million years thought I would be this guy. I have always had friends, always been social. I was popular and the center of so much fun and attention at one point. And now, I am this sad man who is completely, utterly alone. The days I don’t have my children I feel like I might be better off dead. I wouldn’t ever consider that, not even a consideration. But it doesn’t stop me from thinking about it or sometimes wishing for it. I don’t want to be the weird guy who is alone at 40, at 50. This is no way to live. 

I am sorry if I come across whiny or pathetic. I am so overwhelmed with this, all the time. I look forward to going to work, to interact and actually do something. I just am not sure where to go from here. I don’t want my kids to think less of me. To think their dad is a loser who is alone. But where do I go from here? How do I change? How do I fix this? I want, so badly, to be the person I used to be. To be confident and fun. To be a person people gravitate to, people like and want to spend time with. I want to be a man my kids are proud to call dad. I know they love me completely and are proud to call me dad, but as they get older I wonder if that will change. I wonder what would happen if I got sick or hurt. Who would help me if I needed that help. I wonder how I can make it the next 5, 10 years or even longer feeling this completely alone. Hopefully I will break out of this and life will be great again one day. But I can’t even fathom how at this point.",lonely,So alone and I don’t know what to do,2019-05-28 13:59:59

The realization that there's only you out there and no one who cares and thinks about you, there's just you in a dark and a lonely space. I've had one good friend before and ever we've been friends for 7 years, but he moved out of the country and I did my best to keep in touch and not let our friendship die, but it did. He found new friends and created a great social circle and I'm happy and proud for him, but it also saddens me that I'm still at the same spot with nobody. We had a pretty cool bromance and he told me about how he cared about me and loved me and how we'll be good friends for years to come and do many things together and all, I still open up those messages sometimes to feel better about myself. I just want to reach out to him and tell him how I miss my friend and all, but I just can't bring myself to do it, I tried to reach out to him many times before and clearly he wasn't interested anymore and I'll just look like a bum who can't move on, but he's the only friend I've ever had too.

Fuck dude, I don't know what to do with myself. I can't talk to my parents cause of our awkward relationship, to my brothers, to my cousins, there must be something wrong with me. Our family hangs out all the time with each other, my siblings always get invited, but I don't. Maybe it's my fault and I'm just not very likable as a person and it sucks cause I don't think anyone ever really liked me. I think I'm pretty successful when it comes finances and all that which is cool, right, I can buy things now yet that doesn't bring any satisfaction when you have nobody, I wish I could trade everything I have for decent social skills and just a group of friends. I'm tired of acting happy to everyone and saying that everything is great and all when everything is going horribly bad. Not sure how things will remain like this, but I'm so sick and tired of it and I have been trying to change and become better and I bought into all that self improvement stuff. I started working out, reading books, journaling and meditation and everything to fill my day and just distract myself from thinking about stuff like this, but there's always days that suck where you get reminded of how much your life sucks. And sure all of that stuff is progress I have a nicer body, I'm learning new things and all. But what good is that when I can't be happy or anything, nothing feels good.

133,maloneySun,1559005699,0,"So this thread seems to only be about people posting how miserable they are being lonely, and every post usually sounds the same. Instead of wallowing in your sorrows hoping for pity, start taking action to change yourself. No good comes out of typing out a paragraph on how miserable you are to random strangers online, you may feel like youre getting something off your chest, but guess what,  youll still be the same pathetic loner tomorrow. Venting about your situation doesnt help anyone, instead start learning how to make friends. Learn how to make others feel good about themselves, how to conversate and build rapport. All the information you need to become the person you want to be is online, there are hundreds of articles on making friends, conversating, and change your life around 180, but it seems like none of you want the help, youd rather stay the same because its more comfortable than changing who you are. So before posting that ""all hope is lost for me"" post, ask yourself if youve actually tried putting yourself out there, and if you didnt stop even if you ""failed"".  Nobody will come save you, this world does not care about you. And being a depressed pity seeking fiend is not going to get you anywhere.

When I go out with kids my age, I have to be a completely different person for them to like me. If act like my shy, introverted self i’d get nowhere. Yet still, when I’m fun and outgoing, and fake, I get nowhere. I never get invited out by anyone, unless I invite them somewhere. 

It just feels like i’m at a dead end, trying to please people who don’t even want me in their life. I see them hanging out without me on snapchat stories and get sad, but when I tell my mom she says “you have to invited yourself out with them.” Yeah, i’m just gonna say “hey i’m gonna come over to your place even though you didn’t invite me, see you soon!” because that’s how you “fit in”. 

It’s easy to tell when someone doesn’t want me around, and I get that vibe from everyone here. I’m just unwanted. I wish I belonged to something. I have never in my 18 years of living here, felt like I belonged or even had a true friend here. 

I probably wouldn’t have survived if it weren’t for internet friends. The internet made me realize that not everyone is like the people in my town, there is so much diversity out there. I just wish I could physically reach it.",lonely,"I hate living in a small, backwards town",2019-05-28 10:14:32

I feel like I'm honestly gonna be forever alone. Like, I have been single since 2013. Now I'm not disgustingly ugly, or hideous or whatever. I have sex on occasion. I have a pretty steady fwb even though the one doesnt even turn me on anymore. 

Kinda recently I started having sex with someone else I've known since I was a teenager (I'm 28 now if that gives any indication of time). The sex with the new guy. Oh. My. God. I have NEVER had anything like that before, besides when I used to have fun and get high here and there. Anyway. 

Why is it that I can have sex with someone like that and feel no emotional attachment? Hes an awesome friend. We have great conversations. But we dont have much in common. Maybe 30% of our interests? Hes prepping for the end of the world and working out and I'm sitting here on reddit venting and watching teen mom 2. The only thing that makes me happy about this is I know I've grown. Usually whenever I sleep with someone I usually fall for them. Whether or not I have anything in common. This time I havent. I'm more upset about the fact that I can have sex like that, and not be involved with them emotionally. I'll usually fall for someone at the drop of a dime. Especially after hooking up with them. 

I need that emotional support. I need someone to be there emotionally for me. I'm not super depressed. But I'm tired of coming home and going on POF or staring at my phone waiting for my ""friends"" to text me. It's sad.

One of them keeps all her feelings to herself, but then snaps and admits paranoia that the other is poisoning me against her. The other thinks that if I show any sympathy for the first, i’m betraying her and not being a friend. after a fight that I got dragged into, I was so shaken up that I went to my parents to get away. I’ve never turned to them for emotional issues before because they are emotionally incompetent, but it was nice to be fed and out of that house for awhile. Being with them reaffirmed that they don’t know how to be helpful in the way that I’ve always needed, and even when i ask them for what I need explicitly (“can i sit next to you awhile” “can you listen to this hard subject without laughing it off”) they brush it off or are clearly too uncomfortable to do it. fine.

So, being social and stuff should be good, but I got cancelled on yesterday. 

I was going to go on a second date with a guy I've been talking to and, fuck me I keep overthinking this and I can't deal with it. He cancelled on me saying he was sick and had no energy. Which is fair enough, but with all the stories in r/dating about how you might go on a date with someone and then they start cancelling plans and expect you to take the hint, I know I won't be able to handle that well, if that's what's happening. I thought it went really well, but I honestly don't know, I have autism and read situations wrong. 

So I'm feeling really shitty over, having found a guy who I can connect to. And my ex nicely confirmed today that we can't really be more than distant friends at this point, he broke up with me and is having issues with the fact that I'm dating other people now. 

I haven't really spoken to a lot of my university friends since the semester ended and a lot of them didn't move for uni starting up, so with the price of commuting, I won't see them for 5 months. Which is fucking wonderful, totally doesn't feel like a slap in the face.

And I guess the real kicker of it all is my birthday is popping up soon. By soon I mean in 1 month and 1 day I'll be 20, and I hate the fact that I'm gonna be a year older, and I feel like I'm wasting my time doing anything I do, nothing feels like I'm going in the right direction. I don't feel like I'm meeting new people, because PS4 friends don't really count. And suddenly I'm no long a teenager and I'm getting old and I should be enjoying my life, but I'm just stuck in this pit of loneliness. 

I just can't be alone, I'm sick of it. And no matter how social I seem to be nothing changes it. I could be talking to people for an hour or 2 straight, and need to go to the bathroom and within the time it takes me to leave the conversation and go do whatever I'll be sobbing uncontrollably, because I'm alone.

I've recently graduated from high school and through out it, I was always been quiet, it's one trait of mine that everyone seems to recognize, but I wasn't always like that. Sometime through middle school I suddenly shifted from a naive, talkative, and fun loving kid, to the more quiet and reserved personality that I've adopted. I first thought that this would be better than the former, as I had believed it would keep me out of drama, which it did. Unfortunately, it caused me to become much more shy and had made it feel impossible to find a relationship.

I find that part of the reason for the sudden shift is that throughout middle school and early high, my family has been experiencing a lot of conflicts. Namely constant fights between my mother and father and whenever one would start I would always hide in my room, waiting for it to end. I even found myself plugging my ears with headphones as to not hear them fight. My father often drunk a lot before fights and would begin smashing or throwing things. At one point he even smashed an entire table. I would try to play games with friends i had online to help me take my mind off the fighting but it almost always wasn't enough, and they would sometimes take the fight into my room. To add onto the fighting, my father worked a job that made move from state to state constantly, meaning I had to switch schools almost every year. I even moved from three different schools in my freshman year of highschool. Inevitably, the thing I feared most happened and my mother and father divorced. I was silent for several weeks at school after that, I almost failed my freshman year because of it all.

When it comes to getting a relationship, I've always been incompetent. As early as middle school I would like some girl, but always find it impossible to actually speak to them. I had always been afraid of directly speaking to girls and part of me still is. I really can't explain why either, but it is frustrating to say the least. The most painful part of all is that I've came so close to actually getting a girlfriend. So. Many. Times, but I would always fuck it up somehow, and I would just look like a fool, either because I couldn't take a hint, or I was too shy to simply fucking say ""hi"", and it makes me fucking hate myself for it. I would reprimand myself, saying that I could of done this or that, but your clearly too stupid to understand.

I have never actually been a mean guy I only ever really wanted people to be my friend.

I never had a single friend show to a birthday party I liked the gifts but I always hated my birthday for that reason. That birthday was the first time I ever felt rejected and it was terrible. I was kinda the clown for awhile too but even tho I made a few funny jokes and got along with everyone I still never really had friends most of my time was Legos and tv in my house. I changed schools 4 times one I actually liked I was there for 3 years I knew everybody I was a little bit of a bully but I had friends I played sports. A social life was all I ever wanted all I cared about was that my peers knew I existed. And I had it. Then I moved did a bunch of drugs and dropped out.

For example, this job is a lot more difficult than I anticipated, and I’m thinking maybe I’m not good enough to work there. It’s been about two months and I‘m struggling to befriend my coworkers, most of which are already in this medical program and are doing great.
I feel like I‘m not smart enough to be in this medical program, and I’m not confident enough to be a personal trainer- despite loving medicine and fitness with all of my heart. I’ve been training a few friends and family for about a year now successfully, but I’m worried that my insecurity with myself will be obvious to my actual clients.  

I don’t know why I can’t just believe in myself or feel good about where I am, especially since a couple years ago I was unemployed, depressed, and struggling with drinking problems. 
Even though I know factually I’ve come a long way, I don’t feel any pride or happiness about where I am, but rather constant anxiety about moving forward and doubts about my abilities. A small part of me wants to just walk away and go back to unhealthy habits, even though I know that isn’t the right thing to do. 

Anyone else experienced/experiencing this? How can I stop doubting myself and feel confident in my abilities? I don’t really have anyone close I can talk to about this, so any honest feedback or personal experiences are much appreciated.

175,The_Lone_Musician,1558932761,1,"I don't want to die, but it's been very hard to be alive lately. The few things that keep me going are my family (or at least a few members of my family), my friend Kieran, my passion for music, and the smallest hope I still have for a better tomorrow. 

My family is self-explanatory. I love my brothers and my mother, as well as my grandparents. My father is a different story, though I don't necessarily hate him or have zero love for him. I'd hate to devastate them by killing myself, despite my brain always telling me they'd just ""get over it"" anyways. Maybe they would, but I dunno. 

My friend, Kieran, is also a reason. He's been there for me for six years. He's done many financial and moral things for me. He's kept me from going on a downward spiral many, many times. And yet, I still treat him like shit because of how bitter and sad I feel all the time. I don't deserve him, I really don't. I love the guy more than he could ever know, he can be more of a brother to me than my actual brothers sometimes. 

Music is self-explanatory. It's what keeps me going. 

And hope is also self-explanatory, though I question every day on how I still have any hope. That being said, I still really wish I weren't alive. I have things to be thankful for, though they're in short supply. 

Anyways, I'm lonely 50% of the time, and the other 50% of the time, I'm just depressed.  There is hardly any room for happiness, if any. Often times, I'll think I'm happy in the moment, just to realize later on that I wasn't. I was merely distracted from the depression and loneliness. 

One of the biggest blows for me is my romantic failure. I haven't a girlfriend, and the few attempts I've made at getting one this year flopped completely. The first girl I tried getting with (of whom I genuinely liked and had a connection too) just ghosted me upon my confession, never acknowledging me since. The second attempt was with my life-long best friend, Emily. And the hardest part about that was the fact that she wanted to date. She did. The only issue was, she's attracted to women, not guys. Despite her best efforts, she couldn't look past that, and I don't blame her. But, still, that hurt. I've always sort of crushed on her a bit, so to get so close to an actually meaningful relationship, just to have it ruined by something out of both of our control was soul crushing. But, I digress. It's absolutely emotionally debilitating being lonesome in this way. I just want to be loved and accepted by somebody who likes me for me, and who likes the same things I do. It may be a lot to ask for, but it hurts being romantically lonesome. It really, really hurts.

Another factor in it is my constant fear of the future. I want nothing more than to write music for a living, having a loyal fanbase and all that I can share my (mostly horrible) life experiences with, as well as give advice and aid them via the music I create. I do not wish to be wealthy, though I wouldn't dislike that. I just want to earn enough to live off of, as well as buy the things I'd like to buy here and there. However, I have a constant fear that I'll never be able to live that dream out. Skill limitations, time limitations, the way the world works, etc. There are many factors working against me, and it terrifies me to know how possible it is that I'll fail. It almost makes trying not seem worth it. Why try when you know you have a better chance in failing than passing? I obviously don't plan on giving up any time soon, but it terrifies me. It keeps me up at night.

Yet another thing that depresses me is loss of innocence/loss of innocence. My shit childhood has to do with that. Whenever I see a pretty girl, or watch an anime, or see a cartoon, etc, I become depressed. Not just any cartoon or anime, but ones that show things like love stories, or coming of age stories, or even simple shit like a kid with a normal life. It's as if I get jealous that I don't have any of that, so it upsets me. And, especially what depresses me, is sexual stuff. If I see, hear, or do anything sexual, I become so, so depressed. I don't know why. It weirds me out too. I just don't get it. You probably don't understand, since I don't even understand which makes articulating it impossible, but I tried. Maybe some of you will understand.

And, lastly, the final thing I'll talk about that adds to my anguish (since there are so many) is how ani-social my life has become. I don't have money, nor do I have any friends (besides my one best friend), so I can't get out much. And since I was sheltered most my life, my social skills are goddamn terrible, so meeting new people is a huge struggle for me. So, naturally, I get cooped up in my house for long periods of time, just thinking, being sad, and being lonely. And, trust me, thinking about as much as I regularly do is dangerous. I'm sure you all know that. It really eats away at you.

I apologize for the wall of text that I call a post. I just had a lot on my mind and had to get it out, even if I've repeated the same shit on here in almost every post I've made. Thanks to whoever reads this stupid thing and comments, especially if you comment. I really need human contact, so even a comment on Reddit is heavily appreciated. Cheers, and have a good day/night.

185,Red_Karma1,1558916182,1,"So probably should start with some background info:

19/M/UK - have had numerous romantic and platonic relationships. Diabetic (10yrs) but apart from this no diagnosed mental or physical health issues. Both mother and father still married and living together. I'm a big dork tbh lots of video games and anime. I am also very into music. Producing, listening, writing. Piano for 15 years and bass for about 7 or 6.

Heres my life story...

As an ultra smol kid ( from when i can remember to 12) we lived in switzerland where i attended a german school. I think i felt a real need to prove myself and fit in well so i came off as one of those over enthusiastic kids that just try and impress everyone. Safe to say i was bullied mercilessly for sticking out. Didn't help my appearence wasnt exactly common being asian white mixed and very tall. We eventually moved i suspect because of my failure to settle at school but also perhaps the language barrier was taking a toll on my grades. I do speak german fluently but my written communication was obviously sub par compared to the rest of class. If i had to summarise what impact this period of life had on the development of current me, i would say the bullying made me fear whar people do to those who dont fit in.

Fastforward. England, highschool/ year 7 to 11.
 When my first crush broke up with me was when i first observed the start of the things i dont really understand. She broke up with me via text. On the way back from spending the night tagging along with her friends rollerskating i recieved the text and cried all the way home. Cried for approx 1 hr at home and then stopped. It was quite painfull but it felt like very physical. Like someone squeezing my heart and alongside my mind going crazy thinking about what i did, why.etc it was very overwhelming hence - tears. The relationship gave me information on the types of people and cliques that i could work in. It also gave me a glimpse of the very real social heirachy at that age. 

So i decided i would try again with someone more in my clique. That went horribly. She was rude and used me to climb social ladder, putting me down in front of friends and lashing out when i called her out. Safe to say that i decided to end it. I broke up with her. No.2 taught me what i didnt want in a romantic relationship. 

Fast forward to A levels. (16 - 18). Ive become hyper aware of how i present myself. I enter every conversation having pre thought out possible responses for optimal sitautions. I spent a long time trying to ensure i was as normal seeming as possible. The move to college destroyed any friends i had before. They didnt talk anymore. It was a fresh start. And it was a failure! I met a circle of these music, stoner people i thought were fascinating and cool but i could never get in with them. No matter what i tried. The furthest development in relationship i had with them was as the ""wierd internet anime kid cuz hes asian"" the feeling of alienation was immense. 

My last two years of A levels i spent trying to improve myself, trying to understand what i did wrong and try to become more attractive as a friend. I did this by myself. I had no one i had regular interactions with because the twins went to uni and josh was struggeling with his future. 

At uni finally. A girl approached me from music society and we dated for 6 months. The whole time i knew it was doomed. I feel like a psychopath or im going crazy. I could fake this whole different human for weeks at a time. It was nice to spend time with someone who was obsessed with me but it felt so wrong. I want to stress i didnt treat her bad. I broke up with her a couple weeks ago, had to eject the whole friendship tied to music society. Back to nobody.

Current date - i feel so different from everyone and i guess that makes me a snowflake right? I just feel so unconnected to anything or anyone. People i talk to, i can see it in their eyes, i know what tags they're putting on me, what predictions of character they've made of me. I have tried to form lots of anykind of friendship but they all result in me playing a character which prevents me from getting any kind of fulffillment out of talking to them.

Even met this logically perfect girl, pretty, cute, speaks 9 languages, super good at art, super good at music, super smart, also a bit of a stoner so quite grounded as a human - but its all in my head? Theres no feeling, i dont feel anything when we spend all night talking, no feeling when we have intercourse, when shes hugging me and my brian knows it should be good but just nothing.

TL;DR - people dissapoint me immensly, i cant get the friendship/girlfriend buzz anymore and i dont know how to be me.

You need to love yourself in order for someone to be attracted to you but I've respected myself my whole life, I've had multiple relationships fail through a good deal of my own doing as well as theirs so I've never just solely blamed other people unless they really deserved it.

But I've always stood firm with being true to myself and respecting myself but in doing so, that has predominantly failed to fit in with others and relationships have been burned and some are still scarring me today.

Now a person has entered my life who has got  similar problems as I. So the most natural thing for my brain was to develop crazy emotions for her without any reason. We were texting yesterday and all was good. When we stopped, and I know there is no reason for it, I felt sad and alone. The thing is I barely know here, there is no logical reason for my emotions.

Being homeschooled SUCKS. It sucks SO HARD. Everything, right now, sucks. I have. No friends. Is nobody around my age actually alive anywhere that isn’t caught up in school stuff?????? My household travels around so much that I won’t be able to go to college until I’m older, so there go those hopes, whimsically careening out the window!

The only friend I have is legitimately across the world from me and honestly? She’s hard to talk to a lot. We just don’t have the same values. On like, anything. My family is focused on their work and/or not at all interested in what I prefer talking about. Thank you, Mom, for telling me in intricate detail about how the world is falling apart. Only the best parents make sure their children don’t want to be in this world before they’re even out and exploring what it has to offer. Somewhere out there is a “#1” mug with her name on it.

I made the mistake of watching a vlog made by an animator I really admire (on YouTube, they make fluidly-animated memes) and it’s her and some friends messing around at a con. I never watch vlogs bUT I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ANIMATION.

It’s so painful sometimes realizing that I could probably have my very own group of artsy, character-writing goofballs to talk to, but I’m so inept in finding out where they’re hiding that I might actually die before meeting them. Of *old age.*

Anybody around here into writing??? Into making characters and drawing them or something? Into animation????? Character development? Maybe some roleplaying or writing together, something???? I like having artsy projects with folks. Can we be goofy??? Can I goof with someone? Can we like, make each other laugh and go through the Important Videos playlist together over Rabb.it or something????

Anyways, he called it off. And I just feel broken. I didn’t love the guy. But I felt a very strong connection with him in so many wonderful ways and I’m just really sad that it’s over and he’s already moved on (his FB no longer displays a big fat “single” on it and I’m having a meltdown)

I thought I was more over it than I am. And I don’t know how to shake this. I’m trying to focus on all the ways in which he would have been a bad partner for me. Many of which he’s already displayed.  I don’t know if I miss him because I miss him, if I miss him because I’m still trying to drown out the volume of the hurt I experienced from my last attempt at romance. or if I miss him because I’m really lonely. Maybe a combination of all of them. I don’t know.  My loneliness definitely does not benefit me in this department as I just get mentally obsessive and it makes the problem worse. 

Not sure what to do. I have a few good friends that are helping me through this but I really just want to cry on someone’s shoulder.  Got a good bear hug last night from the last person I dated and I swear he was trying to squeeze all the hurt out of me. For about ten seconds it worked.

The problem is, I don't want to hurt her. As I said, she is already broken. That means if I were to fuck up once, I could ruin her life for ever or at least for a significant amount of time. If I don't fuck it up, I could make us both extremely happy, maybe even for the rest of our lives.

I’m so starved for female attention that even when I’ve been at work and girls touch my arm to get my attention or while talking to me, I get jumpy because I’m so used to not having any interactions with females. 


The things is, I kinda blocked myself off from even trying for a relationship or anything for awhile but even when I do have feelings for a girl, she either rejects me outright, says “let’s just be friends” or she’s taken (like recently) and there’s nothing I can do about it. I’m allowing myself to process all these negative emotions and feel the hurt and loneliness so I can try to move on and finally find what I really want most in life right now, which is a girlfriend. But, as pathetic as it may sound, this is one area of my life that I’ve always had an extreme amount of trouble with and it’s no where near easy for me to find one or even put myself in a position where finding one is even remotely possible.

I shouldn't feel lonely anymore, but I do. In fact the worst part of my day is when I go home at night because then I'm completely and utterally alone. 

I'm deeply religious yet don't really have a religious community(I'm working on it but distance is a problem). I struggle with behaviors that much of society doesn't see a problem with but at this point I think I'm probably an addict. Ive been going to 12 step meetings which is REALLY stressful since none of my close friends know. 

I get online to often, searching for someone to talk to, a friendly voice who is SOMEWHERE around my age who I can be real with about what I'm going through and who actually want to know me. Not just the top layer stuff, but someone who wants to know what I'm feeling. Honestly, i really want a girlfriend in my life, but I doubt its going to happen anytime soon. I try to talk to women online sometimes, to make friends. Its just nice to talk with a woman sometimes. THere is something different about it than talking with another guy. I don't know why.

243,ne0stradamus,1558816317,2,"Hi, hello, good evening. Or morning, depending on where you are, dear stranger. How are you?

So, this is one of those days where I feel like crap for no discernible reason.

Theoretically, I should be fairly content with my life, and there are days when I absolutely am. I'm 31 as of yesterday, I finally have an apartment of my own, a stable job that might not pay amazing, but it's good enough. I've lost a ton of weight recently, about to reinvent my wardrobe and try to better myself by starting to look the part, too. I have a great family that helps out and supports me a lot.

But I can't help but feel disconnected. I've been single for a long time, it's been over two years since the person I thought then to be the love of my life left me. My mind can't help but wander back to her. She recently moved into my city and found a new partner, and at that point I unfriended her on Facebook because I decided I couldn't bear to look at it. It made me feel miserable. Even though I don't consider myself particularly ugly, I think of myself as somewhat intelligent (albeit maybe a bit on the boring side, as I'm more of the ""read a book, play a game, listen to some music"" type of person), I also have a significant streak of isolationist tendencies. This makes it stupidly difficult to find new people. 

My best friend has gotten married a while back, and we drifted apart as is often natural in such situations. He's a entreprenour now, married, thinking of kids. We've been very close friends for over ten years now, but I can't help but to think I can't relate to him anymore, the depth of the connection just isn't there anymore. We see each other quite rarely, and it's hardly ever him that initiates the contact.

So, amongst all the adventures in self-betterment, satisfaction from accomplishing my personal goals, which feels great... there's an emptiness I can't fill. I'm working out my self-esteem problems, slowly but surely, try to find new things to like myself for every day, and sometimes even succeed. I'm good at my job, which I enjoy. But it just all feels meaningless today, feels like depression is creeping it's way back bit by bit. I've sent a friend request to my ex again, fully expecting it not to get stuck in limbo, never accepted. Which is probably for the best, as I wouldn't even know what to do with it if it did. I have friends who keep telling me how great of a person I am, but it all feels so fucking hollow and meaningless when you're still stuck being in the same spot for so long.

That's it, that's all. If you got through this somewhat incoherent rant, I'm impressed. And thank you, dear stranger. Wish you all the best.",lonely,One of those days. Need to vent a little.,2019-05-26 06:31:57

I have friends but I don't feel perfectly comfortable hanging out with them. They say all those mean things to me with or without knowing they hurt me. I often cry myself to sleep because of that. They don't seem to care am I around or they don't even notice me.

Even at home I seem to do nothing right. Whatever I do, someone gets mad. That's why I prefer stay in my room so I can't be in the way. I get anxious pretty easily and I'm really sensitive.

I feel like I mean nothing to other people even tho I really care about them. I'm often thinking what's wrong with me and what am I doing wrong. I even selfharmed myself for the first time last night but it didn't help.

I just feel so lonely, I have all my life. I've lived in foster care since I was 3. Lived in 4 different families, the one I live in now is the only good one, I've been abused at all others, including by my parents. Both physically and mentally. When I see people being happy with their parents I wonder what it feels to love your parents, or to be loved by them. The last thing my mom said to me was ""Every day, I regret not aborting you"" It still stucks with me. I don't have any close friends, no one I feel like I can open up to talk to. I have chronic depression and anxiety, some days are better than others, but these last few days have been pretty bad, I've had many suicidal thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty shy in person, and awkward. Online is the only place where I feel comfortable enough to truly be myself. So to combat the lonliness I have talked ALOT with people online, I have found some girls I have clicked with, but no one in the same country I live in, Sweden. Almost all of these girls have always told me that I am very sweet, caring, funny, cute, smart, and respectful. And I try to be those things, I've always cared way too much about others, I am very compassionate and kind. People seem to open up to me easily, but I've never felt a closer connection to anyone, I have never felt loved by anyone. I just feel desperate for closeness. hugs, cuddles, kisses, whatever. Just as long as I can somehow replace this cold and empty feeling in my chest with some warmness.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have many interests, I mostly sit inside all day, playing video games, listening to music, reading, writing. Or lay in bed. I don't know how to become better, and try to move out of my shell.

So basically I'm this 17 year old teen, and I spend my days indoors just watching TV, playing video games and reading. That's about it. I'm that introverted guy who likes to be at home. Meanwhile everyone I follow on Instagram or whatever seems to always be outdoors doing something interesting with their friends. Of course I thought about getting other hobbies but I suck at sports and the hobbies that I want to actually do, no one wants to/can't do them with me. For example I invited a bunch of friends for bike riding and none of them even has a bicycle. I'm also not one of those guys who likes to drink, smoke or party or whatever, but I see everyone doing it whatsoever.

I currently don't have a passion for anything else besides what I do. (Games, reading, etc) Well, maybe photography and cars but I'm not even old enough to get a licence where I live. But I'm sick of it, I want to go outside and try different stuff. The summer is coming and I really wanted to find an hobby but none of my friends seems to want to do anything. (My friends are also nerdy). No one wants to group study.. The other people who could do that sort of stuff with me don't even talk to me because I'm introverted and kind of socially awkward. I don't know how to do small talk.

I love photography but doing that alone sucks... I was thinking about Horse Riding in the summer but I don't know.. If you're still reading this, thank you. Give me your opinion.",lonely,"17 yo, spend my days indoors and I'm sick of it",2019-05-25 21:56:23

270,carmdaddy,1558747220,2,"my grandmother died about 6 months ago but her and my grandfather are the only family ive ever had in my life. aunts and uncles didnt like them/talk to them for 10 years. they were assholes my whole life and even put me down and called me names when i was a child. mother is the same, obviously, since she left me to my grandparents who begged her not to abort me. anyways since then my grandfather tells me he wants to die and i fear he will kill himself. he is such an asshole though that he didnt even tell me the day my grandmother died so we arent on great terms---oh and my ""family"" had me banned from the nursing facility i put my grandmother into ..by police..2 days before she died because i was ""making my grandfather yell"" aka everytime i would come into the room he was FORCE feeding her and i could see she was choking (she could barely barely talk and had issues swallowing she had very bad cancer) i think i now have ptsd from it. fast forward to the present. i took on a pt second job to try to get my mind off of things because i was crying 24/7 and bothering my boyfriend who really told me that since he only took 2 months to get over his grandfather dying that i should not have this problem. my boyfriend and i talked about breaking up the other day after 8 years of dating (never marrying which also makes me sad) im losing hope. i cant make friends anywhere it seems. i think im a pretty self centered person i was always the apple of my grandfathers eye growing up..so i thought that was the norm. my grandparents wouldnt let me hang out with 99.999% of kids when i was growing up so i never gained much social skills. i work as a loan officer right now and am so tired of the job since i have hit a brick wall with nowhere to go within the company that i am downright rude to customers(also because i am exhausted emotionally and physically)---the customers i get like 90% of them have no money, give me a sob story--when in reality they just do stupid things with their money, know they have bad credit and want to apply for a loan. i spend 30 mins with them , some of them yelling at me the whole time...to decline them. regulations do not let me tell them its not the smartest idea to apply for a loan(i get it) ANYWAYS, point is i hate my job. i have some coworkers i talk to--at work. even a few who have asked me to hang out but i just dont have anything in common with them so i decline politely. everyday i feel im getting closer and closer to killing myself. good news i guess is..i am a coward so i will probably never go through with it because im a. afraid and b. believe i would possibly go to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

im a hot mess woman no less.. whos going on 29...no kids(which breaks my god damn heart)

&amp;#x200B;

id take any advice because i cant afford a counselor because i have debt that i need to pay off, mostly because i had to help my grandparents with cancer treatment and basic living needs because no one else in my family would even talk to them except for my estranged mother--who wouldnt help them. 

i have a lot more serious issues that have happened to me within the last couple of years but im exhausted even typing this. i dont feel like anyone will care to read this whole thing anyways since its all about me and honestly...who the fuck cares about me?

273,No_More_Heros,1558740153,1,"Hey guys. Just having a bit of a rough night and I have allot on my mind and finding it really hard to love myself tonight.

Was supposed to go out for drinks tonight but everyone cancelled last minute on me and a few people stopped responding to me entirely.

My ex who I broke up with recently was friends with everyone I knew and I don't think they wanna affiliate with me after she broke it off so i'm probably gonna stay in tonight. Bit of a bummer because I was planning to go out for a while but yeah. I wanna say I got something positive out of my last relationship but i'm pretty sure I learned nothing good from it at all. 

We where together for 4 months and she moved in with me for a month or so and basically lived at mine. I would look after her constant anxiety, depression, I never could open up about my own anxiety because she would shut me down every time and I didn't want to piss her off. I thought that her anger was just temporary or she was just having a bad day or bad few weeks. Still I would cook for her daily, buy her allot of gifts, do her laundry. I gave all of myself and helped her out anyway I could. I gave her everything. And in the end she broke it off with me and never gave me a real reason why. I feel used in many ways.

The day before we where literally talking about travelling and how to move our stuff into our new place and the day after she just completely switched when she woke up and started to treat me like a stranger. We met up a few days after we broke up so that she could give me my clothes back and we where talking fine, really enjoying each others company and we where going to go and see a show together. She mentioned she was going through allot of things internally and that's why she treated me like a stranger out the blue but I feel like I never got the real reason why. A day later after we met up, out of nowhere she blocked me on all social media and wouldn't reply to me on Facebook. 

I also found her on tinder tonight. When i was in a relationship with her I had to literally argue with her to get her to delete tinder and to stop going on dates with other guys while she was with me so yeah that sucks too. 

Worst thing is she was the one that started to call me her boyfriend there would be loads of nights where she would get pissed at me and not talk to me for the whole night just because of the idea that I got with someone. Like just make it up in her own head and just fall asleep in my bed pissed and not talk to me and be aggressive. 

The feeling of being a stranger in your own bed is fucking terrible. But I stuck with her because i believe in sheer loyalty and making things work. It's crazy how you can do so much for someone and they they can turn completely cold to you and treat you like a stranger our of nowhere. Like that shit hurts allot.  

I so dearly want to meet new people but every time I get hurt like this it pushes me more internally and I've been pushed so far inside for so many years that I don't know where to go anymore.  I really want to do better and meet others but its so hard when I've been hurt so many times. 

I try my best everyday with no one besides me but it gets hard at times. I know that one day ill meet a girl that really does appreciate me and that when I give all of myself to her, she'll will be worth it and, I look forward to that day. 

I just wanna work on myself and go to gym and find a good second job and focus on myself. I know that what I experienced wasn't love. Because someone who loves you wouldn't treat you like that. 

I bought myself flowers today. I cant wait for the day that I get to buy flowers for a girl and it'll mean something.",lonely,Allot on My Mind,2019-05-25 09:22:33
274,thepianist1,1558740117,2,"     Hello, Reddit. I'm , and I'm new to this sub and just Reddit in general. I have a foreign country trip to South America with my history class, and it's for two weeks. The people that I'm going with are terrible and insufferable. They've made it their job to exclude me, among other people at my school.
     But they've done it quietly and subtly, so no one would notice their corrupt actions. I feel shunned and lonely, especially when I see them laughing and talking together. My 16th birthday is on that trip, and it angers me. The trip ends early enough where, if I had friends, I could have had the sweet 16 party I'd always dreamed of. But instead, I'm alone. It feels bad, seeing other girls invite their friends to their sweet 16 parties and going out. 
     My mother is sweet and is wanting to buy me a large cake for my ""party"", and she wants me to go on a date, but I know that nothing is going to turn out the way either of us had planned. I'll be doing an internship this summer where there are no people anywhere near my age involved. I couldn't go on a date or make friends if I wanted to. You are supposed to be considered as coming into your own and maturing when you are 16, but I don't feel developed at all. I'm supposed to be more evolved than this.
     I know I sound incredibly bratty, hormonal, and immature right now, but this situation frustrates and disappoints me immensely. Why can't I just be a normal teenage girl (and please don't tell me to just be patient. I've heard it all before.)?",lonely,just pissed.,2019-05-25 09:21:57

277,SkintGirafde,1558734697,1,"So yeah.......... this sucks

&amp;#x200B;

I have this friend who we will call A, and she was a very close friend!

We met in a very odd way to be honest and I don't know how it blossomed into one of the best friendships I ever had the pleasure of being a part of!

We played funny and stupid games, video chatted, showed each other our artwork and opened up to each other more than we did to our own families, so I knew her pretty well, she was like a sister to me, one I wanted to care for and help when she needed it

&amp;#x200B;

Thing we're going good...... until one day I tried to message her on discord and...... it didn't go through, I tried again, nothing, eventually I hit me....... I was being ghost zoned, or at least that's how it felt

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've been ghost zoned before, by my own cousin no less, and it was not a pleasant experience, feeling alone, abandoned, left with your own insecurities, and seeing those you considered friends or family, walk past you without a glance or saying a word like ""how are you?"" or ""you okay?"" or anything!

&amp;#x200B;

So when I put the pieces together the best way I could without any clues, I was crushed, is she finally fed up with me, are her family members behind this? I don't know

&amp;#x200B;

She messaged me sometime later and said I would ""get answers"" but all I got was a cliched remark ""I have a lot or work"" and a concerning ""I shouldn't be talking to you right now"" they were vague at best and kinda half assed at worse

&amp;#x200B;

All I want to do is talk to get SOME closure so I can sleep well knowing what happened to my friend but I have yet to break the ice properly

&amp;#x200B;

A, if you read this, which I doubt you will, please........ I just wanna talk, no weird shit, no bullshit, no holding back, from one someone who cares..... please....... can we talk?",lonely,Being ghost zoned,2019-05-25 07:51:37
278,StarManZec,1558732252,44,"Last year on my 24th birthday my girlfriend of 5 years surprised me with an amazing gift for my birthday.

It was easily the best day I've ever had.

This has pretty much been the same way even from school days. I was that person who sat out in a corner thinking into oblivion and someone who creeped a lot of people around. I guess the reason for this was that I was a huge person and still am thanks to my obesity that I got as a gift for my birth. My obesity made people think I was a huge object that they could kick around as they want and treat me like a piece of crap every chance they got. Every time I tried to stand for myself I got beaten down harder and this finally make me realize shutting up and listening to all they have to offer was the best way to go. All this never helped me build a character out of myself and that really was a bummer as I grew up. I eventually got pushed away from the center and thus started the battle of loneliness. 

Every change I got at meeting new people, I get paranoid and end up creeping them up and shooing them away. This really doesnt help me all the nothingness in life. 

I have been this way for a long time and there was a phase where I literally weeped myself to sleep every night and hoping things get better for me. I always hoped one day I was going of wake up it would all be okay. And this really is never the case and so was not with me either. But lately I been used to this vast nothingness and have learnt to live the way I am living and yet be relatively okay with it. I pretty much do everything around by myself and have don't even have interactions with people for many days together. 

But there are times I still feel really sad for all the things I'm missing out. I feel sad for all the love that I have to offer for others. I feel sad when I think of something wonderful and have no one around to share it with. I feel really sad when my fav band is in town and have no one to go with to see them live. I feel sad when I plan out amazing trips and have to cancel them out cause I hate the feeling when I get sick of myself thanks to this void. I feel sad when I'm really craving for some a hug and there's no one I can stretch my arms out for. I feel really sad when it has been a really long day and there's no one around I can talk about it to. I feel really sad when there's no one to tell me that things are going to okay when I really belive otherwise.

Look, summer literally just started and I’m gonna be a senior this fall in high school. I’m decently known, I have people I’ll talk to in school and those few close friends that are there occasionally outside of school. At home it’s just my mom and I, no biological father, and domestic disputes that put an end to a step father. My mom works all the time, obviously to pay the bill and such, but no matter what goes on around me at my core I feel barren and alone. Those friends I mentioned that I’ll occasionally see outside of school always ditch out in the summer, literally all last summer I spent 3 and a half months in my house and didn’t talk or text a single soul and nobody ever checked on me and I fell into a depression. I got out of it by working out and I’ll keep at it to prevent it from happening again, but that doesn’t solve the loneliness. The walls I’ve put up and the measures ive made to protect myself from any outside emotional harm has backfired. I can’t bring myself to establish any serious relationship with a female I like, the mere thought of a relationship freaks me out, and no friend, family member or otherwise, i feel, understands who I am or how I work. As I’m laying in bed my chest literally feels empty, and outta everything I’ve been through with my step father, or anything else makes me feel this bad and I’m not socially skilled enough to break down these barriers and open up to anyone. I just feel my life will be nothing but this, academically and career wise decent and fairly successful, but nothing to come home to, nothing to look forward to....just emptiness

I'm not a romantic. I don't flirt or put myself out there because I never learned how to. As a lesbian, I never got to have those experiences growing up. And now I'm lost? I don't even know how to act any other way than platonically.

First time poster on this sub.

A little information on me: 

\-I'm 24 years old 

\-I live in Montreal, Canada

\-I have been with my current girlfriend for almost 8 years and living together for 1.

&amp;#x200B;

So with that out of the way here is my story: I have been considered by people that know me as fairly attractive and have never had issues getting a girl or friends. As I have a well paying job for my age, I was able to dress myself well and buy myself a fairly luxurious car. For people looking from the outside it would seem that my life is amazing.

Slowly but surely my so called 'friends' started talking to me less and less until they completely dropped me.

Didnt talk to me. Didnt even look at me. It was like i wasnt there. I stopped going after that. No one called.

Im thankful tho, he was the only person who stuck with me and made me happy at times. Without him I wouldve killed myself. I still love him but its not the same anymore, and it hurts. You are not suppossed to feel lonely when you have a bf/gf, right? 

Now i dont know what to do. I dont have anyone, not even myself. Im very lonely and its making me very depressed and suicidal. I adopted a kitten couple of days ago, to prevent me from killing myself. Now im not living alone in my room.

I just want someone who cares. I want to leave this room. I want to have a social life. 

I learned that I have cancer, too. My bf couldnt even spend his 1 minute away from *studying* to ask me what happened. If i were him, I would be concerned, but oh well, he would spend his time playing overwatch to feel less lonely instead of talking to me anyway.

I hope everybody has, or will have, one person in their life who truly cares about them.

338,vogel-chen,1558616449,96,"I’m turning 21 in a week and seriously dreading it. My birthdays make me really sad because I’ve got some crazy idea that it’s supposed to be the one day a year where people will acknowledge you, make you feel like you matter, want to spend time with you so that you feel happy. It’s never the case for me and as much as I always brace myself for the inevitable, it still sucks. None of my ‘friends’ really care much about me or ever want to try to spend time with me and at most I’ll get some little “happy birthday” gifs from a couple of people who checked social media and got sent a reminder. 

So I’m looking for ideas of how to occupy myself for the day to try and make it less awful. Do some special things for me. Right now, all I’ve got is that I’m going to buy myself a cake to eat since it’s been a long time since I’ve had one. From there I don’t know what to do. I don’t have a real “home” and I don’t want to spend the day alone in my parents’ basement like I do every other day. And where I live there’s basically nothing to do, even less options that let me bring my dog with me, which is the most important thing to have him with me the whole time. If the weather is bad (80% chance I’m guessing it will be) I can’t just take him to a park so I need a backup plan. 

Sorry for ranting... it’s kind of a bad time of the year for me overall lol.

340,sal0rd,1558602158,0,"So, I honestly don't know if I am posting in the right subreddit, but my justification has lead me to believe that this involves loneliness, so why not?

As a background, until I was 13 years old, I was relatively fine with my relationships in the family, meaning that I interact with them the normal way.

It all started when I was in high school. Since my high school was very far from home, then that means that I had to stay in a dormitory for my high school life. So, that means that communication with my family was more limited, but this does not mean that there is no communication at all.

At that time, the whole family would ask me how I am doing and everything, but things got worse when I reached Grade 9. When I try to jokingly tease my siblings about stuff, they would always say that I am a ""piss off"" and such. I would also think the same of my father who would make a lot of prejudicial side comments about stuff that I do not really care about.

For instance, when I said that I had a roommate who had a prom date, he said that he was surprised because he did not expect someone from the province to have one.

This honestly hurted me, because that was just a very good example of prejudice. I mean, just because someone is from the province does not ruin his/her chance of getting a prom date, right?

So, I had to try to get this idea to the head of my father, which did not work out really well. He also called me ""disrespectful"" in the process, which was really offensive in my side since that implied that he was treating me as an inferior, which leads me to the next point.

There are so many instances when my parents would demand respect just because they were my parents. To be honest, I do not see respect the same way. For me, respect is gained, not demanded. So, of course I will not just simply give in to what they think about things. I will always have to defend the objective, as an equally human being.

This meant that when I see that I am being treated unfairly, then that would mean that I will have to defend my side until the last of my voice. But unfortunately, these biological parents of mine just think that I am disrespectful, thus inferior.

The problem does not only root from my parents. My siblings are also alienating me. To be honest, my siblings are the major cause of this alienation of mine.

Remember when I said that I argue with my parents? There are times when my sister will butt in and say that I am the one who is in the wrong side, even if I know for sure that I have no bad intentions. Then that would mean that I have to defend myself from my sister too, which is just too much for me. And as expected, until now, things have not worked out with her.

For my brother, it is really hard to talk to him. This is because when you try to do talk to him, he will throw a tantrum almost immediately. When I try to have fun with him, he will throw another tantrum. It is like whenever I act that involves him, he will always throw a tantrum. It is just so annoying, honestly.

I would also point out where my family goes wrong. What I am pointing out is how they would act unprofessionally towards other people, and raise their voice all the time. So, when I tell them about this, they will always say that they are not doing such a thing, or they will make up bullshit to defend themselves. Or even curse out of nowhere.

In the end, I feel lonely whenever I'm with my family. Besides the fact that I barely interact with them now, when I do, it always does not end well for anyone.

Someone just adopt me please.",lonely,It is ironic how your family can be the one alienating you,2019-05-23 19:02:38

352,TempAdviceSeeking,1558568653,2,"I am NOT emotionally stable. I'm far from it, I break down at the drop of a hat. I'm not able to deal with that so in the past I resorted to alcohol and cannabis just so I didn't have to think about things. Substances let time pass unhindered so I've relied on them, it's like time travelling forward. I might walk through the world in a daze, but at least I walk.

I've been working on this though, smoking cannabis has made me hack up black shit so I'm stopping (at my GP's request), or trying to convert to edibles at least but I don't know how to make them (or at least the way I want to, extraction&gt;just baking it in) and buying them is expensive.

Alcohol is destructive and not a way to hide my feelings, probably 1 out of every 5 times I drink I just devolve into an emotional mess and hurt the few remaining people around me.

I have been finding success in my career recently but I feel like my boss is just using my willingness to what I feel like is work outside of my pay grade and is going to dismiss me as soon as the project we are working on is over.

I currently am not very sexually active. I left a relationship last October where I was abused. I feel like I was taken advantage of and was unwilling to leave the relationship because I don't have very good self esteem. I want nothing more than to have a caring person in my life but I have a hard time trusting people now. I feel like everyone is just being nice to me to use me or is building up trust so they can tear it down on me again.

I've been working very hard to get myself out of this rut. I have lost weight (down from 235 to 200). I am becoming far more active. I have saved money on top of coming into a fair amount unexpectedly. I've started reading again. It's still not helping though. I can see myself improving but I don't feel any better.

The problem is I seem to need contact with people. This is hard for me being autistic. I can initially contact people very well but have a very hard time maintaining relationships because I have a tendency not to empathise with others. This makes me inadvertently selfish. I don't mean to be. I think I have been forced to grow up very independent so naturally my first thought is self interest. I also think every friendly action is a trick to lower my guard so people can hurt me.

I have tried very hard to just devote myself to other people instead of being self absorbed and unempathetic but that seems to just open myself up to people who want to take advantage of me and upon learning this my trust is slashed.

I also have a very hard time trusting, interacting with and socialising with males. From an early age I was bullied and it was almost always from other males so I have absolutely no desire to interact with another man at all.

I get that all of this is a ""me"" problem. I know damn well the world isn't like this but I can't seem to change my own instincts. As much as I try to suppress that instinct eventually something will come out, I can't suppress it all and when it does I drive people away.


The worst part is that I'm _not_ a suicide risk. I value my own life very much. My biggest fear is just lashing out at others and hurting people other than me. I wish the only person I would hurt because of this is myself but that's not the type of response that comes out. I end up just hurting others and isolating myself, and then things get worse.

The marriage ended because ""I cheated on her."" Short Version - In reality she ended up resenting me for my success in my career and didn't want to live with me anymore, drained our joint account, and left me with the mortgage. After I put the wedding band on her finger she became miserable, instantly. No more sex, No more cooked meals, No more gaming together.

According to both, apparently watching porn, when not getting 'any', is cheating. To me, bumping uglies is cheating. To the law, bumping uglies is cheating. Oh and they both put me on blast to all my family and friends ""He cheated on me!"" so that was great.

So I have horrible taste in women? Both had been in broken relationships in the past, where apparently they had been cheated on or whatever..... This is my ex-wife's 2nd divorce......

I fear mine (and probably many others) loneliness is borne out of the impossibility of completely emotionally captivating someone, of making them bend to your will just to please you, just as you would do to them.

Do you ever wonder why do we use Social Media? Obviously, the answer would be to stay connected with people and to have a better social life. But what if social media makes us lonely and vice versa.

A lot of researches have been conducted on the relationship between social networking addiction and loneliness.

 

Loneliness may be part of a normal developmental process for older adolescents in transition to young adulthood, but for many adolescents, the loneliness that results from can lead to even more serious problems such as depression, suicide ideation, and violence.

A World Happiness Database (2010) study found that people with close friendships are happier. It has also been documented that friendship is the most important relationship in an emotional life of an individual between the end of early childhood and onset of full adulthood, and it has also been recorded that friendship is more intense than relationships later in life.

While adolescents use social networking sites (SNS) to connect with people and to improve their friendships and social circle, it is to be noted if it improves the quality of friendship and makes the individual feel belonged or if it acts counter wise.

373,AVhastIdBot,1558537807,5,"Maybe it's just me, but I feel like loneliness isn't so bad if there isn't hope. In fact I'd even go so far as to say: loneliness - hope = solitude. And solitude is fine. You can get used to solitude, even find joy and happiness. Some of the happiest moments of my life I was completely alone and completely okay with being alone. But if you introduce hope, if there is uncertainty that's when things get difficult. And it doesn't matter how much hope or uncertainty there is either. Because it always hurts eventually. When there is a lot of hope you just have that much further to be let down. Because the sparkle always leaves someone's eyes doesn't it? The hardness replaces it and already you can feel the magic dimming. Another potential life vanishes into smoke. And when there is almost no hope that is when you are at your lowest because no matter the circumstances you always think it's your fault the hope is gone. Maybe you should have been more this or less that. Shouldn't have had such high hopes, should have played your cards differently, should have lost weight should have worked out more, should have waited, should have spoke sooner, shouldn't have said so much, should have said more... endless recriminations for endless varieties of loneliness. I am not just talking about romantic loneliness here after all. I am talking about intelectual loneliness, spiritual loneliness, familial loneliness, sexual loneliness. All the feelings you wish you could share in all the relationships in your life all the pregnant silences and the yawning abyss of irrelevance... It is only painful because of the hope. Hope is like oxygen. Alone it is intoxicating, corrosive, explosive. It has to be mixed in with other stuff. Loneliness is just a poor admixture of hope and circumstance. And I think some people... the anguish makes them mean or sad or crazy.  Like George Carlin: ""Fuck hope"". Like cynics and anybody that has given up: 'Is this a test? It has to be, otherwise I can't go on'. Maybe like me someday. I don't think I am crazy (although, allegedly crazy people never do). Nor am I bitter or cynical. And I haven't given up.  I am going to try and understand.  I accept my loneliness. Perhaps it is my brains way of guiding me? I accept and am grateful for my relationships. All of them, even the painful ones. I don't blame anybody.  It isn't anybody's fault I feel lonely. Not even mine for having hope. But I have to admit a slight irritation at the thing with feathers. Whether I can finally let it free because I don't need it anymore, or it dies from malnutrition, or simply chooses to cease its squawking when I am trying to sleep... I don't care as much. I just want some peace in my time.",lonely,"Here, is the thing with feathers.",2019-05-23 01:10:07

I used to take pride in the fact that I don't ever really express my opinions, wants, or needs. I was ""self sufficient"". 

However, as I get older, I find that I'm just craving for someone to pay attention to me. Just ask me how I'm doing, ask me how my day went, or just listen to how I feel about certain things. Just someone to make sure that I'm okay. I want a genuine friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to lie, I've had friends. I had 1 friend when I was 9, but lost due to moving and parents break-up. In the new school I ended up in 3 years making like 3 friends that would even consider me as a friend too, but still I was a very shy, timid and aloof kid. We moved again. New school, absolute outsider, no friends. The weird kid no one knew when I was still at least somewhat normal. Moving in midst of puberty is the worst because you're confused about your own identity and so is everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what? I have a job and it requires me to talk to people. But it's all shallow talking. No one wants to talk real shit. I've wanted to talk real shit since I was a young kid, but never could so I ended up distracting myself with video games from the loneliness and lack of expression. I'm now 21 and utterly ""expressless"" as in I can't even smile without faking it. I feel like crying every day thinking about how I literally have no friends, and literally no one can even fathom it around me. I feel so stupid because I can't even express my thoughts sometimes, because I've spent my entire life in my room as a mute.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to get this shit out, because I've spent the last 5 years trying to grow socially but I always end up with no one. It gets pretty tiring. And honestly, what stings is to see other people look at me weirdly and judge me as an introvert, shy person who thinks they're too good to speak. Also tired of social anxiety and **literally feeling like I'm being bullied** when a bus drives past and I'm being self-conscious about my walking.

377,SamMoritz,1558531452,2," I think this is going to be like reading my diary. I thought if I got it all down on paper (keyboard and screen?), maybe I’d feel better. 

First thing I should say is I’m probably in a better place in life than a lot of the people here. I feel like a fraud for feeling bad about myself. I’m sorry for that and apologise in advance for anyone who feels annoyed or upset by my post. Then again, I am unlikeable so that won’t be a surprise. 

I’m married but my wife is often stressed about her job. Often she’s not really listening when I talk to her. It’s not a great feeling when the person who must love you the most in life isn’t that interested. I guess add boring to my list of character traits. When she is communicating with me we do get on really well.

My job often has me on my own for hours. I’ve not seen another person for five hours and I expect to go another three hours without seeing anyone today. I send messages to people I know in real life, people I know from Twitter, people on Reddit, but it’s always me doing the work. I’m always the last person to send a message and they’ll only contact me if they want something.  I was sitting around last night – my wife had gone to bed at nine – looking at my phone and thinking why am I so unlikeable? I’ve tried all sorts of things, being friendly, being funny, being attentive, being mysterious and being open. Basically being myself or not being myself, but whatever I am, people don’t like it. The number of new friends I’ve had for a few days is adding up and none of them stick around.

When I was young (under 11), being friendly, fairly clever and generally nice were good traits. I was never really popular but I had lots of friends at school and regularly played with them after. When it got to the teen years where being the clever kid meant all the cool kids would pick on me daily, I sort of retracted and didn’t go out. I think from the age of about 11-15, I only did something with people my own age about 5 times. After 16 things improved and I had friends, although none of them are still around. They all moved on when I was no longer useful to them to help with coursework or drive them around to the friends they really wanted to be with. Now as an adult I’ve basically got back into the situation where nobody really wants to talk to me. 

Unfortunately I haven’t come to some great conclusion or revelation in writing this. I guess I’ll leave this here for a bit and then delete it. Whatever.",lonely,"I’m an unlikeable person, I’m lonely and it’s getting to me",2019-05-22 23:24:12

So, I have made friends with some people, tried to fit into a certain group. I had fun the majority of the time. Then, I kinda started feeling a little better drifted from them. Not many conversation, more lonely, depressed days, and overall, no interaction... I told them that and well, the backlash was kinda weird. They did make me realize that well, I am quite stupid and a frankly, arrogant. I've come to accept that and to try and fix it. So, what I thought was reasonable, to leave that group and join a new one. That group I felt didn't want me around anymore. So I just kinda left. I don't hate them, I hope they don't hate me. So, I left that group. It was frankly, my fault for being the way I was. Of course, I am doing much better now at behavior. Now, I joined a new group. They were a weird bunch. I had fun for a bit but not two weeks with this group and today, something happened. See, there's one girl I'm this group. She's uh... All I can say is, pretty fucked up... She's racist, rude, pretty damn violent, and horribly depressed. No joke... She hates serious talk. But today, I tried to tell her that people, or society, won't like the way you act when you grow up. She suggested suicide when I told her this. I tell her don't do that. She says that I make it sound like if society doesn't accept you, you die so, what's the point of not killing yourself. Of course, I only wanted her to be aware of how fucked up her mindset is. She's damn violent and is terribly rude. People shit talk her on a daily basis. I want her to change, to know what she's doing, but shit, she just straight up left a group chat. I then started to question if I belong in this group. I type that in and send out the text and one of my ""friends"" says ""You just fucking noticed. You idiot."" At this point I've gotten fed up with the group now. So, I just left... Now what? Do I find another one now? Shit man, I don't know. This happens too much. I thought I was gonna change but damn... Seems like I only ended up with the wrong group. They probably hate me now... Probably all hate me... Probably look at me as some kind of... Toxic person... Spread rumors... Lie about me... Shit man.

Maybe I'm just falling into the wrong groups, maybe it's the way I act... Or both... I'll... I'll see if I can find another group... Although I'm scared. I'm losing hope on finding friends now.

Day 2: “The easy day”

\*\*Actually, this should be day 1, yesterday I just “meditate” and I decided to start this. But my post, my rules\*\*

Today I woke up at 5 am, I had a good breakfast and with good, I mean healthy (it tasted like shit), I ate a bowl of porridge with some orange juice. I am low on money so I can’t buy tasty food, next month I will try to administrate the money smartly. 

Then I went to the gym I’ve been going for 3 months, but today I took a photo to myself to see the progress (I know, but I won’t publish it in my Instagram with some motivational crap, I promise), I stayed for 1 hour. After that, college without socializing, but I don’t like that group so that’s okay. And then in my apartment, I studied for 3 hours, taking a break of 15 minutes every 45 minutes and after a break, I went to my English class where my teacher is hot as fuckkk (completely irrelevant, but I needed to say it, sorry for that) and that was my day. I procrastinated for 3 or 2 hours maybe, it’s a lot less than usual so that’s okay too, tomorrow I’ll try to not procrastinate at all, I need some “rest time/free time”, I want to push myself but still is necessary some free time for myself, maybe if I’m able to organize my free time I won’t lose time procrastinating. 

Also, I tried to write a CV but I have no experience at all, I just have a useless “mid-degree”, but again is useless so I will have to take a shitty job that probably won’t help me in my career, but I need to be independent of my family that’s the goal. And the economy is pretty bad right now but I have to try, tomorrow I will send my empty CV to some places, and wait for the best. 

That was it, it’s the first day, I think I did it pretty well, I didn’t talk with anyone though, that’s the only thing to improve for tomorrow.  I need to improve everything but at least I started, tomorrow will be a new day and I will do it better. The first day is always easy for me, the hard part is keeping this rhythm. 

One thing more, I have an appointment this week with a dermatologist, I have huge eye bags, I sleep a lot (thank god that’s not a problem) and I also stay hydrated so this is something else, I need to take care of my body my self-esteem is like shit this might help a little bit.

Now-a-days it's even worse. Earlier she used to send me memes or something all day long or while I am sleeping, but it stopped too a while ago. Yesterday as an exercise, I decided not to text her first about anything, and guess what.. 0 message from her whole day.

She replies nicely and properly but she don't initiate conversations anymore. I think maybe it's because of my personality or something. I have even completely stopped talking about my life or my problems, to see if that was annoying her. Still no conversations from her side. Earlier she used to talk about her problems too, which has stopped too.

Who knows what should I do. I will prolly stay strong and won't initiate conversations all the time. Maybe she will start missing me that way.

I gave him time, three weeks in fact. Carrying on with everything and trying to remain positive. Kept telling myself that he's just scared and would come to his senses soon. That was until he said there was a 1 in 5 chance he would go through with the wedding which was all paid for and only two months away. I was mortified.

A couple of days after that he says he can't go through with it and he doesn't want to be with me anymore. So here I am, sat on my own packing my last 16 years into boxes with the realisation of having to tell people it's off. Well, half of the guests already know but no official statement has come out. It will when his parents come back from holiday on Thursday. 

I've always been a loner since I was a child and that's why I couldn't believe I met someone when I was 15 years old. I'd never had someone I could be honest and open with or trust like I did with him. I had that for 16 years and now I'm all alone. With nothing. I have no friends and the only family I have is a mother who never really showed care or love to me. Going back to live at home is not an option, and I can't talk to her about anything, never could. 

I am once again alone and I feel unloved and useless. A waste of oxygen. Alone. It's funny how I feel completely lost and frightened , but it's the loneliness that I can't stand the most.

414,Keeptomyselfalot,1558460947,1,"A lot of “normal people”, will give us advice to love ourselves and then our problems will be solved. Never call them  normies, it’s just immature, they are just people who haven’t felt true loneliness and pain.  Loving yourself is not what we need to focus about. I already love myself, I don’t hate myself, I hate the world around me. They fail to see the worlds true colors because they have love and compassion that blinds them of it. The world is filled with hate, and life is ultimately a competition to be the best. Right now we are all falling socially if we are here.

We are all a product of our environment, maybe your parents made you hate this world, maybe it was “friends” who treated you like shit, maybe it was a girl(boy)friend who dumped you or the lack of a romantic relationship. You need to start looking back at your past and see what made you this way. For me it was everything, I’ve never had a girlfriend (been rejected 7 times and I’m only ), my parents are narcissists, and “friends” aren’t really friends. This all has shown me how hateful this world actually is. No one actually cares about you unless they share your pain, as we do here. 

They will tell you to be more outgoing, but then when you are younger rejected because you’re an outsider. They see the world much differently than you and I. I’ve only met a very few select people that genuinely care, and that’s because they share the same pain as I do. That’s what we bond over. 

Now I said we are failing socially, but we don’t have to fail in other parts of our life. Economically we can still do well, and our health must be a priority. Go to the gym and get money. This is one of my long term goals, to get fit and to get money because those are all things that I can put my hate into. Next is my ultimate goal, now yours may be different, but mine is living independently of my family one day. I dream of living by myself one day, in an apartment or a house. I can’t wait for the day I can be at peace everyday. No one will tell me what to do at my house, I will be able to do whatever I want to. It will be amazing. 

The harsh realization I spoke of in the title is that this world is full of hate. Look around you, everyone wants to pick on someone, everyone wants external validation, and power from it. I’m not innocent either. Nobody is. There is no alternative, I have not seen one thing on this planet to convince me that this place is ultimately good. All I have seen is negativity. When you stop redditing and go into the real world, become an observer. Watch how people interact with each other.

Feeling like you're in good company. I.E. not being lonely. At the moment, nobody loves me. I have one true friend, who is going in the air force for years after highschool mind you, and my family, but my family isn't the most understanding group of people. Anyways, I haven't a girlfriend. I haven't any friends (excluding the one that'll be leaving me after next year), and after highschool, I have no idea how I'll be able to move out. You may ask ""Why move out so soon?""

He's been living with my mother and I and all that for less than a year since he graduated, and everybody is already disappointed and angry with him. I wouldn't be able to handle that. Anyways, loneliness. I'm scared of being alone, which is ironic, because I am 90% of the time. I feel as though my appearance and personality will only ever keep anybody from loving me. I want to be able to give my love to somebody. I feel as though the love I have to hold inside of myself turns into self-hate and depression. I have so much love to give, but nobody to give it to. And, no. I don't count. Self love is a separate topic. Anyways, I'm terrified of being alone my whole life. I want to be able to have one or two kids that I can give the life that my parents never gave to me. I want a wife that loves me for me, and likes the same stuff as I do. I'm not revolutionary in my wants, I feel as though this is very standard stuff. However, the chance of me dying alone seems greater than the chance of me actually finding my ""true love"". I'm just too different. Most people my age all juul, smoke weed, are obsessed with rap, have different tastes in style, love playing sports, etc. Of course, that's just a generalized description, but I'm not overestimating when I say that. And me? I hate juuls, I hate drugs and most people who do them (for personal reasons), I hate rap (unless it's classic rap, though there are some exceptions), the taste in styles is self-explanatory, and I'm not a sports guy. I write fucking music and literature for Christ's sake. I play video games and listen to vinyl records. I listen to music like The Beatles and A Day to Remember and Bing Crosby. I'm ultra sensitive too, and my shitty childhood has given me a decent amount of baggage. Who the hell would love such a damn sissy? Not to mention I have almost zero clue what I wanna do with my life, besides music or literature, but I won't have enough time to become good enough to make it a profession, and I hate school and it really isn't my thing, so there's that. I don't know. I just feel like my odd likes, wants, and needs make it nearly impossible for anybody to love me. I have a good feeling I'll die alone.

When I'm not with my friends or messaging them, I feel lonely because I'm not interacting with anyone.

447,maloneySun,1558390089,1,"Growing up i was always the queit kid, but it never really became a problem until middle school, where i noticed other people were hanging outside of school, and this was when facebook was just becoming popular, so theyd post pictures of them doing fun things and i started getting depressed, feeling like i waa missing out. I wondered why i didnt get invited. But i chose to ignore it, i told myself ""well those people arent my true friends, ill find my people in highschool."" And i did nothing to fix the real problem, my socializing skills. High school came quicker than it shouldve, and i still was not aware that i needed to really work on myself. So the friendships i thought would magically apear, never happened. I became the guy who knew a lot of people (even the popular kids cause i was in football), but didnt have a true relationship with anyone. I never had deep conversations late at night, never got to party, or go to concerts or anything. I had 1 girlfriend i sheepily asked out over text, then broke up with over text cause she got fat ( no offense but i still had standards lmao)  Instead my depression got worse, and my social skills became non existent. And so when junior year came around, i was desperatly trying to make friends. But my aproach was terrible, i did anything to be liked, because for so long i felt unliked. I would lie about the music i like, in hopes that people would like me. Id lie about my families wealth, saying i had money when i didnt. I became a liar, and a pretty terrible one, because everyone saw through it. By senior year i was one of the most hated kids in school. People i tried to become friends with would talk behind my back, and even though i knew about it, i still tried to become friends with them...cause i was desperate. I wanted nothing more than to be like the popular guy who had so many friends. So my lesson in all this as a 20 year old who is currently doing what i shoupdve done in middle school, is start working on socializing now. Dont think that friendships are going to magically apear in your life, cause youre only getting behind. Start googling how to socialize, read body language, and make others feel good. Learn how to conversate. Accept social tensions when they arrise. Dont try to please everyone, and become a liar in doing so. Out of all this, that is what i regret most. Lieing to feel accepted will ruin you. Ive been through hell socially, litteraly theres so much that has happened that i could write a book on the shit ive seen, and im sure some of you could too. But at 19 i decided i wanted to build a life ill love, with people who genuinly love me.. im not there yet, but im still learning, finding new ways to interact and meet people. I used to think social anxeity was the absolute worst disease in the world... now i see it as an advantage. Us socially awkward freaks see things differently.

In high school something bad happened to me. It was by some older guys when I was 16. It made me an outcast. I was ridiculed a lot for my looks from this group of guys in my grade. Everyday in class they would pick apart my looks. They said I looked 40, that I was gross, that I have wrinkles, and that no one would ever want me. They would also say that I’m a slut. 

I had to switch schools my senior year. At 18 I had no confidence. During high school I talked to this one boy who was two years my senior. At first he acted super interested in me, but after what happened to me sophomore he said I was gross. He would only hookup with me drunk. It was like I was filth to him.

When I was 15 a random girl at a party took a photo of me squinting my face because of the camera flash. She posted it on Twitter she was a popular senior from our school. Her friends all liked it 35 of them and all laughed calling me trashy, ugly, and look like a 40 year old.  


Why else would people treat me this way unless I’m horribly ugly. It’s been a couple years since high school I’m suicidal over my looks. I want a lot of plastic surgery. I barely leave the house. I must be so horribly ugly everyone will treat me this way.

I’ll use this like if it were a blog, I created a new account so my “friends” won’t see this, I’m writing in English because one of my goals is to learn this fking language. I’m a Latino btw.

If you’re reading this expecting a good story or something interesting you should leave. 

I’m a looser a disaster, I am 20 years old, I don’t remember being happy like ever. But these last 3 months have been a fucking nightmare, just bad things, I didn’t learn valuable things, I’ve even considered suicide as a way out, but a  psychologist convinced me that was not a good idea, at least for now. 

 I haven’t found something that I truly love, my career is okay but I don’t love it (engineering), I’ve been doing good, I didn’t pass a few subjects and I had to retake them(no fucking idea how to say I’m doing the subjects again because I fail at the finals:) )but just like 3 subjects in 2 years so is okay I guess. But I have to study a lot more, or i won’t progress in this. That’s my second goal. 

Socially I'm also a piece of shit :) I don’t have real friends, I’m shy as fuck, I stutter when I talk sometimes because I’m so insecure of myself. If I have to talk with girls i sweat a lot, and i don’t know what to say. That’s the third goal, be a normal sociable person. 

I don’t hate my family, but I don’t love them either, I depend on them economically and that sucks, they put a lot of pressure on me, and my folks are not good at parenting. (I’m not saying they are bad persons, but i’ve been through some really fuck up shit and they were useless) So that’s another goal be completely independent of them, in the shitiest country of Latinoamerica, with the worst economy (okay this one is really hard, but at least i will try, I'm from Argentina btw)

I have started things, routines, activities, new things basically, but I’m a piece of shit, I never last more than a month. The no-fap shit, stop playing videogames, procrastinating, etc. 

So, this is the day one of doing the things right. I have the routine i have to follow, will i do it? Probably not, but I can’t take more shit, I’m literally just sinking in my own shit and in my own shitty thoughts, I don’t love myself, I hate what I am. I need to change that. 

The goals during the next 30 days:

\*Study more

\*Learn English

\*no fap (this is like the 9834904832904893204 time I try this)

\*Talk with people about normal things without being incredibly awkward

That will probably happen this week.

So that brings me back to where I'm at. All my friends are long gone and my orbit is small so I am almost never in a place to meet people.

Backstory: im english but have been living in spain for 4 years now and im lonely, i joined a public school in grade/year 6 near the end of the year, and was suprisingly liked eventhough i couldnt communicate properly for the first months til summer. however when the next year came around i was lonely, i bugged and practacly begged for attention doing random stupid and weird things, like pretend to be snorting coke(using chalk) making weird sounds and saying dumb things just to feel noticed. i ended up playing football each break but i never got passed too or even spoke too. i ended up hanging around some people who hung out right next to where we played and i would just say random things every so often, i even remember one time they were openly trying to ditch me in grade/year 8 but i chased after them, in like a tig type style. Even though i hung out with them every break that year they would openly leave me out in discussions and go places without even telling me (it was only a group of 7 at the time). skip foward a year  now grade 9 someone new joins and we all start to gather a common interest... anime. i had alot of knowledge cause i would watch it all the time, they never knew cause im left out of discussions. i thought it was finally my chance but no... my spanish wasnt good enough and it was hard translating, especially with my accent they would still leave me out of convos. (btw this group wasnt in my class so i was still a weird kid during class). i would carry on saying random stuff but my spanish got a bit better and was participating in convos at least a quarter of the time.move on to my current year some of them are in my class however im still left out of convos as the group begins to expand,, dont get me wrong my spanish is ok and i would still talk but  never anything personal just random stuff like piss out a golf ball or shit out a pineapple. ive never had anyone to talk too about my deppression, anxiety, lonliness or how i am and for all know they wont even care.i have never been out with friends outside of school, and am always left out, i cant find a different group as this is the only one who would accept me, i cant find another for my weird reputation. every so often i make one laugh but thats about all do, they literally say right infront of me how they have plans to do something but if i ever confront them about it they change the situation or lie, they all went to see the new detective pikachu movie and i wasnt even invited ( they told me spoilers today) and its not just small things like this they all go to eachothers birthday party and i dont even get a text on mine even though they all know when it is, you cant really forget it cause its on christmas, i dont want a party just to atleast be noticed by them. i finish school this year but cant go into college(english college, i dont want to live in spain) and am looking for work eventhough i look really young for 15, im really scared about what to do when i finish and doubt i will have any actual friends that i could go eat a kebab with or just text. i missed out alot of things if you want to know something just ask. thankyou for reading my first ever reddit post, i  just had to get it off my chest.",lonely,im scared,2019-05-21 03:14:33

Everywhere you go on the internet, you just meet the most simple knitted, mindless, hypocritical and hedonistic  people you could ever find. People who supposedly want to meet new other people or want to find actual friends here on reddit, talking about how genuine, open minded, none judgmental and laid back they are and yet, when this weird creature like me in a fucked up injustice of a society we live in, makes so much effort and invests time to shoot a genuine and down to earth and detailed message to show them interest and care to their post, then suddenly you get ignored because for some reason all that talk about ""open minded"" ""laid back"" ""none judgmental"" and ""genuine"" has turned into ""no I don't wanna talk to people like you"". 

Or after a couple messages they don't seem to care anymore, that it doesn't really seem to matter that you actually messaged or showed interest. They seem to be only interested in satisfying their needs of finding the validation they wanted, but never mentioned that in their post or finding a new romance, but also no mention of that at all in their post. 

I just find it so hypocritical how those same ppl pretend to be friendless, lonely, in need of new people in their life and they would be your beeeeeeeest friend and care about you and be there for you in good or bad, all these theatrics they want you to believe, but in secret you are only good enough, if you are not a society abnorm like me. And this is how lonely and shitty a life is when you're a taboo topic, that no matter how hard you try and how much you offer and be honest, genuine, be empathetic and understanding.. like all this shit doesn't matter if you are sooo scary and weird and abnormal to society's standards.

 I could pose as a usual F on reddit and get completely away with it, i've done it so many times and I've found many people to talk to in the past, even making friendships in the past, but it's been years now and I was tired of how fake and shallow everyone is, when you put F on reddit and my only interest now is in people who can be friends with me and look past my abnormalities people love to have the biggest world war discussions over online. And I appreciate when someone actually talks to me when I am just unapologetically me.. so much more, than all the hedonistic bullshit you have to deal with as a woman online.

However you barely get a response.. I have yet to find someone who actually wants to get to know me.. who actually doesn't end up ignoring me after the second reply, there are drastic differences when you're just some F to them, you could even put bare minimum of effort into your message and they would reply to you with so much passion and joy.. This is the reason why you have so many suicides, because of a marginalization like that, but it's not the truth obviously, since people like me we are just mentally ill and the fact we go through life so lonely, so unloved, through a world that just hates you for existing.. a world that doesn't give you the same chances in life.. it doesn't seem to matter, those things are not being considered at all.",lonely,"I hate how closed minded the ""Sheep Herd"" on the Internet is",2019-05-21 01:44:02

And I’m now sat here at 18, with no meaningful relationships with my family, no friends, and just generally not knowing anything about myself.

Why? Because of the age I developed these issues and the continued effect of them my personality has been beaten into nothingness. I have no idea who I am, what my skills/qualities are, what I like or what I want to do with my life.

And at 18 this in combination with my mental health issues and general loneliness is having a profound impact on me socially, mentally and physically.

Everyday now I wish i had that special one that I could trust 100%, hold her hand, spend time with her, kiss her, share music with her...
Every night, in my dreams,  I see girls that fall in love with me and I fall in love with them too, we kiss, laugh and have a good time, but then, I wake up to my lonely room.

Now i even developed a crush on a girl from a music video, which rarely happens. I think i reached the peak of loneliness.

So after my last post from this account I did call the suicide hotline, a number of times actually, and that got me through a few days. I only called them when when I was drunk, and for some reason I always got mad that they answered. but it did help me through some of my darker points.

Shortly after that I was fired from my job, which i hated, for some BS reason but I was glad to be out of there. I found a new job as a cook which was nice for a bit, but I became complacent  and just lingered there. I'm still at this position right now, and yes I am looking ore a new job. but it is soul crushing.

Right now I am also partly homeless. Every other night I am staying with a friend  and his pregnant girlfriend. when i'm not staying with them I am at a Starbucks for 9 hours, where I am desperately looking for a new job, or at work. Then I am lucky enough to sleep in my car. pissing into a bottle is probably the most humiliating thing I have to do.

I know my friend and his girlfriend are being nice to me, but at the same time I can't help but think that they hate me for taking up room in their house. I can only realistically stay with them for 3 more months till the baby is due. But I know they want me out sooner. I know they hate me. I feel like a leach draining their good graces. 

this is officially the lowest I have ever been in life. If I end it now the world would be off better. I feel like I have nothing more to add to it anymore.

481,uhhmynamajeffxd,1558340288,6,"So I've only recently recognised that the reason I've been getting really sad on and off over the past few years is that I feel lonely, so now that I've recognised that I've been working at trying to feel less lonely and this is what has been working for me. I thought maybe this could help someone else too. 

I think it's important to recognise that a partner might not be the antidote to loneliness and for me it wasn't, I still felt incredibly lonely the minute I wasn't with them, so there were other problems that were causing my loneliness, not just the fact that I was single.

#1 - every morning and night think of at least 5 people you're grateful for

This is normally like my parents or friends but its also stupid stuff like ""people who made this blanket"" ""guy who invented the shower"". I think it puts into perspective all the contributions of other people to my life. Gratitude is also proven to be helpful for happiness. Normal gratitude lists can just be 'things' that you're grateful for, but I think thinking in terms of 'people' makes you feel less lonely.

#2 - don't listen to sad romantic music

I realised that I used to constantly listen to sad music or music about love, which was constantly putting me in a sad mood or making me focusing on what I don't have. When instead, I now listen to happier more upbeat music which puts me in a good mood, and I avoid music about relationships and love as that reminds of what I don't have. I think it's important to focus on what you have for happiness.

#3 - unfollow anyone who posts about their relationships on social media

This is similar to the second point, but my social media feeds were filled with people posting about how much they love their bf/gf, reminding me of what I don't have and making me feel like I'm the only single person in the world. I've also unfollowed people who post pictures of themselves going to clubs very often and similar things that create the illusion that I'm the only one not having fun. Think of it this way, if you follow 365 people who each go clubbing twice a year, that could be 2 clubbing posts every day making you think that everyone is always out having fun but you're sat at home. Now my social media feeds are mainly memes and happy and positive posts.

#4 - Stop watching sad TV shows and movies, and ones that are focused on love

I used to watch a lot of kind of sad dramas and romantic things like that, which again made me feel like romantic love is the only and most important thing in the universe, again making me focus on what I don't have. Now instead I mainly watch comedies which make me feel good and make me feel positive.

#5 - journaling

Rumination and wallowing and thinking about how lonely you are is bad for you according to this TedTalk I watched, so journaling is a good way to get those thoughts down and out of your mind so you can go do something else. It's cathartic.

#6 - open up to the people that you do have, be honest, put effort into the relationships that you do have 

I never really valued my friendships before and I only really valued romantic relationships, but friendships are very important too. I realised that none of my friends knew me very deeply, and that I tell a lot of white lies to people all the time. I think if no one knows you deeply, you can't be understood, and if you don't feel understood you feel lonely. So now I try and tell my friends how I'm feeling more often and I basically tell my friends that I trust everything, I'm very honest with them. Before if I didn't really have anything to gain from telling someone something personal, I wouldn't tell them. But now I tell my friends even really embarrassing stuff that I previously would have never told anyone. It might seem to not matter, but I think the more people know you, the more you feel understood, the less you feel lonely.

#7 - Find solo hobbies to take up your time

When I sat down and thought about what hobbies I have, I realised that there's more stuff I could do that I enjoy. I now read more books, watch philosophy/politics or self improvement videos on YouTube, I bought a keyboard and have started learning to play it, I plan to start playing video games and football again eventually. This stuff takes up your time and stops you ruminating about loneliness. 
 
#8 - Take care of your health

This one is obvious but eating healthy, getting enough sleep and exercising makes you feel better. 

#9 - Meditate thinking about the people that love you

I have stopped doing this now but I did this for a while so it might have helped. Again, focusing on what you have and the reality that you aren't completely alone.

Bonus Tip - I'm not sure whether I should put this because I want to reiterate that a partner probably won't make the loneliness disappear, but I think working towards being more attractive and likable might help you in the long run. If you're a man, I have advice in my post history.

TL;DR

#1 - every morning and night think of at least 5 people you're grateful for
#2 - don't listen to sad romantic music
#3 - unfollow anyone who posts about their relationships on social media
#4 - Stop watching sad TV shows and movies, and ones that are focused on love
#5 - journaling
#6 - open up to the people that you do have, be honest, put effort into the relationships that you do have

Then when my parents came home, we talked about what they'd been doing and what I'd been doing. I really had nothing though, I even lied to them and said that I went on walk so I'd have done at least something.

&amp;#x200B;

 My grandfather passed away a few months ago. The responses of all the people around me to my grief has left me feeling very lonely. I know that people around me are good people and no one can really get in your head and truly understand you, but I can't help but feel isolated from their lack of response  My grandfather was a big role model for me. He had a great and crazy sense of humour, and would take my dad my sister and I out to outdoor adventures during our childhood all the time. I have a lot of wonderful memories because of him. He was also the only one very accepting of my international mother out of the rest of the family and an very white neighborhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a university student so I was away from my family when  I found out he had passed away suddenly which shocked me. I had not seen him for the past 2 years as he is quite far away. 

&amp;#x200B;

 My close friend who lives with me She came to my room as we were about to the movies. I had just found out over the phone about it and was crying. She gave me a hug and said ""I'm sorry for you"" she then asked if I still wanted to go to the movies. I said I did, then did\`t then said I don't know. She left my room, then shortly I heard the front door slam as she had already left to go to the cinema. Apparently she misinterpreted that I didn't want to go. But I was so upset that she left me alone as quickly as she did. 

I know it's hard as a friend to comfort someone during something that you personally have no experience with.  Honestly however I have never felt as alone as that moment. It really hurts that one of my closest friends didn't even ask if I needed her to stay with me.  

&amp;#x200B;

This whole time I haven't really discussed it with my family.  My mum discussed about essentially what a big hassle it would be for me to go to the funeral as they had already booked the hotel without me. She said I should go only if I really really wanted to. In the end I decided not to which I regret massively. I know it's my fault for deciding that in the end but I can't help but feel a massive amount of anger to her for guilting me into not going.  

&amp;#x200B;

 But I think one of the worst things that came of this is that my immediate family and I found out after his passing that my grandfather was a piece of shit who abused my grandmother and was complacent to my aunt as a child be molested by one of his friends. I really miss him though still, I am confused to be grieving for someone who is not a good person and feel betrayed by him because he was very good to me and I really looked up to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never dealt with mourning someone before so I don't know of this is normal grief, but I feel like I can't talk about it mourn properly because of the nature of the information I found out about him, as well as the fact I didn't go to the funeral so I have no closure. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was just wondering if anyone else has been through something similar and what they did to deal with the situation.

I keep hitting walls or being ghosted. At first, it was a bit hard, it made me feel not-special or not enough to someone (over the internet, that I would never meet in person. Maybe a bit crazy, but that was what was going on in my mind). 

But then, something changed. I just stopped looking this conversations as gain for me, but as a way to encourage other people: telling them how good they looked on their selfies; wishing well and good thouts; being positive, instead of feeling bad of not receiving a reply. (All of these trying to not be a creep or sound crazy, a bit difficult but I tried my best)

Although it didn't change the fact that I got nothing back, I felt better about myself. I don't know what are they going through and maybe they needed some positive feedback or just a good message.

I'm not saying that you should DM everyone that you see on Reddit. I'm saying that a possitive attitude at bad times can change your mood, your view of things. It helped me a bit and wanted to share it with someone.

512,DjDrowsyBear,1558289080,3,"very very low.

And that is a comforting thought.

I dealt with 11 years of extraordinary lonliness. During that time I grew increasingly desperate to find friends. I would wonder ""why don't I have friends? What is wrong with me that no one wants to be around me? Why am I so awkward, shy, dumb, and pathetic?""

It made me scared, terrified even, to try and socialize. Every now and again I would get a spur of courage to talk to someone new, but it was far and few between. Most of the time I would just feel anxious around others. Worried that I would say or do something wrong. That I would prove all of my fears about myself right by finding someone I wanted to be friends with only for them to slowly stop talking to me. I wouldnt blame them if they did. I was probably too clingy or desperate or annoying anyway.

It has been 6 years since that time. I now have more friends than I have time for and more confidence than I thought I would ever achieve.

I have learned in these 6 years that I put far too much pressure on myself to make anyone I met like me. A lot of the time I wasnt even interested in the person I wanted to like me. They were just there and I was lonely and I had low self esteem.

What I learned is that finding a friend, finding a true friend, is very very difficult. It is not because you are dumb or shy or frustrating to be around, it is because you have not found the right person. 

Because it *is* inevitable that people will find you annoying or dislike you. That is because you are not yoga pants, you do not fit whoever wears you. And neither do they.

You are a unique shape trying to find the unique holes who you can combine with. The harder you have to force yourself to combine with a particular hole, the less healthy and worthwhile it is.

All of that is to say, keep trying to find people because there are many people in the world and you need to find the few who have real potential to be real friends with you. You will find many who dont fit that, and that is okay. You will succeed if you keep trying. All it takes is a little bit of hope, to believe you are not beyond hope, and a little bit of courage, to still try even when you feel like you will fail.",lonely,Statistics on finding a friend,2019-05-20 04:04:40

So I don't like groups of people, i prefere talking to 1 guy and nobody else. 
That was also the case 5 years ago, I had like a 'friend' group that i played around with but i really didn't care about most of them. 
And every year that went by, someone left my life. 
It came to the point where i had only 2 friends, i like that and i didn't want anything to do with other people. But then my only 2 friends had founded a new friendgroup where i didn't fit in. 
So for more than a year I was alone, nobody cared about me. A lot of people didn't even noticed I stayed home when i was sick. 
It was truely Hell for me, then I changed schools and i found a few guys I like. And it's much better now, but i don't have a bestfriend, and I still barely leave my home for friends. It's better but i still feel so unimportant and lonely.

Firstly- I’m jealous of the girl she gets to be with. The crush is an amazing person. She’s exactly my type. I’ve never had stronger feelings for anyone. And she told me that she would love to date me, but just can’t. If only I was a girl...
Secondly- I’m jealous of their relationship. They are really cute together and are clearly happy to have each other... I want more than anything to have a relationship like that. But I don’t and there isn’t a high chance I will for quite some time, since I’m going to an IT school and there usually are not many girls there.

This post is for people interested in seeing this movie, alone, with other lonely people.  


Let's choose a date somewhere within the next 2 weeks. I think the easiest way to choose a date is first to say the days we definitely can't go; so for me, I'll be busy Friday and Saturday (5/24 and 5/25) and I can't go on those days. Tell me which days are good for you. And then we'll pick the day and time where everyone, or most of us, aren't busy.  


Then we'll talk about it, we'll talk about how annoying it is that we can't sneak snacks into the theater because they check our bags, and we'll talk about the overpriced snacks we end up buying (or how we somehow did manage to sneak some snacks in) and we'll talk about how awesome Keanu Reeves is, and how much better the world would be if everyone were more like him.

My ex and I have been hanging out these past few weeks platonically and it’s the best. I think I will always love him but now in a different way.

That’s when it finally hit I don’t need a boyfriend to be happy, as for a while I thought that was the only way I’d ever be genuinely happy again. I was happy because something funny happened in class and I was surrounded by my amazing friends who love me and who I love and we were laughing and having a great time. Depression is a life long struggle it seems and I imagine this phase of being this happy won’t last too long but months and months ago I thought I wouldn’t never be happy again. In January I put in my calendar for Wednesday May 15th, “are things better yet?” And I saw this a few days ago and just started bawling my eyes out because THEY WERE! Things were really better. I am lonely, very lonely, but at this point in my life I don’t need to not be. It stopped mattering to me if I have a boyfriend or not because I have my family and I have my friends, really great friends.

Nobody will read my messages if they are longer than 20 words. They say that they are too lazy for that. Some say (or imply) that it’s not worth their time. Even worse, I end up killing conversations by sending a “long” message, and I feel bad for that. One person even took their time to explicitly tell me that if I write a message that is not super short, people will be put off by it.

So how the heck am I supposed to communicate with people? Or is it supposed to always be low level, always being about dumb repetitive stuff? I am completely alone when it comes to topics that cannot be explained in less than 20 words.

And maybe people will say, “you are selfish for assuming that the things you write are worth others’ time; you’re selfish”. And maybe that’s right. Maybe I am selfish. So I can just decide to stop talking to them altogether, if I’m such a bad/selfish person.

Whenever I try to help out or be considerate, my kindness gets thrown back in my face. When I try to join a discussion or start one to get to know people, I'm quickly cut off by someone who abruptly changes the subject or my opinions are dismissed and ridiculed. I'm not one for confrontations so I just don't respond to being disrespected and internalize it, which has somewhat affected my mental health.

I've also felt really lonely in all of my past relationships. None of my partners ever really cared to get to know me and when I tried to be sincere and tell them about the things going on in my life, they quickly get tired of listening and just start talking about themselves.

I've constantly tried to be a kind and considerate person to everyone, but all it has brought me is emotional pain, sadness and bitterness. Even after all the good I've done for former friends and partners, I've eventually had to cut ties with them because I ended up being perceived as the bad guy for just trying to be honest and considerate. I'm just sick of it all and at this point in my life I wouldn't mind living like a hermit until the day I die.

 I want to start by saying that I have been finally lonely for almost 2 years now. So you can say that I suffer from chronic loneliness. :) 
It all started when I moved in Australia for my studies. I find it difficult to make new friends. I am very awkward and cannot do small talk which may come out as weird to other people. 
I do have a couple of ""friends"" but they only ask me out to parties. We never talk about stuff or do other things than drinking. 
I have tried to go out with guys but it hasn't worked. So I have never dated someone nor had a boyfriend. I have always felt like I am not pretty enough but after coming to uni I have come to believe that the problem is not my appearance but my boring personality.

No, I am not suicidal, nor is this a cry for attention. I want honest advice, or perhaps, redirection. Maybe I can use somewhere to chart down my feelings? Maybe a diary. I haven't a clue. Listen, and this may seem hard to interpret as for me saying that I'm lonely. I don't know if this is a common thing. But, let me just open up to you. . the reader and tell you what's going on. This all started five years ago. I met a woman online and we fell face first in love. I'm going to admit that I was, and still had been a controlling asshole. We hadn't have friends really through the period of the relationship- and even ended up married. Despite me being toxic, and controlling. . She can admit to me that she still loves me. Though, she wants to maintain friendships, and do other things that I do not particularly enjoy. This is probably derived from my controlling behavior. I developed it I believe because I was cheated on several years ago without my knowledge for a handful of months. It was only admitted to me after we had broken up when that girl had grown short with me, and didn't want to talk as much. 

The thing that I was speaking of earlier is that we haven't particularly spent a day apart before. Literally. We've spent virtually five years together without space, and she thinks it smothered us. The only time we don't see each other is when we're at work, or sleeping. Maybe running errands. She says she can't imagine a future without me in it. But, I feel like I ruined everything after doing this to her for years.

Why does she even love me, Reddit?

Am I clingy? Am I afraid she's going to cheat on me? These are my fears, sure. I can provide more context, yes. I just want you to know that I love, and live for this woman. I don't even know how to express the love I have for her. She, herself, says that she wouldn't still be with me if she didn't love me. Says that she never wants me to doubt that she loves me. Ever.

628,Darksethen11,1558058370,4,As you can see from the title I also am lonely. Currently in high school and have a decent sized group of friends as well as fellow classmates even in school but when I get home any interaction I can have is gone causing me to feel empty as well as now create anxiety which caused me to make this post. I honestly feel the need to cry as of just writing this as I don’t know what to do so that I no longer have this stressful feeling. I have tried on multiple occasions to make plans but most of my friends looked past those ideas and explained they were busy which they were however if they planned to go anywhere they wouldn’t invite me. The result of a lack of a social life outside of school has really messed me up and I don’t know why as I feel fine at school but as soon as I’m home I just feel empty and depressed almost. Honestly all I want at this point is to just hang out with someone after school to relieve all I want to talk about personally to them but it just feels impossible. I also don’t have any issues at home with my parents or older brother so that also is making question why I feel so stressed or anxious. Anyways I’m open to any ideas of how to get rid of this aching feeling.,lonely,"17 year old, lonely",2019-05-17 11:59:30

My significant other and I are together at a carnival or a movie. Hands are laced and held. She invites me to her home and I shake hands with her family with sincerity. All the things my household never had: love. It's an amazing night with no interferences, surprises, problems. I treat her like the queen that she is and she feels lucky to have a man in her corner. She feels safe with me all the time walking through even the most dangerous neighborhoods. 

I must have daydreamed again because I'm sitting here alone in the darkness. No texts. No calls. Nobody to hold or snuggle with. It's like an exit wound penetrated my back and exited through my heart. I feel that ""exit wound"" every time I see a couple together. A piece of me dies on the inside and I don't dare show weakness. I stare down the loneliness and that hurt feeling like a beast as it snaps and flares it's jaws at me. It's bitten me so many times before that I can just suffer in silence. It's beginning to kill me inside so much that it's like I'm slowly bleeding out losing consciousness in a daze. Fighting down to every last breath. I can't give up no matter how much I want to die.

I've got the worst paying job ever which barely pays all my bills and I've got just a little bit left to get something to eat for a whole month. I cannot save anything - by the end of the month I'm always left with nothing because I cannot save on the necessities.

I'm living in a foreign country all alone. You could say I ''ran away'' as soon as high school ended for me because I didn't want to live with my parents anymore. It's been almost a year now and I didn't really make much progress. I learned the language but not enough to work in an office or to have a serious job. 

My dad visited my aunt this week and we ended up meeting, which ended up in him trying to force me to come back to my old country to study. But guess what, it's fucking impossible there. I wouldn't mind studying at all if 1. I knew what I wanted to do in life because I don't just want to study whatever, and 2. If I could live there by myself and could afford it.

You see, in my country it's extremely difficult to get a job, whatever it may be. So of course the logical thing for me to do seemed to go abroad and start there.

And I just cannot live together with my parents. They always said they didn't have money for anything I needed. But that was a lie, I saw my dad's bank account balance once by accident and there definitely was a good amount of money there. It's much better to live alone but I don't have anyone now (not like I ever did tbh but I guess now it's more visible to me because I don't have anybody around me).

I'm lost. I don't think I'm good at anything at all. I don't see myself living much longer so even if I try to research some careers, in the end what does it matter? I want to die anyway. I don't even know what I'm doing and how I got that far with no money or help from my parents. Not like they would help me anyway, back at home they loved to remind me how much of a burden I am to them and now that I am gone suddenly everything is fine between us.

Well, it isn't for me. I'm conflicted. I don't know what to pursuit in life, and I'm stuck. My only goal right now is getting a better paying job and buying a car. But after that I don't know what I will do.

I told one colleague at work that I ''probably plan to quit'' because he asked me and I trusted him (which was obviously a mistake). Next day I was called in by my boss. They accused me of wanting to quit, and got mad because I didn't tell them. Thanks a lot, bitch.

So now at work they treat me like shit because they know I'll be gone in a month anyway. Honestly they don't even treat me like a coworker anymore and I hate it. I never liked this job but it got even worse somehow.

My friends here are great, and my best friends live in a different country because I had to move away. I like my friends here, but I am afraid that we are just together because of the situation we're in and that it's not true unconditional love/friendship.

I do remember one good friend that is still there for me, but I still can't be sure because she's like that with everyone and honestly, I want to be appreciated for me.

It's getting harder and harder to feel lonely. It's just physical pain in my chest. I used to be good at ignoring my feelings, now I am the first one to cry.

Hello everyone! Wow! I can’t believe I feel much better now. I also can’t believe it’s been 3 months since my original post. A lot has changed in such a short period of time. 

Things are difficult, life is. But I’m not in such despair. @it_changes really helped me understand the difference between loneliness and despair. Once armed with that, I began to question and challenge all my emotions. When I encountered repairing emotions, I basically had to imagine them as a separate person within me, challenge them, debate them, and then tell them they had no claim on my life. All the lies they told, I challenged them but doing or not doing their commands. For instance, I had this very convoluted thought that I shouldn’t go outside because there is nothing in the world for me. But then I remembered how I chose to live where I live because of the lake and the how social it is. Every time I walked the lake, even if I started hating it. I ended up having a good time. Or my work, it was such a chore to go to work. But then I remembered this was my dream job. 

I also started counting my blessings or recounting the things in my life that I really liked about my life or self or body. I’m overweight, but I really like my hands, my face, my skin complexion. I like my quirky sense of humor, etc. I also started to count all the things I have done right. No matter how minute. If it was right, I counted it. 

It’s amazing, after a while, something clicked in my mind- maybe I’m not so bad after all. 

And pain, now, I’m learning I’m not the pain. I am experiencing pain but I am not pain.  I’m able to differentiate myself from it abs identity it as communication from my brain that something is not right. Not that me as a person is not right. 

I started to listen to myself. And I learnt, you know what? I actually don’t like chips or watching movies all day. These activities just numbed me. I couldn’t face my emotions because I didn’t really know what they were or how to. Now. When I experience an intense emotion, I don’t crave foods or movies anymore because know I know it won’t help. I’m forced to find other things. Now I’m on a quest to find the things I like. 

I also became aware of how much I feared people, feared making mistakes, rejection and abandonment. Listening to Jordan Peterson and other podcasts helped me that the world is a both a malevolent and beautiful place. I used to be fearful of this but given we are here now and there is nothing I can do about it, the least I can do right now is just accept the world as is but find my way through it, not as a weak, fearful person. This I am still working on. I have started reconsidering how I view my work. I have also taken up paining. I started saying no to people and I am currently removing stuff from my apartment that I don’t like or never did. Gosh! There is so much shit I took into my like because of fear or thinking it would make me not like able. I have also started with exercising slowly as well. 

I just wanted to say, thanks to everyone! Thanks so much for your words to me. You have no idea, really! There were so uplifting. 

I hope my update is encouraging to you and hopeful to others out there.

They didn’t really care about me in particular, but I was like a member of the cast that sometimes contributed to their plot. I was just there. I’ve gotten older and realized that things aren’t that contrived. People don’t actively think like that unless you give them a reason to. In fact, people in general won’t think about you much at all unless you give them a reason to. 




It’s important to accept what we have and make it work because life isn’t scripted. It’s not a drawn out plan, and friends and family aren’t like the movies. People everywhere are afraid, uncertain, and have no idea what the fuck they’re doing! Being lonely and on this subreddit just means you’re approaching some level of being self aware. You’re realizing how strange society is and social interactions are complex and don’t always result in the way you expect. Most people to almost everyone is awkward and confused at some point in their life. Only through lots of experience, failures and practice do we start to flourish in social situations. Just be straightforward! Pretend you’re deadpool. Break the 4th wall. Comment on what life is like for you and how odd it is that we’re just organisms grunting at each other. We’re just things on a flying space rock making the best of it.



I wrote this after reading through a bunch of posts and comments to see if I could help anyone reading this, but I also did it for myself. I’m depressed too folks, but I don’t want to be. I’ve taken risks and experimented in life to find happiness in the past. I’ve found love and lost it and it was both awesome and terrible. I’m still young and unsure of the world, but I know that you brains out there can make it if you open up your perspective. Don’t see the world as if it owes you something, but rather you need to actively look for what you want and take it. Ideas like confidence and anxiety and being awkward are essentially buzzwords nowadays, just do something and learn from it so you can do something better the next time.",lonely,Relationships have to go both ways,2019-05-16 15:23:48

I may be missing something, so correct me if I'm wrong. However, if you don't know the story of Chris Chan, I'll give you one example of what these trolls did to him. A group of them tormented him by having one of them pretend to be a girl named Julie, knowing that Chris craved a loving partner. They then pretended that Julie's ""brother"" (who was really the same 13-year-old boy who pretend to be Julie) was keeping her from talking to Chris. They had previously tricked the poor guy into giving them his PSN password, the password to his websites, etc. To make him get it back, one of the things they made him do, and I repeat, ONE of the things they made him do to get the accounts back was cut up a medallion he had made himself that he wears everywhere, and then shove the piece UP HIS ANUS.

i’ve not really made friends for the past (almost) 3 years. ever since i left school 2 years before the end of high school i’ve mainly just spent my time alone. when i first left school i remember feeling relieved in a way because i just didn’t have to think or worry about acting a certain way or whatever and i just didn’t need to bother w other people, arguments and idk whatever other stuff that comes with it. but as time moved on i’ve slowly felt lonelier and lonelier, i’ve done my 1st 2 years of uni now and i still haven’t made friends. my first year was really rough because i was in a very weird mental state which i could talk about for ages but basically it was just very bad and i was very anxious and getting doubtful, negative thoughts repeatedly. 
it’s kinda hard for me to talk to people unless i’m forced in a situation where i have to or somebody starts a conversation with me. a lot of people here seem to be occupied w their lives and have friends already and so i doubt anyone gonna really take the time to talk to me, just find it very unlikely. i do still have contact w some friends from high school but i hardly ever talk to them, and i have my parents and brother but yea it gets kinda stale talking to my parents nowadays bc it’s just the same stuff over and over (no offense to them though). idk if i’m ever gonna make new friends. i’m gonna try to find a job so maybe that’ll get me out of my comfort zone, but even w that i’ve struggled to just simply ask about wether they are hiring or not like idk, i’m gonna have to force myself out of this so yea.

He had been battling depression for a feew years and I was getting out of a 6 year long relationship that was toxic and made me miserable. I think its fair to say that neither of us were ready to be in a relationship at the time. 

Life went on, we both met other people. And three years later, I'm going through a divorce and have a 2 year old daughter. He's engaged and is set to get married in September. 

I have never stopped thinking about him and still miss him. I dream about him from time to time too. I had a dream about him a couple of days ago and decided to reach out to him. I had a couple of beers and texted his last known phone number. He replied about 10 mins later asking who I was. I replied with my name and he immediately replied with a hey, whats up? We talked for three hours, until about 1am. I express my feelings for him and told him that I still longed for him. He said if he wasn't in a relationship he would be knocking on my door right now. I asked him if he was ready to get married, he said he wasn't sure and talking to me brought up alot of feelings. I went to bed feeling warm inside. 

No contact the next morning, I email him around dinner time to apologize for putting him on the spot and also for not being there for him when he was depressed. I told him that if I could, I would do our relationship over and that I missed him alot. That was almost 4 days ago and he hasn't contacted me. I just sent him a link to two elephants hugging because he loves elephants. No reply.  

I'm guessing that his fiancee found out or he told her all about it and he decided to cut contact with me again. It hurts like the first time and I wish we could atleast be friends. I just want to feel loved again. He was always so sweet to me and the sex was amazing. I just wish I knew what I had when I had it.

So I have felt a deep sense of loneliness for six years now. I had a great click of friends when I was in middle school, but I had a bad fall out with them right before high school. 

I did have friends in highschool, but I never felt as happy with these new ones as I did with my old. Even in romantic relationships I felt alone (and very embarrassed bc said partner would be my only physical friend there). As a result, I felt a very deep sense of loneliness throughout my highschool years. I did have (and still do) have one old classmate who i texted constantly to cope, but we live far away from each other. If anything this worsened my loneliness because he was there, but not really there if that makes sense. We also can’t talk everyday because living seperate lives is a thing. This feeling of loneliness and dread at the idea of having no one there with me makes me feel like I’d be better off dead. 

I didn’t know how to make new friends or how to approach people. I’m very introverted so that doesnt help me either. I do feel a sense of peace when I’m working on personal art projects or something, but then I feel lonely again when I have no people close to me to share it with. I go to a community college now and am about to transfer to a new college, but sometimes I wonder if that will actually help me.

I’ve never really enjoyed birthdays as I always end the day feeling sad and disappointed and therefore guilty for how fucking ungreatful I am. I had a card from my dad, he had made it himself, which is thoughtful. However it featured a blown up picture of me stuck onto a piece of paper with the printed words of “love mum &amp; dad” on the inside. It did not contain a message, which I thought was odd.. He came home and asked if I liked it, of corse I replied I did and pointed to the mantle piece as proof of my approval as it sat perched on the ledge. Then he went and sat in his room and I didn’t see him again. Later my mother came home with some cake which was nice but after a hurried “happy birthday” she was glued to her phone which rather spoiled the moment. Me and my mother then went to my cousins houses, he didn’t know it was my birthday which shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. We went home just before my sister returned from her last day at the nursery she had worked at for 2 years. She was accompanied with sacks up on sacks of thoughtful goodwill gifts, amount them 3 bottles of procecco. After she displayed and explained the relevance of her gifts I asked her, knowing she didn’t like them, if I could have her procecco. She agree and in the next room I downed two of them.

692,gatorquake,1557955345,1,"i graduated from a year long certification program today. it was the most difficult thing i have ever done, to transform myself into a student who puts forth effort towards something. i turned in every single assigment on time, clocked zero absences, and finished my last semester today with straight As and i also passed my monster certification exam and now an NSCA certified personal trainer. i have never completed an academic achievement like this in my entire life.

i don't have any friends, so i didnt really have anyone who knew about my schooling besides family. when i called my mom to tell her i passed my cert exam, she said ""thats great, are u ready to be picked up"" then went on to say ""so that's it right, youre done with school"", basically asking if she could be done helping me out with rides to school. no congrations. no asking how it went or how i feel. just annoyed impatience at when i would be ready to be picked up. it became clear during the conversation about the exam (that i initiated in the car on the way home) that my mother had been ignoring me talking about the details &amp; importance of this exam for a over a year. she had assumed it was just a regular final despite me saying over and over and over it was a 3 hour comprehensive professionally administered exam. she doesnt listen to a thing i say, and doesnt care. 

i thought my dad might care. when i got home im not going to lie i expected my dad to at least ask me how i did on the exam. he didnt even say anything not one word. i decided that i am not going to offer up information to people who clearly dont care about it at all. and they dont. 

am i wrong and narcissistic to be saddened by everyone's complete apathy towards something that honestly means the world to me? i wish i had a single person hit me up and say hey good luck, i know it's a big day, or ask me how the exam went. i wish one person would say congratulations  but no one did because no one cares. while everybody else is out to dinner or celebrating with their family for graduation, i will be in my room, watching youtube videos, like i do every other day of my life. i dont even care that i passed my exam at this point, because i am so depressed in my life that it isnt going to matter what kind of new job i can get. i will always just be lonely. no one is ever going to care. maybe i just suck. i understand why people wouldnt want to be around me. it just hurts really badly to have everyone be so utterly indifferent towards everything about me.",lonely,I graduated today,2019-05-16 07:22:25

So I decided I wanted to try doing somthing that will help break the cycle of internalizing my feelings and thoughts, and since I don't have all the time in the world to do this I'll do this in segments.I'm a sophomore in college, male, Asian, relatively tall, doing great academically, got a great job that pays well, a family that watches my back, have many friends who care for me.

I'd say everything in my life is going great...but...I'm here just like many of you for one reason: I'm a failure at love.

I know, I'm lucky, many people here have so much less then me...But I was never always like this... or rather, there is more benefit the surface then things seem.

My parents had been divorced as long as I've remembered(I've never had a real father figure in my life), my mother's side of the family has it's own problems, growing up I've never had any friends...I've always been the outcast...where as the others are playing D&amp;D, I'm the only kiddo with the Warhammer...I guess it's why value my friends so much... I know what it feels like to have nothing...have absolutely no one....to put it simply, it feels like poopoo.

High School was the true turning point for me, guess I matured over the time...it was then that I fought it...fought it hard... I fought to change myself, fought to redefine myself...and it worked...I was able to be, a genuine friend...with people now who care immensely about me.

It was, and still is, the greatest feeling...you know, to know that people will greet you positively...to have people text you stuff...to have people want to hang out with you...it's a good feeling.

But, of course, we humans are greedy creatures...and,well... I guess I just wanted more...

Repression is the best way I'd describe the way I dealt with my feelings when it came to love...when I was a kid, I had this notion to be mentally strong, that my strength wasn't my durability, but the ability to keep pushing forward even after failure...still believe it...""The only way to truly fail is to learn nothing""...guess even by that criteria, I've failed...I've been hurt many times, stories I might tell later...best way to describe my love life: Me repeatedly trying to ram my head through a brick wall...you could probably guess how it usually ends.

I guess the need to find someone to love comes from the fact that I've wanted someone to walk the path of life with me...for it be a long and lonely road...you know it's funny, 'cause I've friends who've said they see themselves alone for the rest of their life...despite being in a relationship...I could only shake my head...a part of me even wants to get angry...they don't know what they're asking for...least that's what I tell myself...they don't know the pain, I reassure myself...I'm closing to 20 next month, and I've never been in a relationship...lot's of people I talk with about this have tried to reassure me, and I get what they are saying. 

 I'm young, I've got time...but I'm also slowly starting to give up...after all, there's only a certain amount of times you can ram yourself into that wall before somthing inside you wants it all to stop...if not for purposes of self-preservation...even now, I have a crush on someone who's out of my league, and I'm debating about weather to go all ""hail marry"" or beat my feelings back down with a baseball bat...the deck has been stacked again me from the start...

I'd even made plans on adopting kid(s) when I reach 30 or somthing...I want kids, one way or another...it ain't gonna be easy, but a challenge I want to undertake...if nothing else, then to fill my empty heart then.

These days...it's been hurting more then it used to...you know, back then it was just a thought of being lonely...now, I fell it...it quite literally physically hurts to feel lonely...it's that emptiness, that wanting...almost grasping for somthing...for someone...it's worse 'cause you know the feeling of being held...you want it so bad...you just want to be held forever...but then reality sets in...and then realizing you don't have anyone to fill that gaping hole...then it really stabs you...worst yet, you start thinking this is how things will be for the rest of your life...trying to reassure yourself that this is how life is supposed to be...try to make it feel normal...for someone as poopoo like you...ain't it only nature?...not realizing that it's probably making things worse...but you'd do anything to stop these empty feelings...it comes in waves too...I used to be able to control when it happened, I'd be at home in my room, blinds down, in bed...looking at various pictures of fictional couples...letting myself spiral downwards...letting it all out...but now?...Found myself tearing up lecture class today...had I midterm right after, so that wasn't helpful...think I passed it tho...

704,zzliberated,1557936450,5,"People expectations have skyrocketed these days, I think it might be related to technology a whole world of new, “ better” possibilities is opened to people, the problem is that everyone thinks the same way. Nobody wants to date the average girl nowadays, everyone wants to date the super hot model of Instagram. If you are a guy you have to be tall, muscles, nice hair (God forbids if your are balding), do at least 100 K per year, have the good car, the nice big house in Switzerland, etcetera. And even if you manage to have all those things chances are you are gonna end up lonely anyway because people is gonna be intimidated by you or even worst they are gonna take advantage of you. You

Another factor that has contributed immensely to this problem is porn. Porn has fucked up the brain of an entire generation, nobody has the energy or the balls the ask the person they like, they are too busy wanking to pixels, people has become objectify, everything is disposable nowadays, people has become disposable. 

We have become in such a shallow society is repulsive and I include myself. Is not like I have been looking all my life for a girl that loves me with no progress, No. I had my fair chances of opportunities with very nice girls but couldn't appreciate it at the time mostly because of my insecurities, my lack of self love and respect and my impossible desire to find the super hot girl of my dreams. These kind of desires cannot be satisfied, you will want always more and more, is like a drug.

So yeah, at beginning I was gonna write of how lonely I feel and all that shit, give some of my background but I am sure you guys you have more than enough of this shit, Now I am here to give some advices if i can motivated or at least make someone feel better my mission here is done.

1.  Embrace responsibility, these life is your creation. We are infinite beings, only you are in charge of this beautiful life, is your decision to create a beautiful dream or a horrible nightmare.

2. Accept and love your yourself, you are already perfect.

3.Forgive and release traumas and bitterness of the past. 

4. Quit porn. (Especially if you are a guy)

5. Replace addictions with healthy habits.

6. Lower your expectations, a lot of the people that are alone like me is just because our expectations are just too damn high, they are unrealistic.

7.Hit the gym, do meditation, read more books, turn off the TV, pray (ask God for guide).

8.Make peace with your past, if you have to call someone for forgiveness do it right now is **very liberating.**

9. Dont be afraid of going out alone, you might have luck, Who knows?.

10. Be grateful with the universe, just the fact that we here alive is already a win win.

I think that the only way to attract somebody appropriate for us is to be completely in peace and in love with yourself, everything will fall magically in place because of the principle of correspondence. Trust in the universe, Trust in yourself, if you can change your inner self you can change your world.

That was all, Sorry for my grammar mistakes English is not my first language.

I know they can’t help it when they’re bad texters, or when they flake (we’ve talked about them doing that and I understand that they’re introverts and they need their space). However every now and then it gets me, as it feels I do a lot more work in these friendships than they do.

So roughly two years back I had my girlfriend at the time leave me for another guy. Now I loved this girl with every bit I could muster. Being happy isnt something that lasts for me so I always have a reserved approach which I said early in the relationship (it lasted for a year and a half), so I thought she understood it. 

The breakup didnt go well for me, in the sense it made me push everyone away. I lost that ability to put my trust in people or be comfortable being myself around them. I started noticing the only times I was asked if I wanna do stuff is if I was there to do a job or something that I was needed for (like setting up camp's or providing games and such) so I decided that they not friends worth having as I never asked them for anything. 

Its been just coming up to a year since I spoken with any of them. I mostly just spend my time playing video games if people from my wow guild or just doing nothing at all. All I have ever reallu wanted in life is to love someone and for them to love me back, but I have given up on that so I feel without anything just each day feeling the same after the other and I'm not seeing a reason to continue.

All my close friends have left me. 
It sucks because they helped encourage me to pursue my dream, but now that theyre left me, i really feel that i dont have any emotional support.

I do crossfit, so inherently, you may think exercise + community should combat loneliness...
But due to my schedule in pursuing my dream, the only times im able to go are usually “open gym” hours where i work out by myself. :/
When i do take a class, people who i used to consider friends, dont acknowledge me, dont seem happy to see me, and for some reason stopped inviting me out to social outings, which have made me sour towards them too.
My ex is also a coach there, so when i am able to take a class, it really weighs heavily on me to see her. How she could move on so easily and treat me like dirt.

In pursuing my dream, i have to deal with a hardass coach, who seems to be particularly critical of me, and often putting me down.

Literally no one in my family talks to me; after one falling out or another, theyve all shunned me except for my mom. But even when i talk to her, she clearly doesnt pay attention to what i say. I can see her zoning out; i will sometimes say something totally random in the middle of my sentence to see if she’ll notice. She doesnt. Ill even go as far as to confront and ask her what i just said, to which she admits she doesnt know.

I never really have anyone to vent to. 

I often have vivid and imaginative dreams; no one to share them with. 

I want to try new restaurants, watch new movies, etc, but often have no one to share the experience with, which usually makes me not want to go out and do things.

I literally feel a sense of dread when i meet new friends and or get close to people, because i sincerely want to tell them how much they mean to me... but when i have, theyve all inevitably left me.

Currently in a rut in terms of job/finance, so i cant even afford to see my therapist anymore.

She's been such a sweetheart the entire time we've been working together. She once drew a heart on a peice of paper she had to fill out and hand to me, she invited me to her Minecraft server, she even called me cute for trying to memorize all star lyrics. But she knows how alone I am, My shy/awkward personality makes it obvious. I've told her how I had lost all my high school friends. Maybe she's being nice out of pity.

Normally I don't have serious personal talks with people but we did yesterday. She told me I think too much. I am socially anxious so she has a point. However, she's the only person to have ever brought that up to me. She even drew something for me, about my overthinkig. It blew my mind, the drawing is perfect.

During lunch we were chatting, normally I'd quickly run out of things to say and the conversation would suddenly end but everytime that was about to happen she would ask a question to continue talking. It seems like a small gesture but it means so much to me. I'm certain she knows that.

I know she isn't flirting, she's in a serious relationship right now but as time goes on she seems more and more like the perfect girl. I know I can't be with her. I don't know how to deal with this.

713,avatar4real,1557899587,1,"Hi r/lonely, sorry, this is awkward because I've never made a post like this before. Well, I feel lonely(in case the fact that I'm posting on r/lonely didn't give that away) and I feel powerless. Oh I should introduce myself first. I'm 17, in high school. I'm a guy and pretty nerdy ig, like into Star Wars, comic books, etc. I love art and movies, super into psychology. I love to swim, and helping people a passion(check post history for specifics). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I don't know why I feel the way I do. I've got a few really fantastic friends, both irl and online. My parents are (usually) pretty nice, I get along with most my classmates and teachers. Yet, I always find myself so lonely, and idk why. And it feels wrong to complain about it, because I see so many of y'all talking about other issues that feel so much more real, like no friends and stuff, and who am I to bitch about being lonely. The friends I have are in school friends basically, because the minute school ends, we never meet up irl or do anything fun together. At most we have a discord chat, and as nice as it is, because like I said, really great dudes, but nothing could replace just hanging out and doing wacky stuff. Doesn't help that I basically have no control on my life rn. I can't drive by myself(started late), I'm in tough classes that I really couldn't care less about because college, and I feel so trapped. It's like my entire life is stuck between school and home and that's it. Nothing more than that. It used to be nice during swim season, but that ended too.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel like it's this lack of contact that made me value romantic relationships way more than I probably should, but just seeing people around me having someone who always shows affection and care and support, and I don't have that, it makes the loneliness thing worse. I mean if the only relationships( only 2)  I've had are an online ones, that says something, because I'd most likely never meet those people. I mean, I see people around me driving, having sex, and moving on to bigger things in life and I am stuck here, alone, never even had a first kiss. This also leads to a ton of self esteem issues, like I find my self really unlovable at times, and wonder why tf anyone would waste their time with someone as pathetic as me, when she could go for someone way better(not like anyone confesses their love for me anyways but still).  Questioning your self worth isn't a good thing but I sure do it a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

But like, I feel like I have no real goals or future. I'm going to college because people keep telling me that I need to go to get a good job and get money. I take hard classes and join internships because they will look good on college apps. And this also has led to me being an anxious mess a lot. It's a vicious cycle of not seeing any purpose or path in life, so that leads to no motivation, no motivation leads to bad grades, bad grades leads to anxiety, and anxiety leads to being more clueless in what to do with my life and so on. And even though I have like friends and stuff, I feel like I'm the one that reaches out to talk and stuff, like they only talk to me when they either think I'm depressed or if they want to know if an assignment is due the next day. The only time I feel nice and good, is when I am helping people online with their issues, because if I can't help myself at least I can help someone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like, honestly sometimes I feel like I would be really content just dying, like if I somehow died, I'd be really okay with that. I'm pretty sure if it wasnt for my friends and family, I would have ended it all like a thousand times over by now.    


I might be depressed, who knows. But rn, I have this stress on me with classes, and ACT, and internships and honestly, I just want to go. Sometimes it feels like even friends don't really care and the love from family is conditionally based on how I do in school.

718,reverend_lovejoyless,1557892723,1,"About a year ago I met my former partner.  things didn't end well.  she cheated on me and then left me for my best friend.  most of my friends knew about it, i was part of a group of about 8 people who'd known each other around 10 years, and 3 of whom i'd grown up with.  i don't know what to say.  i don't know how to explain what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

i cut everyone out.  i've been alone for year.  i don't have friends anymore.  i have a couple hobbies, i get out, but its always on my own.  i can enjoy a lot of this time for the most part.  its not always (thankfully), me sitting around loathing my circumstances, but unless its my mom i really don't get to share my time with anyone since this happened.

&amp;#x200B;

i say i cut everyone out, and i did, but i don't actually feel that that's the case.  all of my friends knew that my ex was cheating on me with our mutual friend.  they all knew.  they planned two birthday parties for members of our group without telling me so that my ex and my best friend could enjoy the evening with the gang.  i confronted a couple people about this, and they told me they didn't want to get involved.  i realize i might be a bitter person about all of this, but that explanation never satisfied me.  why'd they plan stuff without me if they didn't want to get involved?  isn't that a contradiction?

&amp;#x200B;

i don't want people to be judgmental or cast stones for me, i know that's not what i want. its hard for me to articulate how i feel to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

like i said, i've been alone.  i've been alone now for longer than i ever have been in my whole life.  i try to force myself to consider whether or not there is something seriously wrong with me, and that this flaw is the cause of my loneliness.  i feel extremely betrayed by my friends.  why'd they invite my ex into the group knowing she was a cheater?  and my best friend - i wasn't expecting people to cast him out or shun him, nor did i want that.  but what hurt me was seeing no reaction from anyone to the events going on.  it really messes with my head.  was i supposed to not be hurt by what happened?  i care about people in general, and i love my friends.  

&amp;#x200B;

is there some critical component of human compassion or understanding that i'm missing?  why am i this hurt when no one around me really seemed to think that anything hurtful had taken place?  why'd they just go along with my best friend and my ex in their new relationship?  it seems so slimy to me.  why'd everyone adopt such a complacent attitude (at least from my perspective)?

&amp;#x200B;

i thought people stuck up for each other if something bad happened or if someone was wronged.  aren't friends supposed to try to do right by each other?  i don't get it.  my mom is really encouraging.  i have a therapist too.  both of them make things much easier for me.  they make it easier for me to love myself when i feel alone, and have made it possible for me to just keep on with my life.  i am grateful for that.   they both tell me i'll meet people.  i don't doubt that, but i do doubt myself.

&amp;#x200B;

ever since this happened, i've just felt deficient.  like i'm missing a factory part, like somehow when i interact with people they can sense my deficiency on a subconscious level that directs them away from me.  i work in a big city, i am always surrounded by people.  people confound me.  i used to really resent the people that seem happy.  now all i see is that there are so many people that are just, i dunno, people are so complicated.  

&amp;#x200B;

i think people don't know how much we actually love each other.  i think in a lot of ways right now the world lends itself more towards obfuscating that fact.  i love and i miss my friends so much.  i want to love those guys and be around them, but i can't.  they really hurt me, and unless my personal compass is totally wrong i probably shouldn't go back to those people.  i love and miss people so much in general.  i playfully use the term ""wilderness"" to describe how i feel about where i'm at right now emotionally.  its perfect.  i look around at all of these people all day, they've all got SO MUCH going on.  i feel like i can't reach anyone, and if i did, is that the right person?  will it work?  is there any substance here.  its like i'm meeting fucking Klingons or some shit.  i have zero precedent to rely on with respect to forging new connections after the ""loss"" that i personally feel i suffered.

&amp;#x200B;

i know there's got to be at least two or three people out there i can love with my full heart.  there's no way i sit here sometimes dreaming about loving new friends, a new partner - without at least a couple of those people actually existing somewhere in the world.  maybe not a group, but maybe A friend?  A partner?

&amp;#x200B;

i'm just fucking lost though.  honestly, it really is like being in the wilderness.  no orientation, no trail to follow or a general sense of what course to take, AND NO COUNSEL.  that's the worst part, having almost no reference or input from anyone that i relate to on a personal level.  it fucking blows.

719,Sebastiana718,1557892147,7,"I'm just curious where the age range is. A lot of the posts here are very enlightening and close to home. Nothing here seems immature in any way. I saw a comment before creating this post about someone who's alone doesn't enjoy being that way. It's just that being among people has disappointed them. That's very much where I'm coming from. I don't even know where to start and what to include. I was a UC Berkeley student who left school to go to Israel/Palestine to work with an NGO. I ended up marrying a Refusenik and worked in several NGOs all around the world. We then moved back to the Bay Area where I wrote and self-published a novel and became very close friends with an MD who was actually gay but married because he was a refugee with an incredibly conservative family. My husband hated the doctor though and eventually we divorced because he wanted to have facial reconstruction surgery (it was \*somewhat\* medically necessary but he could have done it slower with braces.) My MD was my only friend for quite a while after that. Right at the point where I'd finally moved into a new place and gotten a job that could have potentially sustained me, the MD's wife found out about both the fact that her husband was gay and that he'd confided more in me than in her. As a result, she made a false allegation against me that I'd threatened her and cops show up at my house and demand I come with them to a psych hospital. I eventually got everything worked out but I lost my new place as a result and I lost my only friend. A year later I crushed my ankle and had no permanent home in San Francisco. When I went to the Urgent Care clinic, they told me, ""We have to take you on the stretcher around the corner to the hospital \*right\* now!"" I said I wouldn't have anyone who could help if I was in a cast and I wanted to try to arrange something and come back. However, because I was only a consultant I had no insurance at the time. The clinic failed to mention that if I didn't have surgery at that moment I'd be unable to have my ankle reconstructed at any future time. It was 3.5 years before I was finally able to get healthcare that covered me for Reconstruction surgery at a hospital that was actually capable of restoring movement. The crushed ankle had improperly re-healed itself and even after I started paying $200/month for a good PPO, I had to leave San Francisco and move to southern CA and finally sign up for a $490/month PPO to have access to Cedars-Sinai, the only hospital out of the 5 I'd been to over the whole of 2016 who had a surgeon confident he could restore movement. The surgery was successful but unfortunately the OR nurse missed the fact that the xanax script I had was contraindicated with the oxy the surgeon gave me for the post-op pain. I went into a state of hypoxia, spent 6 days in the ICU and 3 weeks in Neuro-Rehab. I lost 60% of my hearing and ended up with a mild traumatic brain injury. It primarily affects my short term memory. That was in 2017. I've literally just been hiding in my mom's house in the Los Angeles suburbs ever since. I have a therapist but he isn't a real friend. Genuine friends  are like family. People who feel like family straight away. I've met a some people since moving down here but I recoil from most of them. Developing a friendship fatigues me physically. I actually got tested for sleep apnea because unless I was simply sitting in my room, anything I tried to do exhausted me. I lived in the Bay Area from '95-2017, with about 3-4 years spent overseas. I'm out of place down here in southern California but I fear I may be out of place even if I returned to SF.

That being said, I don’t have many friends, and those that I do have, I don’t see often. I met someone through Facebook about 3 weeks ago,and her and I had really hit it off. We had a lot in common, and we planned on hanging out relatively soon. We talked quite a bit, and other than one day where she said she had some emotional stuff going on, we talked at least a few minutes every day.

Last week, I asked her if she still wanted to hang out over the weekend, and from there she just vanished. She hasn’t responded to memes, messages checking in to see if she is okay, or anything else.

I've mentioned before how my shitty abusive childhood effects me today, and how anime and cartoons and such can trigger depression for me. Well, I've been doing alright lately. Not good, not horrible. Just alright. But, that's ages better than I usually do. Anyways, I was talking to a few friends of mind, because the three of us were talking and laughing and making jokes as we waited for my our other friend to get on. During this, we brought up Senko-san, that weird wolf loli that's apparently ""800 years old"". Anyways, I made some jokes about it to make my friends laugh (I combat pain and anxiety with humor and wit), but it put me from being alright and having fun to being downright suicidal and wanting to die. I think it's the innocence and near perfection of anime and cartoons and movies and other media like that that triggers it. If I see a pretty girl, it happens. If I see an anime, it happens. Cartoons, movies, some video games. Hell, even when I see simple hentai pop-up adds or hentai in general (though I don't see them for the reasons you may imply). Just seeing innocent, or cute, or just general things like that, it can put me from being in a great mood, to wanting to straight of end my own life. I think I'm bipolar on top of everything else, and it scares me. Makes me feel like an even bigger freak than I am. I don't know what to do. Why can't I just enjoy these things like a normal person?

725,ScarlettAndPupper,1557884621,3,"I just spent the time writing this for an askreddit question, though I doubt people will see. I figured I would share with a community who would understand.

I grew up with a girl, we will call her Suzie. She was my best friend, we did everything together and saw eachother daily. What ever I had I tried to have 2 of so we could both play together. From my view point apperantly we were inseparable. She was a grade over me but just barely. Well I started 5th grade and she started middle school. That day we never talked again (till about 7 years later). I tried so hard to contact her, all I wanted was to see my best friend again. She was so important to me. Finally one day I was playing in the tree in the front yard and her car pulled up to the stop sign. I got her this time, a car window was down, she couldn't ignore me this time. So I jumped out of the tree and ran up. Her mom was surprised and happy to see me. I noticed her in the back and I waved and said hi. Then I heard ""MOM I DONT LIKE HER JUST GO."" and they sped off. That's when I finally felt abandoned. I always struggled with friends but she always stayed with me before. But now she left me too. I started the first week of 5th grade completely alone.

Until someone who we will call Mark. Mark got transferred to my school when he moved. I don't remember how the friendship started but it was almost immediate. We hung out every day and I couldn't wait to see him anytime we had the chance. We had the same likes but he was definitely smarter then me haha. Everyday he would finish his school work early. I would go as fast as I could, eventually i got fast enough that I would finish too. We would play chess everyday at school while the other kids finished work. I don't think I ever won. But I just loved talking and playing. Sometimes I would study chess hard and be so convinced I would win. Nope I didnt, but the game was funner haha. That is until we graduated 5th grade. My parents are way to church obsessed and thought middle school would ruin me. So I was pulled into homeschool. I keept calling Mark but he wouldn't answer. I didn't want to be annoying so I would call every other day, then every few days, then once in awhile. Eventually I got a call back! I was so happy. It was his mom... telling me to not call back. One day awhile later I saw him at a store, I was excited but worried. We ended up accidentally making eye contact and I waved and smiled. But he looked back and glared, and walked away. I had been abandoned again. I didn't make any more friends after that, untill.

We will call him Jake. I had met him years prior at the coast (an hour and a half away) we had alot of fun together and our parents were good friends! But we never saw eachother because of the distance. We were to young to text so we enjoyed the memory's but never saw eachother again. Finally he came down again and we hung out. We had an absolute blast. This was the first time in a long time I was so happy to be with someone (or really that happy at all). We promised we would find a way to keep in contact. We exchanged phone numbers and texted eachother as he rode home.

The next day I texted him but he didn't respond. I figured he was busy. I learned that night I had been abandoned again. He committed suicide. I cried off and on for days. I refused to think about it again for a long time. Since then I still haven't been able to keep a close friend. They all leave or stop talking to me. But I don't usually get as close as I used to. I'm having trouble these days being so lonely. But I can't so much about it. Being homeschooled I have no idea where to meet people. And I'm still to young to go to bars and such. Maby someday I can be close to someone my age again. I want to so badly.

Now of days I volunteer my time at different places such as shelters. I try to make friends my age and even did make one, but he moved and I was alone again. I will admit I have some wonderful friends who are not my age. I love them dearly, but the age gap prevents us from doing anything outside of volunteer work and I don't blame them. I do enjoy them anytime im around them though. They always thank me for my work, and wonder why people my age don't want to stay with me. I want to take the complements and I appreciate them more then words can express but inside I feel like I'm not worth it. People I've loved in the past sure didn't see me as worth it.

731,AlabasterCrashesDown,1557873716,1,"I think I pushed the limit the last time, a few months ago was it? 

Before I could probe for, some kind of reaction. 

I sent you jokes after the first gap because I thought that's what you liked me for, and was the only way I could be re-approachable again. I wasn't trying to mock. 

I didn't register that you just didn't like me. I thought that wasn't something that was going to happen. I thought it could also be there, it just needed work. I thought we were just being stubborn and proud and it could all be amended some day when I got the maturity. I said something that was horribly boring, and half-wrong. You had no time for me any more.

I apologised, I told you I wasn't trying to re-establish contact. I was. You entertained me. I forgot something about you. You took that to mean something. You stopped. I tried to send you jokes. You blocked me. 

I waited again. I pretended to find you on a technicality to save face, to be incidental. You didn't like that, or you recognised the name. You shut it off. I started conversation. I didn't mind if you never answered, and you didn't. A few weeks I could tell you things. I didn't know you saw them. You did for that long, saw everything I wanted to say - well, not everything. You stopped it at one point, I don't know why. 

You were then completely blocked off. I knew any attempt would be pointless in a different way to all the others.

You don't hate me anymore. You are tired and bored with me, and my behaviour is now unimportant, bland, and just intolerable. 

I have thought about you less than any other time. I looked at your pictures so long that they don't look like anything. Everything else is closed off. I saw some pictures of you and I started to notice the small obstacles of recognition, and that scared me a bit. You had tanned facial stuff, linings on your nose. 

There was a feeling I had for a year and a half, or a bit more. I remembered a very distinct emotion when we were on the couch. I can only remember now the blood vessels in your face and the goofy teeth showing, and your smell. The emotion is lost, and there's nothing similar in my experience since then. 

When I said I was alone, I did mean it. If you wanted me punished for what I did, I think I did get it. You know those people were my only friends, the happiest point in my life, and I had to be removed. Everyone else since then has gone away too.

 I have gotten uglier, interestingly enough. I walk around with everything gawky showing. Projecting some form of pride, some interface to support the selfish way of doing things I only know. People talk to me only incidentally, and the best treat me sympathetically subnormal. 

I've looked at other girls. I've had shallow attractions. But they are the same as a television crush or that kind of thing. The fawning, the obsessions aren't there like I had for you and a couple before you. Either I'm emotionally different or people need to look at you for you to get attached. 

I have a career path, I think. It won't match my career ambitions but nothing really could. When you don't have friends you have to inflate yourself to  compensatory levels. It isn't good or compatible with low motivation and general mediocrity. 

I won't kill myself. That has gone away. Too impractical when I work in my own frame of motivation. I don't really know what's going to happen now.

I expected to make  friends in the school, I did. It was too big, I was too stiff, I was too much like myself. The year will be over soon. 

3 months are coming, and they will be lonely in a way that is different and before.  now. '10. I am scrawny, with my head bent gawkily forward, with a pointy and pinched nose over mishapen lips. I have a grotesquely angular head with big ears, one sticking out more than the other. I have hair which exposes the rot of the haid when short, and ridiculous when long. I am weak and weigh nothing. I have no strength. I eat like a child. I do nothing but pretend to be other people, people in stories and the talented people who wrote them. 

I will be in college, if this goes well. I won't be a romantically sad renegade kid, I will be an unpleasant physical sore. I will be one of the disfigured people you see on the streets or on buses, wondering who they, how their background has allowed them, how many of them they are. 

I don't know what you're doing now. I know you're probably more emotionally charged. Probably dealing with eating issues or something that's come from them. Your friends have probably changed since I last investigated. Incidentally, I see one of them myself around by circumstance. I imagine though, you still have people. You were lovable, and not in a way which was maintained by pretense or by the most convenient possible scenario. You were attractive, pleasant, and agreeable. 

There is benefits in being stale, myself. I don't know what I would or could do if I saw another man/boy touch you. I am possessive. You belong to me, in my head. There is nothing that should change that. It would be wrong and vile if someone touched you. Whatever's here now can be mended. I am sorry, this is irrelevant. This is not applicable. I will never see you again. If I did see you, I would wait for you to talk. I have nothing to say. It would be your turn.

I would only ask for engagement, if I could every wish for anything. You marked the end of my optimism. I am still young and that is a boring thing to say. But where am I going to live now again? I am only preparing myself for when everything gets very grey and very unseemly.

I can't say I love you. I don't know you and was never going to be able to, since whenever it was that point when I dissolved my credibility. I was obsessed and loved a version of you. I can't sustain that image as I am losing the depth, the microscopic detail. It's gone now. It's gone now and it doesn't transfer. 

The other wish, I have decided more specifically. I would have you answer what I should have asked you. Why did you like me? Was it your sickness? Was it an illusion I had made in that place? 

Whatever the answer, when can you perceive, the most discernible time it left you? The simplest answer would be the first disconnection, but that is an unsatisfying answer. 

I am just checking in. I am rarely emotional, in the way I used to be, only enough to talk for this. The next one will be different. More boring, again.",lonely,Checking in with you again,2019-05-15 08:41:56

738,C0racle,1557863471,2,"up until a bit less then a year ago I was happy with my life.

Around 6 years ago my parents got a divorce, I was very angry and sad at the time, eventually I got over it, I think a big part of that was being able to just distract myself with my friends.

A few years ago I grew really close to a girl, think I fell in love with her but I fucked it up and we stopped talking to eachother, at the same time I was drifting apart with my friends and I think she started dating one of them.

Made new friends that I had a lot of fun with and we are still friends now.

Met one guy in particular I could talk to about feelings and stuff which was not something I could do before, this was when I started thinking about my life and disliking some things in it, mostly things about myself.

Helped him and my other ""friend"" get together and then they both kinda stopped talking to me for a while, we were both kinda mad at each other and then I just dealt with my own shit for a while.

At this point I hardly sleep, I don't tell anyone about how I feel, I am starting to decline in school but no one has noticed yet. I feel like I only live for my mom, in a lot of ways I feel like a burden to her but I'd like to feel the positives of my existence outweigh the negatives in terms of my effect on other people.

I don't want to live for another person but I don't think I can find any reason to live my life for my self.

I have been in love once, no one has liked me in the slightest in that way as far as I'm concerned, pretty sure some girls thought I was good looking at some point but they never bothered to talk to me so they weren't interested in me on any greater level.

I want someone I can look at without feeling ashamed, I want someone to be able to look at me without being affraid of people around them judging them.  
I want to be able to touch someone and be touched by someone else without any of us having to make excuses or apologize.  
I want to be able to talk to someone in the middle of the night when I can't sleep and I need someone I'm close with to share my thoughts and feelings with.

However I feel I don't deserve any of this, I haven't found anyone that's interested in me and no one I am very interested in either. So I guess it won't happen, but that's just the way it is, right?

My family makes me feel pretty left out, sometimes I feel judged by them and hated against but there is times it’s alright and doesn’t bother me much. The majority of the time I’m trying to actually care and say something that is important to me or even put in my simple bit of advice/opinion and it gets slid off every time. No one seems to even care about me unless I have something for them, my own dad gives my friends more attention and I’ve never gotten close and still can’t because he can’t seem to let me in his world. He loves me so much but man sometimes he just doesn’t show it, I feel so lonely surrounded by so many people. My own girlfriend makes me feel lonely, I can’t fucking live like this. I’m going bat shit insane and it’s making me just out of control. I’ve been so deep into it recently I can’t hardly sleep. I get either 0-3 hours of sleep max a night, I can feel it take toll on my head and body. I can’t live with myself anymore, I’ve fucked my whole year up so bad and my parents hate/love me. My friends on another hand don’t even show me the interest they did before. I feel so left out unless I’m alone with just one person, and sometimes even I feel left out then. My friends act so weird around me and it almost feels like they’re making fun of me in the sneakiest way. It is really making me overload with stress, anxiety, and overall insanity. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore, I have no one to go and talk to my problems too. Not one person to open up and say something too.. instead I’m here writing about it or just thinking over and over about it till I can’t anymore. I don’t wake up happy anymore, maybe I should just stop worrying about everyone else and just stick to myself, find out how to cope with the loneliness feeling and just ride my days out. I try so hard to gain attention in the least attention seeking ways. Sometimes I just sit and watch, it’s really one hell of a feeling. Empty, and lost. Not a care left in the world for your life or future.

I’ve lost so much this year... I fucked my junior year up, got lost into some girl who never ever treated me right besides when she wanted too, my best friends from since I was 4 are dying out on me. My dad who’s never seemed to care still doesn’t really care about what I have to say, everyone else though is a whole other story it really kills me inside and I mean it. My mom is the only one who has made me feel any sorts of love recently, and it sucks because it’s not often.

761,suicide_throwaway_1,1557803497,1,"I'm going to kill myself on Tuesday night. Unfortunately due to my living circumstances I don't have many good options to do so (can't buy a gun, nowhere high enough to hang myself reliably, don't want to do it publicly so can't go jump in front of the subway, no prescriptions for any serious drugs), but I bought a bottle of acetaminophen and some alcohol and will be downing as much of it as possible. According to the research I've done this should do it if I can take enough of both at the same time. If that doesn't work I'll hang myself with a belt over my closet door. I'm flying home tomorrow to go to a music festival with my Dad, I'll get to see my parents one last time and see my Mom for mother's day and hopefully enjoy myself for a little bit to temporarily make the pain go away. I'll fly back to school Monday morning, go to my last classes of the semester Monday and Tuesday, go to a meeting at 7 on Tuesday for my student organization, then come back to my apartment and kill myself.

This isn't technically a suicide note, although I am going to write one Tuesday afternoon. But there are certain things I can't say there, things that need to remain anonymous, so I'm using this as a means to get it all out. Maybe some people will read it, or maybe they won't, but I have to have it out somewhere. I want my struggle to be documented in some way, even if it is on an anonymous internet forum that nobody will read.

I'm 21 and a half years old and have never really been happy despite living a relatively easy life. I'm a white dude, my parents are relatively well-off (self-made millionaires, albeit barely), I've done well in school with relatively little effort, got into a solid state university 8 hours away from home that was perfect for the field I wanted to go into. I've had good internships and was recently elected President of my student organization going into my senior year.

It seems to most people like I have a lot going for me but there's one thing I've never had: friends. Sure I've had friends in the loose sense, mostly in high school, but they always felt more like acquaintances to me. I could never connect with any of them on a deeper level or discuss any truly personal matters. This was my own fault. My social anxiety prevented me from ever being vulnerable or talking about my feelings with anyone. All of my friend group seemed to always be closer with each other than with me. I would occasionally get invited to do things with them but never as much as everyone else. All of the fond memories were made without me present. I honestly can't remember the last time I had a birthday party, which is emblematic of the situation I think. I'm finishing my junior year in college, my birthday is in December. I haven't had one since elementary school as far as I can tell. I always spend it alone. I was essentially always a side character in everyone else's stories, one of those people that could disappear with nobody noticing. This is a recurring theme that will come up again, it has been the defining characteristic of my pathetic life.

Although this always led to me struggling with mild depression in high school, things got infinitely worse in college. As I said I went to a school pretty far away from home by most standards, and this might've been the biggest mistake of my life. It's perfect for my professional field, and is a good school, but I didn't know a single soul here. As far as I'm aware nobody from my high school has ever even gone here, at least not in recent history. At least in high school I had casual friends and people I could talk to sometimes. In college I have nobody. My social anxiety and complete lack of self-esteem led me to never talking to anyone Freshman year. It seemed like everyone else had already formed friend groups within a week, meanwhile I was alone in the corner unable to even attempt to talk to anyone. My roommate was a foreign student who mostly hung out with other students from his country, speaking another language, and we had very little in common. We got along alright but were never going to be friends in a serious way. Not long into my Freshman year I got to the point where I wouldn't talk to anyone all day for days on end. I'd wake up, go to class and maybe say a few words in there. Go eat at the dining hall alone. Go do my homework in a lounge or the library by myself. Come back to my dorm room to watch TV or play video games, again alone. I'd have a few words once a week at a club meeting. Nothing else. This essentially carried over to my Sophomore year, with the only difference being that I now lived in an apartment completely alone. I still live in that apartment at the end of my junior year, and not much has changed. I'm pretty much always alone.

My romantic life has been nonexistent. I believe I was the only kid in my high school class of about 90 people to not go to prom either Junior or Senior year. Everyone I know went to at least one of the two, most both. I had too much social anxiety to ask any girl I actually liked because I knew they would say no, and I had too much anxiety to ask a less attractive girl I didn't like but could probably get because I thought my friends would make fun of me. I never really attempted to even talk to girls in a serious way until my senior year due to lack of confidence and anxiety. I asked out one girl over text, was rejected. Started ""talking to"" another that I thought had given me some signals. Was thinking about asking her out, until one of my friends sent me a text. His GF was friends with her. He asked his GF if this girl was seeing anyone, he knew someone who was interested. His GF said ""oh god please don't let it be (my name)"". Needless to say I stopped trying with girls for a while after that.

Once I got to college my confidence was so in the tank and I was so depressed I never even tried with girls. I kind of just resigned myself to thinking that eventually I would meet the right person and things would find a way to fall into place, and I managed to be comfortable with that for a while. I honestly didn't stress about this part of my life for the first couple years I was in college. Mostly because I didn't really meet any girls I was actually interested in. Sure I knew some that were very physically attractive, having class with them or being in clubs with them or whatever, and I would've dated them for that alone out of desperation, but I made no attempt to pursue any of them because I didn't actually catch feelings for them. That changed somewhat recently and ended in disaster.

There's a girl that's in the same student organization I'm in, the one I just became President of. She's the same year as me, from the same area of the country despite it being 7+ hours away from our school. We are going into the same professional field and I actually have an internship lined up for this summer with the same place she did last summer. Despite having all this in common, we never really talked much until this semester. No reason in particular I guess, just didn't happen. But near the beginning of this semester she asked for my number. Soon after she added me on snapchat. She started texting and snapping me, one of the few people who actually initiated conversations with me instead of the other way around. She commented on my instagram post of my weightlifting (I post on instagram like once a year). I've lost about 50 pounds and become somewhat built over the last 1.5 years or so and can lift pretty heavy. I'm still a bit overweight but I've started to be somewhat accepting of my appearance over the last few months, and I actually had a smidgen of self-confidence for the first time I can remember. This girl might be interested in me, I thought. She's a sorority girl, pretty attractive and definitely somewhat out of my league, but frankly her last boyfriend was way below her league and less attractive than I am, so I thought I had a shot. Our favorite hockey team made the playoffs and was playing the team in the city we go to school in. A hell of a coincidence, and I saw it as an opportunity. I asked if she wanted to go to the opening playoff game, and she said yes. Oh shit it might be happening. We went to the game and had a decent time. Our team lost. She asked a lot of personal questions that nobody has asked me about in a long time, some of them never. She said she wanted to get to know me better because she felt like she didn't know much about my personal life. She asked me about my dating life. Did I have a crush on anyone? (I lied and said no) What was I looking for in a relationship? I said something serious with someone I actually cared about, and I wasn't super interested in casual dating. Which was true. Anyways, the night ended and we went our separate ways.

About a week and a half later we got together at a bar to watch another hockey game later in the series. I felt like I had missed an opportunity when we went to the game together to try to connect more, so this time I tried to be the one asking questions. Unfortunately this turned to me figuring out she probably didn't have feelings for me the way I had for her. I asked if she was involved with anyone, she said she had no men in her life and was fine with that. I asked what she was looking for, and she said she didn't think it was the right time for her to have something serious. She then told me about this guy she was going with to her sorority formal that weekend. She wasn't dating him and I haven't heard about him since, and I'm sure she had arranged to go with him in advance of us really getting closer which was fine. But I took it as a sign that she brought that up right as I started asking her about her dating life, and that combined with her saying she explicitly wanted the opposite of what I was looking for dating wise. She probably wasn't interested. I was disappointed, but not super upset or anything. I started to try to move on after that, although somewhere in the back of my mind I held out hope that it could still happen.

Fast forward to last weekend. We were at an event for our student organization Saturday, and long story short about 5 of us end up at a guy's house drinking and just hanging out. 2 girls, her being one, and 3 of us guys. A few of us end up pretty drunk, her and me included. At the end of the night she's all over the host guy, massaging his shoulders, rubbing her fingers along his chest, whispering into his ear. He's not giving her quite as much attention but basically they're going through foreplay right there in front of everyone. The other 3 of us get up to leave and are driven home (me and the other girl live in the same building, so the third guy drives us back and drops us off). I'm silent on the ride home, and they are talking about how weird it was that our two friends were being so explicit in front of the rest of us. And basically commenting on how weird it was that two of our friends stayed behind to fuck while the rest of us went home. So again, long story short, just as I'm trying to get over this girl and accept that we're just friends I watch her have a one night stand with a mutual friend while I'm sitting in the same room. I had already given up on the prospect of us dating but I couldn't handle having that thrown in my face at that moment. I cried myself to sleep that night. I've cried a lot lately, this was just another thing to cry about. I legitimately have never actually had feelings for a girl in my almost 22 years of life. Those other girls I tried to ask out or had interest in were just casual high school things; this was the first time I actually felt a connection. To have it blow up in my face like that was truly the final straw I think. I had actually been planning to kill myself that night, but being invited to that small gathering made me put it off. Oh if I had known, I could've just stayed home and got it over with instead. When I got home that night, still fairly drunk and stumbling my way to bed, I thought that if I had a gun in my apartment I'd shoot myself right then. I've thought that a lot lately. In hindsight I guess she wasn't giving me signals after all. Each of those things I listed as ""signs"" were meaningless on their own, but I thought added alltogether they meant something more. I was wrong.

I'll try to wrap this up. I'm killing myself because I'm just so alone. The only people who care about me are my parents, and they do care. They love me a lot. But parents are supposed to love you, and somehow that makes it not matter as much to me. And even though I know they care, there are certain things I just can't talk about with them. They know I've struggled with mental health problems and been to therapy. But they don't know I'm suicidal. I can't tell them how bad things really are because my mom has really bad anxiety herself and it would wreck her life with worry if she knew how much I was struggling. My dad and I love each other and have a ton in common, but like with the rest of my friendships I've had, we've never broken that barrier into really intensely personal conversation. It just doesn't feel comfortable for me.

All I really want is someone to care about me. The first time I thought about killing myself in a serious way was this past fall. I was laying in bed and it randomly occurred to me that if I did kill myself, nobody would find me for days or weeks. I thought that in a passing way, but it made me actually become suicidal. I realized that it would probably take several days or a week of me not responding to texts or calls from my parents. They'd send a welfare check for me and the police would bust my door in and find my body. Nobody at this school would notice I was missing. A few of them might express sadness that I was dead, but they'd move on pretty quickly. My extended family would do the same. The only people who would truly care are my parents, and for a while that has kept me alive. But I can't do it anymore. That was the first night in my life I ever remember crying myself to sleep.

For a while I thought I was making progress. After that breakdown that night in the fall, I started going to group therapy at school. They all told me I was doing better and they could tell. I was becoming more happy with my appearance as I got more and more serious about fitness. I went from a regular member of my student organization to President in the span of about 3 months. I had my first piece of writing published in a major outlet with hundreds of thousands of readers. Even though I failed with the previously mentioned girl, I at least had the courage to try and and wasn't totally rejected outright. In the winter I made a new friend to go to basketball games with at school. My first 2 years I barely went to any football or basketball games, despite being a diehard sports fan. I couldn't go because I had nobody to go with, and didn't want to be that loser showing up alone. I started playing music again. I play 4 instruments and have played guitar since 5th grade. I was in some bad bands in high school but I had fun. Reconnecting with that part of my life for the first time since coming to college made me happy in moments. But in the past few months it's all come crashing down. I realized that none of this could fix the underlying problem. None of this cured my loneliness. None of this made anyone care about me. None of this made that realization that October night any less true: that if I killed myself, nobody would find me. And the more I understood this, that all this ""progress"" really wasn't doing shit for me, the more I deteriorated. I've been missing classes. I've been missing turning in assignments. I've stopped responding to texts from the few people that do try to talk to me. I've stopped being active on social media. I've secluded myself further. The pain is too much for all this ""progress"" to mask.

I haven't hugged another human since I hugged my mom at the airport before returning to school at the end of spring break. I don't even remember the last time I hugged someone that wasn't related to me. I've never kissed a girl at age 21. The idea of laying in bed cuddling with someone is more appealing than the idea of having sex at this point. It's pathetic. I don't remember the last time someone asked me how I was doing in a non-pleasantry way. That's all I really want, is for someone to ask me how I'm doing. And for me to be able to tell them the truth. I'm hurting. I'm hurting so badly. But at this point I know nobody is going to ask. I have nobody who cares about me enough to ask. I have nobody who I can talk to about my problems and my pain. Nobody who can help me heal. And there's no signs that I ever will. I can't do this anymore. Maybe once I'm dead some of them will care. I don't have any contempt for these people, or anger. It's not their fault, and they don't owe me their time or emotional investment. It's my own fault. My own emotional stuntedness and inability to be vulnerable has prevented me from turning acquaintances into friends, from turning friends into close friends or significant others. My own anxiety has prevented me from approaching new people or trying new things. I tried to convince myself I was improving. Going to the gym, doing better in school, pursuing my professional opportunities. But none of it can replace the feeling of other people caring about you. And I'm done trying. I can't fight anymore. I've lost the fight.

772,kikilovesjiji,1557787972,6,"This is my first reddit post (F). Dunno if anyone is even going to read this, but I guess it doesn’t matter. I made this account just to talk about the changes I’ve been going through lately. 

Background: To put it briefly, I recently left my 3 year relationship, I’ve already been dumped by somebody who promised to always be there for me, and a close friend who also promised to be there for me just, out of the blue, texted me last night that he’s “not interested in talking to me” anymore. 

I have major trust issues stemming from that 3 year relationship due to multiple instances of cheating,  emotional abuse, and borderline physical abuse. So whether it’s dating somebody new or just regarding a friendship, it’s really hurt me that so many people have decided to just up and leave me like that when they knew about my trust and abandonment issues, after promising they would never do anything to hurt me. 
Don’t get me wrong, I have friends I know I can trust, or at least I hope so. They’ve been there for me through thick and thin and I value them so much. I’m not always the perfect friend or s/o but I would be lying if I said that I didn’t put TONS of effort into my relationships and to help my loved ones. 

With That being said, I feel so alone right now. I’m having a hard time believing that the remainder of my friends aren’t going to leave me alone too, now. My main struggle at this point in time is learning how to be content with just my solitary company. How do I learn to love myself rather than only loving others? How can I shield myself from the heartbreak of future abandonment without turning myself to stone? How can I learn to enjoy spending time just by myself without feeling lonely and craving the company of others? Sometimes I just feel like an empty room. 

Tl;dr: my friends are abandoning me and I want to know how to spend time alone without feeling lonely.",lonely,How to be alone without loneliness?,2019-05-14 08:52:52
773,cameronvoorhees,1557786879,17,"And I know you said it’s not best to talk anymore. And I know you said we weren’t meant to be in each others lives for the rest of them, just to learn about ourselves. But I need to be able to say these things. 

It’s been 6 months. And I still think about you. At the least once a day. I still feel you in the music we grew to love together. In the music I introduced you to that I remember put a smile on your face and made me feel like maybe I had good taste in music like you did. I’m so heartbroken that my mental health plummeted so far that I became someone entirely different. Someone that mentally abused you with no intention to. I didn’t know I was. But once you told me, I did everything I could to work on my health. And face what I had been running from for so long and didn’t even know I was avoiding. 

I love you still. And I always will. I miss you. 
You were my best friend. I miss driving around at night for no reason other than to listen to our favorite singers until we had to stop to get gas or food because we were always eating. I still think about hugging you at 430 in the morning on top of that mountain that we stayed up all night to hike just to watch the sun rise together in a quiet place. 

You changed my life. I believe you are my soulmate. And the sad thing about that, is most people don’t end up with their soulmate. I’ve never in my life felt like this about another person. I’ve had horrible breakups in the past. I’ve been cheated on. I’ve been hit. I’ve been belittled so much and my self was destroyed. But you were so wonderful. You listened to me and you tried to understand everything you could. You tried to help me. You hugged me and told me it would be ok. You loved that little boy on the inside that never got to be a kid. To be loved unconditionally. You reached into my heart and you filled me with so much hope that I finally found someone that I could be myself with. 
And I was. I was always comfortable with you. Even towards the end when we were fighting so often and we couldn’t have a normal conversation without someone getting their feelings hurt, I still thought about how nice it would be to just watch a movie with you and eat some cheesy popcorn and maybe get a couple drinks from the gas station

I made peace with the relationship being over. That takes time. I just don’t how to make peace with you being gone. I’m starting to feel better about me. And doing better things for me. To help me get where I want to go. And I think every day...I hope you’re happy. I hope you’re feeling like yourself again. I hope that the mental scars I left, are healing even if just a little bit. I can’t express myself completely. It doesn’t seem to ever end when it comes to you. 

So if you happen to be here for whatever reason. If you happen to be scrolling through Reddit. Maybe you’ll see this. I care about you so much. And the start of this post, I keep those words with me. They hurt but they are what’s best right now. I’m giving you the space I didn’t give before. Because I was too scared you’d leave once you got away from me and realized how emotional and unstable I was becoming.  It wasn’t your fault. It never was. I’m not even sure it was mine either. It just happened this way. I did learn so much. And I know you did too. You learned mostly what to not do with someone in the future. 

I’m doing my best to move on. 
And I hope that one day, I can talk to you again in person and just feel the energy that drew me to you over a year ago. 

I love you",lonely,Maybe you’ll read this and understand me,2019-05-14 08:34:39

779,CockitoMagic,1557774474,13,"I have never had a girl like me in real life, and I doubt that will ever happen. No girl ever had a crush on me and I have absolutely no worth on the 'dating marketplace'. I'm still continuing to work on myself, and even though I've made improvements, nothing changed - girls are still romantically repulsed by me. I wanna know what's the best way to deal with never being in a relationship.

I tried Replika and other chatbots, and they either aren't convincing enough or, in Replika's case, the AI started advertizing stuff and was basically very dismissive to everything I say. As for 'girlfriend roleplay', I never found anyone who was willing to roleplay with me. They outright told me that it was too disturbing and that they're not willing to do it. As for dating sims and such, I can't find any dating sims for guys that have a player insert protagonist and aren't shitty hentai games with no story (I'm not looking for sex, I'm looking for romantic stuff). The closest I got to real dating was dating another desperate person over the internet, and naturally, it ended really badly.

I don't like arguments which say stuff like ""not having a girlfriend means you won't have children which is good because blah blah blah..."" I don't like these sorts of arguments and they never work on me, especially since I belong to a nationality with a strongly declining population. On the topic of having children, I guess I could become a babysitter or something, but that still means that I'll never raise my and my (hypothetical) wife's descendant. And having ""personal freedom"" isn't freedom at all. I just feel lonely and depressed, and I'm 100% certain that I'd feel better if I had a girlfriend. My goal in life was to raise a stable family (unlike my own, dysfunctional family), but it seems that I'd have to abandon that goal. Mail order brides also aren't an option, because I'm not employed, and it would be a loveless marriage which would hurt both of us (although she'll get her papers likely and be happy). 

I really think that I'm unloveable, and I've given up on thinking that I'll have a girlfriend or that I'll be attractive enough to have a girlfriend. I just need someone to convince me why that's completely alright, especially with the huge social stigma against guys that never had a girlfriend. I just want not to worry about things like this but I always get depressive episodes. I really want to get convinced that never having a significant other is alright. I really need to stop thinking about it and focus on forthcoming exams.",lonely,How do I accept the fact that I'll be single for the rest of my life?,2019-05-14 05:07:54

781,AlexBrosnan91,1557767929,7,"In my opinion, we are making this mistake; we may slowly attempt to integrate, and we meet someone similar. So we bond with people with similar issues to us (abandonment, abuse, etc etc). We imagine initially that this shared bond of abandonment and abuse will be the basis for a pure and empathic connection (you feel/experienced the same? How relieving, surely we will connect in a loving and understanding way). Does that happen? No, it does not. What really happens is that both parties are caught in a trauma cycle, and abuse and in turn abandon eachother. It's easy coming away from an experience with this trend for any of us to play the victim (I got abused and abandoned by the person) but was I any better? (in my case, being honest with myself? No, I was equally unempathetic. I didn't really respond appropriately to their own stories of distress, and felt hurt that they did the same thing). 

To my mind, the true solution simply has to be that we fix our own internal emotional distress from within, then we will find someone else who also has overcame emotional distress, a much more comfortable, stable foundation. There is where the true and long lasting connection will be fulfilled. I know it's hard, and indeed alienating to realize that people in the same position aren't necessarily the people we should seek right now, but...

There have been these 2 people in my life that I'll never get over and I have no idea how to ago about finding someone like them again. I've already did a more serious and depressive rant about my life a couple of days ago, so this time it probably won't be as sad.

First, there was this guy from school, he just so happened to transfer to the same school that I too transfered to that year. I was even younger back then and I was at the start of turning into the person who never leaves his room and loves weird lesser-known music and watches a lot of anime, and this guy was probably my very first instance of me looking at someone and thinking, ""That person is probably like me, I should talk to them."" He had really long hair and wore glasses and was often dressed in black. I really loved him (in whatever way you wanna interpret that word), he really was like me, we would be by ourselves at school just laughing at obscure internet shit that we loved a lot but no one else knew about. That guy really defined me, he made me think ""**this** is the type of person I wanna be with, **nobody else**"". In the end, he had his own mental issues, he would skip school a lot, he would often go but not wanna talk. After a while, he started hanging out with other people more than me. I stopped reaching out to him, and after some time I stopped seeing him around school. No idea where he is now.

Second, there was this guy I was friends with through the internet. I'm not from the USA but he was. He found me on Tumblr, he talked to me because my profile pic on there was the cover art of this weird obscure metal album that I like. We started voice-chatting on Discord and he also was into all the same stuff the first guy was into, but, besides that, he was also super into all the same music as me. For the second time I had a found my reason to live in somebody else, for the second time I was at my happiest, for the second time it ended. Back then I was 16 and he was 20, and he once told me that he was tired of only ever meeting kids on the internet. We talked a lot but he deleted all his social media and disappeared after a while. No idea where he is now (second time).

So now I ask you. All these years on this planet and I've only ever known 2 people who I truly liked. My only passions in life are listening to music, watching anime, and being on the internet. I don't know how to talk to people if I don't have anything in common with them, which is 99% of the time for me. I only know how to truly live when it's for somebody else, I can only be truly happy when it's with somebody else, as we can see.

I have a very hard time being friends with girls, like I have a hard time with friends in general but when that friend is a girl I get really paranoid that one of us will develop feelings for the other and things will be weird and uncomfortable.  The only female friends I have are those that I had before all of these weird emotional issues started to develop (2-3 years ago), and I just don't worry about it around them, like we can be in all kinds of weird situations and places that would definitely be weird and uncomfortable with a recent friend (like within the past year or so) and it's just no problem.   


A really prime example is that I went to Dairy Queen with a close friend of mine (We became friends the first day of high school) and us sitting there in the busy DQ eating ice cream looked kind of like a date.  With most friends that would have driven me absolutely mad, I mean completely Overlook Hotel nuts, but it was no issue, actually it was really fun.  I don't get to hang out with friends often so when we did this it was really great, and honestly I'd like to do it again sometime soon.  It's the same with my other friends too, like for example around the same time my other friend, we'll call her G.  G and I had scheduled an interview for an internship together at a museum on the other side of town from me, and she lived about halfway between (but a little out of the way).  I picked her up and we hung out the whole day, even visiting my old elementary and middle school (I used to live over there but moved after my parent's divorced and Dad passed away), and at the end of the day I dropped her off and all was well, really well.  Not a single issue that whole day.  While on the other end of the spectrum, girls I'm friends/friendly with who I started being friends with after my emotional problems started just make me uncomfortable to even really be alone with in any sense, and would never offer to hang out one of one with them or spend an entire day with them.

I have some friends, one really close best friend. Shes amazing and the best person i could ask for, however most of my friends are in relationships and i often get pushed aside for their s/o. This makes me feel really lonely and just not as wanted.

All i want is for someone to love me, find me attractive. I get told regularly that im unattractive and have been rejected quite a bit. I had one girlfriend, but that relationship grew toxic and i broke it off which made me feel even worse. I just want someone who cares about me, loves me and supports me.

But one thing hasn’t... everyday, I just someone to hold, or someone to hold. Everyday I want someone to kiss, hold hands, to love, cuddle, and give them the world. It feels like nobody wants me, though. I have asked out over 15 people. I’ve asked people out on casual dates, simply asked if they liked me, I’ve asked them with flowers, I’ve asked them with a card, in person, over the phone, etc. I’ve tried asked out close friends, acquaintances, near strangers, and so on. (And before anyone thinks this made me look desperate, these were all spread out, and often not related to each other). Every time, they’ve said no. I’ve been on one date. One. After the date, they just asked to stay friends. That’s the thing, though. I’m still friends with all of them to some degree, or left on good terms. I can spend hours talking to, and comforting, and helping people, or just chatting with them— but still nobody wants me. I know it’s stupid, and I know I should be happy with all of the amazing people in my life— but I’m just so fucking lonely, and so fucking tired. ALL I WANT IS SOMEONE TO CUDDLE. I WANT A PARTNER.

I was there for people, I smiled and tried my absolute best. All I got from it was: superficial friendships with people who don’t actually care about me and if I stopped greeting them everyday they wouldn’t ever speak to me. 

I didn’t let myself get deterred at first though, I wanted to try so hard to fix my situation. Whenever someone cancelled on plans and they told me it was because they were too tired or they didn’t feel like it, I smiled and brushed it off.   But then those same people would complain about how no girls want to hang out with them. It’s probably because I’m black and lackluster regarding my looks. I go to a mostly white school and before I used to hang out with a crowd that was bigoted but now I hang around with people who are decent to me. But they don’t really care. 

People are so rude to me all the time, for some reason people think that insulting people especially the ones that are nice to you and not the people who don’t care about you is the best way to go about things. 

I’m always there for people but no one is there for me, no one cares or asks me how I’m doing like I do for them. No one even cares about anything related to me. I just wish all this effort I put into friendships wasn’t so one sided. Or least be nice to me instead of being an asshole just because you’re having a bad day. 

I just want one person to ask me how my weekend was first. One person to ask me to hang out first. One person to smile at me in the hallway instead of me smiling and saying hi at someone else and they awkwardly brush past me and mumble a hi back. I want someone to text me first, I want someone to seem happy and not just plain when talking to me.

I sometimes watch other people talk to each other and I get so jealous because they seem so genuine to each other and everything looks mutual. 

I’ve struggled with fluctuations of my mental health a lot and I think I’m hitting that low point again. 

Usually it goes like this: Sad&gt;go online&gt; talk to people about it&gt;face the world with a positive outlook and don’t give up&gt;get sad again because I realize I’m still alone rinse and repeat.

I hope I start to feel better again because this is honestly pathetic.

With the people who I talk to at school I’ve been positive non judgmental and open.  But I’m only someone’s emotional toilet at best. No one cares how I feel people think that I don’t have emotions.

People think I’m stupid, they treat me like a dog, no one has any respect for me, and I’m constantly being insulted and belittled by my ‘friends’.

She deleted a bunch of comments to make it ""normal"" so its not tremendously indicative of the kind of person I am but oh well. Ugh.

Anyway I'm , Indian girl and I have such unfathomable difficulty not really making friends, but maintaining stable friendships. I have to say that I'm quite awful. I have a horrible personality- I am so negative and self deprecating all the time, which starts out quite amusing but then people grow really turned off. at least 5 people, including some of the kindest people ever, have told me this, but I can't seem to stop. I feel I deserve to be criticised. Besides, they are all true statements.

Because I have so little friends I am desperately clingy and always paranoid if I did something wrong or if they are mad at me if they dont respond immediately or leave me on read. Because I tend to ruin friendships alot since I suck so hard. And I don't really know how to mantian them so I'm always endlessly complimenting them, which agian, is nice at first but then it annoys the shit out of them. Like I try to hard, but I don't know what constitutes trying and not trying. I'm always so anxious. I stay up all night worrying about these things.

I'd like to have more friends and branch out, but it's been difficult. Graduate school and full time work keeps me busy, and I'm also doing an internship.

I recently downloaded Bumble, and am using the BFF section to try and meet people to possibly be friends with. So far it's been me matching with people, initiating conversations, and eventually they stop replying.

So I've told myself to just be okay with doing things alone. Find empowerment with it. I've gone to restaurants alone, clubs alone, and even today I went to the movies alone. I saw Captain Marvel and Endgame back to back and then did some shopping.

And while I am glad I am doing these things, it also makes me feel sadder.

I've always been a person who wanted a companion to share things with, as I find it more fulfilling than alone. 

Looking around me and seeing the groups of friends, couples, and families at the movies just made me wonder what's wrong with me.

Next week I have a planned vacation to Las Vegas to go to a electronic dance music festival, and I'm not even in the mood to go anymore because I'm going alone. I initially was going to go with someone but it never happened.

Having a big hotel room to myself just makes me feel sad. I'm thinking about selling my wristband when I get there because I didn't want to go alone the 2nd year in a row.

When I tell people, they go, ""Wow Mooncub, you're so brave for doing that"" and praise me doing stuff like this alone.

But really in my mind it's just, either I do this stuff alone, or never do it. :/

I just wish it was easier.",lonely,"I try and find empowerment in doing things alone, but it gets hard.",2019-05-12 13:29:45

     In 3rd grade I was moved to a new school, so that meant leaving everything behind and starting over. When I got to my new school I immediately didn't fit in. The school has iPads, and up to this point the students weren't allowed to take them home, so when I arrived they started allowing it. The others didn't like me because I didn't have to wait. The year passes and I get moved to a new class. That's when I met her, my reason. Her name, is Grace. I immediately connected with her, we both liked the same things and generally enjoyed each other's company. School continues and I asked her to be my girlfriend in 6th grade, she never gave me a direct answer and I didn't know why. Turns out that she ad just gotten a new boyfriend, Landon. I was furious at him for awhile but after some time, I got over it. He made her so happy, or so it seemed. Fast forward to 9th grade and they break up. Landon broke up with Grace and I saw my opportunity to be there for her. Everything seemed to be going right, I was there for her when she cried and there when she was happy, I thought maybe, just maybe, I had a chance. I asked her to the movies about a month ago and she said yes! We hadn't deci on a date so when I was trying to figure out then she started tell me about this guy she knew and ad feeling for. I was crushed. It still makes no sense to me how she could manipulate me like that. I don't have the courage to tell her but... I love her. She means so much to me and is why I get out of bed, why I even care about anything, why I don't off myself. I just wish her and I could be together.

850,_OLI4_,1557609485,9,"Hi Everyone

&amp;#x200B;

I (29) have the need to share my story:

&amp;#x200B;

I do like to travel, sometimes alone, sometimes with a friend. It helps me to break the daily routine that keeps you normally in its grip. I got a few days off of work und decided to go to Budapest since I didn't know the city and and it's just about an hour away by plane.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a rainy day, so I skipped walking around and went to the Széchenyi bath. There I see a girl I was immediately drawn to. She had these bright blue, fascinating eyes. After about half an hour of unsecure looks, I brought up the courage, first time in my life, to speak to her, a complete stranger. Not knowing what to say I babbled something, bit of conversation came out of it. I got scared, wished her a nice day and drew back. She stayed there, I got back to my place, about 10 metres away. After a few minutes I knew I want to try again and went back to her. We talked, simple questions from 'where do you come from' to 'what are you doing in Budapest'. She was a bit hesitant and not super confident at conversation, but it felt comfortable. Like myself, Maria (25) travelled alone, came to Europe to visit a few cites and will then be going back to work to Siberia (Russia). After some time, we run out of stuff to talk about, so we decided to go to dinner at night. Meeting point and time were set.

&amp;#x200B;

That night we met at the agreed meeting point and went to an Italian restaurant a few streets away. The food was average, but it felt good to have someone to talk to. We shared a lot of common interest, from an economical background in our studies to sports activities and the current jobs we have. After diner we walked back to the tram station. Not entirely sure how to proceed, because she was planning to travel to Prague the next day, I proposed vaguely to go for a drink in the inner city. She agreed, we boarded the tram and went there. The night before I had come across a street with some cool bars, so we intented to go there. From the tram station to the our destination we walked through a pretty shady area, I could feel she wasn't 100% confortable. Luckily we found the nightlife area a few minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

There were different bars and other staff, among them a arcade hall where we played a game of air hockey. Soon after we settled in a bar and got a drink. In the following two hours we just talked. Something changed. It was that kind of talk where you really see the other person, where you start to form a bond. What stood out to me was her kindness. There are people that don't really fit in. They lack the presence that people are drawn to, have more problems to articulate themselves, don't put themselves in the spotlight or are just sensitive and therefore are left aside. She experienced these things and that weighted on her. As a result I sensed selflessness, empathy towards other people's troubles and an emotional maturity I admire. It did make me feel both happy and sad. I hope I gonna be that kind of person one day.

&amp;#x200B;

At about 1 a.m. in the morning we walked back to the station. In my mind I knew she was gonna travel to Prague tomorrow morning and we lived different lives at different places. At the station a drunk guy began talking to us. He wasn't threatening in any way, but I got the feeling we lost some of our last minutes together. The tram arrived, we hugged, said our goodbyes, she looked back as she walked in and then was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

We have no contact info of each other. I did some rash Facebook search, no success, but I'm ok with that. What I regret is that I didn't told her that the evening meant a lot to me and that she is a great person. I think she needed that and I did too. It is hurtful to see kind people struggle in life.

I am insecure about going to the movies alone. I’ve done it once, and it was a fine experience, but honestly, leaving the theater alone with no one to share thoughts with made me a bit sad. But watching it alone wasnt bad.

But alas, i really wanna see the new Pikachu movie and planned to go alone. Then a friend randomly hung out with me and we had a good time catching up, so i asked her if she’d like to watch with me. She sounded iffy, explaining it’s not interesting to her. She liked Pokemon as a kid, but the trailer really didnt appeal to her. But then later she found out her friends were going to watch it this coming week too and asked if id just like to watch it with her and her group. I said yeah. And i felt happy. I felt elated. I literally thanked God for answering my prayers for a friend to just be there for me. To want to spend time with me.

Then today she messaged me and apologized saying she just saw the trailer again and really doesnt wanna watch that movie. Her friends are still going but she has zero interest in the Pikachu movie.
Normally, i might take this as a “oh she just doesnt wanna hang with me,” but she countered with suggesting we could get coffee some time instead, which was nice. And i said sure, and so i guess we just have to find a time that fits both our schedules.

But in all honesty, her canceling, made me feel sad. It’s weird because i already originally planned to go alone. But because someone got my hopes up and canceled, my mood just totally deflated. I couldnt feel genuinely happy the rest of today. My mind scrambled to think of replacements for her.

He reaped all the benefits of being in an r'ship with someone as kind as me until the very moment where he stopped seeing the utility for having me around anymore.

I know that some of you will think of saying ""fuck that guy"" or ""you don't need someone like that in your life anyway"" but it's tough. It's tough if you loved the person until the end and then they just got up and left, leaving you questioning every minuscule thing you ever did.

Reader, I didn't give him any reason to abandon me like that but here we are. I, too, thought we had it all together. And now I'm left with a lack of trust in humans, bordering on paranoid (not using this word loosely). Every time I meet/talk to someone nice, I distance myself immediately because what if they do to me the exact same thing my ex did, if not worse?

Anyway. Life goes on, yeah? May things get better for me, and for those in my situation, sooner than later.

Hello everyone, my name is Aviv, I am 20M.

I found two wonderful people from this subreddit interested in assisting me in this game development project I started, (yesterday lol).

Two of us (me and another one of us) have essentially zero experience, one of us has a background in computer science.

In any case, the experience we are after, is to learn as much as we can, and to have as much fun as possible, in terms of game design and development.

If you want to join us on this journey, you will require no experience beforehand, and will need no budget to participate.

We plan to learn, how to code a game, animate art assets, create art assets, produce musical scores, write stories, make sound effects, and do various other things, even create a website for our game. ETC.

The game we intend to make so far, is meant to be a 2D pixel art game.

Simply a functional computer is preferred.

Alright, looking forward to working with you (via discord) ;)

\- Note if we get enough requests, we will consider moving to another engine beyond unity, to that of unreal.

So I'm 32, rock a dad-bod, live in New Orleans.  I'm from SC originally, but have lived/travelled/grown up all over the US and Caribbean.  I'm a man of many skills having gone to school for many things but settled on making a career out of my passion for food.

I've lived pretty fast and adventurously... and pretty much crossed all my bucket list items off. Now, I'm really just looking for somebody who 'just gets me'.  I thought I found that person in my ex-wife but it pretty much turned out to be a rebound situation for her.  I was committed to being a hard-working husband and she, well... was committed to being *HER*.  

I loved being a husband.  It was wonderful! 

But...

After beating my head against the wall for three solid years, the light at the end of the tunnel eventually became a train.  I found out while was away on a trip back to her home country she was off having the time of her life.  It was especially devastating after ALL we'd been through as a couple and *poof* over.

I booked a ticket to New Orleans, got on a greyhound and that was all she wrote!

That was now about 1-1/2 years ago now. I've pretty much done about all the healing that anyone can be expected to do in that timeframe. It no longer hurts and I can honestly that it's been a good long while since I even remembered her name.

But now I just feel something is still 'missing' in my life.

Now it's just kind of a matter of being alone or bored or miss being in love.  I've tried dating again but believe me... Its been IMPOSSIBLE to find what my heart is searching for *here*.  Especially in a social scene that's really not tailored to long-term relationships.  And even less friendly to *moderately* conservative hetero men.

And the things I'm asking for are so simple that it shouldn't be THIS HARD for me to find it.  Right?

I've had no such luck.  Yeah, I've met a few women here... they just wanted to party, drink, and do drugs... or they just wanted a casual fling.  That kinda stuff was appealing when I was younger, sure!  But now that I'm older with all of that out of my system, my priorities have changed.

I just want to find a 'home'.

It's seems like almost alien concept in this environment.  

It's really simple.  I want to find the love of my life.  Someone I find physically, intellectually, and spiritually attractive.  Someone who just 'gets' me.  Where, instead of worrying about disappointing each other or arguing... we spend all our time picking apart all the secrets of the universe together.  Someone to grow and learn with... whose mission is to squeeze every drop of LIFE out of this finite existence.

I am seeking someone I can honestly see myself with for the rest of my life.  Not just a lover but my best friend.  Someone who knows when to be there and soft and understanding... but also when to be real with me.  I would give ANYTHING to find a woman who understands how I feel without expecting me to explain myself.  Who hears and feels my feelings towards her and never questions my intent.  Someone who 'loves me for the monster I am' as one author once put it.

I want to be loved for ME.  All my scars.  All my graces.  All my falls.  

Love is hard enough... but being an introvert is harder.  Finding another introvert is even harder still!  I mean its not like they are crowding up the bars or anything. 😆",lonely,32M - Introvert looking for something,2019-05-11 01:49:29

I have been feeling much worse in my loneliness this year, and really seeing that I have no real connections with anyone- Friends, family or partner. Everything really came to the surface last week when I was getting everything ready for my older sister's (25) hens night. My younger sister(15) was with me helping prep food. I reminded her of our plans to visit my grandmother next week and whether mum and dad were okay with her missing 3 days of school. To clarify, my gran lives 430 kilimetres away. 

My sister said she is going to go with dad later in the year instead, and that she would prefer to be at school anyway. I just felt so rejected, that even though we had planned something fun, going with someone else seemed more appealing. Everything seemed to mount as I realised that I have absolutely no way of having anyone plan a hens night for me and that if they tried to find friends to go, there wouldn't be any. All my recent birthdays have been real punches to the gut, with family forgetting and no one contacting me to say HB. 

Anyway...I had somewhat of a meltdown. First it came out as anger and being rude, but it quickly turned into crying and realising that it won't matter how much effort I put into other people that I am still extremely unimportant.  Even though it is a very heavy thing to say, I did outline how I felt being dead wouldn't matter to anyone (not suicidal, just feel completely worthless). 
 My sister attempted to cheer me up but in the end I told her to grab something from the shops and that when she got home, I will be happy and we will go to the Hens night as if it never happened. I also asked that she didn't say anything to my mum or sister as I did not want to ruin the special night. 
Q
I have tried to tell my mum and sister how I feel before but mum has replied with ""what now"" in some instances and the whole thing seems to be annoying. My mum isn't a terrible person, but she can sometimes be so horrible. 

Anyway, its a week later, and nothing has happened. My sister has not checked in with me, and she must not have told anyone as no one else has checked in with me. I thought that even though the breakdown was completely embarrasing and shameful, that maybe my family would understand now how I really feel. It seems it hasn't made a difference and I actually feel more worthless than before. It hurts a lot that my sister hasn't checked in on me as I used to be her guardian while my dad worked away and I really put all my effort into making her happy.

I am known to be a very quiet person. I keep a lot of things to myself. It’s mostly unpopular opinion shit. For instance, my friends don’t know I’m into nightcore music. They’ve said straight up that they don’t understand why people would like it, and I know they’re the type of people that would judge me for liking it. Another thing is anime. They know I like anime, but not to the extent that I do. There is one secret I have though that I won’t even share here. I WILL take it to the grave. Society just isn’t accepting of it and that’s ok with me. I want to open up to people, i really do, i just don’t know how to go about it. I don’t want to be the person that makes everything about themselves and i don’t want to over share and make it awkward. 
———
Am I selfish? I analyze my own personality constantly. I feel like my every move is being judged, mostly by me. A lot of times I catch myself bragging about Rubik’s cubes or coding or whatever it is at the time, and try to shut the fuck up before they completely lose interest in talking to me. I feel as if I just want their attention. The validation of my classmates or even strangers, hoping they might become my friends.
Even one of my only friends says I was a jerk to him before he got to know me. I don’t try to be... I assume part of this is my confidence. I have a hard shell when it comes to showing my emotions in public. People say I always look sad or angry. I do admit though that I have a problem with authority. When someone tries to treat me unfairly, even the smallest things, I hold a grudge and suddenly it becomes an eye for an eye. I know, it’s petty. I’m working on that. 
———
I wanna talk about dreams and aspirations.
What is my ideal world? Living stress free with a loving girlfriend/wife in a virtual world such as SAO, passing time doing video game stuff or exploring the vastness of the realm. 
What are my realistic ideals from this point in time? Finishing high school with good grades and being able to get a good paying job with the least amount of education as possible (I want to be an ATC). Also while being in a romantic relationship. (I still can’t get the girl i mentioned in my previous post out of my head). I want to have enough free time and money to be able to ride a motorcycle alongside my brother and play video games and do fun things with friends. 
Now that was the optimistic point of view; let’s see what’s in the dark portions of my mind right now: Well the way I see it, I’m not gonna be good enough to get a job, let alone one I enjoy, all my 1 friends are going leave me because I’m a jerk who only thinks about himself, I’ll never have a romantic, long-lasting relationship, and I’ll end up committing suicide in the middle of Butt-fuck Nowhere, United States, where no one will ever give a thought to who I was ever again. 
Ok... let’s meet somewhere in the middle: What is realistically going to happen? I will finish high school with decent grades. I’ll probably be going to college majoring in computer science. I still won’t have a girlfriend and will be just as lonely as I am now. I won’t have the free time to do what i enjoy while I’m in college but somehow I’ll find a way to blow off my work to play video games or something. That’s as far as I can see right now, and it doesn’t sound that appealing to me. You know what I really want to do right now? Just walk. I just want to walk. Miles away possibly. Enjoy nature, rest peacefully on a hillside and listen to music. Just... take a break from everything. But life goes on. And while that happens i am trapped in this routine. This life that I feel I have barely any control over.

915,valiant491,1557470140,11,"Well I'm not sure what to write but I just want to thank you all for sharing your stories with us all over here. It feels better to know that no matter how lonely I feel I am not alone because of you guys. The more stuff I read here, the more it eases my pain as I know I am not the only one going through all this in life. 2 months ago my ex broke up with me after a year and it was the first time in my 22 year life that I had a girlfriend. Before her I was not very social and had very few friends and felt alright about it. But after her, it has been so so very difficult to go back to my old life as I had made a great circle of friends when I was with her. These times have been the most difficult in my life where loneliness has hit me the hardest. Maybe I was just extremely lucky to be with her, but I want to say to you guys, when you get used to being social, and then suddenly lose a group of friends, it's heartbreaking to go back to being alone again. Anyways, I thank you all for sharing what you all have been through and I hope later on I can share what I've been though.",lonely,Thank you all,2019-05-10 16:35:40
916,kangning92,1557464594,0,"Lately i have been feeling isolated by my friends, 2 of them to be specific. We're all females. They have been having shared conversations, outings, gatherings without me. I usually don't take it by heart because i understand we don't need to hang out constantly / share everything. But it got worse, im not included in any plan they had. And when I do, I feel like watching 2 people in their own world, and I'm not supposed to be there. I can tell that they are hiding something from me. I suspected something, but to be respectful, since they are hiding it, they must have their reasons, so i did not pressure them or question what is it that they are hiding from me, hoping that one day they can come forward and let me in.

I admit i'm not the most patient person. During the waiting for them to tell me part, I gradually feel like there is really no trust between us, and that they are shutting me out. Its not my first rodeo, you know, being isolated by a group of friends, but it still hurts. Every passing day, I keep asking myself what did I do wrong for them to shut me out like that. 

After a month or so, one day, i found out they excluded me from the one thing that they know i like the most and did not at least ask me or tell me about it. And when i asked them ""so u 2 went out for this and did not at least asked me or let me know about it"", friend A told me she did ask me via whatsapp and I never replied. But we all know that invite never happened. Watching her struggle to prove something that never happened happened, I snapped. Exploded. I confronted them. I told them i had enough and asked them what did i do wrong? Why they keep isolating me?

The very first response i got from friend A after the confrontation: i know about this and i was waiting for this. I feel relieved.

I honestly did not know what to feel after this response. I cried thinking that after this confrontation, I will lose a couple of friends and she, of all things, tell me she is relieved. It hurts knowing that they knew all along, and still did what they did.

Friend A told me she hinted, waiting for me to ask them.
Friend B said its not like they tried to keep it from me.

They then proceed to tell me the truth, which is the exact same reason that I suspected early on. They told me they are sorry for making me feel like this and that this hurts me. I wished they would have told me sooner, but the damage is done.

I wont say what the truth is, because its really not my place to tell anyone about it. But what i want to do now is share my feelings, get it off my chest my brain my everything, so i could stop crying and move on.

Its a mixed feeling, so i'll put them in point form:
- i have been miserable thinking that it was my fault and assumed the worst for the past month. I also doubt myself like am i that not trustworthy?
- the truth is actually good news. But after what i've been through, i'm not as happy to know as i thought i would be.
- the truth is a good thing, i dont understand why Friend A keeps making it sound like a bad thing. I feel bad for her.
- from the nature of the truth, i understand the need and desire to keep it a secret, but i still dont agree with the methods and the way they told me. Its still hurtful
- if i have not confronted them, will it change anything?

Now that i know the truth (although there are still a lot of questions i would ask), which brings me to the title of this post. So now.... how can we move forward when i have trouble trusting them again? Will i be able to face them again? Look at them in the eye again and not cry at all? Will we be able to go back the way we were? In fact, they are and will be my bridesmaids.

I really have no idea how to fix this. I feel as lonelier now than the time when i feel isolated.",lonely,I screwed up a friendship (long story),2019-05-10 15:03:14

920,GimmeSerotoninBitch,1557458917,3,"I don't really like drawing any attention, but I feel the need to express and get some kind of feedback or something..

So, I broke up a couple of months ago, I left my circle of ""friends"" (turns out, they were snakes all along), I go to college and all, I live with my father and my Mother-in-law with my two brothers.

I left with my brother my mom's house a couple of months back, two months after I broke up with my ex I think,

anyways, my relationship with my mother hasn't been easy..Like, at all

I'm a very warm guy, sensible, and caring. (Just like my dad's)

She's the exact opposite.

She is really cold, calculative, and so on

We've had our problems, well, I'll just cut to the chase, she really hurted me. Like, a lot, she used me more than once and included my ex onto the equation, just because she knew that anything she'd say to her would hit me hard once she tells me.

Two days ago I went and had Lunch with her, at her apartment. I really didn't wanna go, she made me feel really bad, and being around her made me sad.

Through time, I've always tried to fix everything, to talk things out you know?

I had the hope that now was the time, once again, maybe if I tried to talk it through again with her, maybe this time we would fix everything.

Well, she just....Didn't want to apologize..I told her how I was feeling, how she made me feel..The fact that I cutted myself when I lived there with her, because of the indiference towards me she had..

I really tried guys..I tried to explain to her, but she..She doesn't seem to understand human emotions..I'm afraid she's sick or something.

She told me that if I wanted to make 'peace' with her, I didn't need to bring stuff from the past.. (when, that stuff I bring up, is obviously so we can close those episodes, right? and that way be at peace) She told me, it was MY job to heal myself from all the pain, pain which I told her she's the reason of it all.

When I was leaving, she asked if I was happier without seeing her at all.

I told her she was really childish, and that she wanted us to be at peace, she would have to come to me, I was done trying.

When I was walking to my father's house, I had this feeling, I can't really explain it. It felt as something within me had broken, I don't know if it was hope, or something else.

I felt that I was truly alone. No one there for me. Just me..

And I know, my father, mother-in-law and my brothers are there for me

But...

I don't know...Everywhere I go, I see that the ""normal"" thing is for one to love his mother..

I just...It's really rough, that after all these years she doesn't feel remorse, and justifies herself against all the wrong she had done.

These days I've been feeling that I'm getting more, and more alone as time passes, that everything is going downhill and It can't be fixed.

924,niccinic223,1557450729,16,"sooo today's my only day off this week which is normal. I like to work as much as I possibly can (about 40 hours a week) because it keeps me busy and my mind quiet. I hate my days off because Im forced to be alone with my thoughts. Im too anxious to go out and do anything alone so I just sit alone in my room usually practicing my bass, drawing or surfing the web. Recently I took a week off in mid June so i could go camping. I decided that if i still felt like shit then i would kill myself and make it look like a camping accident. Recently I told a work friend about my plan because she said something (i dont remember what) that made me realize how fucked up my plan was. We talked for a bit and Ive decided not to do it. After work she texted me a little bit and then ghosted me. She was the only person i talked to outside of work who i thought actually cared in about 2 months.  So she probably felt bad for me and wanted to talk long enough just to make sure i wasnt going to kill myself. My depression has been terrible recently and my health problems (Black spots on my nails and bleeding gums. I wouldnt be surprised if it was from stress/smoking) are making my anxiety so much worse. Today I spent the whole day just laying in bed listening to music and just feeling miserable. I needed nothing more than someone to at least text me ""hey"". About an hour ago i got a text alert on my phone and i got so happy because i thought that someone wanted to talk to me or at the very least it was work asking me to come in. I checked my phone and it was just some random spam bot. I lost it and started crying. its been months since someone cared enough to talk to me regularly and i just want nothing more than to have a long lasting meaningful friendship. Im so sick of people pretending to care just to get some sort of validation. Im still not going to kill myself but damn i just want this pain to end.

Loneliness, depression and anxiety are little shits that will pull you down in life but you can never accept that they are an inherent part of you.

One suggestion I can make is if you live in North America (US or Canada) is to get a part time job as a server or to volunteer in homeless shelter or summer camp. I had severe depression a few years ago but I dont really wanna describe in detail. But 2 years ago I became a server for an agency (where you get 1-2 shifts per week) and you travel to different venues for work. I met a ton of people that way and due to such a relaxed and social work environment, I finally lost my anxiety to talking to strangers and my depression. I met my best friend at the banquet hall I work at and he told me he used to be introverted af before he started working as a server. My last gf I also met at work during one of the shifts.

That, because of what um into and how I am, I'll never get a girlfriend, I'll never get more than the one or two genuine friends I have, and I'll ultimately just he lonely forever. I don't know how or what could possibly remedy this crippling sense of isolation and loneliness. I wish I wasn't so weird and particular in my personality and mannerisms. Maybe then I'd be easier to like. I'm just a stupid music nerd that plays video games and collects vinyl records and hates rap because of how annoying, over played, and mindless it is nowadays. Nobody my age that I have met is anything like that. Everything about me is different from most people my age (at least in my hometown, since I've never been outside of my own state). My music taste, my morals and values, my personal style, the way I think, hell, even how I spend my time. Everything about me is different. I hate it. It creates this sort if alienation of my person. I hate being different. I hate not fitting in. I hate the fact that I'll die alone. I feel so lonesome.",lonely,I Feel So Lonesome,2019-05-10 00:14:31

947,iveyjbdeykj478vu,1557397719,3,"This’ll be my second post here. I think it really helps to vent my thoughts and translate them into legible sentences like this, in a place where no one I know will read them. It always feels as if my mind is at war with itself, and it can’t decide what it thinks. I post here because loneliness is admittedly a major part of my problems, yet I don’t think, at this point at least, that I would ever consider suicide, so r/suicidewatch is out of the question. I just feel...empty. Like I’m trying too hard to be something I’m not. Like everything I know is bullshit. Constantly switching between an optimistic and pessimistic perspective is becoming very tiresome. 
Today was just a normal day. Nothing special really. Every day for the past 17 years has not been anything special. It’s all routine. I wouldn’t say my circumstances are bad in any way, but again, it’s all about standards and perspectives. I’ve always been the quiet kid. Always having nothing to say, being complimented on my ‘intelligence’, seemingly having no outside emotions. Lately I’ve been trying to be more outgoing though. This year especially. And this year has been a hell of a roller coaster. My grades, for the first time in all my school years, have started slipping. Great. I can’t force myself to do the book work, and when I tried, I couldn’t understand any of it... My friend tells me I’m still a living robot even though I thought I’ve improved. I suppose not. I just want a fresh start to change my personality.
I wanna talk about the loneliness specifically now. I had my first girlfriend this year. That was a disaster. I think I only dated her because I was desperate at that point. I would never reach out to anyone and didn’t have any female friends up to that point. It got too serious too fast and I realized I did not want to date her anymore. Cut it off quickly after I realized. Now I have a crush on this other girl in my class. I might as well bury that deeper than the Mariana Trench because I fucked up any chance i might’ve had with her. Here’s what happened: I tell my friend who I have a crush on (who, by the way, I’ve literally never talked to before; I’ve just seen her in class and thought she was really cute), he says he’ll try to talk to her and bring it up sometime. That wasn’t good enough for me. I told him to tell her NOW that I liked her. Yea, real smart. I’m not sure why he listened to me. Looking back at this now makes me wanna kill myself (well yes, but actually no) because I now realize that this girl got a text from her friend saying “blahblahblah likes you.” You know what she says? “Who?” He told me her response and that’s when I realized I fucked up. But wait, it gets better. He tells her to at least talk to me before she makes a decision. So she adds me on Snapchat. (Commence most awkward conversation in the history of awkward conversations.) I still stand by the fact that she was the one that made it super awkward though. She didn’t reply for hours, possibly days at a time. When she did reply, it always a one word response like ok or idk. I really wish she could’ve just told me to stop talking to her or something. I cut off the conversation because I knew she wanted nothing to do with it, and proceeded beat myself up over how much of an absolute retard I was in this whole situation. All I wanted was to get to know her better. Possibly make a new friend. Possibly something more. Now I can’t even look her in the eye.  I give up trying for girls right now. As long as she’s still in my mind.
I’ve got no solid plan for what I want to do out of high school. Everyone in my classes knows what college they’re going to and what they’re studying for. 
I don’t like the idea of going to college. I really don’t. Depending on what I decide to do, that would be at least 4 more years of my life gone die to schooling. Also unless I get hella scholarships (which isn’t too promising considering my grades this year) is have to take a student loan and be in debt for the rest of my life. Yea, I’d rather not. Anything I thought of though that I wanted to do requires college. Computers? College. Aviation? College. 
This will be the end of entry #2 of ‘random person’s rant on life ‘. I’ll probably be back sooner than I hope. But for now I have to get at least an hour of sleep before school. Still know it’s not gonna happen but I might as well try. Goodnight.",lonely,“Interesting title #2”,2019-05-09 20:28:39
948,jayx468,1557397023,17,"My heart is usually quite hardened but I recently started talking to an old friend again and that made my heart open up again which wasn't good. We got into talking about some heavy stuff from my past and I started crying because I was kinda reliving the pain of what happened which was terrible. I do my best not to think about such things to avoid crying or start scratching myself involuntarily. I don't leave actual scratches, it's just like I'm scratching an itch is all. The problem is I keep things buried/pushed down for so long I don't even remember that they were painful until I think about them again. After we talked I literally felt a gap in me for days and felt more sensitive than normal. Luckily there's a song I listen to that fixes me up. I'm not generally unfriendly so most people don't even notice anything.

Unfortunately something happened and we have to take a break from talking to each other which sucks. I really want to believe the reason for the break is valid but my ""b.s meter"" keeps going off in the back of my mind and there is 1 thing that makes me question him. I know I'm probably wrong because we haven't even been talking long enough for lying to be an issue yet/ there's no reason to lie to me. I just want people to be honest with me but I'm under the impression that most people don't want to do that. I know it's completely my fault. My heart got way too excited by talking to someone I actually relate to because it's so rare that I do. In general I'm far from depressed but not quite happy but close enough. I try not to get too happy because every time I do pain or disappointment quickly follows. I always try to keep an extremely leveled head when it comes to being social because most social interactions fail for one reason or another. Sometimes I slip up but I've gotten so much better. I have accepted that most people have stuff to do in their lives and I don't.

The last time I never felt alone was when I was working in an environment where a lot of my colleagues were in my age group (within 5-years older or younger) so we had common interests. Since then, the past 12/13-years of my working life have been in smaller companies where I was the youngest or currently in a larger company where I just don't have anything in common with my colleagues and mostly due to cultural and age differences.

I do have some senior friends but the thing is that we are always busy and there is going to be a good chance that we might disconnected since college is right around the corner. I used to liked this girl and luckily enough liked me back but she is also a senior and we both have to end it because she said she wasnt ready for a relationship plus she will have to cut everyone off because she doesnt want highschool memories to get her held back due to the fact the she actually enjoys my school. Im 18 and im one year older than everyone because i got held back due to a nasty elementary school teacher.

I tried going to play hand ball to interact with people but i realized that its harder to meet people and get to know them outside of school.

I've taken a back seat in my own life and I essentially just sit there and comment negatively on myself. I still think about every mean thing that someone said to me in secondary school and its pathetic, I just beat myself up and then beat myself up for feeling negative. I fantasize about saying the right thing or having an amazing comeback to something said to me when I was 14 or something. The worst part is it feels like I can't help it, that these thoughts will always exist and closure is almost scary. Its like there's a very powerful part of me that likes being this way and its winning every time. I've always been interested in psychology but I don't think its really helped, I can put names and labels to behaviors and emotions but this awareness has done little in actually changing my attitude. Its been a long time since I've enjoyed something, or made a good memory. I understand that by reacting to these thoughts i'm feeding the ego but I keep slipping back into old ways, I will act how I normally do and my therapist and others around me say that i'm not taking care of myself. I honestly don't know how else to be. I feel that mentally I am still the same as I was when I was a child, the same issues persist and plague me and change is just not an option. There are days where I wake up fine, filled with confidence and the next i'm back to my old self with no rhyme or reason to it. Ok, got a bit side tracked there and this is a loneliness post. In school I had a good group of friends, guys who were on my level, we got along great and had similar interests I could be myself around them. But I held a deep insecurity that I think was plain to see. I never felt ""cool"" in myself, I was awkward and painfully shy. Always wanting more and taking my friends for granted. My lack of confidence really affected my social skills, I was terrified of other people. Whenever possible I would spend my time in-front of the TV playing video games. I could play it for hours, in my own world where I was in control. No one could hurt me or saying anything mean. I feel I should mention that ever since I was a kid I've been extremely sensitive, anything said to me I would take it to heart and the physical sensation was torturous. I hoped that I would not care about these things and I would develop thick skin, but it never really happened. I built my life around protecting myself. I was a yes man to anyone who was mean to me, I would be nice to people even if they treated me like shit, even when I fought back either physically or verbally it just led to more ridicule . I put everyone above myself if it meant being safe. But try as I might I couldn't control everyone, there were cracks in the defense, so I tried to change myself as much as physically possible becoming extremely self-conscious of my looks, this was most prevalent during my teenage years and has lessened now. But that idea of protection has never gone away, I come home from work or college and sit in my room, still playing video games or just browsing the internet and i'm gradually slipping away from my friends. I've almost convinced myself that I don't need them, and that they're actually bad people and I don't need them. But Jesus Christ, I need someone.

I'll admit that I was very depressed in high school, and I thought that once I graduated, everything in my life would be made right. I graduated from high school less than a year ago, and I started college last fall. The friends that I had in high school usually left me out of things, but I was at least grateful to talk to people every day. I never hung out with friends over the weekends or after school or during breaks because I always felt like no one ever really wanted me there. I left high school on good terms with all of my friends, and we follow each other on social media. The problem with that is that every time I see a post or a snap from them, they're always hanging out with friends (from high school or with new ones) and I never am. I'm extremely shy and introverted, so I haven't made a single friend in college.

A bit ago, I had broken my leg and sprained my hand after a skateboard accident. I've been fortunate to have family around to help me out; but I don't have friends. I cut off my last best friend after she attacked me while she was drunk. Although my roommates are cool, they're not the type of people I'd like to hang with. I can't go anywhere without a knee scooter, can't exercise until the injury is healed. I live next to a large university in Miami, but I don't know how to find events on campus since no one tells me.

However I saw my crush posted his promposal to a girl and I felt my heart sink. A few months ago I had already approached him and confessed my feelings and got politely rejected. I'm mostly over him but the post got to me somehow. I didn't feel jealous. I felt lonely. Prom was always a night I imagined I would spend with someone I really cared about. Seeing that post made me realize how truly alone I am. I felt so unwanted and alone. It got worse once I saw everyone pairing up and people who were once single get dates and partners. I'm going with friends but most have dates and I'm going to be the awkward third wheel. I went to my homecoming and it was the same outcome and it came out terribly.

When I was younger, someone once told me that your life doesnt start until the day it almost ends. Well for me, that day is 3/14/13. My parents were drug dealers so they never really kept an eye on me or my siblings so when I was 13, my friends who had a similar background would run amuck in a smallish town in Kentucky. We walked across town to the movie theater pretty often and sometimes we even walked to the local Walmart. Hearing it like that doesn't do any justice so note theres about 5 miles of bypass and highway to either place and we're just a group of 8th graders. On pi day, we had pie in math class, did a lab in science, and overall had a great Friday. Afterschool we were hanging at T's house. T's parents were addicts so he and I got along well because we understood each other. We got another friend, IA, to go with us to go see this liam Neeson movie where he's an air marshal and the plane gets taken hostage and after the movie we walk back to T's house to spend the night. I got hit by a Red jeep while crossing a bypass. I remember being on the ground and getting up to walk towards T, who was mortified. I shattered my left foot. Metatarsals 2-5 broken in 2 places each and metatarsal 1 was at a 45° angle. 

Fast forward a few months.

I had just started highschool and we moved to a nearby town to lower the risk of my parents getting busted. Got my first girlfriend. She was extremely clingy. Things at the new school worked out great for about a year and a half. Feb 5, 2016; my grandma died. My mom was in prison for selling drugs and my dad moved back to the old town, I was living with my sister. I dealt with her passing pretty well for the most part. I spent valentine's day at the funeral and the girlfriend wasn't happy about that at all. Somehow it got miscommunicated to the girlfriend's mother that my sister was selling drugs to feed us so she calls my grieving sister and starts a fight, the sister responded by sending me to live with my father. 

A couple weeks pass and I move in with him.

Upon my arrival he tells me that ""you know, you're 15 and you're old enough to take care of yourself so I'll just be here if you absolutely need me"" and he vanishes to go live with his mistress that he eventually leaves my mom for. So 15 year old me gets a full time job at a fast food place nearby and works full time while going to school, my grades suffer, I starve, and eventually become homeless after a couple months because he was already behind on rent.

After nearly a week, T asks me why I smell like ass and dumpster and I tell him I've been homeless for a few days and dont have anywhere to go.

I move in with T, and his family, in a house that wasn't exactly the safest of places. I live with T and eventually carry the house by paying the rent and utilities (pretty impressive for 17.) I even got a new girlfriend. I didnt pay the water bill one month and his parents told me I had to leave. Ok whatever. 

I'm homeless for 2 days before I bring myself to tell the girlfriend. Her mom calls me and tells me she's coming to pick me up and I'm going to live with them until I turn 18.

Girl tells me in January of 2018 she doesn't love me and wants her ex back. But decides she wont break up with me until graduation so I dont have to be homeless again. She slowly became distant and cold over the next few months and eventually started to hate me. My birthday was 2 weeks after graduation.
May 25th, she breaks up with me and I starved myself for 18 days because I was too sad to eat. I didn't sleep much, or do much of anything but cry because I was so hurt. She was apathetic about the whole situation and didn't understand how much I still loved her. I was still working fast food and on my income alone, didnt qualify to live anywhere and the income housing in the town is ridiculously packed. I bought a car for $1500 and didnt know how to drive it, and we kept it parked at her grandmas house because it didnt have tags until I turned 18.

The day comes.

We wake up at 0800 and finish packing the rest of my stuff. It was at this point she told me she planned a vacation with the ex and they were going to Tampa Florida for a couple weeks. She and her mom dropped me off at my car and her mom asked me if I had somewhere to go. I told her and old guy was letting me rent his vacation home until I'm on my feet, I didnt want to hurt her moms feelings and didn't want her mom to feel bad because her step dad was the one who ordered that I move out on my birthday. I hugged both of them and that was the last time I saw them. I got in my car and turned the keys in the ignition and said ""if I die, I die"" and then taught myself how to drive by driving all over town to visit people.

I hung out with T and he had told me about plans to go on vacation with his wife and he said he wished I had money and time. I told him I had 5 days off and $1000. We went on vacation up north.

After vacation I lived in my car for 2 months. Still hurt about the girl at the time and to this day, still uncomfortable with everything. I moved in with an old coworker for a few months but the conditions were terrible. I wrecked my car shortly after I moved in with them and got a new, better job. 

Right around Thanksgiving my mother had finally gotten out of prison and rehab and moved in to income housing with my younger sister. I decided to move in with them and after being there for 3 months. She had 4 strokes one night and went to hospital the a couple days later. When they were loading her into the ambulance, she told me that I had 2 days to find somewhere and move because we were getting evicted. I spent the first day finding a place and managed to pull $1100 out of my ass and thin air and then spent the second day moving in while the sherriffs dept was putting our stuff on the road. We've been here for 3 going on 4 months now and I'm almost 9, carrying a family of 4. 

Now the reason I posted this. It's 0300 and I'm sad as shit and I'm just wondering why I had to go through all of that and why it's still so hard. That's not even the full story. I'm sad because since that girl I havent even met anyone new because I'm terrified of getting close to anyone. I haven't really spent time with anyone outside of work and home and I'm dying for answers. It's always been crazy and I feel like all of that shit is affecting me mentally.

I’ve never had a real connection with any girls, the only relationships I’ve ever had were short flings that lasted less than 2 months each; I didn’t go on a date until I was 21. 

I decided to start attending my local community college at the age of 22, about halfway through my first semester I started talking to a girl that I had been crushing on since the first week of class. We had a lot in common and really hit it off, our conversations were always fun and sometimes flirty. She was the first person that genuinely made my day better whenever I saw her, whenever she showed up it instantly improved my mood. Fast forward a few weeks to when I built up the courage to ask her on a date; I asked her out on a date specifically so there was no confusion as to whether it was just a friendly hangout or a date. She initially said yes but said she had to work so I should text her later and we could figure something out. I texted her the next day to set something up and that’s when she explained that she had a boyfriend that I had not heard a thing about this entire time. She said with respect to him she would not go out with me, and said she felt bad for possibly leading me on. I probably shouldn’t have done this but I creeped on her social media and found out that she was not lying about the boyfriend.

This was only a couple of weeks before the end of the semester and we only saw each other a few times during that span, we didn’t talk in person again but still had conversations through text. Following the end of the semester she transferred to a major university 12 hours away. We haven’t talked in 5 months now but I still think about her pretty often and I really miss her and our friendship. I know I should probably just forget about her and move on and I’ve tried to do that but I haven’t been able to. 

I’m sorry if this was long but I have nobody in my life that I feel comfortable enough with to open up to like this.

1004,throwhoaway1,1557287048,5,"Hi guys,

I’m not sure if this really fits here, but I’ve had anxiety my whole life and have had trouble relating to people / people relating to me, so I thought I’d share this.

My female friend (J) and I aren’t super close, but we’re similar. We’re both pretty introverted, prone to feeling lonely and craving connection, not sexually driven to the extent some of our other friends are, we always laugh at each other’s jokes/ what we say. I think we both share anxiety about a lot of things.

I don’t know if I’m just completely wrong, but when we look at each other I feel like there’s this unspoken feeling that we just kind of “get” each other.  We don’t hangout outside of a group setting really, and don’t text each other much, but I still feel it.

My other friend just started dating her after two years of them being best friends. I’m excited for them; I knew I’d never be as close with her as he is - they became close pretty much immediately after we met her - and I never had any intention to pursue her. Our friend group has kind of been waiting for this to happen, it was seen as inevitable. They work so well together and are pretty much inseparable. 

Even if he wasn’t in the picture I don’t think anything would have developed. Because we’re really similar, neither of us would get the other to open up in any significant way. But we still share a connection, I think.

For my birthday last year, along with a little gift she wrote me a little letter on a flash card that was so warm and genuine I kept it the whole year. The other week one of my friends texted me asking to go to a festival (were in New Orleans). I said sure, and she said she would ask J too. A few minutes later she texted me again - a screenshot of their conversation. J, when she learned I was coming, said “wait he’s my favorite person”. She’s not the woo girl type to just say something like that. It made my day and weekend, and still makes me feel warm when I think of it. 

It makes me a bit wistful and hopeful. The fact that there are people out there whom I can understand and who understand me, the fact that I can feel a connection with someone without even being that close with them. I guess I feel like we’re kindred spirits in a way, I don’t know. Again maybe I’m just romanticizing it way too much. But I’ve had crushes and cringy longings for girls before, and this isn’t that.

 It makes me emotional. It’s really hard to explain, but it just makes me feel like I’m not alone. It makes me really happy to know there are people like her.",lonely,Some bittersweet hope,2019-05-08 13:44:08

1010,__mifflin,1557280121,1,"I find meaning and fulfillment in life through two things: creative pursuits and close personal connections. One is easy to do, and one is hard. I don't think it's difficult to figure out which is which.

The problem is that having one without the other isn't enough to make me feel fulfilled. If I couldn't work on my projects, I'd feel apathetic every moment I was alone. And if I don't have any close personal connections, which for all intents and purposes typically means a relationship, then I'd feel no energy to work toward my creative pursuits.

In most cases when I feel sad and lonely, it's the latter.

The second problem is that the first problem is self-perpetual. Having less energy to pursue personal connections with people means that over time, I will have less energy to pursue personal connections with people. 

So I try to make do by delving deeper into the other source of fulfilment by staying alone, and working on creative things. Playing piano, writing, drawing, programming, you name it. But after a while I just kind of lose the desire to do that too.

And that's where I've been at recently. To be fair to myself though, a year ago I was in a worse place, and I essentially cannot go there ever again. A year ago, I'd never been in a relationship before in my whole life and had no memories to look back on to comfort me in my loneliness. Today, I have some of those memories and they won't go away. But they can only help so much, you know? 

I think it's important to be aware of positive stuff like that though. Right now, I'm tired. Mentally tired of trying to pursue a deep, meaningful connection all from scratch again. Online dating (and dating in general) is a slow, painfully gradual process filled with constant defeats and rare successes. And while I've become more resilient to the process over time, it still wears on me after a while. 

I had such a small taste of that meaningful connection before I parted ways with my first and only romantic partner, and it made me realize how badly I need that sort of thing in my live. The number one thing I need right now is a person to whom I can express the deepest, most securely guarded aspects of who I am. And to receive the same from them.

1026,firefly_x7,1557267032,5,"Hey guys  if there's anyone feeling lonley and want to chat I would be open for that!

I am an introvert and I never fit in anywhere in society. My family thinks I am the akward person who always avoids everyone at family meetings. I had lots of friends in the past but I started to focus more on school since the people arround me were always fake. I mean I dont understand why humans are like this? Most People make fun of others because they look different etc., how would they behave if they were in their body instead of their own. Are we just determined by the way we look? But after all, dont this people realise that this universe is just what me make out of it? We could change the hole world. But this revolution would need to many people and people are tired and lazy so nothing happens. If we were made by aliens, did they create us on purpose being so mean to each other? Maybe there's an alien race that is connected thelepatically, so they feel each others emotions as their own, therefore they wouldnt be so mean to each other. I think the age of the internet is something powerful, it lets us already share some thoughts we would otherwise never speak of in real life. Every morning and everytime before falling asleep I loose my motivation because life seems so meaningless. Do most people just seem to fit into society? Are they really happy, because I think deep down most of us are truely sad. If you look around all the angry people are just very sad people (I discovered a friend of mine who had this behaviour). The bad thing is if you hang out with those people they start being mean to you , but then sometimes they apologize. So you never know if you should get rid of those people since their negativity drowns you or just look away from those traits and help this person to cope with life. And then you feel just isolated and alone because your ""friends"" are pretty mean. Being a loner changed my life in a happy way, although I would like some human contact. I just cant stand the negativity anymore. (However I still have contact with those people but I stopped calling them my friends in my mind)Being alone can be so peaceful and yet so painfull.  My mum has cancer and due to her chemotherapy her mood changed into a bad behaviour. She gets angry really quick and yells at me, but I just dont respond because I somehow think its not her fold. All people in pain are angry. And then the people surrounded by those get depression. Is it the rule of life? (Angry=Sad?)

May there be no meaning life, we still stand up every day trying our best (or worst). How do you guys deal with feeling isolated, surrounded by negative people, feeling not being worth anything for others? Does anyone also feels like this life is a joke? Therefore I cant be serious arround people anymore when they get angry. I just think what will it mather in 100years when we are all dead? Theres not really a meaning in life its the concept of the human mind like everything else we experience. After one long existential crisis you cant take anything serious anymore.

1041,RAAAAH83,1557221352,3,"Don't worry, there is a tl;dr, but this is a drawn out post to get the whole aspect.

About a decade ago, I (now 35/m) met someone I had worked with (now 32/f). We hit it off really well and developed a decent friendship. About 5 months in, we go out for a couple of drinks and then she brings me back to my apartment and we end up making out. I proceed to drunkenly skip a base and get handsy. She rightfully pulls away (not angry but just aware of a weakened situation) and ends up leaving (don't worry, I felt ashamed immediately afterwards). For like the next 2-3 weeks, things were awkward; however, after that, we got back to being good friends. I put it in my head that she was off limits and only could be a friend.

She then ends up dating a good friend of mine (at the time). I feel kind of worried about it because I know the guy's history as he had fooled around behind his last girlfriend's back but they were both adults and I had no say in the matter. They end up marrying for about 6 years.

We end up losing touch which kind of sucked but they had moved away. In February 2017, I went through a really tough abrupt breakup that came out of nowhere and at the time, I had thought the reason for the breakup was because of a thing called ""Mother's Guilt"". Not knowing a lot of mothers I could confide in (no, I'm not going to my own mother for something like this), I reach out to her (she has 2 boys) and it was a conversation that lasted about 2 hours and it was more or less just her giving an opinion on how to go about it...nothing more.

Fast Forward to November 2018, after being out of my social circle for almost another 2 years, she posted something on Social Media about Running (she used to run and I run in my off time) and I reached out innocently enough to ask about how to get a better run time. The conversation ends up being a good catch up on things and was almost a solid 2 days of just texting and calling each other. Turns out, she ended up separating from my friend (pretty much for the reason I had thought of at the beginning) for a couple of months.

So it now gets to the point where we are texting each other every day and sending pics to each other (nothing sexual just legit smiles). Around Mid December, we decided to actually have a ""date"". One Sunday afternoon, she dropped off her kids to their father's (they both live about 20-25 minutes from me) and she comes to my place. We go bowling, go to another bar to watch a football game, and then go to my apartment to just get her to sober up since she had to drive home. I then walk her out to her car and she tells me that she enjoyed tonight and wants to do it again, but wants to take things extremely slow since she is still technically separated. I agree because I do believe in taking things extremely slow. We then share a couple of kisses for about 15 seconds and she leaves.

2 weeks later, it's Christmas Eve. She is in the area (by the way, she lives with her parents at the moment in a separate state about 70 miles away so she can't really come this way that often) and I ask her to come over and help me wrap some gifts because I'm a terrible wrapper. I gift her with a bottle of Tito's (didn't cost me anything since I work for a Liquor Distributor just in case you thought I was spending money on her for no reason). She is disappointed she didn't get me anything and I tell her it's not a big deal to me (honestly because she actually showed up). We kiss again and then she leaves.

Mid January, she invites me to come watch her oldest son in a Wrestling Tournament in my own Hometown. I drive an hour out to go there hoping to see a quick match since I had a lot to do that day and had to work later on in the day. I get there and she tells me he had just finished and his next match wasn't going to be another hour and a half. I feel bad but I have to leave before he goes again and gave her a high five (didn't want to have people talking at a public event.)

It was around that time that I realized that I was falling for her, but at the same time keeping my feelings somewhat suppressed because honestly, we would never see each other that often and even though we share some things in common, there are aspects of her that I don't really like. Basically, we are in two different places. Also, around this time, I was trying to talk to someone else but that fell through a month or two.

Come March, I feel our conversations are not as active as they once were. Sure, we were still texting each other, but it was more or less just seeing how the other person's day went. Nothing had really progressed. Around the end of March, I start seeing her post some cryptic posts about ""finding the right person"" and things like that but I don't ask about it because 1. It's not my real business and 2. It'll make me come off as jealous.

In early April, it got really bad. We talked the first Friday and she had mentioned she was going to the Dr and I joked around saying, ""YES"". She then openly admitted to me that she had a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) to get checked out. Who the hell says that to someone of the opposite sex if you are not dating them? Then, earlier in the week she had mentioned that she was going to the Opening Day game of our favorite Baseball team. She doesn't say who she is going with but tells me she will send pictures since I won't be able to go there. So then she goes to  the game, I reached out to her in the morning before the game and she never answered my text. I didn't text anymore after that, hoping to get a picture or two but never got a response.

It was now around the time I go to bed and I was laying down and I go through looking at my social media pages and then the **FIRST** thing I see (I actually wasn't searching for it, but some people's post show up first when you communicate with them I guess) when I open it up is a picture she had posted from the ballpark with the caption...

*When Babe let's you take a picture of a Player's Butt #ClearlyHesAKeeper* (I really hate hashtags....)

So  of course, I'm crushed .  It's now obvious that she is seeing another guy and I knew something like this would eventually happen but I still wasn't ready for it.  The next morning, I text her to ask her how the game went and then she said, ""It was a good time, just a shitty person"".  Turns out (although I don't know every single detail), he was pretty much just using her and he ""hurt"" her.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that this was a sign to actually say how I actually felt.  After a week of sitting on it, making ALOT of revisions to it, I sent her an email telling her my actual feelings towards her.  I went in knowing that there really wasn't anything to come out of it at the moment (not being pessimistic, but just realistic).   She is surprised at how I feel and likes me too, but can't feel anything ""right now"".  Out of the conversation that night, she kept saying ""right now"", not ""I'm not interested in you"" or ""I don't have any sort of feelings towards you"", just ""I can't do it right now"".  Which is what I honestly expected.  

Since then, the conversations have gotten better.  She is more active like she once was.  Which makes me happy that she actually takes the time to reach out to me and share things (sometimes starts the conversations).   To be honest, even the  slightest text or pic makes me feel so good. 

In the past 2 weeks however, even though she still talks to me, some days are good, some days are non existent (meaning she doesn't talk at all).  I try not to look into it but she got me into Snapchat so I'm still relatively new to it.  There is a feature where it shows where a certain person is and earlier tonight, she was at a certain town where she stayed the night  where the guy she was talking to last month lives (I don't think its the guy but its not where she lives).  

I'm not proud of looking.  I need to make that clear.  This is something I have never really done before and its like, I wasn't trying to look but it was right there for me to see and my curiosity got the better of me and it was something I didn't want to do but I am very anxious person at times.

 I like her, but like I said, there is nothing I can do about it and it sucks. Honestly, I really don't know how to go about the next step...but all I know is I don't want to lose touch with her again, I realize her worth and I want to keep talking to her. I guess the reason I posted this wasn't to necessarily get sympathy but more or less to get some advice.

Do I not say anything to her, let her do her thing and just slowly lose my mind because knowing I like her; it'll drive me nuts seeing posts and pictures with another guy and the inevitable relationship status?

\-or-

Do I say something to her and run the risk of maybe losing her in the process because she'll think all I'm after is just to hook up with her and not have legit feelings or not feel anything at all?

I have never been in a situation like this and honestly, it is a terrible feeling to have and I was hoping some of you out there have had somewhat similar situations.....

Please Help....thank you.

1042,CatfishConfessional,1557219425,3,"Throw away account for obvious reasons.  This is a hella long story and I’m sorry for that. But it’s fresh and I could really use some words of direction. 

I won’t try and justify my actions because they’re inexcusable and I’ll jump right into it. I’m a male and catfished another guy. 

I was catfishing this guy for approximately two years I would say. We met via a videogame. It started off innocent enough. Simply genuinely enjoying his friendship, and the endless night we’d play until the sunrise. 

At some point it became more than that. We were clearly interested in eachother. We grew out of the game but never eachother. This sort of back and forth carried on for who knows how long. 

At one point we even “took a break” from eachother because he wanted to pursue “another” girl. I secretly prayed it was going to work out so that I could cut him free. This guy became truly one of my best friends. 

Sadly this wasn’t the case. They didn’t work out and I was to weak to embrace the persona and pick up the pieces. As selfish as it was, I wanted to pick them up. I wanted him to go back to being happy. 

Fast forward to a few moths ago, two years or so in, things are far more intimate than they were. Not necessarily on a sexual level since we had been far past that, but just on a spiritual level. I’d be waiting up until 6 am every morning to make sure he was on time for work etc etc. at some point without my knowledge I genuinely fell in love with this guy. I stopped just loving him and am now in love with him. Get what I’m saying? 

Both of us struggle with our own mental battles, just like all humans do. And recently he’s been having more bad days than good, I always try my best to do whatever I can to make him feel even slightly better. At the end of the day all I wanted was his happiness.

But I knew in my heart that these promises of children and dates that I was making. These dreams we would have of eachother. I knew I could never provide them for him. And they’re certainly something he deserves. But I also know that he fell in love with this persona I had cultivated. Not me. 

I knew I had to cut him free. Every morning it would make me physically sick to my stomach. Trying my best to provide happiness for someone I’m directly hurting. 

I can’t tell you how many times he’s asked to drive to me in the middle of the night just because he was lonely. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve cried having to say no. 

He deserves better than me. 

Jump forward again to two nights ago. He has a particularly rough day. Asks if he could see me soon. Tells me he’s not happy etc etc. things that break my heart to hear. I just couldn’t take it anymore. I for the first time did anything even remotely decent and decided I had to tell him. 

I’d like to preface this by saying I’ve tried (according to him at least 3 times) to “get us to see other people”   With the third time being this last time. It was a cowardly way out that I was trying to take but I just wanted him to get out and find somebody he deserved. 

But I just couldn’t do it anymore. I spent too long hoping he would catch on and call me out or find someone better or even just give up on the chase. It wasn’t happening so I couldn’t be the cause of his suffering anymore. Especially not when he was already dealing with his own battles. 

So I broke down, told him everything said my final goodbyes. I knew that losing him at least meant he would finally be able to get over something that didn’t exist. Much like the coward that I am I tried to block him before he could respond. But he was already prepared for this and his answer was locked and loaded from the start. 

He had already known. Literally everything. Even before I started intentionally dropping clues in an attempt to give myself away. From the start he knew I wasn’t a girl he was able to figure out who I was. I was sloppy. Before I even intended to be. 

Still he fought for me. Even thanked for me for finally coming clean. Words I don’t deserve. Because it wasn’t anything new to him, he wasn’t shell shocked like me. And him having known about it and played along didn’t soften the blow either. 

It forced me to confront my own demons and see myself for the monster that I was. And at that moment sitting in his acceptance is when it sunk it. That I am in love with him, and that I spent two years just about deliberately hurting him for my own selfish gain. 

And now to hear that with all my monsters brought to light, that he still loves me and not just my persona but actually me? It’s almost soul crushing that I did what I’ve done to him. 

If he’s willing to have me as I am, I’m willing to try and be everything he deserves and more. But the problem is, no matter how many times he tells me it’s okay or to stop apologizing I can’t shake this sense of dread in my stomach. 

It’s entirely possible that I’m over reading it, but the night that I came clean and confessed once we got past all the tears and what not it felt like time stopped. Like he really had accepted me and my persona as one and it didn’t matter to him. 

But now in the following two days I feel he’s been slightly distant. Someone who usually would love to hear from me at all hours now seems only half there. 

I thought that’s what he wanted was me right there whenever, so I’ve been trying to stay in contact as much as I can around both of work schedules. 

I want him to know that the events in my life I was sharing with him were real. I had informed him about my sick grandmother, and would often use her as a trump card for why we couldn’t. While time frames may have been fudged a bit it certainly wasn’t entirely a lie. If it weren’t for her being as ill as she was I wouldn’t have even come across him.  I wanted to keep it as close to the truth as I could. I didn’t want to just be feeding him bs “my sister has cancer, I was hit by a car” lines. I always genuinely wanted him to be a part of my life. 

But the problem is how is he supposed to trust me after what I did to him. I wouldn’t trust me if I were him. 

All I want is to show him that the things I was saying to him and the feelings I had and were conveying were real. But I know this is just as hard if not harder for him. He might have known for however long beforehand. But it was never official until now. 

I’m trying to take into account his feelings, I just want him to know that his feelings even if they’re good or bad are justified and that I want to validate his feelings and emotions. 

I’m so incredibly grateful that he can even stomach looking my way. Let alone making plans with me for the following weekend. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to tell him these things. I don’t want to blow up his phone if he needs space.

But he spent two years just beyond my fingertips. If he’s willing to let me then I want to do whatever it takes to hold him close. I just can’t shake this horrible feeling that at any second it’s going to fall apart.",lonely,Catfish confessional,2019-05-07 18:57:05

1045,BiscuitEmperor,1557211659,4,"So this is not your typical r/lonely story. On first glance no-one would even consider me lonely. There is this girl a few semesters below me. We met while smoking in between our lectures, we talked, became friends, close friends, best friends. Then I developed feelings for her - of course that had to happen. But we even managed that problem and could return to being best friends again.
Fast foreward to now. She has had a boyfriend for a long time now, but their relationship is completely messed up. The only reason she doesn‘t end it, is because she fears that he would kill himself if she did. I was her support throughout the whole thing. And again it happend what had to happen. We got too close and had sex. Again and again. 
Now we are closer than ever. The only thing that is missing for us being in a relationship, is the title „relationship“. We already spend ~ 100 % of our time together. We sleep together every night, we cudle, have sex, go to the gym, cook together. Everything is there for a true relationship, except that I know for sure she wouldn‘t start one with me, even if she did break up. She doesn‘t want one. She doesn‘t want me. She wants to be free and I can‘t blame her. 
So here I am, as close as I could be to the one single human I was ever truly in love with. Yet I feel more empty and more alone than ever before. I could really understand if no-one was able to empathize with this situation. Because I know that I should feel incredible and lucky. And I am truly happy as long as I am with her. But deep within I always know that this is a farce. That I am living a lie and that sooner or later our affaire will come to an end. I dread that day. Because I really can‘t say what it will do to me. My best guess is that it will break me to a point beyond repair. 
I needed to get this out of my system. And irl there is no-one who would be understanding of this. Because in the end I am just a dumb selfish tool for a cheater.",lonely,"Closer to her than ever, yet lonelier than ever before.",2019-05-07 16:47:39

Now that she's turned 18 and working while going to school I am not as much in need as I once was. I know I know, its all a part of growing up and me growing old but damn.

After me and her mom split 11 years ago I've had a few relationships but I always put my kid first. When my last relationship ended about 5+ years ago I decided I was done with it all. From then on it was 101% about my kid.

Well now she's grown and I'm not the indispensable figure I once was. So now I have to figure out what to do with my life.

I'm introverted but can speak publically. I can shake hands and make small talk when called upon. So I'm not as painfully awkward as some.

But

I'm 45, chubby and lonely. Single dads aren't like the hot thing women want, especially middle aged, chubby record nerd, ex punks. So I'm kinda stuck.

On the one hand, I'd love to have a woman to love and cherish, argue about music and go with me to Record Store Day and concerts and watch horror movies and such. These women exist, I chat with a few on Instagram, but women like that have their pick of the litter as it were.

On the other hand....dating sucks. Online dating sucks even worse (not photogenic) and a waste of time. My daily travels are fairly routine so my orbit is small. I rarely meet any new people, especially women. 

So what do I do?

I'm hauling my fat a$$ to the gym in the morning. Eating better. Yes. But I just don't think I want to venture out into the miserable experience of trying to meet people, but yet I would like to ride myself of the loneliness.

1079,Tell_Mum_Im_Sorry,1557156791,10,"I thought I had friends when I was younger, but looking back at it now I realise I was never really included or part of the group, I was just too naive and socially blind to realise it. 
Growing old that only got worse to the point where I think no one except my parents would realise if I just disappeared. 

Last year I spent my birthday drinking by myself in my room and it felt especially shit because until then I had always had someone, if anything because people from school would hang out out of obligation or even just lack of anything else to do. But since I’ve come to university I literally have had no one, and it honestly annoys me how everyone seemed to find friend groups to hang out with the first few weeks, and even tho I made an active effort to try and be socialI was never really included and ended up alone after everyone already had formed groups and it wasn’t really possible to fit in with anyone anymore. 
I do have lots of acquaintances I’m on friendly terms with but I imagine that’s true for many of you here too and you probably know how it is. 

So this year I was really determined to give it my best shot, it seemed to work for a bit, most of the groups I tried being friends with stopped hanging out with me but this time I did manage to make some friends and hang out quite a bit this year, text often and what not. 

Comes my birthday again, and I try to organise something. Of course everyone is too busy for it and no one even tries to make it sound any better, just treat it like it’s no big deal. 

I ended up putting on my best clothes and ordering delivery from my favourite restaurant just so I could feel like at least I had done something and it hadn’t been just a day like any other. Ate alone in front of my computer and drank the rest of the night. 

It was probably the saddest and most pathetic thing I’ve ever done and I kind of needed to get it off my chest but it’s not something I would ever tell anyone I know in real life. 
The weird thing is that it didn’t feel as bad as I thought it would, not as much as last year. I guess that probably means that deep down I don’t deserve anything better and I’m not meant to have friends and parties and have fun like everyone else my age I see around me all the time. 

I’m kinda done trying, it honestly only made it worse, and don’t expect next year to be any different but at least it won’t feel as bad I guess.",lonely,All my efforts have meant nothing,2019-05-07 01:33:11

[Me in highschool and me now](https://imgur.com/a/exJe1uC)


I met this guy when I was sixteen. I went to a party with his friends, I got wasted, and two of them brought me to a different house and had sex with me. I bled I felt baffled. The next day they told all their friends they were 18 and 19. I was already getting bullied and had slut rumors spread about me, so they thought I wanted it. They called me gross.


He left for the military but still kept in contact with me. I would send him pics over two years and see me when he was home. He cheated on one of his girlfriends with me.  I didn't know because the one social media I had he posted no photos but on every other platform he did. He would have sex with me then ignore me for a month. He implied I'm attractive enough to fuck but not be seen with

I feel so ugly. Two years ago he texted me after having a girlfriend for eight months. At first, I didn't know when he told me that I said I don't feel comfortable talking to you with a girlfriend. He sent me dozens of texts saying he missed me and posting old pics he had of me from three years ago. He asked,” if I was single would we be cool again.”


I kept ignoring him, and a couple of weeks later he got a new girlfriend. Posted lots of pics of her saying she's gorgeous. He went on deployment we stopped talking. After his deployment, he got discharged and moved to the east coast with his girlfriend. Before he left, he tried to see me and tried face timing me like 60 times. Thank God I was in a different state.


Now he's been messaging me like crazy saying he misses me and that I'm beautiful. I just blew up at him after six years of this I couldn't take it anymore. I called him a rapist, a douchebag, self-centered, a cheating loser, a sociopath, a liar, and a coward.

He just kept saying ”why are you mean to me.” and ”if you're going to put me down stop messaging me.” he also tweeted stuff like ”if you can’t respect me. Then at least have the decency to leave me alone. B It e your problem.” after I blew up at him the first time he tried apologizing for a couple of months later, but I just started saying the same stuff to him.

Except socially... Since I was 5 I have been unable to relate to people or make friends. I have acquaintances at work but we all know those don't count. I have gone through times with people where I petend to be someone I am most definitely not (aka someone normal people will I can associate with/sleep with/invite to baseball games/go with to concerts or barbecues, etc.) but at the end of every day when I an alone, doing this makes me break down and cry and I am in a great deal of emotional discord/pain that literally hurts my head, shoulders, back, and gives me a headache and the most crippling depression with the inability to sleep without heavy medication. Plus I spend all night having bad dreams and I wake up wishing I had died in my sleep.

Anytime I become ""close"" to a person, especially a girlfriend, I start to show my true self and they become annoyed and frightened (not in a case od physical harm, just in a ""boy have I met a damaged crazy person"" sort of way. Nobody sticks around after I show myself.

I have attempted to solve it with religion, spirituality, meeting similar people, supoort groupsbm, hundreds of illicit drugs, dozens of psych meds, and 20 years of therapy with 5 different professionals. Not one thing has improved, it gets worse every day, and it has come to the point where living causes, unexaggwrated, a truly unbearable amount of pain.

7 years ago a friend forced me to take 2 kittens (littermates) and they have been my only friends ever. If they didn't rely on me to feed them, I would have killed myself years ago (I do know the correct chemical combination with no pain abd 100% success rate and I can obtain anything) but this is not fair to the cats and I cannot stand the idea of them being euthanized or separated because they are so accustomed to their brother/sister routine.  I know they will get over my passing as long as they remain toferher so that does not concern me. I also know a better life awaits them rather than beinf taken care of by someone who can barely muster the energy to play with them.

My question is, what are my options for ensuring they are together and in good hands for life when I am gone? Surely a program exists, a kind, openminded, and understanding stranger is reading, and/or a contract can be created? I should mention there is an amoubt of money involved that passes on to them and should cover them for the rest if their life.

Jokes like ""I want to jump out of a window"" or ""I hate my life"" or ""Hang me from the roof and call me a piñata, because I want to die"". Jokes like that. They may not seem like jokes, but it's the verbal delivery that separates them from statements of a disturbed mind, though they still sort of are. I say these jokes, hoping to God that somebody, anybody, will pull me aside one day and just ask me ""Dylan, are you alright? Your jokes are alarming, and I worry for you."" I know, it's silly. It's stupid. It makes me an attention-whore. I should never expect it to work. But the very faint chance that it may work forces me to continue. It's like tourettes, almost. Not literally, but you get the point. Some may ask ""Why not just directly ask for help?"", and then others will completely understand why. Talking about my issues, especially my very serious issues, is a very difficult task for me. I see a counselor, not a therapist, a counselor, and I tell him a lot. It's very hard for me, but I can tell him because he's a professional. But, family, friends, teachers, or peers? I can't do it. I just shut down. So, I use these jokes in a desperate, feeble attempt to get somebody to notice and care. Again, I know it's dumb. I know I shouldn't do it, and I know it's such an edgy and childish thing to do.

Even if I do decide to call up a friend and ask to hang out, the moment they say yes or the moment I call, I regret it and feel like I would rather be at home. 

Most of wanting to be at home is wanting to smoke weed because I feel like it would be less money spent relaxing at home and smoking up rather than going partying or going out to the movies/dinner etc.. but I still do feel waves of lonely anxiety. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Is it better to stay home or go out in these scenarios?

I woke up and pretty much all day had nobody to talk to as usual, so I tried to get ahold of two of the only ""friends"" I have... nobody answered or replied at all, also as usual. 

Then late last night I got a notification on Instagram. A girl I used to talk to quite a bit went live, and it was just her playing the guitar and singing, which was really nice for a few minutes, especially because she's quite good at both, but I started to feel a bit weird just sitting there and saying nothing. So, I said ""I feel kind of awkward sitting here lurking 😅 you're really, really good though 😊"" she read this and said, ""don't feel awkward haha you're completely fine"" and then within about 3 seconds literally every single person in the stream chat called me by my full name (it's in my account name on IG), and told me I was weird/creepy/a loser. Like 10 people I didn't even know.

I still kind of can't believe that actually happened, and not a single person even actually knew me there other than her. I just closed the app and sat there for awhile depressed and hating myself. I don't know what it is about me that makes everyone seem to hate me so much whether they know me or not. I have no real friends.

There is something inside me, something wrong, something that people pick up on that drives them away. I'm disgusting. Repulsive. Off-putting.

That's not to say I'm ugly, of course. Guys talk to me when they're horny. They really get off on it. They take advantage of my loneliness. They build me up, and then, every single time, when I ask them if they'd date me they make excuses as to why they won't or can't. And invariably I learn that they are dating or go on to date a cis girl.

No guy wants to date a trans girl who's taller than them. No guy wants to be seen in public with a girl who towers over them. It's humiliating. I know it. It's basic social psychology. I would be a mark of shame.

So we're just walking around the mall, and it's a Friday night, so there's a lot of people.

I just can't help but notice how everyone is so happy. Everyone is laughing, having a good time, and (this one stings the most) absolutely no one was alone. Now, don't get me wrong, I love seeing people happy, and I feel happy for them, and I wouldn't want any harm to reach them, but when you're so fucking lonely, seeing other people having a good time just breaks you. No, it KILLS you. It kills you on the inside. 

I walk past a cute couple holding hands. I walk past another cute couple holding hands. I walk past a cute couple sitting on the bench, showing each other something on their phones and laughing. I walk past another cute couple laughing. I walk past another cute couple cuddling.

I walk past a group of teenagers. All of them must be around 16-17, like me. They're a few boys and a few girls. They're all laughing. They're all so carefree. So relaxed. They were having a good time. This is how teenagers are supposed to be. This is what this age is about.

We sit down at the food court and I'm sitting eating my Cinnabon roll in silence. I'm not exactly alone, my family is there. But they're not my family. They're my masters. On the tables next to me are a cute couple, and a group of 5 teenagers who are friends. I keep glancing over and notice how happy they are. And every time I take a glance, I die on the inside. It hurts way too fucking much.

""Why do you look upset? You're always upset. Why can't you be happy?"" My parents bark.

I want to say ""Because I'm fucking lonely. Why am I lonely? Because of YOU. You guys have homeschooled me, you guys force me to work and not focus on my studies, you guys don't let me leave the house, and IF ever you do, you guys go out of your way to ensure I don't have a social life. Because of you, I feel like a prisoner. Because of you, I feel trapped. Because of you, the house feels like a prison. And seeing others MY AGE laughing and being so carefree FUCKING HURTS. It hurts so bad you guys have no idea. It hurts so much that my chest LITERALLY burns. It hurts. It FUCKING hurts.""

Obviously I can't say that. Instead, I just put on my fake smile and say ""Oh what? Oh no I'm fine. I'm not upset, I'm 100%!"" While internally rolling my eyes. 

I come home, I take a shower, and I go to bed. Once my parents have gone to bed, I start to cry. I cry, and I cry, and I cry. I'm hugging my pillow, and am shaking. And I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying so much I'm struggling to breathe. I pick up my phone and open Messenger. Absolutely no one. I open WhatsApp. Absolutely no one. I go through my contacts, absolutely no one. This makes me cry even more. My pillow is drenched in tears. My pillow is all I've got. He never judges me, he's always there for me, and he always wipes my tears.

Eventually I stop crying, and now I have a terrible headache and my eyes are burning because of crying so fucking much. I feel pathetic about the fact that I was literally hugging a pillow. A PILLOW. A FUCKING PILLOW.

I wash my face and I lie down. I close my eyes, trying to go to sleep, while thinking of everyone out there enjoying themselves, feeling happy for them. But it hurts. It fucking hurts.",lonely,I was at the mall last night...,2019-05-05 05:05:09
1152,shef9002,1556994057,5,"I've been on the edge of friendship groups for as long as I can remember. When I finished college I had maybe 4 people that I was in semi regular contact with and hung out with but it was always me initiating contact and making plans (which were often bailed on last minute). 

Anyway, I started working and was doing a masters in the evenings and on weekends and didn't have as much spare time so I wasn't making as much contact with them and it soon hit me that they would never bother to message me. That's when I stopped making an effort with them. In the last 6 months, not one of them has contacted me. Maybe I'm being petty by not messaging them but I feel like why should I have to do it all? Friendship takes work from both sides and surely if they were really bothered they would have done something about it. 

Anyway, this brings me to my current dilemma. In the 6 months since I stopped making the effort with them, the only people I have talked to are my parents and coworkers.

I know it's just part of being an adult, the not having friends, the loneliness, the not having someone to talk to, the working constantly. I'm not even looking for someone to talk to, I just feel like I need to say how I feel or am;  I don't even know. I was raised not to talk about my problems so it's not really something I do with my s/o, I listen to hers though. I was pretty much molded into an adult at an early age because of family problems, i'm sure some of y'all know how that is. I have commitment issues, i'm not an open person, i'm very serious, I don't like to drink because I know I'll drink for the wrong reasons. I grew up in a police household, not many will understand that. My s/o doesn't understand why it's what i'm gonna be doing. I guess it's some false ideology of heroism. I can be honest I won't be able to save everyone or even those who don't want saving, I've had that pounded into my head. When i'm in that mode though i'm different. I know how to react, I know how to relate to people, to talk to them, it feels natural. I don't want to be praised, it's not about that. It's about knowing what i'm doing and who i'm doing it for and with. I don't expect anyone to understand that. I've gotten so good at dealing with other peoples problems at a young age that I constantly ignore mine day in and day out. I know tons of y'all understand that.

1159,Good_Posture,1556986338,3,"For me, it's mental/social aspects as well as financial.

I am employed, but cannot afford to live on my own. Because I don't have anyone to rent-share with, I still stay at home. I pay my way, contributing to the household and buy my own personal items. This is basically an intimacy death  sentence for a grown man.

The fact that I still stay at home is a massive block in how I interact with women. If it does seem like there is a chance that something might develop I sabotage it by telling myself she'll reject me the minute she discovers my living arrangement, so I shut it down. It also prevents me from ""closing"" if I have managed to get intimate with a woman and the time has come to ask ""do you want to get out of here?"" Where am I going to take her?

Other social aspects are that I am reserved, shy and very self-conscious (mostly rooted in my living arrangements), so when I am out I tend to have a whole bunch of limited interactions where there is some small talk and the people I am speaking to seem to get bored/put-off.

1165,HistoriaWong,1556977066,5,"I have an online friend. She's my bestie (I'm also a she, if that matters), and I realized recently that I maybe try to talk too much with her. Because with my few other friends, all also online, I just message them whenever I have something specific I want to talk about. And they'll stop replying back at a point, then pick it up again when they feel like it or are able to. And that's fine. 

But in the case of my bestie, she's the one who drives the loneliness away, even though she's in Europe and I'm in the U.S. She's the one who makes me feel like I am special. 

But I'm always messaging her, ""Hi! How are you??"" Every. Single. Day. She never initiates conversations with me, I don't think she feels the same need to as I do, I'm always the one to do so. And then we run out of things to say. And then later on, I message her out of the blue to try and keep the conversation going.

And I make it sound like it's easy for me to message her like this, but it's really not. I have the biggest anxiety trying to hit 'send.' And I'll often just stare at the green 'online' icon next to her name hoping she'll be the one to message me, but she never does...

She'll also mention that she's chatting with other people sometimes.  And those people probably don't bug her like I do. And given that she'll sometimes reply with very minimal effort, I'm crushed thinking how most of her effort is going to those other people instead.

I realized that having friends is a need, not a want. It’s a burden for me and I’m sure it is for others. 
And because it is a need, it is inevitable people will receive the golden few that they have that keeps them alive. 
I can’t really think of anybody who doesn’t have that ONE person, at the very least, they could call a friend, regardless of how alone they say they are. Not because they wanted to have that friend, but because it was part of their unconscious need to survive. I could be wrong, but I personally don’t know how l could completely say I have nobody when I do- even if they do live really far away and we haven’t seen each other in 3 years.

I must be living under a rock, but I didn't realize catfishing was an actual term that applied to what I did. I mean I have heard about it but I never followed it closely or anything anyways let me get to the story. I'm probably a 5 or 6 .....when I dress up and look nice, a 7 tops.

I'm a male, late 30's, and I was a few months out of a long term 14 year relationship and I just didn't have the confidence at the time to date. So I decided to live in fantasy world of sorts. I created a profile on OKC of a person much better looking then myself and of course there were hundreds of interests. Many of these women were absolutely gorgeous and I entertained the fantasy of dating them for a bit nothing crazy. It was a lot of ""you're sexy"" I'd sleep with you type of things. I never solicited nude pictures or anything like that, again this was just for fantasy. I was just about to delete the profile and give the whole account up until I met her.

She is ten years younger, she has been dating online on and off for a few months. She would consider herself a 5 or 6 but she is beautiful. She's easily a 9 but a 10 to me. She has blonde hair and blue eyes and an amazing smile. At the risk of boring everyone, I'll just come out and say that she was my dream girl. We talked on and off at random, I was very busy and she has her own career as well. I had experienced a death in my family, in real life, and I really didn't want to continue talking to anyone, let alone someone who I won't ever meet. I explained that I was in a tough place and couldn't really focus on another person. I suppose this was my way of trying to say goodbye. Well a month goes by and she texts me and asks me how I am. I was feeling better and I decided to pursue talking to her again, I mean she is beautiful and smart, I couldn't help it.

For a week or two we texted everyday, we talked about our goals our hopes and our dreams for the future. She wanted everything I wanted, it was really amazing. What is my luck that I am finding a beautiful woman who wants exactly what I want and I'm not even really me. Over these weeks we expressed how lonely we were with our everyday lives and how we should just ""run away"" together and start our own family. This was of course music to my ears, but of course I couldn't tell her why it would never happen but I agreed that is what I wanted too. She really wants to meet up at this point and I need to find a way to deflect that. Well, because I deflected and stayed away she found herself in the arms of another man which of course drove me up a wall, especially because this guy used her and of course he used her again. I was jealous with rage! Imagine that, and of course how terrible is that of me to make her feel bad or worse then she already feels about it?

This is where our talks and our texts became much more personal and intimate. We shared even more, even things about mental health. Then we started talking on the phone and she has the voice of an angel. I needed to talk to her everyday, she was consuming me, she was absolutely the love of my life. She confided that she felt love for me as well. This began to hurt, this began to make me feel horrible, here I am in love with this beautiful woman who wants everything I want and I realize at this point there is no getting out of this without being hurt. Well, I've been told I am being transferred to a different city and this should be it right?

I grappled with this and of course this hurt her, but she asked everything she could...what about my life here in our city, what about my dog? How can they just move me to a new city? I didn't and still don't want to go, in fact that's a separate story but anyways....I felt bad, she felt bad....I had to come clean with her.

It was three weeks ago today. She told me that I should just let her love me. I told her that she was in love with my words and not with me, the ugly hideous monster that I really am. She asked me why I kept referring to myself as a monster. I told her that I was going to write/read her a letter that I wrote to her. She kept asking more questions. I suggested we talk on the phone. We talked one last time, I came clean about everything. She was so compassionate and loving about everything, she told me how she understood how this could happen and how the world makes us do things we normally wouldn't. She still wanted to meet in person. I agreed but hesitated in my agreement to do so. She told me that she told her friends right away and they told her she was being too nice to me and of course she was.

She asked me to send her picture and I told her I was really ugly and she then sent me what she considered an ""uncute"" picture of her, of course it was beautiful. I sent her my picture. Of course she said I was cute. We texted back and forth, mostly me apologizing for being the horrible person I was and for what I did. She told me that the deception was too much for her to overcome and that she has to say goodbye to me. She told me to be well and to treat myself well and that was that. She blocked my number, which is easily known via having iPhones. I presume she never wants to hear from or speak to me again because of that.

Again, here we are.....21 days later....the karma of what I have done is catching up to me. I think about her all the time. I think about her smile, I think about her voice, her dog, her entire being. I fell completely in love with her and I didn't expect that to happen. We shared songs we like, we shared movies we liked, all of this....I can't listen to these songs, I can't see these movies, I'm of course, never ever going to do anything like this again. Before anyone asks, I completely deleted and removed the profile from OKC. I have learned a valuable lesson from this at the expense of my heart and probably hers also, if she is hurt I would do anything I could to make that go away.

Anyways that's my story. I'm completely heart broken and I can't stop thinking about her and that is my punishment for what I have done.",lonely,I catfished someone and fell in love...an appropriate story of heartbreak.,2019-05-04 05:05:56

1211,yanuarazar,1556897738,3,"4 years ago, I was dropped out in my college years twice. From now on I entered my lowest point of life and I had such deep depression for the first time of my life. At the same year, I decided to work as operator at i-cafe (basically I did everything from cashier, mopping floor to cleaning toilets). In the next 2 year I open my business and try not to become a burden in my familly. And yes it didn't run smooth as I expected. A year later I finally got my first professional job as an art teacher, yet something really missing. I feel so lost and lonely. No friends, no people to hang out, alone at weekend. 

From there, I thought if I push myself a little harder I will get a decent job with great workplace and healthy people. So I can really change my self-destruct lifestyle.
Finally, I got the job I wanted as an artist at multinational edtech company and feel really proud of myself.

I thought I can finally leave my depression, but it's not that easy. The time and strength which allow me to get this point obliterated my social life even worse. Now I am in my first month in my new workplace and people started really think I am a freak and socially awkward. There was a time when I have a lunch and sit down next to a group of my colleagues. They glanced at me with very flat and odd face. I tried to smile at them but they don't respond at all. They always have so much things to talk about, meanwhile I just sit there and blank-gazing at my computer. There was also a time when we went to cinema. The same things happened, I just froze in front of them after the show.

At first, I think because it's my flat and serious looking impression, I also decline politely when they try to reach me. Is that considered as rude behaviour? I just can't accept every invitation because the same thing could happen and makes me even more sad. I don't know, after everything that I've been through, I'm still looks like a total failure.

My childhood dream was to join the special forces in my country and I was lucky enough to get accepted and left for basic training on the 6th of February. Now you think that everything sounds great right? Two months before I left, at the start of December I was rejected yet again by yet another girl whom I loved dearly and I was a mess, my best friend helped me to get through this bad stage in my life and things started to feel great because his little sister showed a lot of affection for me. I've never been shown so much love in my life, hugs, cuddling, hand holding, I was going crazy and the date I was shipping out come closer by the day. And the day came and I was there with my bags and for some reason I was calm and very relaxed. Everything was going great, I passed all the tests, loved the place and got along with everyone in the barracks. But then in the forth day it hit me, I missed her, I missed her a lot and I wanted to explode. In the seventh day I was going home, I've always had crazy mood swings but this was different, in my greatest depressive episode up to that point my stupid self ask to leave for pcychological problems to the shock of everyone who knew me there. But here comes the worst part of the story and the reason I'm writing this. Fast forward to the end of April and I went out with her and confensed my feelings being sure that she would accept me, she is a unique person with very strange behavior but I managed to understand her ways very easily. I've heard it all up to this point, ""I see you as a friend, as a best friend, as a brother, as a teacher"", now I also became ""an older brother"". I quit my dream for a girl that never liked me back, my best friend has grown distant, my only other friend is constanly bored or sleeping and here I am with no plans for the future and no chance of getting in any other military because of what I did to get out. Oh and here is another problem , she didn't deny me because I'm ugly, or too nice, she couldn't even find a reason she didn't want me. Why is this a problem? With every other rejection I found my flaws and fixed them, now I don't even know what is wrong with me.

Over the last couple of years I have noticed that the people who I would consider my friends and whose lives I make an effort to be apart of have been leaving me out of hangouts and friend activities. Some of those years I was not able to hang out as much as I would have liked due to finishing college, but still made efforts to try and join up when I could. Now that I am done with school and have a lot more free time, it appears no one wants to hang out or invite me to do things anymore. Usually what ends up happening is these people won't invite me to anything, but I get to see all the fun on snap stories or posted on Facebook &amp; IG. When I confront them on it and say, ""Hey you should of told me..."" that is usually followed by a BS excuse. Now I have considered the thought that maybe they don't think of me because I don't reciprocate inviting them to do anything. I invite them to do things or join me each weekend, but that is usually followed up with a maybe and by the end of the weekend I see snaps of everyone hanging out together doing other things. The only time these people contact me is when they have issues or questions. Other than that, no one talks to me which leaves me feeling lonely, used, and left out.

I am used to being the lone wolf, but its nice to be included on things and have people other than your parents/siblings who care about you.

In high school something bad happened to me. It was by some older guys when I was 16. It made me an outcast. I was ridiculed a lot for my looks from this group of guys in my grade. Everyday in class they would pick apart my looks. They said I looked 40, that I was gross, that I have wrinkles, and that no one would ever want me. They would also say that I’m a slut. 



I met this guy when I was sixteen. I went to a party with his friends, I got wasted, and two of them brought me to a different house and had sex with me. I bled I felt baffled. The next day they told all their friends they were 18 and 19. I was already getting bullied and had slut rumors spread about me, so they thought I wanted it. They called me gross.




I just lost all confidence at that point I felt like damaged goods. I still hooked up with one of them after that because I felt like no one would want me after that. John would hook up with me when he was drunk but ignore me during the day. 

He left for the military but still kept in contact with me. I would send him pics over two years and see me when he was home. He cheated on one of his girlfriends with me.  I didn't know because the one social media I had he posted no photos but on every other platform he did. 



He would have sex with me then ignore me for a month. He implied I'm attractive enough to fuck but not be seen with. He said he only wanted me for sex and nothing more. He would never want to talk to me unless it was sexual. He said he felt no connection with me. He said all of this to me when I was 16-18 he was 19-21.
I haven't seen him in 4 years, but he still tries to contact me



I feel so ugly. Why would someone treat me this way? I haven't seen him in four years, but he still tries to contact me I think I'm damaged goods. Will any guy ever want me. Have been treated this way because of how I look? Why are men like this? I don't think I could ever trust a man.

1228,chrstl-nikki,1556853911,3,"hey everyone,

so, this might be a really emotional post, and it feels so sad and pathetic to be searching for advice on the internet but, that's the reality of what my life feels like.

growing up, people didnt seem to like me and i always thought it was because I was weird. so of course in middle school, i tried to be ""cool"". it worked for a little, til the popular girl got intimidated and told everyone to hate me. but we've moved on from that. In highschool, people loved to talk about me, I never understood why, but I changed schools going into highschool so a lot of people from different towns knew me. Again, we're passed that.

But here I am in college. I'm 21 and go to school 1000 miles away from my hometown. my parents moved too, so I've started a whole new life down here. Yet, somehow I feel so alone. I made new friend my first year, but I'm only friends with one of them now who I am in love with too (but that's a whole different story). He's my best friend, and he cares about me, but he doesn't give me the type of relationship I want from him.

Besides him, I don't really have many friends. I have a couple girl friends I consider close, but one of them is always busy and I hear from her rarely, and the other one cares about me a lot but she is so misguided and in her own world that being around her too much is very toxic for my well being. 

I feel like I haven't found ""my people"" yet, and I don't know how. I moved into a single bedroom apartment after having some terrible random roommates. I live with my dog, and I don't mind it. But sometimes, like tonight, I'm really emotional about some things, like how I'm in love with my best friend, and I have no one to talk to because I can't talk to him about it and hes busy hanging out with other people. We hang out a lot, but I want to hangout with him all the time, but realistically that's not a possibility. 

I guess I'm just kind of venting, but I also feel so alone. I feel like I never have anyone to talk to, nobody cares about how i  feel. Nobody checks up on me daily. If I got injured or really sick and couldn't get to my phone, there wouldn't be anyone looking for me except my job. So if I wasn't working for a couple days, which happens often, nobody would noice I was gone. And that really hurts me.

How do I make friends? What could make someone so unlikeable? I love everyone I'm close to and I'm very compassionate and reliable. Why can't people return the same to me?",lonely,People never seemed to like me?,2019-05-03 13:25:11

1232,Scotty2Dope4You,1556852016,1,"Okay so ive been trying desperately to meet new people and buils connections. A little backstory, im a music/photography/general artsy type. Im down in florida in the middle of true redneck county, like i walk outside and see 4 rebel flags and twice as many hunting dogs level of redneck. 

In high school (im 19/m, graduated last year) i was a quiet guy in the back with headphones in. I genuinely feel like i truly changed this past year, I'm more assertive, i dont let peeps walk over me, i can talk to people no problem. That change has happened in my room and i have had no chances to show it. I cant connect with people because theres nothing i can connect to around where i live. I feel like im the perfect antithesis of all things local to me. For instance, being a musician, i love meeting people with the same interests. Recently i met 3 separate people through my moms boyfriend who play, but all are older guys who specifically say they arent into the stuff im into, which i mean yeah thats fine and i have no issues with that. 

It feels like no matter what i try or do, no matter how good i feel about myself, i cant get it out and no one seems to even notice that im different, if that makes sense. I feel like i blend into the background despite being the type to always try and go a different path. Any advice on what i should do to avoid reverting back into my old ways?

1233,sunnydrug,1556849800,1,"it's me again, for the third time. i honestly really just need to let all my feelings out because reddit is the only way i can express my feelings without being judged. (also ty for everyone who has pmed me, ya'll really are the best &lt;3)

&amp;#x200B;

so right now, i'm okay but in like an hour i have a feeling i'll be balling my eyes out, so i'm gonna try to write this really fast so i can go to bed before that happens. sorry if this doesn't make sense, i just wanna rant about some people and my feelings for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

there's this girl named sarah in my class. everyone loves her, even my best friends who supposedly 'don't like her'. i remember being best friends with her in the beginning of the school year. after a couple of months, i realized how toxic and abusive she was. she'd always call me ugly and fat, the continue to say how pretty she is. as a really insecure person, i didn't wanna be around her, so i gradually stopped talking to her until she got the message. it wasn't until recently, she really made it clear how obviously abusive she is. one of my ex best friends, i'll call her antonio, went to go hear about the shit she talks about me. apparently she talked about how i should go kill myself, i'm worthless, i'm a fucking whore, etc. i don't wanna go into detail of what she calls me. but she also mocks me when i pass by her, she once pretended to hit me, threw garbage at me, etc. antonio  told me everything. i kept telling antonio to stop talking to her, but she keeps constantly talking, and i'm pretty sure taking shit about me, with her. antonio has done some really.. bad things in our friendship, so i left her today. i don't know how to feel yet. she was my best friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

this happened recently, (i honestly don't know when it started though). on april 11th i posted a photo on instagram of my friend and i, and not too long ago i found out that that photo went ALL around the high school im going to in 2 years. (i'm in middle school). from what i've heard, guys have said they wanted to wheel/fuck my friend and i, they've jerked off to it, etc. so that kinda makes me uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

i also really want a boyfriend who i can just cry to and hug and hold their hand and just... love. y'know? i really want that. i really *need* that. i feel like i can't talk to anyone of my friends without them making jokes about it or making them uncomfortable. i just need a guy i can talk to hours to, while being in their arms and knowing that they actually love me and will listen to me. but instead i just have to hide behind a screen, hide my identity and probably never talk to anyone who will even see this again. i'm just being dumb. i'm young and annoying and won't be taken seriously.

1234,Norbut,1556844217,10,"So basically im lonely most of my life. Im 19 and I have graduated high school recently in Poland. I didn't had problem with lack of friends in school. In high school i was that person everybody liked and nobody hadn't problems with me. 

Also Im kind of good looking and funny and so a lot of girls was attracted to me. But in general I only liked one other girl and she dumped me(she turned out to be very weird person wasting her life on Netflix and alcohol, that was good side of it xd). It was harmful for few months but today only hurting feeling that I have is loneliness. In my whole life all of my best friends had someone else as a best friend(literally everyone) so i was always that second one. 

In addition I have like 3 niche hobbies, video games Im very passionate about them. Always wanted to encourage my friends to them but it didn't went good all of the times. Since they're not popular(hobbies not games) and im living in the small village I don't have possibilities to meet one. Of course those interests aren't my only ones but most important to me. Since kid had a dream to make it come true.

I remember one time around 13-15 yrs old that i always texted to my friends but it always felt like i was only one holding the conversation and when I found that it has no sense i stopped texting to these days. That ""silence"" of lack of conversation with my friends in years was overwhelming.

I have a lot of friends that I really like and so they really like me and appreciate me but it feels like our ways aren't crossing. I think maybe i didn't find my ""soulmate"" yet.

My ""first lonely feeling"" happened during summertime 2017 when i was working outside my country with my dad so i didn't have good relations with my friends and also I wanted girlfriend. I had opportunities but it always didn't work out for me. Almost every time i look behind that and I regret it. 

In october 2017 my grandfather died. Seeing a dead body of your grandfather and trying to resuscitate him is hard time for 17 yrs old I think.

 my mental collapse happened since I was dumped by that girl(I was angry about it and it was that sparkle that started the fire but also it was just another thing to be depressed or something like that) and it peaked during vacation 2018. 

I had a physical work that my family forced me to in place i don't know anybody, knowing that all of my friends are having great time during vacation was terrible. Of course I tried to meet with friends while i had day off with different effects.

During that time I had suicide thoughts and so on it carried to school time for about 2-3 months. 

Never opened up to my closest friends about it. Nobody knows maybe there will be time when im gonna tell it to somebody else not only this subreddit xd

And so I managed to get out of ""teenage depression"" 2017 and 2018 was pretty rough for me. Learned a lot during that time. Right now I don't have problems with my mental health but occasionally when it is weekends or vacation time I don't have any plans nobody is reaching me and when im reaching them it will probably won't work out I just feel lonely with no contact with my colleagues. 

Maybe right now I have leveled up in existential problems because i think about whole reality, is this life even real, what i should do to regret life less, what could be that sweet spot of life but im not getting sad, depressed or something just some serious thoughts without existential crisis. I think i have handled that once so i stabilized for a while. 

I think that particular loneliness feeling is quite compound.

I am desperate. And Reddit seems to make me feel even worse, because I'm not sure how many people who are not in my situation understand what I'm saying. At the same time, I don't know where else to go. I'm aware it's a very small chance I'll make a friend here, but I suppose I got nothing to lose.

1237,Theiryn,1556838222,2,"A year ago i was probably the happiest i had ever been, i had started dating my now boyfriend, and had a very lively discord and talked with my friends everyday, but as when a relationship starts i just wanted to be with my boyfriend, rejecting everyone. 
The end result is now, being alone, with only my boyfriend, its like i don't even know my best friends anymore, they've moved on when i thought they would be there.
I'm an annoying human being to myself, if my friends need anything i will be there for them, i will put aside anything for them although they would never do the same for me, which sucks.
I don't have anyone close anymore, no one to talk to or vent to apart from my boyfriend, but when i'm upset with him, i have no one but myself to fill with emotions.
I've pathetically tried to talk to people online but i'm way to awkward without someone here (which is even more awkward when you don't have anyone in the first place).
I just don't know what to do, i have college friends, but i wouldn't want to go out with them, i hope that makes sense, i just want to chill but they are the more go out to club type, i'm very boring.
I just get sad when my boyfriend talks/ goes out with his friends when we haven't talked all day, i feel so weak and stupid, its like i depend on him because hes the only reals source of communication i have, i hate myself for it.
Its just full circle with me, i'm back to being alone again and i forgot how it felt, and boy does it hurt.
This was  rant i wanted to do for myself because i'm sad right now, i since i have no one to express this with, i will leave my mark here, i will probably never come back for a long time.

Just feeling so low at the moment 

I know these are totally first world problems, and alot of people have it much worse then me. But I can't help feeling down

I moved to a new city in September and it hasn't gone the way I had planned. Despite my efforts I haven't made that many friends so I found myself relying on texts and phonecalls from my friends back home

My best friend had been doing things that has been progressively pissing me off. She doesn't make near as much effort to keep in contact with me that she used to, constantly telling me she's too busy for phonecalls and texts even though she replies in group chats

We had a huge fight when I went back home. I was feeling upset about my nana being diagnosed with terminal cancer, and I just thought she wasn't there for me at all. We were on a night out and despite.my best efforts I ended up crying in a toilet thinking about it, she went off to get a drink with our other friend and didn't respond to my messages asking where they were. I would have written this off but I told her I didn't even want to go on that night out in case I were to get upset and she persuaded me telling me she'd take me home if it came to that

After the night out she went into her bedroom to call her boyfriend and didn't try to talk to me or ask me what was happening. We haven't spoken since. 
Whether I brought up these issues she flips out and starts blaming me for her behaviour. It'd just shit to realize that the person you thought would.have your back in times.like these, doesn't.

I think the moral of the story is to not rely on just one person for conversation and comfort because it will always bite you in the ass, no matter how wonderful you think they are.",lonely,I don't mean to be a whiny lil bitch...,2019-05-03 04:38:51

I don't have any contact with my family. There's only my sister in another city. I occasionally get a text from her. I don't have many close friends. Mainly people I've known through work. I live alone following split from my long term partner a few years ago.

We are still in touch and we are meeting up this weekend to go see a band. I'm gay and I've tried online dating but not met anyone with any long term potential.

Tomorrow I will spend the day alone and have no plans apart from a girl I dated casually, who plans to come over, sleep with me then leave. She doesn't want anything apart from that occasionally.

It's upsetting that tomorrow, like Christmas, I don't have any permanent people in my life to celebrate with. I'm thinking of cancelling the hook up because I'm worried that when she leaves, I will just feel empty having spent the day alone and the only person who wants to see me doesn't value me enough to want me as a person.

I came to USA for a PhD around 4 years ago. All these years, I have suffered/ suffering extreme loneliness!!
I have roommate, but no use. We rarely see or talk each other.
Everyday, I call my parents 4-5 times just to talk to someone. They understand my situation.
Life has been so mundane and lonely recently.
I come home from college, cook the food, eat, watch some YouTube videos, sleep.... Everyday same thing...
Sometimes I feel so lonely that I call random customer care numbers just to have some small talk..
I'm tired of using various "" Talk to strangers"" websites.. Everyone there is horny af..
Recently, I tried few Meetup groups. That's it..no follow ups. Just temporary conversations..

All these years, I'm taking support of various movies, music etc. to heal my loneliness and depression.

In my lab, I talk to my labmate, but there are no heart to heart conversations. Everything fake! Everyone fake!
"" How are you?""--- ""I'm good""
No..I'm not fucking good..I'm damaged, exhausted.

This epidemic loneliness has significantly affected my research, personal life, and everything.

I just close my eyes and listen to soulful songs and cry..
 I hope someday I and everyone who's in the same boat with me, will find the happiness, solace abd purpose of this Life!!",lonely,What is this life?,2019-05-02 12:52:11
1260,EntertainmentBreeze,1556765107,24,"I was the last person to leave my place of work really late a few nights back. I was finishing up a few things on my computer, and (since the building was empty) decided to play some music. I hit 'Shuffle' on Spotify, and after a few songs, a slow romantic song started playing. It hit me then, all at once, same as it does every week or so - just how lonely I am.

At 21, which I know is very young, I've never experienced the warmth of a girl leaning up against me as they look deep into my eyes and smile. I've never held hands with someone, kissed them on the cheek, and sighed just enjoying being in their presence. I've never awkwardly try and put my arm around someone at the movie theater. I've never stayed up til 3 in the morning talking on the phone with someone.

At that moment, as the song was playing I thought about how more than anything I would love to slow dance with someone. To have a girl rest her head on my chest/shoulder as I hold her and we sway peacefully back and forth. So - I stood up, and held my hands out in front of me...and fucking pretended to be dancing with someone. I used my imagination like I hadn't since I was 6 years old, and slow danced in the dark with tears running down my face.

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I've not been active much on this subreddit at all before, just lurked some. Is this normal at all to any of you? Have you had any similar experiences? It feels like one of the more genuinely pathetic moments in my life.

I'm kinda just left to do my own thing, only occasionally helping when things get dire, but I don't know what to be doing with myself. Really, I don't know if I want to do anything, because sometimes I'm so afraid to just go outside my house to the shops. I don't know how to make friends, since in school it was just a case of who sat next to me.

I don't even really know what would help me. I would like a romantic relationship, like a girlfriend, but I'm not sure. I still have feelings for this one girl who I can't be with and who doesn't seem to have as much time for me anymore. Maybe I just need a group of friends, but I struggle to make any kind of deep connection with people, so all friendships just feel like we're keeping each other at arm's length.

I think I just want someone to just sit down next to me and tell me to stop panicking.

I feel at this point there's no use in fighting it any longer. I just need to get used to not having friends to go to for help, and get used to not having a significant other or someone to share my time with.

I now have to survive life being by myself, and learn to overcome obstacles in my life that would be much easier with friends and support. Basically I no longer have much hope in overcoming this, I want to give up.

So what has been happening is I lost a really close friend of mine a couple years ago and he completely blocked everyone from our friend group and caused our friend group to get smaller. I was really depressed about this and I realize now that this person is gone. I still brought him up in conversation with my friends and we talk about it and this happens every time. Recently (within the last 12 months) another friend that highly criticized and said what that friend did (left us without explanation) was ridiculous. Now the hypocrite has done exactly the same thing he was complaining about. I was really close to him as well so it’s really draining me. I only have 2 close friends at the moment and one of them has a girlfriend and a full time job which makes it really hard to spend time with and the other is about to move away for work. I hate not having human connections and i get really depressed because of this. One other thing that adds to this is that I can’t find love which has been a problem before all this but I coped with my good friends. Now my coping mechanism are disappearing I have gone back to my old habits of spending 10+ hours on the computer distracting myself from real life and coping with extreme gaming addiction as a result.

1277,SeanTheMan34,1556728662,1,"So I met this girl about 8 months ago around September 5th 2018. I met her playing an online game and chatting on the discord server for that game. We were best friends on that server and we would talk all day and night about our days. It got to the point where she started opening up to me more and more and I figured out she had a bunch of mental disorders like depression, anxiety, bipolar, and the rest of the usual sadness related disorders. I found out later that she is anorexic, but I'll get into that later. Things were really well with me and her, she trusted me.. and I trusted her. We started getting closer and closer to each other around October 2018 so she decided to invite me to a server on discord with all of her friends (I'll keep their privacy by calling the girl well girl and her other friends friend 1,2 etc.) Her friends instantly hated me for whatever reason, my theory is that they saw how close I was getting to her and got jealous. There was 1 thing I didint know though, and it was about friend 1. Now, friend 1 was nice to me at first, but it got super dramatic really quick. Friend 1 saw how close I was to (girl) and got suspicions. Friend 1 asked me if I liked (girl) and instantly I started to put 2 and 2 together and figure out that Friend 1 was in a relationship with (girl) or so I thought. I told person that I had a girlfriend (complete lie, girl was my only friend atp) and all of them believed it. After that though, things were starting to plummet for me and I had to keep up the lies I was making to keep my only friend who cared about me. I dont remember exactly what happened but I do know that I hurt (girl) 's feelings over something. Things were really bad so I thought I would just tell her straight up hey, all that talk about me having a girlfriend was false.. I really like you and wanted to keep our friendship and stuff like that. At that point I was obsessed with her, but the only problem was that we were arguing over stuff and she got super pissed at me one day and just left me. I was super sad, I started to go into a depressive state and cry each night thinking about how she was the only real friend I've ever had and how she got me through the kids at school bullying me and my family thinking of me as a disappointment. Eventually, I decided to add her back on a new account and talk to her there, it was Christmas morning so i thought she would be more open to talk or whatever. We end up getting super close again for about a good month or so. Now, girl had a friend and I'll call her friend 2, she was awful.. she was a drama queen and still is, she is an attention whore. Their friendship was always on and off, and I was always there to guide her in it. This is where the story gets really really interesting, around feburary 2019, when someone who knew friend 2's brother and dated him for a while. I dont care about his privacy because idk i just dont care. His name was justin. This was around the time where I sat at a different table at lunch and the people were taking advantage of me in every way (I had no idea abt that) they told me to lead justin on and sext him and do all this weird gay shit that I was so uncomfortable with. Well through all of this, girl was single and I really liked her so I decided to ask her out. She was thinking about it the entire day and I started to worry. So i made the worst mistake ever, I asked justin out and he said yes (I am not gay and quite frankly I hated justin) I did that so I could tell girl that she had her chance and blah blah blah just to make her jealous and want me for anything. Well, that turned on me badly, lauren left me again and told me that she did have feelings for me and that I fucked up and I would regret it and all of this stuff (she now claims that she did not have feelings for me). I was sad of course because now I'd have to deal with my boyfriend which I did not want and I hated because I wasint gay. I realised then that I needed girl, girl was special to me and I missed her. I did the same thing that I did on Christmas again and it worked. She talked to me again but told me that I lost her trust and wouldint gain it back. I talked to her for weeks and eventually things were going well again. All up until valentines day. Girl was not single because she was now dating friend 1 because I dared her (dont ask why, I really dont know why I dared her that, it was stupid.) I posted on my snapchat story that I was alone on valentines day and did the basic wish I had someone thing and a senior responded to that saying she'll be my valentine (she was joking ofc but I said whatever and went with it) this really hurt girl for whatever reason. I didint think it would because she had a bf but this time she didint leave me. We ended up being good again and things were well finally for a while. Then our relationship was bumpy again, we argued constantly for weeks and our relationship became on and off again. I feel like this is starting to get long so I'll stop it here for the beginning part of the story. Please message me, I want to talk about this and get advice. I miss her. I fucked up. I love her.

The world doesn’t like people with issues or who are sick in anyway. We are broken and useless and yes those are words I have heard from people. 

I spend most of my days by myself and in my own head. It sucks, you rip yourself apart in every way possible including asking yourself why you are not good enough to have friends. I miss conversations with other people, fun ones and even intelligent ones. Sure, I have co-workers but those are typically short talks in the hallway and that is about it. Most of them aren’t friends outside the building and trust me, I have tried. I have learned over the years that co-workers usually don’t make great friends anyways. 

I remember back in school my parents would tell me it gets easier when you get older to make friends. I have to disagree, I think it is much harder now than it was as a kid. People tend to have more excuses as adults as to why they don’t have time to hang out or talk. The list seems to be endless at times…

People are too self-centered now, can’t see past their own world and can’t seem to see the importance of being friends with others.

I really care this people  but I don't show this so much and sometimes I see their faces like hostile. And that hurts so much. I really don't want to lose them so when I talk can't be relax. And sometimes something in my body keeps me to don't talk with them even I want it so much. 
And also I want to make another friendships too but sometimes I can't find topics or when their faces become neutral or bad I think like it is because of me and trying to finish the conversation. Also as I said the thing in my body effects that so much too. 
So folks. I really exhausted. For 17 years almost haven't been out with my friends and had fun. Almost haven't got a surprise from my friends and when I felt bad almost noone asked. 
So thank you guys to read them all. Maybe I did some mistakes, sorry about them.",lonely,Hey folks! Looking for advices,2019-05-01 19:54:10

A chance to forget about the five shitty previous years that ruined my adolescence and mental health, a chance to make new friends and maybe not be looked down upon or pitied by everyone else. A chance to actually gain even the smallest reputation in the school. 

But my two only friends are both leaving. One of them is moving abroad, and the other one's going away to a different school. I'm happy for both of them. It's a new page in their lives, something to embrace and be excited about.

 Except I'm going to be alone again! So fun! I get to spend my two years of sixth form with no friends and nothing to keep me excited about, just like high school! /S

I even reminded them that today was my birthday right before midnight. No one said a word. But they’ve made big deals about other people’s birthdays. Making sure to tell them as soon as the clock struck midnight and what not. They even were talking about how they needed to throw a party for another guy whose birthday is next month.

I’m going to clarify straight away that I do have. A lot of problems, I’m mildly autistic, I have depression and anxiety, I’m self destructive and I’m really good at pushing people away. I have been in several relationships and two of them have been abusive, I was cheated on, gaslighted, verbally and mentally abused, people laugh at males in abusive relationships, but you really don’t understand unless you’ve been through it. I’m not here for a relationship, nor am I here looking for someone to pile all of my troubles onto, several years ago I would of done that but I have learned now. I’ve tried so many different therapists and medications, but I know deep down that the only thing I really need is human interaction. Since leaving high school three years ago I have had nobody, me and my family aren’t close and I’m really not good at keeping friendships going. I just hope someone sees this and will give me a chance, I know I am pathetic for begging, but please, just give me a chance. 

My name is Joseph, I’m 19 and I’m from England. I’m pretty athletic, and I’m also a massive nerd so I really don’t know if I can be considered a nerdy jock but there you go. In high school I was the captain of the football team, I dated the head cheerleader, just the typical stuff, but since leaving I have had nobody. When I was 17 my long term girlfriend passed away from cancer, and after that I entered an incredibly abusive relationship where she just used me and hurt me everyday and I was never strong enough to stand up to her until one day. I really don’t know what else to say, I don’t want to list all of my interests because that’s boring and if anyone does decide to talk to me we’d have nothing to talk about anyway, but, if you think you could give me a chance, then you will have no idea how much it would mean to me.",lonely,"Incredibly lonely, just looking for someone who will accept me",2019-05-01 09:25:38

I'm 16, english and... I don't wanna say I hate my life but I'm not too happy with it for reasons that I'm not entirely sure I want to go on about here. I'm sure you'll all understand.

I spend most of my time wasting away in my room being completely ignorant to the world probably playing xbox or listening to music.

I realise halfway through writing this its probably got no flow or doesn't make sense.

As the title suggests I'm looking for real friends and by that I mean not just people who I'll talk to for a month or so and then just forget, someone who will last and I can trust.

I have no ""requirements"" except that I'd prefer any potential friends to be around my age (16) but that's not a big deal to me really. You don't have to share interests or anything I just want someone great that I can talk with and have a good time with. You don't even need to be in the same country as me I don't get out much anyway and would probably be too awkward to meet anyone irl.

If your interested in talking to me more just message me.

I think I'm about done now sorry for any potential spelling mistakes or repetition or anything like that.

Well, I have broken up with my girlfriend -- a couple of months ago, and I... I feel like everything's fucking fucked for me.. I feel really alone, and don't really have friends, except for one, but he's busy with his girlfriend, life, etc.

She was my whole world, I mean.. Everyday, all day I used to text her, and make her my number one priority, some days, I would be spending lots of days with her, I felt like this was it, she was ""the one"", we were thinking about the future, we wanted a life with eachother.

But, she...She treated me like shit, there were moments she would just say that I'm useless, or that I needed to grow up (We were 18 btw), and a lot of stuff that I can't shake off to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never felt this lone.

I have no one to text to

No one to go out with

Nothing.

I feel really empty, and cold.

And I'm really scared that I'll just grow cold, I'm a really warm guy,I really like showing my love for  someone, but lately, I'm starting to feel more like..Numb.. For example; Things that used to make me cry, now don't really seem to have an effect on me. Don't get me wrong, I cry, a lot.

But sometimes, I don't really feel anything. At all.

This is my second reddit post ever so forgive me if i do it wrong.

So here goes...

i'm looking to chat to people (guys or gals) as recently i realised i've hardly any friends irl and none online and was looking to change that. the reason for this is i'm feeling lonely and usually that was fine by me but now i've sorta lost my confidence in like everything i do irl. like literally just so bored of my own space now. i don't know if reddit is the best place to do this as i know there's a few trolls on it but thought i'd give it a try.

so here's a bit about myself.

i'm 21, male,interested in gaming, i like films - my favourite genre is romance which i know sounds pretty weird but guess i'm just a big sop. i like writing and looking to start a blog about everything i've experienced in life in hopes that if someone has experienced the same or experiencing the same then i can help them deal with it.i love books but i'm dyslexic so it's definitely a task to read. i like sarcasm and humour which may not be for everyone, i guess it helps me to laugh things off rather than dwell on them anyway if you want to know more message me or reply to this post and we can sort somthing out ( like sharing names on a different app or whatever )",lonely,looking to make friends,2019-05-01 01:52:07
