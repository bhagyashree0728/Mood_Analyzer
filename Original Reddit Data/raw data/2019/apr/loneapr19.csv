It's not the first time - I text with a girl for 3-4 days, it's going fantastic from both sides - we have actual conversations - we set a place and time to meet in real life. The day comes, the date either gets cancelled, I get ghosted, or even today - deleted and also blocked on instagram out of nowhere.   


It's so disrespectful. I put my time and energy into it, and they don't reciprocate. I honestly feel like giving up on dating altogether or just losing all my expectations. Maybe I should only put minimum effort when I get a match. No more conversations. I'll just ask if they want to go on a walk.

3,Norshimor,1556619119,1,"Hey guys, I (m21) am new to this Reddit and hope that I won't break any community rules, if I do please notify me and I will edit accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

Allright so first off all some background on myself:

I'm quite honestly extremely extraverted, easy talker to the point where I helped others who were introverted to get out of their shell. Used to work in a bar and everyone in that entire street, different businesses and bars knew and (as far as I knew) liked or at least tolerated me.

Even though all this was the case I didn't have any close friends, the whole typical know alot of people but having barely if any 'true' friends. Throughout my entire life I've never had more than about 2 or 3 really close friends which (appart from one) never lasted more than 2 years. 

I moved out about a year ago and I've never been so lonely in my life. I have a stable job, good income and about 3 'true' friends. They are however extremely busy and I meet up about 1/2 times a month. The fact that I meet people outside of work so rarely makes the loneliness way worse. Essentially the fact that I have someone around me for one night makes the time between those moments horrible.

I am in this state where I work, go home, work, smoke a joint to dull my mind and sleep. Every day. I honestly don't know what to do with myself and the only conclusion I've been able to make to fix this is completely cut off contact with everyone and just focus on working and get used and accept being alone to get rid of the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Extremely lonely but see people once in a while, seriously considering to cut off contact to ease the pain.",lonely,Thinking about removing contact with everyone,2019-04-30 20:11:59

However, I always find myself feeling lonely. During high school, I was always surrounded by my close friends (who I am still close with), and after high school, I started going to college. My friends went away from the city, and I stayed home. Fast forward two years, I took a break from college and started working two jobs, and it was great, but there was always something missing. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, what do I do to stop this feeling? I've tried all of my coping skills, going to the gym, hiking, yoga, meditation, art, music, traveling, etc. Is there something that I'm missing? Is there something maybe I'm not quite understanding?

22,SubZero9712,1556579943,2,"The last few weeks of my life have been extremely difficult for me and I have never felt more lonely in my entire life. I can’t help but watch as my life spirals out of control. The love of my life seems to be slipping away from me, while my career seems to be cruising at a steady pace to come to a sturdy halt.

My whole life I’ve learned to accept loneliness as a friend. I’m an only child, and had no other children to interact with in my life until I was 6. Despite being an only child, I have always felt the constant need to be perfect and successful to please my parents and to gain their love. I’ve never had a close relationship with either, and amongst many arguments I’m consistently made out to be blatantly disrespectful, worthless, and ignorant. 

Consistently being alone and being socially awkward because of it, I had very few friends, and was constantly bullied until I was a sophomore in high school. Throughout the years I’ve battled severe anxiety. While I got older and closed out high school, I became “that funny friend” to a lot of people, and I became someone a lot of people came to seek advice, lay down some heavy stuff, or talk to when times got tough. I loved helping other people everyday, however it got old very quickly as I soon found that while other people came to me for help, I was routinely brushed away when I was the one in need of help, or good humor.

Still to this day, (Currently 21) I constantly feel belittled by glooming shadows of anxiety as I struggle to come to terms with my life as it is falling apart. I feel as though my problems are inescapable and I have no where left to turn to. In the grand scheme of things, my career, my parents, etc. are all subpar problems when compared to my girlfriend, because if I lose her then I’m losing my whole world.

Just seeing everyone around me with they're friends and having a good time, it saddens and angers me at the same time. I envy them. Why I can't be like them? 

No one really bothers the kids who are alone at lunch, which is good because they're not getting picked on, but no one is checking up on them. It's funny how people come running when they see that you're crying, but completely ignore you when you *look* fine on the outside. 

Seeing all these couples around me makes me feel bad about myself. I want to be in a relationship, but no one talks to me...some guys stare at me sometimes but other than that. Nothin'. 

I'm really shy and awkward. I *know* that starting a conversation is as simple as complimenting someone's outfit or pointing out that you have the same music tastes, but it just feels like I'd be bothering them. 

I don't really smile and look angry/sad all the time so maybe that's why people don't approach me. 

Once this random kid asked me for my number, but he was 14..I'm 18 so I said no. Then he and his friends started laughing, and they were staring at us while he asked me. 

I guess it was some stupid dare. But it hurt. It honestly did, I almost cried. 

I'm even finding myself observing people when they talk. As if I'm an alien trying to mimic human interaction, like I'm kind of robot. 

I'm not going to hurt myself. It just really fucking sucks. I want to be social, but the only socializing I've really done is bad (in my mom's eyes). Hooking up with guys from dating apps. 

I don't have dating apps anymore because I got in trouble with my mom but that was my only source of meeting people. Online makes it so much better for me.

I'm gay but also lean towards women on occasion. I ain't fat, if anything underweight. Thin. I relate quite well to the rejection of weight. Overweight men and women are always complaining about being rejected because of their weight, how often do you hear skinny person complain? Well here is one complaining. Skinny shaming is a thing.

  
Everyone around me tells me I am attractive and handsome, I look good for my age. Most place me between 21 and 25. I don't think I am that attractive. I am introvert and find it difficult to approach people offline so I spent a lot of my time via online dating sites. I spent ten years on them. All of them. Looking for that supposed equal that supposedly exists. Sure I met people, many, all over the planet, they didn't stick around. Sure I have been in relationships, but the last one I was in was 2013. Since then I maybe net one or two dates a year. Sex is rare too.

  
 I've had many tell me how sexy, cute, hot I am. I have even had a slight few tell me that I might be too attractive. I don't think I am that attractive. But if I am, you think being attractive is easy livin and gets you plenty of lays? No. If it did I wouldn't be on here bitching about not getting what I want.  I've been on plenty of dating sites and hookup apps. I've had people tell me they want to date, fuck, sleep with me, etc. Every time I ask if they want to meet up and do so, they balk, they cop out.  


Offline? I've tried. I've tried Pride events, LGBT+ meet ups, I've tried bars. I've tried social groups. I've tried everything. Nobody wants to chat. They just push me away. I'm not a mean spirited person. I wear a smile on my face everywhere I go. I'm friendly, chill, live and let live. I wear my heart on my sleeve, I am involved with my community. I have a nice job, a place of my own, family and friends. I got issues, sure, I admit that. Everyone has issues, but those are kept in check and under control.

  
But its just... nothing. Nothing works. And I am so fucking alone. As stated earlier I often feel overlooked. I have met people from other parts of the country and planet and they said the  same to me. They said that people are shitty. That I am a handsome and respectable guy who deserves to be with someone. My family and friends say the same.

  
I know a lot of people out there find themselves in the same position as I do. But they always have something holding them back. Something that they need to change about themselves. They are the source of their own problems. Me? I honestly believe there are some of us, like myself who no matter what we do, no matter whom we speak to, no matter how nice and friendly we are. Nobody gives a shit. There is literally nobody out there for us. Some of us are truly made to be alone. And I am one of them and that hurts.",lonely,Single and lonely...,2019-04-30 01:20:51

51,Davey_Aero,1556520242,2,"Life has been interesting. I'm 18 now and went through a pretty normal childhood. My parents are divorced but that's pretty common. Up to 2 to 3 years ago In sophomore year of high school I felt like a normal kid. Dating, making friends, doing shit 15 year olds do. Never drugs or dumb shit I was always against being an idiot. At this time I started to become full of myself and developed a very different philosophical religion. Where I wanted to be more than just a normal boring person. I wanted to be something but not something to people. Something bigger than us humans. Because of gaining this mindset I started thinking I was so much better than everyone else and that they did not understand what the world really is. That it is a neverending die repeat and you have limited time to live a life worth living. I pushed many of my friends away because they became nothing to me but mindless meat suits with no understanding of life. Now let me remind that I never acted this way in person, only thought it and on the outside I would consider myself very good at faking personality. High school went by and it is almost a year after I graduated. Now I am at a point where I work a decent amount to pay for what I need to pay for with a bit over to try and entertain myself with games. But, the thing is, is that it's tough not being showing people what you really think for years. Faking every reaction and interaction you have to be politically correct in this society. Currently I am waiting for something to happen. I believe if I am meant for something than something higher will grant me it. If not then oh well. But thinking this way is very lonely. And I know loneliness is just a emotion created in the brain and means nothing but it is has to get rid of. If you've read this whole thing so far I would expect you think I'm fucking insane and I might agree. But its who I've been for a while but I could change it because it fucking sucks. Everyone had a goal in life and for me I've never had one. But now I do and it seems impossible because of how I am. I just want someone like me to talk to and be with. To be each others lost halves until mortality consumes us. I'm not a weird guy I would think I'm actually very energetic and talkative. I love a good story. Some of my favorite films are Death Note and Butterfly Effect. I feel kinda twisted typing this because at first I was at a God complex but now I'm just lonely and want my other half.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 21 in Uni

&amp;#x200B;

After I moved schools my senior year of highschool I have been met with alot of bad luck socially. I do very well in school and money isnt that big of a problem for me as I am in school on scholarship and stuff. But making friends and connections with people have been a negative for about 4 years now going on to 5. I dont want to say it has anything to do with looks as I may not be stunning but i have heard good things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent the best part of the past 4 years playing World of Warcraft alone in my room which was mainly where I got the most of my social interactions from. Now despite the picture I have painted for you I do not struggle speaking to people as I am in stem and have to present research in front of large crowds several times a semester, I have a small presentation this tuesday and a very large one on May 8th. I also dont have trouble speaking to people when its casual but do find it difficult to talk to people below surface level conversations, I find many people to be dull. I say dull meaning I dont share any interest with people mainly because there is nothing interesting about me and after I quit playing wow a few weeks ago I have spent a large chunk of my time sleeping in till my next class or watching The Office till I fall asleep again. Life honestly is starting to feel pointless but thats a whole other story.

&amp;#x200B;

Mainly the biggest part of this post is this,

After so much time being alone and mostly emotionless I met this girl at the gym. I noticed this girl back in freshman year but two weeks ago( now a junior going on to senior year) I asked her for her phone number. We went out last Wednesday and spent the whole night at a beach talking and drinking beers. Honestly the whole night was out of a movie and was just beautiful in my eyes. The girl is one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen hence it taking so long to talk to her. Well over the course of the night she asked me how old I thought she was. She looked around 22 years old but she then told me she was 27. Honestly I was shocked as she just looked amazing and I would have never guessed. I understand a 21 year old and 27 wouldn't work long term although hell i would try if she would let me.

&amp;#x200B;

We still hung out and laughed and drank for a good 3 more hours after she told me here age, we even spoke for a few more days after texting each day and things. Honestly i thought maybe there was something there, she was sending me cute photos of her ( nothing explicit just her smiling and of her cats and stuff). However today (Sunday) she texted me saying things wont work out and we should stop talking you get the idea, it felt so random.

&amp;#x200B;

What this message showed me though was how badly I actually longed for affection, as corny as it sounds but I hadnt really thought of any other person the way I had thought about this girl and I only knew her for 3 days. I actually feel like something is missing now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else ever experienced this, I actually used to think there was something wrong with me because I didnt really show much emotion and now its like Im feeling them all at once.  She still has another two years on her masters program and I have another year till graduation and am already thinking of getting a pHD just not at this school but at least ill still see her for another year as I see her at the gym daily but it still hurts.

Years  ago I found it really easy to socialize but at that time I was  basically living with a crafted personality specialize for the purpose,  now that I'm no longer hiding behind fake smiles I really fear human  nature, I can't be myself because I don't appeal, I've tried being kind  but it seems indivituality is more important than humbleness.

Even  if I've become so scared of human nature due to contact though I wish I  could just feel the joy of having an relationship again, having someone  to be there by your side has to be a great thing and I feel like I  forgot what it was

But for me, getting better would be having a group of friends that trust me, so I guess I’m never getting out of this vicious cycle.
Even when I talk to people about this, they talk to me in a tone of pity, instead of helping me build a friend group. Which is worse, because I feel like I have to be fake to get friends, but being fake has backfired every single time.

Everyone seems to be drifting away from me. Even my friends who I know and see in person are starting to fade away from me. I don't know why. I need to find out what's wrong with me so I can improve myself so people stop pushing me away when they get bored of me. I'm nice to people and don't really have any arguments with anyone because I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm trying not to cry whilst writing this but I can't keep it in any longer. I don't remember the last time I cried about anything emotional but I can't keep going like this. I don't know what to do anymore. I have 4 friends left. And I can't trust any of them with any of this. I can't even trust them with a secret. They never message me unless they don't have anyone else to talk to. I'm bottom of their list when it comes to friends who they want to go out with or talk to. Basically I'm a worthless piece of shit that has no purpose in life. I will keep going and I won't end it, but I feel like all I have left is college work. But where will a levels take me? Yeah, I'll go to uni and might end up with a well paid job, but no amount of money could ever help me if I don't have anything else. I wish that one morning I just wouldn't wake up and that'd be the end. I won't commit suicide, and I'm not having any thoughts about comitting suicide, but I wouldn't care if I was to die. And I don't think other people would care either. I don't really know what else to type. I don't really want to go too far into my thoughts because I don't think you should have to see some of them. I'm not in a good place at the moment and I don't see how anything will ever improve. Even all of my friends that I've made online have stopped talking to me. All of them. I've had about 8 or 9 in total, about 3 of which I've made in the past 4 months, and every one of them has stopped talking to me. Sometimes they come up with an excuse as to why they can't talk to me, sometimes they fade away, and sometimes they just stop suddenly without an explanation. I don't blame any of them for this. It's something wrong with me - it's happened to many times for there to be any other reason. There's something wrong with me but no one has told me what, and I've thought about why people stop talking to me and I guess it's because I must be boring. Talking to me is about as good as eating the same meal every day - it's good at first but gets boring after a while and eventually you stop eating it completely. Maybe then there might be the occasional message/meal, but each time you remember how boring it is and why you stopped.

 I don't even know what I'm saying now.  I can't give up but I know I can't continue like this for much longer. I've been crying for the past 15 minutes typing this and I'll continue to cry once I've sent it, I can let myself cry for once over something emotional. It's ok to cry. I need to.

This day I went up to this girl and told her I wanted to ask her a question really quick. I was planning to ask her if I could get to know her better or hang out with her sometime, she was cute and seemed pretty cool so I wanted to see how things would go...but the second I said that I wanted to ask her something she replied ""I have a feeling whatever you're asking is going to make me uncomfortable"".

I can't unbiasedly tell you how I am as a friend but when it comes to relationships, #1 priority is my fiancé, then my family, then my friends.

Having migrated to Vancouver, Canada from the Philippines, I've lost most of my close highschool friends - only 2 I'm still in touch with but because I'm so far away and the time difference, I feel like I'm losing the meaningful connection.

I treat my fiancé as my bestfriend but I just feel like if I depend on him too much, what if he disappears one day? And now, I'm somewhat depressed because I can't think of anyone to be my bridesmaid at our wedding. I get jealous of people when I see pictures of them with 6 bridesmaids or when they're having a bachelorette party. 

Whenever my fiancé travels out of province for work, I'm usually at home doing nothing and I have no friends to hang out with. I work in an office of only 5 people, including me, but they're all in their 40s and they have children to take care of.

I have been living in Vancouver for 8 years now and I have never been able to keep a close friend. I have no family here so it's harder to invite someone out to do things when my fiancé is away.

92,Xixiphoid,1556460696,1,"I've heard the saying that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, but no one ever tells you how long the tunnel is. 

Guess I'll start with a little about life. I grew up as a child of the state, bounced from abusive foster homes and group homes. My mother was a drug addict, my father wasn't in my life. I always had a hard time trusting people or getting close to others due to how I always was treated. When I turned 18 I was discharged from DCF (child protective services) as they could ""no longer help me"", and I was left to be on my own, homeless no family and no friends. I wanted to keep going, I thought if I put my all into finding my own happiness I would be rewarded for not giving up so that what I did. Got into Job Corps to get my GED, ended up leaving before I completed my vocation due to being bullied and harassed for being the only homeless kid there. So back on the streets I was once again, traveled a lot and did random odd jobs I found along the way to keep myself feed, all the while keeping that thought in my mind "" my hard work will pay off someday"".

Got my first place at 22, it was a month to month place, not a great area but it was my first true home I felt. Then everything fell apart. I had found a job that was over night, while at work everything in my apartment was stolen, coming back to find what little I had worked so hard for was gone was heart breaking. I no longer felt safe in my own place, a place I had worked so hard for no longer felt like home, it felt like a cage. The stress had affected my sleep and my work performance, and just like that I had lost it all. I felt so lost, like I had failed because I wasn't strong enough to grasp what was going on and cope with it. So I decided that maybe this happened because I wasn't meant to be here, so I picked a random direction and just kept walking.

I lived outside for what felt like forever, keeping my distance from others out of what felt like fear. I learned to make my own shelter, to find my own food and to never stay in one spot for more then a few day. I did this up until I had gotten badly hurt. I wont get into details, but I ended up with a large gash on the left side of my neck that ended up getting badly infected to the point others had taken notice of it. I was picked up by a stranger who had brought my to the hospital where I spent 3 weeks recovering. When I was allowed to leave they pointed me to a local homeless shelter, I never like the idea of going to a shelter but I thought "" maybe I can make some friends"" so I checked in.

The shelter was a nightmare, I was 24 when I was there and it felt like the longest 4 months of my life. The people I met were hollow shells of people, broken by life. I knew I didn't want to be like them, I wanted to be valued, to have self worth, to be happy. Then my lucky break happened, I got a job at a local gas station.

Because of this job I was able to stabilize, I had saved up while in the shelter to get an efficiency. I felt so happy, I felt like my hard work had paid off. I had achieved my childhood dream of having a home, even though it was empty, it was home and more importantly it was MY home, something I had earned. I didn't have a lot of money but I had a roof over me, and safe place to rest at last. I worked that job for 2yrs still I felt I should try to improve more.

I got a job at an amazon warehouse, I felt like things were getting better, I had built up my little room was able to get a bed after 2yrs of sleeping on the floor. But there was this gnawing in the back of my mind, it still felt empty. No matter how hard I had tried to talk with others around me that connection just never formed. I had achieved a goal in my life, but I had no one to share it with.

Then it happened, a year and a half of working and I was let go. I used what little I had saved up to hold on to my little place for as long as I could, but I had once again failed. Everything I had worked so hard for, gone just like that. It was starting to get cold outside. So I though ""I can't do another winter outside, where do I go""?

So here I am, I ended up in Florida. I was able to find a job, and I currently live out a cheap motel while I try to figure out what to do. I've had a hard time sleeping more then 3hrs a night. All I do is work and sleep, I'm afraid to try to make a connection with others now. I'm in a relationship ( the one person I made a connection with at amazon). She stays with a co-worker about 15 miles from me, we don't get to spend time together and I've felt so disconnected from everyone around me, from the things I used to like. I feel like I've lost my drive and no longer know what to do.

I just recently joined and found this subreddit which is something what I wanted to come across for months now. It’s so nice seeing that so many other people feel the same that I do.

I’ve only had one serious relationship. Being able to experience such amazing things with somebody for the first time was a once in a lifetime feeling. As of now, it’s been more than a year since that relationship ended.

I never understood how it felt to sleep alone or being alone at odd hours of the night unable to sleep until after everything ended. Ofc, I felt this shit before but it was much harder afterwards. Every single night I lay here and dream of the day I’ll get to be with somebody that I love and enjoy being accompanied by. It almost seems draining and hopeless. My dream night would be getting high and watching the dumbest or scariest movies with an amazing girl. But, it feels so far away and depressing. Some nights I can’t sleep until 5 or 6 because I get so in depth with my thoughts. And it seems like every girl who laughs or smiles at me, I have a crush on them. I’m so desperate for love and i’m not shameful about it. I want something real and unique, not something rushed or forced. But its so hard not to rush into stuff when I want it so fucking bad.

This is just to help me feel at least a bit better I guess, don't even know if that's gonna work but, here goes nothing.


I'm tired of being alone, and being alive, and whatever are the responsabilities of being alive in today's world. Also I don't have any friends left. Well, that's not true, I do have two friends, but I barely speak to them anymore and they both live far away, so I haven't talked to anyone in a long time.

I don't have goals, I don't have dreams, to be honest I'd like to live as a medieval hermit, somewhere random, hidden; that is, without refusing the use of modern medicine, of course. But I digress.


I'm tired of sitting in front of beautiful landscapes, and enjoying the simple beauty of nature and the city with its cathedral in the distance (I live in France, idk if there are many cathedrals outside europe tbh), behind the fields and the woods down my street, without having anyone to enjoy it with. 

I'm not necessarily talking about romantic relationships, I'm just tired of having never met people who like the same things as me; simple things, no talking in people's back all the time and complaining about the drama, what school's 84th Stacy said about Chad or if Adam is a virgin or not, I just want to experience once more the feeling of spending time with just *one* other human being and enjoying it.


I don't want to go to school when my teachers treat me like trash, and I was forced into something I didn't want to study (wanted to do 'L' studies — which are literary studies here in France —, but my parents said it wouldn't get me any job) so obviously I don't study much. There's no such thing as afterclass clubs here, so, can't really make new friends that way.


The romantic relationship subject is a whole other story, I've never been in one, and I don't really care about it, since I'm not a good person and I don't want to hurt anyone. I won't go much into it, as this is already way too long, but basically my hobbies are trash, I'm not rich, I'm short, ugly, I have anger issues with my siblings, hell I'm not even intelligent.


I can't draw for my life despite practicing for a decade and taking lessons, too lazy to learn an instrument, not good at sports, basically I don't have any talent (except rambling on the Internet, that I do well). I just kind of... exist, I guess. 

Which makes me feel like a waste of human space, amongst almost 8 billion other humans, who have much more potential than I do. Seeing how a large percentage of the population live, I feel so bad for complaining about stuff like loneliness, what kind of piece of utter garbage am I to be sad when there are so many people without drinkable water out there.


I've considered suicide sometimes, because why the frick not, literally no one would miss me except my parents, but they would forget me in like, two days, so whatever. You die anyway in the end, may it be tomorrow in a car accident or of old age in a few decades; but I don't really have the balls to do it, so don't worry, I won't be tickling my guts with a knife or drinking bleach anytime soon, I think.

I suppose everything all comes down to natural selection. You may think this is a stupid way of thinking, but it does make sense if you think of it, because as I said: I'm ugly, short, my personality is trash, I have poor mental health, I'm not rich... It only makes sense that I wouldn't have any friend. Or girlfriend/boyfriend. If I don't have anything to bring into anyone's life, then why should they bother?


Well, I think that's it. I do actually feel slightly better, so I guess that's good. If you read that entirely, thank you I guess.

It’s hard to explain an entire life situation in text alone, but I’ll try my best. I’ve always been a lonely person. Maybe everyone is. But it’s been very pressing most recently, throughout the past couple of years. I have a decent amount of friends irl and a few online but anyone who shares my same interests is one of the ones living a good distance away.

It hurts a little when I see some of those friends where they live hanging out with all their irl friends who have the same interests and consistently being able to talk and hang out with each other.

I’m very unmotivated to pursue and work on.... anything. Part of the reason why seems to be because I have no friends pushing me and being by my side wanting to do those exact same activities. I try to explain this to people by asking them to think of their most favorite hobby and “what if you knew that nearly nobody  around you liked that and, sure, online people did but even within the state you live it isn’t exceptionally popular”... kind of thing.

If it sounds like I’m being vague, it’s because I am haha. Getting too specific means explaining so much, it would take me forever to get all my thoughts out. It also helps a reader inject themselves mire easily (hopefully) to be able to understand....

I just don’t know what to do. I’ve tried finding people but being introverted and a number of other non-social things certainly doesn’t help my case. All I want is friends who /enjoy the same things/ which doesn’t SOUND hard?? Yet it’s been impossibly almost.

From a learning/career perspective, I've learned so much and made so many strides. Arguably more than most of my peers. Viewed through the academic achievement lens, its been a success. But I feel like I'm leaving school after 4 years with 0 friends. Now, obviously I have some friends, but no-one I've ever felt close to. I always try and be an outgoing, nice, helpful, funny person, but for some reason I have close to no close friends. I feel like a have a bunch of casual, ""hey, how's it going"" friends, like in passing, but nobody I can ever talk to, share my life with, and hear about theirs. I think what didn't help in college was the fact that I am a pretty strictly straight-edge kind of guy. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't like to party, I don't go to clubs (I despise that vibe), and I've stayed far from it. It seems like social groups formed in freshman and sophomore year around parties and then those groups ended up becoming closer friends who do things, but I am never invited to anything. I never have been, and I think about the fact that I wouldn't enjoy them anyway, but it just feels terrible. Social media and instagram stories etc. make things worse. Like I feel actively UN-invited when looking at other people socializing and having fun, and I just don't know what to do. Anyone else feel like this and have any ideas/solutions?

First of all, I hope everyone is having a good day.

I've had depression for a large part of my life, but recently felt like I got over it. Until yesterday. It's still here, lurking. I don't have anyone that I can lean on, even though many people say that they support me. It's not them though, it's me. I just can't bring myself to have any serious conversations. I'm always the one cracking jokes or just acting happy all the time (I sometimes even believe it).

Don't get me wrong, though. I'm very thankful for everything that I currently have. I'm just seeking advice on how to handle this.

I am super isolative/anti-social (because of anxiety) , yet when there was a school event like a football game or something, I'd attend. Just for some form of interaction with the outside world you know?

Earlier this year, I dropped out of highschool because of my mental health and I didn't have the highschool credits in order to graduate ( because of my MH).  So... I dropped out.

The decision was very tough on me, I knew I wouldn't have a normal late-teen experience. Senior pictures, senior pranks... I can't have that ever in my life. 

I was always lonely at school, nobody talked to me and I am too anxious to talk to anyone(I had delayed speech because of horrible hearing and people made fun of that so I just stopped talking unless spoken to).

When I made the decision, I KNEW I would be in isolation. And it's making me feel angry at myself,   because the only human interactions I have is my family, was school, and work. I don't start work until a couple of weeks and my family is gone all week because of work and school.

i just feel l dont know encouraged maybe because of all the post l read here and that l am not alone.

So foe as long as l can rebember l was always alone. In kinder garden primary school, l mean l always had someone l cound talk to but not on personal level realy. Now in college still the same. l do have people l can sit with but if they go for lunch on break they just get up and dont even look at me. So there l am sitting and on my phone listening to yt or podcast just so l can feel like someone is talking to me. And l tried everything l asked many people where is the problem, but they just say its not me and that l am nice and whatever...but pretty much end up saying l am weird and unuproachable. l dont know l am tired of trying l do always text and ask them how was their day or if they have problems with homework...they never ask me. l often offer my snacks. l just cant do it any more. 2 weeks back l broke up with my bf because he just thought l would never leave him because he knew l dont have any one else plus l he is dick. ln short he discouragedme from college, he is homofobic sorry if you got so far l am jus rambling now...

The point is l just cant feel anything from the day we broke up l didnt cry or felt happy realy. For two weeks l am just drifing it feels like and it does for some time now. Plus my friend from secondary school (we text mostly) she just wrote me ....she wants to end this relationship because she does not have energy for me.

and afraid to lose her i told her: ""no what are you talking about"" (smile on my face like everything's ok:)). i was broken that day on that day i lost my self thinking about her depression, stress, anxiety EVERYTHING fell down on my head. i became anti social didnt want to hang out with anyone spent 2016 summer alone when eveyone invited me somewhere. sfter that i was kinda allright.

I have always been an avid reader and I love to have conversations with people about things they are passionate about.   	Ø I love to run, hike, rock climb and lift weights. Staying active is a way for me to clear my mind and relax. Recovering from a major knee surgery so I’ve been laid up most of the last 8 months but starting to get the wheels rolling again.   	Ø Music is a huge part of my life, I play guitar and almost always have something playing. I enjoy a lot of variety and love to find new artist, songs, styles to try out. Make suggestions!!  	Ø A creative outlet is important for my sanity. I enjoy writing &amp; sketching. It’s refreshing and expressive for me to get it out on paper and see that physical translation of thoughts to creation.   	Ø As far as looks I’m tall and large at 6’2”, 240 lbs. Not the best shape of my life at the moment because of the knee surgery but the road to recovery is started and I’m setting some goals for the summer! I could always use an accountability buddy so we can both rock our summer bodies 🤷🏻‍♂️💪🏻.  Dark brown hair and whiskey brown eyes.

One of my good friends overseas ended up chatting to me as well for most of the week and our friendship strengthened quite a lot over the past few days and the last night we even ended up video chatting for 8 or 9 hours and fell asleep together mid call.

As for the other two we had our usual banter and i cooked for them each night and we just played games the entire week on our PC's and stayed up to stupid late hours.

Fast foward to now (some hours later) and its gone, its just fucking gone, it feels like a distant memory now, back the usual shit cycle of 24/7 lonliness and being constantly depressed and craving companionship, i had no idea how good i had it and just like that im back to my stomach literally hurting from the mere thought of something like holding someones hand (see previous post for more on that).

I’ve been a lurker for a long time, and I’m not sure if this is the right spot to post this, but I just needed to get this out of my system.

Anyways, as the title said, I’ve been facing loneliness for several years now, but I was doing a pretty good job of ignoring it and I didn’t realize how lonely I felt. That all changed yesterday, when I went to prom with the girl I have a huge crush on after she asked me to go with her. The whole night was somewhat of a struggle for me because I believe I have social anxiety, and I was extremely nervous about messing up my chance with her or making a fool of myself in front if everyone. Even with my anxieties, I think I managed to be much more outgoing and fun than my usual quiet and boring self, so not everything yesterday was so negative. After it was done and on the bus ride back, I fell asleep on her shoulder, and I think it was this little thing that finally brought back my loneliness. I’ve never had a girlfriend and I hardly have any friends who are girls, so this was kinda a big deal for me. I drove her home in awkward silence, but I think that was mostly because it was like 3 in the morning and we were exhausted. After I woke up this morning, I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened. It was just so nice to just have someone there, and it was nice to share some physical contact with her, even if it was minuscule. I finally realize what I have been missing, so now I’m laying in my room regretting my past inactions and feeling sorry for myself. I really want to date this girl, but I don’t think she’s into me. We also graduate in a few weeks, and she is going away for most of the summer. I don’t know how to deal with this situation, and I don’t want to be alone anymore.

  But yeah... I was in the shower and I just cried. I cried for a while. I couldn't even let it all out cause my mom was in the living room. So it was a painful forced silently cry.

Early last year I had a pretty horrible break up with my ex where 6 months leading to the crash I was trying to rebuild the relationship after being an awful angry drunk to her. I was so drunk I don’t even remember most of what happened but for a real long time the things my ex said I said made me feel sick and disgusted at myself. I think the main reason I was trying to rebuild that relationship was for redemption which never came so after the break up and losing all my self esteem I felt desperate to be back with someone, even just a kiss from a girl just so that I could prove myself I’m not that awful and to feel attractive again.
Ever since all my run in with girls has been awful, essentially just being treated like dirt and having my time and energy wasted. Maybe it’s karma for what I did to my ex but the feeling of loneliness and the desperation to fill the hole in me really just ate away at me and whenever I did anything to self improve myself it felt it wasn’t really for me and my passion but more so that I could impress a potential girl that I’m interested in, which just isn’t right as I wasn’t motivated properly.
I noticed it wasn’t right probably 8 months ago but I honestly didn’t know how I could change my mindset so that I was motivated the right way. Weirdly enough what has helped me focus on doing what I want to do for myself was realised with what I want my students at my dance classes to get out of me. Especially in the last month I’ve been really feeling I want to be someone the kids look up to and be inspired by. While it’s still for people outside of me for some reason this makes me feel it’s for the right intentions and more connected to doing it for myself rather than a potential lover. Now I really enjoy staying at home and not worry about having to be out so that I could maybe meet someone, not only that but I’m really feeling the benefit of not having to use time and energy on dates and having constantly to think about a girlfriend.

Backstory 
In 2016 dad told me several times (before going to high school) to not to do drugs and alcohol

But it attracted me more more. 

I end up smoking weed and drinking (like every once a month). 

Then in may, the cops caught my friends dealing and i was there as witness. 

My dad was very dissapointed in me and it took me loong time to gain a percentage of his trust.. 



Fast forward to this year. 

When he sometimes asked me of what did i do or where did my money go i was little scared of telling him the truth (not that i did something wrong) but i was scared to tell him bcs i though he wouldnt trust me. 

A week ago he told me i can go to a party but if i come wasted he will kick me out of house (he didnt mean it literally but you get the point) 
My best buddy had 18th birthday so i was like ok i will drink a bit, but it went too far. Then my friend dropped me home, parents were sleeping so it was good. 

But i did something that night (its too long, more depth-in family thing) and now i told my sister (cuz dad loves her more than me, he actually loves every sibling except me) that i got drunk etc

She told me not to talk to him (cuz i mess up everytime we talk) so she talked to him for me (by calling, he’s abroad) and he told her that he’s not angry or mad, but he’s very hurt because after i long time i gained his trust and i let him down yet again. And he’s very dissapointed in me.

I was making plans to go watch the movie with this 'friend group' of mine, and half the people aren't in town, so the remaining people weren't able to decide in time, and we lost the available shows.

Turns out, this one fucker had been holding out on us, he already had tickets with another group, he knew we were planning to go, and then the asshole sends me a pic of him watching the movie. Now he tells us he'll come again with us when we go watch the movie. Like buddy, you aren't welcome anymore, there was no need to hide the fact that you had tickets.

Another guy said his exams are on so he couldn't come watch it with us. Fine, that's understandable. Guess what, he sent me a pic today too, with him outside the cinema going in to watch the movie.

Again, I know this is just a movie, but it's the sentiment that counts. The very fact that you don't tell other people that you already have tickets, and then disrupt their planning shows what your priorities are.

It's a very personal and minor thing I'm saying, but for someone who doesn't really have a whole lot of friends, and who doesn't have any way to watch the movie alone now that all the seats are full, it really makes a difference if someone cares enough to wait for a plan that is being made.",lonely,"How many of you guys had ""friend groups"" that planned to go watch Endgame as soon as it released, who then ended up not making any plans and went to watch it with other friends?",2019-04-27 00:14:52

So I was born with some gene that makes me physically powerful without degrading my brain functions in any way (rather I excelled the repetitive school stuff which makes me look intelligent which I am not, just an average)
I had the power but I didn't bully or something, I tried making friends at first and I succeeded at first but they just disappeared.

I look little buff for the kids around so I naturally attract constant bullies and people who think they learn karate or judo that make them powerful and I am an ogre that they much defeat to achieve their trophy 

I didn't show much toward them, I rather ignored them because I don't want to get in trouble, then they started beating me which also I didn't much say and ignored the pains.

So I thought that teachers may help, so I just got to them and show the pen piercing marks and all and exact time of CCTV but they said,*just ignore them, you are doing well in studies, they are just jealous*

I live alone here and telling my parents about this modern mess can't make them understand the circumstances that I can't fight off these.

So in the 9th grade, I had a kid, who was very nerdy looking and weak, but we share similarities like we like playing video games and sometimes retro game which we play on Android and connect to tv via HDMI so it looks like an old school console 
That day I was eating my lunch outside with him while seeing usual kids who play rather eat there lich in lunch breaks 
So the gang of bullies came to him to extort money and he was like being pushed like a ball around the group and actually have no money as he gave his money to me for movie tickets 
And he told them that and they came to me 
*Boy give me the food, I am hungry* 
*You can try but..* and he slapped me 
And everyone in gang laughed
I saw that a shameful thing so I pushed him back and then they went furious and started screaming and looked if there is no CCTV and all.
And started punching me, I was at my brim of anger and I burst finally, so I punched below the jaw with bare knuckles and he just fainted other hesitated but I just flying punches and kicks in the air so they are far from me, they were 5 with one down in total.
That time there was a crowd around me watching and somehow a teacher grabbed me from back as of I was the criminal and took me away 
I was not angry so I was smiling to the kid and crowd and they were somehow cheering 

The teacher took me to principal and them nothing happened as they said it was their fault for not having CCTV there and I had a good image among teachers 

That fainted boy had a swollen jaw joint, all teeth in pain with one broken in half, and then he just overexaggerates in following days. At that moment's people started fearing me as u can just go like the mafia and break there jaw, but I don't work like that, then nobody talked to me in-class like a friend and people started hating me for no reason 
I gained popularity when I won the boxing tournament stated wisely 
But it made it worse.
I was just seen as a monster who can kill with one punch form the average 
But I knew that I was my lucky day
And till now 
After I graduated I still have no friend which I can call a friend from school
Even nerdy boy disappeared 
I believe it was my fault all way as I tried and tried, helped others but I invested fair share in developing body rather investing time on seeing DBZ or anime...
And I left boxing after high school. I just feel so much guilty as his mom was crying to see his son fainted and I was smiling shamelessly...",lonely,Being physically powerful induces staying lonely,2019-04-26 21:18:46

My parents have both started confiding in me about their relationship and both think that they're on the cusp of divorce. My other sister is much younger than me so I need to keep it together for her sake. I have no one to talk to about this and it seems like, as an adult, you're supposed to act like you're unphased. 

I'm sitting in the bathroom at work crying because my boss has screamed at me, again. I have the job I've always wanted but my self esteem is getting chipped away every day I basically don't even feel competent anymore. Everyone knows my boss is a bully but they tolerate him cos he is so good at what he does. I've started to hate the sound of my name because he shouts it so often to humiliate and demean. I cant leave, I need the money and it'll look bad on my CV if I leave after only 8 months. Besides that, everyone else is really wonderful. 

Home life is terrible. My boyfriend nods and barely acknowledges me when I express how bad I feel. He's a good person but I increasingly feel like we were good friends and terrible partners. A lot of that is my fault. 

All I want is to live alone and insulate myself, even if just for a while, from the influence that other people are having on my general wellbeing. I want to come home to a cocoon every night that feels quiet, calm and mine (I currently live with my boyfriend).

232,ButteryBakedSalmon,1556166644,4,"I found this community and I at least know that I'm not the only one going through this shit.

But one thing I keep seeing over and over again is the assumption that ""*women have it easier*"" and that if we ""really tried"" we could ""*get a guy by the end of the night""*.

At first, I thought it was just a few people with that mindset, but nope. Even on posts where women talk about being single, lonely, and unloved all their lives, there are assholes in the comments saying ""*Well as a woman, you could put yourself out there and instantly get a man!""*

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't get the logic some people follow. Implying that women can *""get a man by the end of the night""* means yall think we just want sex...and that we're ""*faking loneliness""* because we obviously can go out get it. 

Following that logic: A woman can go out, find a random guy who wants to have sex. They have sex, and yea, for a few minutes she might feel wanted and she might feel loved. But after it's over, guess what? The guy goes back to his life and she goes back to hers.

&amp;#x200B;

A Lonely Man /Woman having sex with someone doesn't mean that directly afterward they immediately fall in love and start a relationship. The loneliness, the wanting of a genuine relationship, the wanting to be loved is still going to be there.

Sex doesn't equal love, or understanding, or support, or care. Loneliness isn't cured by sex.

233,Xwarndie,1556166010,10,"Today (4/24) is my birthday. I'm 17 today. Let me give you some back story as to why I'm here. 

Right now I live on my own. As in I don't have parents and I take care of myself. I have a part time job as a Recreation Leader (I basically just help run an afterschool program). It's city job so I make an okay amount of money for only working maybe 20 hours a week. I rent a room for me and my boyfriend through some people we met through my mom. 

Recently my boyfriend lost his job and for the past three months hasn't attempted to get another one. Money has been tight and last month I struggled to pay pills and feed us. He wants a career as a streamer and I try to be supportive of him. We havent been on good terms lately though. I find myself getting more and more overwhelmed with everything I need to do. After working I come home and cook, do laundry, feed our dog, bathe her, clean up whatever mess he made while I was gone etc. He never helps. He never gives me attention. I feel alone. I feel useless. 

A week ago I reminded him it's my birthday. He just said okay and that was that. Birthdays have always been special to me. His birthday was in January and we might've been a bit poor but I tried to make it as special as I could. I got him all of his favorite snacks, bought ballons and a banner and made him a cake. It wasn't a lot but it was something. We watched his favorite movie and I wrote him a letter telling him how much I loved him. Birthdays aren't about money but basically celebrating that you exist. Just a reminder that ""hey, I appreciate you!"". I knew he didnt have money. I didnt expect much. 

But he didnt even say Happy Birthday to me. Neither did my mom but I expected her to forget. I woke up this morning. Got ready for work (I didnt call in today because I've always liked going to work on my birthday and having people just tell me HB), and left. He didnt text me at all which he often doesn't anyways. So I went throughout work, my co-workers wished me a Happy Birthday and then I took the bus home. When I got home he was just sitting st his computer playing a game. He said ""Hey babe"" when I walked through the door and that was that. Tbh maybe I'm complaining but man that felt like shit. I'm already without family. Without money to even get a birthday cake. And he couldnt even give me a hug and tell me Happy Birthday. Of course I cried to myself and almost started to fall asleep. He finally got up and noticed I had been crying. He seemed annoyed. He asked me why I was crying and I told him. Then he shrugged and asked me what I wanted from him because we were broke. I suggested that he tell me happy birthday. Maybe give me a hug, watch a movie with me. 

We got into a ""fight"". Fights with him are usually him just ignoring me and going to sleep until tomorrow where I just have to pretend I wasn't upset. But Today just sucked. He's sleeping right now and I just feel alone and unimportant. I text my mom and got birthday wishes out of her but that's all. 

I finally realized that I'm the only one here for myself. Kinda sucks. I try to be positive but today really got to me. I'm alone. No one really cares about me and I'm just kind of ignored. So yeah. Happy birthday to me.",lonely,"It's my birthday, and I'm lost.",2019-04-25 14:20:10

235,NearbyAtmosphere,1556163499,4,"&amp;#x200B;

it did occur to me, that if i wanted to i had one person i could consider a friend. lets call this friend ""c""

c, oh boy, are they something. lets get the basics down of our relationship:

  
\-i have known them for about 5 years

\-we have never hung out outside of school, but do text at least weekly

\-they are fairly popular in our grade 

\-we actually have told each other some important secrets in the **past**

\-they admitted to having a crush on me a long time ago

&amp;#x200B;

see maybe you might have inferred that me and c were closer at one point, which is true. they were someone once i liked (not *liked* though), and they were (are?) one of they only friends i've ever had. but now? we've drifted apart for sure, but i also dislike them now. 

&amp;#x200B;

c's a bitch now though; they've changed. i hate saying it, but they're very quick to put words in peoples mouth, have broken up a perfectly good relationship before because they didn't like who their friend was dating, they never admit to being wrong, and insult people including myself often. they particularly love to describe me as ""retarded"" if i simply disagree with them or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

i also just don't care for c's conversation topics often. they're the type to randomly bring up political shit when everyone is just chilling. like ""ugh i don't understand all these kids in our school acting lgbt, (insert rant about tumblr)."" like no one fucking cares, this isn't a family gathering dude, its history class. even if you make points no one wants to hear them in the middle of a 30+ question assignment. 

&amp;#x200B;

i also just don't care for their interests. in the one we do share, art, i don't even like to share mine because again, c loves insulting and ranting and sharing the same shitty ""art critics"" who just bully kids for liking fnaf or some shit . their other interests like comedy and sports i have no problem with, i'm just not into it. (unless we're talking vine, but that'd just leave them to screaming the same old vines references)

&amp;#x200B;

i feel bad though, i mean at one point we were close, and i feel like i don't have to the right to be lonely when they are an option to talk to. i feel i could work with it, but instead i just want to push them away. i also don't want to end up on bad terms, as they do know shit i haven't even told my own mother yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

im tired of feeling lonely, im tired of c too. i have no idea what to do really.

It's been nearly nine years since I left school, nobody keeps contact with me, the only two friends I made refused to keep me around as I'm either too depressed or just they feel they can do better. Work isn't much different; though we work as a team I still feel like a outcast, everyone else has fun and jokes with each other where I'm just usually left on my own.

I try to fit in and have fun, I try to make conversations like games or films task what they're into, but nobody's interested, I get shunned and shut down without trying most days, othertimes it goes okay if I'm just the one listening.

I just can't stand it. Aside from work it's been years I've actually hung out somewhere with anyone, just so fed up.

239,doodlewithcats,1556151575,7,"So, I know that some will say that I’m not really alone, after reading the next paragraphs. But I genuinely feel alone. I don’t know if I’m lonely, but definitely feel alone and abandoned.

I’ve lost my mom last August. I’m 23f, studying aborad. My whole life, my mom did whatever possible to avoid that I’d make the same mistakes as her; not finishing school, living an unhappy marriage, having a job she didn’t really enjoy. 
I think she did pretty well. I’m working towards my dreamjob. I stand my own ground. 

But when I lost her, I lost everything else with her. Her death made me realize a lot of things, and showed the true face of a lot of people around me.

I have my father and brother left, but they genuinely don’t care about me. They never ask how I do or aren’t interested in what I’m doing. My father just gives me money for school, but, in the brief moments of contact we have, he makes sure to repeat as much as possible that I am a financial burden to him. 

I’ve tried maintaining contact but it’s always me, except when they need me for some problem solving. I stopped caring. So there I lost my father and brother, too.

The rest of the family, well, some acted very bad on my mom’s funeral. I stopped talking to some of them. Others are busy woth life. I don’t think they forgot about me, but just have so much stuff to do. I too, have a lot of stuff going on. Sometimes I wish they would reach out because I don’t have the strength to do it anymore. 

And up to two weeks ago I had a boyfriend and my wonderful cats. 
I realized after my mom’s death that I wasn’t happy with the relationship anymore. We tried and I broke it off because it wasn’t going anywhere. I know it’s my fault. I know I made myself all alone. He will take the cats because I can’t pay for them right now. 

There is a very small crush I have on somebody, but the person rejects me without even knowing.

I’m glad I have friends, even very good ones. The bests I could actually find I guess. But they have their lives. Their families, their friends, their partners.

What I meant at the very beginning is that I don’t feel lonely somehow, thanks to my good friends. But I’m alone because nobody waits for me and nobody awaits me. Nobody loves or cares for me. I could have an accident, they woulnd’t notice, at least not directly. 

I feel abandoned in some way. There are so many people out there, yet I feel all alone. I also feel stupid, because it somehow feels like I’ve let them all go and that it is my fault. 

I don’t love myself and I know I should. Maybe life would be easier. Maybe I have to learn to be content with just myself, learn not to be scared of being alone. I hope I’ll grow to be emotionally stronger and independent. 

I have a long way to go, but letting it all out helps a bit already. Thanks for reading that far.",lonely,"it feel like it’s just me now, all alone with nobody waiting for me",2019-04-25 10:19:35

Not only it got me confused since he avoids pretty much everyone despite his casual interactions with our classmates but it also made me feel bad and even more self-conscious. 

Is it that bad? It's not that I enjoy being alone, I hate it, but does it bother those outside as well?

242,EsotericEye,1556147943,1,"It seems like every friend that I've ever had has used me as a last resort for a period of time, as if I were a temporary pit stop on their way to something better, then when they meet someone who they actually admire and respect, they don't care to really keep in touch with me anymore. I try to reach out and make plans with them, but they always have plans with other friends. I've always been a loyal and considerate friend but no matter how much I go out of my way, I'm never good enough in their eyes. This has been very damaging to my self-esteem over the years and has made me avoid getting close to people.

There's also the issue of sacrificing my integrity for being honest with my friends. I've been berated and ridiculed for having a different opinion, even though most of the time I ended up being right. Whenever I've expressed my honest and thoughtful opinion on a topic and my friends and I didn't agree, they suddenly treat me as if I'm beneath them and they become distant and dismissive. Yet they're free to express any ignorant opinion about anything and I don't act differently with them or judge them for it. 

The last real friend I had, who I considered a decent guy, moved back to the east coast. I had another friend who I saw once a month but I cut ties with him because he didn't respect or appreciate me as a friend. He was very self-centered and only spoke about himself. It was clear that he didn't care at all about what was going on in my life.

At this point in my life, I just keep to myself at work, come home alone and go on my laptop and repeat it the next day. I haven't received a call or text from anyone for almost half a year. Even when I had friends, I barely received any calls or texts from them. I'm feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted from thinking about how much time and energy I've wasted on the wrong people. 

Although, I feel relieved that I don't have these toxic people in my life anymore, I also feel sad thinking of the reasons why I didn't attract genuinely good people into my life.

The small glimmer of hope I had is fleeting as each day passes and I sink deeper into the black void of loneliness and irrelevance.

Then on Saturday I said fuck it and decided to go to this far away park that I’d been wanting to go to. I posted it on snap and my friend texted me asking what I did that day and who I went with. I had to lie to her and say i went with a guy friend. But of course, the truth was I went alone by myself.

257,BotizYT,1556100987,5,"As the title says, I feel like i've just lost everyone.

Typical shit, left high-school, our group of about 8-9 died down to about 4 of us this past year/year and a half due to trust issues and relationships between us.

------------------

Recently, I decided to take a break away from the group of us 4 for a week or so - I left the group chat on Messenger. The reasoning behind me leaving, was because of all of the petty arguments and bickering that was happening. I completely understand the fact friendships are going to have arguments and bickering, but when it happens almost every day there's clearly an issue.

I ended up joining back a week later. The second day back, I was asked if I wished to go out with them, so I did. Whilst we were waiting for everyone else to arrive, I was asked as to why I hadn't really been as active recently within the group, to which I said I just wanted to take a break from everyone and all of the arguing - I was then told that another member in the group had said that i'd been saying shit behind everybody's back whilst I was away, which is really what pissed me off.

I will admit, I *had* said some stuff behind their back, and this was the fact that one person would only engage in one activity if another specific person would too - however - this was all discussed in the group chat weeks before, so apart from that which they know about, i'd said nothing about anybody at all - I simply had no reason to. To me, and the others admitted it too, it seemed like a stupid reason just to start an unnecessary argument.

-------------------------

So, I teased an upcoming track I was going to release later that week (i'm not a big artist at all, I have a tiny following, however I am trying to make it up there). The track was about all of the events that had happened over the past couple of years and how the group has split up, and what had happened over these past couple of weeks.

I released it, sent a link in the group chat, and left. That same day I got messages from three of the members in this group chat. Two of them both said that they'd rather have me in the group than the other guy, and that they liked the track. The other (the one who came up with the lie) said that we could've just talked about it rather than me having to make a song about it.

-------------------------

Now, i'll address the first two people first. They'd rather have me in the group than the other dude - great! Or... not so great. We've had this exact situation in the group before, and when this happened, I got all of the slack and blame and hate from the guy that we kicked out for *months*. The reason I never reported it for harassment or anything is because I just found it petty and stupid.

This is exactly why I don't want to kick the other dude out of the group, because I feel the exact same thing will happen in which i'll get all the blame and all the hatred will fall upon me - so i'm in a stuck situation, because I do not want to join back whilst that dude is there because of how often he tries to cause arguments/petty bickering, and I/we don't want to kick him out because of the situation I mentioned before.

Now to address the dude who said we could've talked about it - we've talked about it *before*. And you said the exact same thing you're saying now - it's a friendship, there's going to be arguments... but the thing is, it's becoming an issue for me personally when these arguments are daily. I didn't actually respond to this guy as I felt an argument was going to be created, therefore I just left it and ignored his messages.

-------------------------

Now, I have two Facebook Accounts - why you may ask? Well, the first one was just so cluttered to the point where I couldn't be bothered to tidy it up, so I just made a new account about a year or two ago. I like to check up on my old account every now and then, as it's pretty much an account for family, whereas my second account is more for friends... or the friends I had.

What I didn't realize until today is - my old account was still in the group chat that I left on my new account. I instantly got a rush of adrenaline, as I was sure I was going to catch them out in saying some shit behind my back.

The thing is - there was only two messages (again from the dude who sparked the original lie) saying that the track was pointless and that we could've just spoken about it - apart from that, that was it... which has led me to where I am now.

-------------------------

I'm happy that there's no negative messages about me in there - but it just seems like they don't even care about the fact that i've left... no questioning about whether i'll come back, no discussion on the track I released, no discussion on any of the issues i'd mentioned, just... nothing. It just doesn't seem like they care i'm gone.

As i'm writing this, I just checked my messages on my new account again and I did just get offered to get added back - however I just stated that i'm not really sure yet. I guess this maybe doesn't show i've lost everyone - I just feel like I don't connect with them anywhere near as well anymore.

(In context, I do have friends and family and on the surface I am relatively outgoing but I struggle significantly with social anxiety and don’t open up fully to anyone in my world because I haven’t yet met anyone who I have similar interests to or feel would understand and connect with my emotions).

The way I make it from day-to-day is by trying to consolidate my thoughts and feel happy in the fact that I am being true to myself, as I am the only person who truly knows me and I find solace in that.

A cathartic feeling for me is by realising that every single minuscule moment, every action, every random event, every fucked up feeling and emotion, is a complete fucking miracle, happening purely by chance, and will never happen again in the same context in the history of the earth. Every moment is an individual moment to you. Own it and make it your story, because even if it makes you feel fucking terrible, it’s a moment you’ll never get back and that feeling is life itself.

Even though sometimes i feel so isolated that it causes me to hit such an emotional low - this is what makes me, me (cliché I know), and that low makes me feel more part of this earth than any basic, mundane happiness that every other ‘normal’ person is experiencing.

It’s fair to say I have embraced my depression and am making attempts to nurture it to grow and better myself and the people around me - because although we are all selfish beings at the centre of our own world, just because you feel at an all time low doesn’t mean others don’t have a right to be happy.

278,Mesut0zil11,1556044974,2,"I just need a place to vent out. Too much stress building up inside. I feel like I could explode in excessive anger with a random trigger. I changed my job 6 months ago. The previous job wasn't that stressful, but I foresee I don't have a future in the next 10 years with it. 

A friend doing business got very rich from the trade. Offered me a job with promise of increment of pay and other benefits if I could expand his business. Took the job knowing I could trust my close friend. Venture into unskilled territory. Let's just say expanding his business requires a lot of funding, the market is also very competitive. It's no easy trade. Investing huge amount of money without seeing returns in short few months brings incredible amount of pressure on myself. In the beginning I already predicted it wouldn't be a simple task, therefore I dedicated insane amount of time trying to make it work. I work 12-14 hours per day, 7 days a week since January. I actually had to work mostly alone during that time. I sacrificed moving one town to another leaving my newly wed wife behind. I actually persuaded her to resign to come to my current town. She resigned without finding a job first, and she will be jobless next month. At least on the bright side her family can support her while she looks for job. Of course, I didn't get my increment as promised because I still couldn't make it profitable. 

I have never worked so hard before. I sacrificed insane amount of things in life. I couldn't even afford time to find my friends or be with my family due to time commitment to my job. They have of course stop paying attention to me. Yet the results of my hardwork now still abysmal. I know I could make it work, if only those on the higher ups set some realistic expectations and be more patient. I lack funding, manpower and support. The higher ups wouldn't try to understand I'm doing, what I achieved or give me the support that I need. They don't sit beside me to try to comprehend the challenges I faced. All that matters to them where are the profits right here right now. Or how much they have already spent without seeing results. They promised all departments will work together, in the end it's just me. 

It's a very lonely battle with no tap on the shoulder, no applause and insane amount of sacrifices. I only wish that I could live to see it become a success.

**1: Not Trying to Fix It**  
On a lonely afternoon, I miss my lover, my sister, my brother, my father, I miss
the dog, the neighbors, a best friend on the other coast. I miss my husband, my
wife, my children, my colleagues, the illusion of friendliness from the stranger
who used to wave from his porch. I miss my cousins, my childhood; I miss the
me I used to be. I get up in the morning and there’s absence all around. The
other towel in the bathroom stays clean and dryer-fluffed. In the kitchen sink,
a single dirty fork. I’m always the one driving the car.
Sometimes it’s a cool absence and I’m a cool lonely—bluesy with low
notes. Sometimes it’s a hot absence and I’m rash-covered and restless with a
single drumstick and no drum in sight. Sometimes I’ve thought there’s no end
to all this and sometimes I’ve thought there’s no need to fix it, that now and
then I’ll just say how I am and see how it feels. Lukewarm-lonely, beige with a
side order of oatmeal. Burrito-lonely, folded into myself with a toothpick in my
neck. Hailstorm-lonely, dented and pocked. I miss my teammates, my grandmother,
the meow of a hungry cat. I’m cocoon-and-cloister-lonely, the rest of
the world a-tango in the muffled beyond.  
  
**2: The Loneliness that Counts**  
The loneliness that counts carries its own clipboard and tracks how many
didn’t call, didn’t wave on the street, didn’t compliment your shoes today.
There’s the blues accountant to report to and the heart that needs to explain its
tendency to shrivel. Picture the claims adjuster circling the dented car or the official
at a basketball game adding up the fouls. This loneliness has its uniform,
its props and crucial tasks, without which it would likely disappear.  
  
**3: The Insufficient Wardrobe**  
When I’m trying to rename loneliness, I call it solitude and drape a velvet cloak
around the absence pressing against me. Or I say it’s isolation and wrap myself
in something gauzy and white, sip wine from a glass with a bendable straw or
dress like a hermit in long wool skirts, immersed in Thomas Merton.
What to call it, though, when I stand in the open door of the closet and
find nothing that appeals? Nothing flirty or sober or exotic. Nothing that
transforms me or confirms, comforts or disguises. The rejected possibilities
pile up on the bed; I’m undressed without options, reminded once more that a
mark of loneliness is that it has no idea what to wear.  
  
**4: Trying to Fix It at a Party**  
When I’m lonely at a party, too many of my greetings are obvious lassos, my
sashays to the bar just another form of bait. I’m a cowboy in earrings, a century
from the open range, or a high-heeled fisherman in the desert. I need to
remember I don’t want the ones who’d willingly be reeled in or roped, who’d
want the me I’m really not.  
  
**5: The Loneliness of the Upside-Down Cake**  
The bud vase with its single lily, one candle, Joni or Aretha on the CD player, a
meal I’ve fixed because I’m supposed to be cherishing this time alone. Chickpea
salad and roasted peppers, a breast of chicken smothered in almonds. I’m so
quietly pleased I want to tell someone else.
Mary, who understands such things, doesn’t answer the phone. Maybe
she’s enjoying her own dinner-for-one and doesn’t wish to be interrupted. I try
Tim and then my sister. The phones ring and ring in empty houses. I imagine
Tim’s dogs raising their heads, Mary’s cats alert on their haunches. My own
old dog is snoring on the couch and the cat’s in the basement, batting a mouse
across the floor. What do they think about eating alone, their heads hung low 
over bowls of Friskies or Purina? I consider, for a moment, waking the dog,
bringing her dinner to the table, but she’d be more interested in my chicken
than her chow and isn’t that one of the pleasures of eating alone—nobody else
eyeing your food? Maggie’s not home either and when I give up and sit down
again to the arugula salad I’ve ringed with oranges and pecans, it all looks
pathetic, the culinary version of boosting self-esteem that finally boosts mine
enough so I can admit that tonight I’d really like a dinner partner, especially
one who covets my company, my conversation, at the very least the upsidedown
cake I’ve so carefully fixed for my dessert.  
  
**6: The Loneliness that Justifies**  
When I find myself lonely because I’m with someone who loves to be alone
and who scarcely knows I’m here, I feel a childishness I want to yield to entirely.
Forget self-amusement or scintillating starts to conversations, provocative
dress or self-pitying sighs within earshot of the one who’s filled up on
solitude. I want to barge into his room and stomp my feet, stand with a pouty
lip, hands on my hips, and insist he play with me, talk with me, at least dismiss
me soundly enough to justify this infantile urge to smack him on the side of
his head.  
  
**7: The Loneliness of Inattention**  
My inattention, I mean, when my interests have dulled, become halfhearted.  
  
**8: One Possible Respite**  
A mile back in a remote Appalachian cave, a waterfall’s been plunging for
thousands of years. Once, in my headlamp, I saw it spray silver. Overhead,
the ice ages had advanced and retreated, cities risen and decayed, wars raged.
Sometimes when I’m lonely, I close my eyes and imagine crawling back again
through narrow clefts in ancient stone to the water’s ceaseless sound, back to
what can’t, of course, know a thing about loneliness and a din so thunderous
I can’t even think about mine.  
  
**9: During Sex**  
One of the most common kinds. The two of you in bed, bodies going through
their fleshy delights and he’s thinking about that offsides scall in the second
quarter and you’re wondering why the dog’s been limping and then here’s his
beloved face lowering toward yours and you can almost hear over the bed
the collision of those private thought balloons cartoonists use in comic strips,
which makes you laugh aloud, which pleases him and you know you should
do better, at least try to be somewhere in the vicinity of this pleasure. When
it’s over and you each roll away murmuring, “That was great,” you know the
refuge of indefinite pronouns and not to ask which “that” each of you might
mean: the sex, the private thoughts, the permission for private thoughts during
sex, the possibility that even at its best sex is a detour around what both of
you for a moment have forgotten can never quite disappear. And what about
the dog? Maybe it’s a thorn in her paw and he’s got his hand on the remote
control, thinking the third quarter’s probably started and you’re both grateful
for each other’s bodies, their generous play and happy willingness to act as if
sex were a cure for the lonely.  
  
**10: The Body**  
Loneliness calculates the space between the edge of the body and everything
outside, pays scrupulous attention to the distance, which it calls heartache or
failure.
Solitude, however, pulls the tape inside, gauges interior gaps, which it has
no interest in filling. Havens, it calls them, sanctuaries.  
  
**11: The Loneliness that Loves to be Bronzed**  
By the curb of a city street, a single shoe is lying on its side—black leather and
a scuffed-up two-inch heel. I’m at the café window across the street with a cup
of coffee and a fantasy that half the men who notice the ankle strap unfastened
and bent backwards like a broken bone are making up a story, and that half
the stories are about the urgency of passion, a few about a drunk, one about a
woman who got hit by a car. I like imagining who has the best story and how
lonely a man might have to be to make it all up. I order another cup and feel 
how his loneliness might lessen mine, though there’s the sight of his back as he
walks on again, and the shoe still on its side in the streetlight.  
  
**12: Old Age**  
For a long time I thought my mother must know forty words for loneliness,
she was so thoroughly acquainted. Or, after decades, do the distinctions dim?
In the blurry end, little difference between losing your husband and your childhood
pet, your future and your youth and, increasingly, most of the present
too. She lives in a small room made smaller now by her helplessness to distinguish
between large and little griefs, between absences she’s created and deaths
she’s borne with dignity. And I, who want to matter more than the woman next
door, dread the loneliness of the day she doesn’t know the difference.  
  
**13: The Loneliness of Others’ Assumptions**  
When people used to say, “How lucky you are to be a twin, you’ll never feel
lonely,” they made me think the loneliness I often felt was something suspect
and unsound, so I secreted it even further inside, which only made me lonelier
than I’d been when I assumed loneliness was, for most of us, a rather normal
state of affairs.  
  
**14: The Loneliness of the Unused Parts of Ourselves**  
The easiest to deny and to endure, and the one you’re least likely to know
might taint every relationship you have.

281,Juche16789,1556040673,3,"So.... yeah. Hi! So lets just start with some important fact about me I guess? I recently moved to a new school since I got kicked out due to having low grades. It wasn’t the first time I got kicked out. It was my second. The first one was in a prestigious school in the Philippines, Ateneo. I left grade 8. I had my grade 9 in another prestigious school,La Salle, which put me into prohibition which only allowed me to fail one. I failed one subject so I moved into a smaller school. Usually I hated socialising cause from past experiences people will just call me dumb, stupid, “bobo”, “tanga” or they would have high expectations of me and then that I’m smart cause I was from Ateneo but in the end I just end up crushing that expectation and end up making them believe I’m stupid. But, this new small school I’m in, which is called NorthField by the way, is way better then I expected. When I moved to a new school the teachers would always say “ah the students here are nice” but they just end up being false statements. But in this new school the teachers were actually being honest. My new classmates were treating me nice and always were trying to hard to make me join their conversations and always wanted me to be part of the fun even when I try to distance myself out of fear of making them hate me and crushing their expectations of what kind of person I am. A good example was that we had a soiree which everyone went to except me. Everyone tried to convince me to go but not forcefully. They were saying “hey (my name), just tell us if you change your mind ok? I promise it will be fun and I want you to be part of that fun!”. I still didn’t go cause of insecurities. So yeah. After the soiree i was getting bullied by this dude who happened to be my old bully in Ateneo. He made several fake accounts and threatened to rape me but I didn’t mind them. I reported him when he made a fake account with my name and sent this girl a dic pic. My friend texted me asking if I was sending dic pics and I told him it was the bully. Next thing you know, I texted the girl saying sorry I got her into this mess and we started to talk everyday. It felt so satisfying cause someone is talking to me and enjoys it rather then me watching youtube videos and talking to noone and being alone.  I always thought I wouldn’t have a chance in love life and I would just end up dying alone. Then she came into my life and all of that thought went away. She later then met my classmate who eventually became my best friend and third wheel in my relationship with her. She would always ask him to send pictures of me and stuff like that. I didn’t mind cause she told me she loved me and all that cheesy shit. So it went like this for 2 months and she got mad I didn’t talk to her in a event so she went on a date with my best friend and they ended up together. Before they got together she told me she wanted to breakup. I accepted it. After the break up I learned about how much they have lied to me. The two people I trusted in life. I thought they were people i could trust but they just kept lying to me. She lied that she didn’t find me weird. She lied to me that she didn’t like him. He lied to me that he didn’t like her. He lied to me that even if i broke up with her, he wouldn’t end up with her. He lied to me that he actually wanted to be friends with me. They lied to me that i was special to them. I already told them how much i trusted them and how they were only the few friends or special ones i cared about then they just left me.

See, I've discovered that I have a HUGE problem with failure which connects to my already addressed issue of feelings of worthlessness. Everything that I try to do, I feel like is just another failure to add to the pile that is my life. Which, in turn, feeds into my usual self-loathing.

So, whenever I fail to get into a relationship or think about opportunities I've missed or totally screwed in the past, I feel like those are also mistakes and failures added to the pile. This hits me harder than anything else because loneliness is a feeling compounded upon those other emotions.

In summary, I've learned that some of our emotions run deeper than even we initially know, and with time, patience, and careful thought, we can help figure out what makes us tick- what makes us broken, and then takes steps to fix it.

314,ya_boi_richie,1555973653,2,(M15)First off sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile. I'm usually surrounded by friends and family who are all great and wonderful people. I always sorta lonely and by that I mean I never need anyone else as I am usually in my room by myself or I wouldn't really speak if I'm in a car with people. I wouldn't feel lonely but each time I think about it I just feel empty like I'm missing something which I think is human interaction more specifically a romantic kind. I've never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl for that matter but I've never really been upset by it. Most of my friends aren't even virgins anymore and they all encourage me to get into a relationship with someone. I feel like having someone I can look after more or less would help me but I never want to get in a relationship with anyone and each time I think about a girl asking me out (as I would never do it) the only thing I could ever think about telling them is no. I'm not sure why like for example currently there's a girl I like who also likes me and I could easily ask her out but I never would and I'm not sure why. The only issue I can think that would be between us as that she lives in a different county (I live in Ireland she's in the county next to me). Its not that I'm scared but I just feel I wouldn't keep it up and just after a week or two I would just stop texting or going out to them because I would be bored and fed up.

321,alskadeangel,1555961871,1,"I have felt lonely all my life, or atleast for as long as I can remember. Sometimes it has been devastating, sometimes it was acceptable. School was hard, while I was bullied everyday and I didn't have any friends, that wasn't really the worst part because I could just tell myself I'm a loner, and focus on bettering myself instead of wasting time on those that didn't like me. 

The difficult part was really struggeling with mental health. I was hearing voices, and would therefor have moments where I freaked out, banged my head against the wall, screamed outloud and such to make it stop. Usually if you just hurt yourself really bad they stop for a while. I also struggled with anorexia, and only weighed about 70 pounds despite being above average height for a teenage girl but it was only seen as a good thing because I was very fat before I had my eating disorder. 

I was always told that my problems weren't real or weren't serious enough to really treat. Though they eventually agreed I needed therapy, I never found it helpful. I just felt like our conversations went like ""wow that sounds rough, here, take some crazy pills"" when I really just wanted to have someone to connect to.

That's the issue, I'm nowmore actually surrounded by people who like me. I have multiple friends. Outwardly I'm very composed, not getting into trouble, not doing drugs or drinking, always getting good grades and being friendly, confident and outgoing to people. But I still feel so alone, because I still feel like I can't relate to anyone around me. Like I'm of a different species.

 I really can't describe it very well, but it's like I'm a horrible monster and no one else can see it and I'm terrified that if I get too close to anyone they will eventually find out. On rare occasions where I open up about this, I have never gotten the response ""I feel the same way"", it's always something along the lines of ""get the fuck over yourself"" (parents) or ""I'm so sorry, I can't imagine what that must be like"" (friends). I hate the latter response more, even though I don't show it, because it just makes me feel even more like I'm subhuman and too strange to be around. I just want someone to hug me and tell me it's ok, because I have always had to do that to myself. I sometimes wish that other people would be there for me like I am for them.

TLDR It sucks having issues that people around you can't relate to. You always have to be there for yourself because no one else is there to pick you up.

Hello there! I mainly speak and write in Dutch, so if my English isn't the best, you know why. A little background about myself :) I'm a 16/M who's struggling in life right now. I can't go full time to school because of psychological problems, so i go to a psychiatric institution. My friends left me for my struggles and the one's I consider friends probably see me as a dude they know. Pretty painful to say the least. I also go to a psychologist every week, but because it's Easter, he isn't available. Alright, so my hobbies: I like to draw, sometimes hyper realistic, and sometimes I droodle things.. I game a little bit, not to much as it once was a problem of mine. I mainly play warframe and rocket league. I recently got a gym membership, so I have that going for. I also like to philosophize about mysteries and life in general. I like browsing the internet for fun and education, but mainly for fun. And last but not least, I really like to listen to music and to people. I listen to just about anything if it sounds good (I know that's kind of a cop out of an answer, but it's true). I can talk about almost anything, as I have deep interest in many things. My favorite talk subject is about things that are happening in our life's. I also like to offer advice, and help people in need. So yeah, that's pretty much me. One last thing, I come along better with girls than with guys, as most guys I met here in my school or in my psychiatric institution, only talk about their love life and their fortnite games.. i don't really talk about the love life subject to much because I'm a bit hart broken and if they talk about hugging and kissing etc.. kinda makes me sad I don't have that special someone. And about fortnite or just games in general, I prefer to talk about reality. Feels more 'real' haha.. but if you're a guy and you also don't like these things, we're gonna get along just fine 😉. So yeah, if you're feeling some loneliness and you want some company, don't be afraid to bring a conversation to the table 🙃 (also, I wont be always available because of personal reasons and a very busy schedule atm).",lonely,Feeling kinda lonely lately.. want to talk?,2019-04-23 04:13:07

[how to deal with loneliness in depression](https://youtu.be/drs1hHqYW4s)

Do you find that some of the depression that you go through is because of intense loneliness?

today

I am grateful for a good circle of friends

I was watching a current affair last night, and they were talking about the epidemic going on in the western world around loneliness.

People feeling disconnected, depression and today I felt a fair bit of depression, and I thought about whether some of that was coming from loneliness and it is.

It's not loneliness through lack of friends because I was fortunate enough today to have two people give me a call to see how I was going and a third person who I called at about five o'clock because I know I was in a bit of depression and I just needed to reach out.

There is the issue of intimate relationship at the moment which is not in my life, and I do feel a sense of loss at not having that at the moment.

I'm quite grateful that I have a good connection with people daily.

For those of you who don't have a good connection on a daily basis with friends.

The tip to change that is to get social, I'm a dancer, but I do other stuff as well, and that connection with other people regularly means that I'm connected to friends when I need to.

today,

I'm grateful for the good friends in my life

I think the strength that people gain from being resolute in their solitude is a dangerous one. Constantly killing the natural urge to interact with others. That might be what they call depression. It’s actually a bit sick, the way one can enable themselves to be a recluse within their own mind. I feel more vulnerable to myself than anyone else. I think someday I will move on from thinking about you, but I still can’t help it. I don’t know if you’re the same person I knew or not, or even if you don’t want to be the same person I knew. I’d like to think that we could still be on the same wavelength as individuals. I’m not really hung up on “what we had” or “our old friendship”. I just miss you as an individual. As a person who strives to look at things as what they actually are, it can get lonely. The social buffers and handicaps that enables everyone else to connect with each other, are absent for me. Part of me thinks it’s wrong to think that they’re “buffers” and “handicaps” and that I should be less judgmental. The other wants to “see things as they truly are, and have a clear view of the world” in hopes of justifying who I am. Whoever that is. I still don’t know. I’d like to think that I know, and I can certainly tell you what I’m not. But a lot of the time, I look in the mirror and at that instant, none of it means anything anymore. I think the reason you have lasted in my thoughts this long is because you gave me a reason to live. I hope this doesn’t come across as a pathetic plea of desperation for you to care about me again. I simply mean that back then I existed for someone else’s existence. I knew that if I were to vanish, someone would feel my absence. My importance relative to the other things in your life is something that I often question. Sometimes I’ll think,  “do they hope to accidentally run into me, like I do?” or “do they still think about me?”. Sometimes I even wonder if my role was even that significant, or if you’ve moved easily on simply because the void that I left in your life was easily fillable. At this point, you may have even become an exaggerated figment of my imagination, an individual more surreal than you actually are. Along with clarity, I think things observed in retrospect are often subject to images that are easier for the mind to digest. It’s been a while.

Of course, it is my fault and I didn't work as hard as I could but my major issues is on weekends, when I have a little more relaxation time and my mind wanders into the territory of loneliness. It drains me, I lay in bed for hours, either listening to sad music, watching videos or rummaging through omegle to find people to talk to and get my mind of things. Hours I could have spent studying. Hours I could have spent enjoying playing a game or something I like rather than feeling miserable.

I can see myself either continue living like this or growing from it and I'm certainly ready to not let my education spiral downwards. 

Initially dealing with loneliness, I was successful. I coped with narcissism and toxicity, and it worked. I broke myself down mentally and was somewhat depraved. As time went on, it took a toll on me and my efficiency dwindled. At the start of this year my mental health really started getting better, barely any traces of toxicity and that stuff, less mood swings. I find myself struggling for motivation to study now, mainly on weekends. I used to feed off narcissism to jump over the hurdle of feeling lonely but now I see, it's not right. I wanna be successful, without being toxic. The same toxicity that broke apart all my friendships beyond repair. I could've managed because I thought along the lines of, ""Heh, highest grades, I don't need friends after all."" Now, I'm left without either good grades or friends and I'm going to build myself back up from scratch, the proper way.

I’m at the age where everyone I know is either married, engaged, or in a long term relationship and the ones who aren’t are just interested in hooking up until something good comes along. I use to try to talk about it with my friends but they didn’t understand and would just give me platitudes or just be dismissive. I’ve tried to open up and be completely honest about how I felt unloved, unwanted, that I felt invisible and insignificant. My friends would tell me that I’ll find someone someday, or it’ll happen when I’m ready, or that my dog loves me, or to love myself first. I’ve had people offer advice that I should pretty much completely change myself to attract someone or that I should casually have sex until it turns into a relationship. Besides my loneliness and depression I love and accepted myself. I don’t want to become someone I’m not just be loved, especially when I know there are people worst than me who have no trouble finding someone to love them. I also know that there are people who waited patiently like everyone says and now they’re in their 30’s, 40’s, and even 50’s and they’re still alone and waiting. I saw a clip of a woman on a talk show say she was still a virgin at 50 because she was taught to wait until marriage to have sex and she’s still waiting. I’ve tried tinder and okcupid and all I got were people interested in just having sex with me and people so desperate to be with someone they didn’t care if I didn’t find them attractive or interesting they just wanted to be in a relationship. I almost tried eharmony and match until a friend said the messages she’s got where just as bad as tinder. I’ve tried dressing up and looking cute and being funny every time I go out in hopes that someone would make a move on me. I’ve shameless thrown myself at few guys and even hung-out with someone I wasn’t attracted to because I thought he at least had a nice personality but turns out he didn’t have a car and was just interested in me bringing beer over. My loneliness is becoming so obvious that my mom
and siblings have been commenting that I must be lonely with how much I’m hanging over there.

My screen time for last week was down 34% because a new app on Facebook let people send anonymous messages to their friends and my single friends were getting messages about how attractive they are and from people confessing their crushes or even just they’re sexual attraction. They were getting dozens of messages a day I got four total. My four messages were asking me to play a sonic the hedgehog app on my phone (I don’t even like these kinds of games), asking what I thought of a sonic hedgehog music video and what my favorite Pokémon was, and my celebrity crush. I know that 3 out 4 came from a girl who I use to ride the bus with I’m hs, she confessed her feelings for a friend to me and I set them up and they dated for a year or so but I haven’t had much contact with either of them since leaving hs. She apparently sent the same questions to a bunch of people so its not like I was special.  The whole thing just made me feel like shit. 

I just want everyone else has. I know the above has been about wanting a relationship but I also want better friendships too. Friends who don’t show they care by roasting me, and friends who aren’t dismissive of my feelings, friend who invite me out because they want my company instead of inviting me out because they feel like they somehow owe me for being there for them when they were single.

358,NegativeCollision,1555886962,0,"I never had a relationship with a girl before, I tried to talk to girls multiple times only to be called  “weird”, “creepy” “future rapist” etc.

Is there anyway I can rewire myself mentally into loving a dakimura since all girls dislike me before I get to know them?  I have been led on and been embarrassed by the nicest of girls at my school and church, I’m thinking if I try to pursue a relationship with a Dakimura instead because obviously I can’t be out “creeping” on people or “raping” women when I’m inside with my dakimura all day. 

I looked differently from everyone, causing them to treat me differently, ultimately causing me to act differently. I have been pelted with rocks by groups of people, spat on, led on by girls that “liked” me only to get humiliated, jumped on by different people almost weekly and for me to be the one that gets sent home OSS because I was the one “bullying” them.

I just wanted to show the world that I had the ability to love others and be loved but obviously it didn’t work out that way differently. I wanted friends, I wanted companionship, I wanted a romantic relationship with a girl my age but obviously since it was coming from me I was asking for too much. Everyone that had similar hobbies to me didn’t like said hobby anymore when I asked them to hangout. Every girl that I asked out replied “Im lesbian.”, “hell nawww ugly ass boy!”, “You just turned me lesbian” or “This is some sick joke right?”

I was known as the school creep and people started taking pictures of me, uploading them to Instagram when it was starting to boom at the end of middle school. They’ve then began spreading rumors about me, mistruths, partial truths, lies and other things about me that other people believed because I happened to fit the narrative.

If you want to hate me, I just want you to hate me for the right reasons, about the things that I actually did because I actually own up to them, however I didn’t do much, I stayed silent and only spoke when talked to, because in the eyes of everyone I was the bad guy no matter what I did and I deserved everything that came my way.

My most memorable experience was when I was walking down the hallway, a group of girls not paying attention to me was walking adjacent to me when one of the girls said “put me on”.
Her assumed friend pointed to me and giggled.
Her friend began bawling and said “fuck no, that’s that scary ass Atrocious looking ass Nigga!”

I’ve been going to multiple therapists for the past 3 years and they just don’t get it. They keep giving me all of this bullshit no sense like “Just be yourself” and “One day all of your bullies will be working for you!”

That’s especially funny when I asked out my crush in middle school, she told me she was lesbian and a guy that routinely bullied me showed me a video on his phone of him having sex with her and her screaming his name. He laughed and walked away

This guy doesn’t really mess with me anymore but now he’s a literal football star.

369,joecb91,1555873459,30,"Its nice actually having a happy story to share on here for once. Little bit long though.

Some sad stuff for context though, the last year of my life has been pretty miserable. I had always struggled with some stuff, but I had one really great friend who was able to help me out. Sadly towards the end of 2017 she started having a lot of health problems because of very severe asthma and a drug addiction, and in March 2018 she passed away after a severe asthma attack that made her go into cardiac arrest. I just felt completely broken after I found out what happened, I wish I could've done more to help her. Making it harder, she also wasn't responding to messages from most people those final couple of months, so I didn't realize how bad things were until it was too late. The last time I ever saw her was Thanksgiving Eve 2017 and the last time she was actively responding to texts was right before Christmas, so I went 3 months with no clue what was going on and just wondering if she was okay.

So, 2018 ended up being a year where my mind was stuck on one very painful moment and thousands of little things related to it. I am doing better now, but that pain will always be there.

In November 2018 though I found something that ended up helping me out. I was watching some stuff on Twitch and I found one of the smaller streams on there where the host was someone who clearly cared about all of the people who regularly tuned in and she spent a lot of time trying to get to know everyone. I enjoyed it right away, it was nice having kind of a relaxing place online to hang out in and talk to people. She plays different games with everyone outside of the stream too, mostly PC stuff and my laptop can't run that stuff (mainly Overwatch) very well but I've been able to play Smash Ultimate with her and a few other people from the group. The first time I've really had friends to play any of the Smash games with! 

Now going to my birthday, the usual plan each year is just going out for dinner at a steak place with my mom and dad. Its something I enjoy, but it is hard not having many people that would be interested in doing something with me. The thing I always looked forward to the most was that my best friend would try to make it out to join us for dinner even if her schedule was packed, but she is gone now and knowing that makes it tougher to enjoy the dinner. Last year I was still so messed up during my birthday and didn't feel like celebrating at all but my parents made me go so I didn't just sleep all day.

This year I was trying to figure out if there was anything else I could do, and during one of those twitch streams I was watching I asked the host if we could play a few rounds of Smash Ultimate after I got back from dinner and she said of course (also sang happy birthday to me and one of the other viewers who had one that week). Normally I would just sit around in the my room after we get home from dinner, but this time I was able to get on the Switch and there was an open room with the host and a couple of the other people from the stream and play for a couple hours while chatting on Discord. Its not something big, but still it makes me feel good that I found this little community to hang out in online where a few people would take the time to play some games online with me on my birthday.

Also, I was playing as ZSS, she was Joker. My first time playing on his stage and I loved the art style for it, she highly recommended Persona 5 and we spent some time talking about how I need to get it if the rumors are true and it gets ported to the Switch.

Just a fun night.

TL;DR - Normally my birthdays are very lonely, been struggling a lot after a friend passed away a year ago, but this year I got to spend a couple hours playing games and talking with a few friends from a Twitch stream who were nice enough to take that time to play with me.",lonely,"My birthday was yesterday, and surprisingly it actually ended up being pretty good",2019-04-22 05:04:19

I would like to be able to maximise my time and use it in a way that makes me feel proud of myself.

Where do you guys hangout whenever you are alone and want to leave the house? Do you guys feel ashame of yourself when you are in a public space hanging out by yourself?

For myself, it is something that I've had problem dealing with as I often feel out of place, like I don't belong or that I don't have the right to this space the same way that other people do.

But the more I think about it, the more I feel like learning to cope with this would allow me to create a place for me in this world. There are so many beautifull place that have a nice vibe in this world, but this social media culture as pushed everything on the internet instead of in the street.

396,Sir_Xanthos,1555827543,5,Well basically I realized that I seek a relationship because I have a lack of friends so I tend to want someone to spend time with because I have no one otherwise. But I can't make friends because I'm garbage at social interaction and I just can't seem to connect well enough with people to create meaningful friendships. And it all just loops and loops. Probably doesn't help that I try to make friends with females because I find it easier but then I sometimes end up just liking them and either making a fool of myself or pulling away because it's not what I should be doing.

I'm not really the strong one. Thanks to years of depression, I'm nearly a professional pretender. 

So I'm basically just sitting at home, alone, unwanted, on a Saturday night - typing on a random sub because I'm so fucking tired of being completely alone. And every day it feels like it gets worse. Like I'm cuddling down into a thicker and thicker blanket of solitude - putting layers between me and the world.

I've had a good life. I've had it pretty easy. I don't even feel entitled to feel my own feelings - how fucked up is that? Like, I've had a fairly easy life - but my brain tells me every day that I suck, I'm garbage, I'm ugly and fat and stupid and inconsequential in the big scheme of things.

So I continue down this lonely path, spiraling downward more and more every day. I don't even know how to stop it at this point. I'm not suicidal (my dogs need me too much, and they just wouldn't understand).

And it's way harder than I expected. I have a huge feeling of guilt and regret. I can't stop thinking about them. And I just feel so alone... And currently hitting rock bottom in life and I just don't have anyone to talk to, yet it's like my brain keeps urging me to talk and share my pain with others. So here I am, writing this, hoping it helps.

I keep going back and forth from ""this is for the best"" to ""I may have ruined the one good thing in my life"". At some points I keep thinking of just going back and ask them to forgive and forget everything, but I'm just too embarrassed.

408,lafemmejdm,1555813506,1,"I’m 27 years old and have used drugs (anything and everything) since high-school. I got hooked on opioid pills in 2013, and quickly moved to using IV heroin plus a ton of Xanax . In November of 2016 I got behind the wheel of my car after shooting up (plus a shitload of benzos) and I overdosed. Needless to say I totaled my car. The police/emts who responded to the scene ended up telling me (later on) that they attempted to resuscitate me with narcan 7 times. I was airlifted to the best hospital in my area, still totally unconscious. They called my mother and told her to get there in a hurry if she wanted to say goodbye. I’m not sure why I didn’t die, I have no fucking clue. I had sustained serious head trauma during the accident, and have no memory of that night at all. When the police searched my vehicle they found a bottle of 90 Xanax bars, a couple of adderall, some empty dope bags, and a needle or two. After I was released from the hospital I had to go to the sheriffs office, and ultimately I was RORed with instructions not to leave the county and to appear at two separate courts. I ended up being sentenced to a very strict drug court program, went to detox &amp; short term inpatient then about a year of outpatient. I graduated from the drug court program without ANY hiccups. I was 100% clean from November 9th 2016 to sometime in the summer of 2018. I still have not used dope or any opioid to this day, but I began dabbling with adderall and Xanax again. It wasn’t until about 2 (maybe 3 tops) months ago that I started taking Xanax every single night. I’ve also been using research chemical benzos like Etizolam &amp; Clonazolam. I have been pretty good about only using benzos at night, but I have continued to escalate my doses. To be quite honest, I am really ashamed of myself &amp; terrified of having to go through benzo withdrawal again. I can’t even go to a detox center because my health insurance got taken away. My fiancé holds all of my pills in a lock box and doles them out when I ask. Lately I’ve been asking for more and more and I can see he’s concerned. It’s a shit situation for him, he wants me to be happy but he also doesn’t want me physically dependent/hurting myself. I really don’t know what to do. I just wish I had someone to talk to besides him. Not that he’s not amazing and the love of my life, but he tends to overreact in a big way.

When you don't have any memories, everyone around you is a stranger. You can get attached to them the same way you would get attached to a character in a novel, but there's this constant feeling that you're supposed to be feeling something deeper, more emotional towards them.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really hard for me to make friends with people, because I have no idea how they experience friendship, or how their emotional experience affects their ties to people. I only have my own experience to go by, and to most people, my 'brand' of friendship doesn't quite live up to their standards, even though I think of them so highly or I adore spending time with them, to them its like its never quite enough and I get left behind or become disposable.

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to appreciate intent over action. It doesn't matter to me if someone doesn't understand my interests or tastes, if they go to the effort of doing something for me, or talking to me, or feigning interest in my interests, that means so much more to me than the amount of time I've known them or past events we've been through (since i can't remember them). 

&amp;#x200B;

So i have a tendency to be 'helpful' all the time to make up for it and prove how much I appreciate them. I over offer to do things, If I have food i'll offer it to people all the time, I'll be the first to offer you a lift somewhere or help you clean up after a party, run an errand for you, I'm just happy to show the people around me in my own way that I care about them. But people seem to think that I'm shallow and annoying for it or they literally never take me up on my offers, thinking I'm offering just to be polite, which breaks my heart because I love doing the things for people that I appreciate them doing for me. Or, even worse, they start to take advantage of me. I'm not naive and usually just cut people out when they start to do it. Which ends up leaving me on my own. But when I'm not doing things for people, no one ever seems to want me around.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so disconnected from everyone around me, like I'm just not trying hard enough to appreciate them, but at the same time I always feel like I care about them so much more than they care about me. I have no idea how to find people that can accept that I operate differently without scaring them away with my weirdness.

I m Ved. I will not introduce my origins or the place where i m studying. Thats all external factors. Lets meet each other from our souls.

I m a dreamer, shy kinda guy. I m innocent from inside, i know it sound cringe but thats the truth. And i mostly find myself at the end of the day with tasks incompleted. Lol. I m suffering from most common illness of our age, loneliness. I have lots of friends online and offline but this messaging apps like instagram and whatsapp have changed the way the conversation was actually should be done. So, what happens is that my inner requirement of connection never meets. And i feel lonely. For example, today i talked to face to face with only a guy, who is my room mate and chatted with n-number of ppl. I know it doesnt happen always, it happened today because i was in the room whole day. But still we have lost that spirit of visiting others. And calling friends instead of texting them.

To me, I am 28 years old and male, study sociology meanwhile, am very sporty on the way and have found very good and loyal friends.

What bothers me about me, however, is the fact that although I have had many female friends in my life, I never had a relationship, let alone sex or similar intimate things.  I think the problem and I hate myself for it, I am. 
 
All my friends tell me that I look good and look good, that I have a good sense of humor, etc., but that never brought me anything.  I have to say, I wasn't really skinny in my school days.  Now I am and I am trained.  That helped me a little with my self-confidence, but not as much as I expected.

I now live next door to a good friend, where I jumped over my shadow for the first time through the impulse of my roommate and actually said what I feel for her.  The answer, unfortunately, was not yes or no, but maybe.  Which in my eyes is the worst.

I think my main problem is that I am standing in my own way. 
 
For example, a few weeks ago I was at an event with my resident and he said that in front of me exactly my type would be.  He can read people damn well.

But I didn't manage to overcome myself, even with the help of my friends.

Then I usually start with self-doubt and depressive thoughts.  Especially the throbbing in the chest is the worst part.

Last Weekend we were all again on a celebration among other things also my neighbour.  We all had fun until the time when she was more attached to my roommate or his friend.

Well, that's all I don't want to go into now.  We (my Roommate, I and my Neighbour) still meet and look at G.o.t. or she justcomes by.  Which doesn't make it easy for me, though, because it seems to me that she comes rather because of my roommate.
Especially because she and my roommate texting more than I did with her.  It bothers me and my roommate knows that too, hes a real good Friend and helps me a lot especially in those things.  my roommate assured me that he wants absolutely nothing from her.  He also refused after the event, there was a lot of drinking (hes not drinking), her offer to sleep with her.

I don't even feel like having sex or anything else anymore.  I just want to be loved by someone.  A deeper embrace or simple cuddling would be enough for me, while a film evening.

I don't know what I want to accomplish with this, maybe nothing other than getting it off my chest for a bit.

I was offered a promotion yesterday, and I accepted. My manager had spoken to me in private about it, and in my confusion about whether or not to go for it, I confided in 4 people I trusted. Apparently one of them has told the entire office about it. And I can feel the difference in the attitudes of people because of it. I can feel their cold attitudes, and hear their whispers. I am devastated to know that someone I have considered a friend has betrayed me in such a way, knowing full well I am a private person, and I have no idea who it was either.
I am hurt, and I feel so alone because I have no one to confide in in-person. All of my best friends live abroad, and the people I thought I was friendly with here apparently cannot be trusted. My husband is a huge help, but he can't help with this. I just want a hug from someone I call a friend, but I have no one. 
I want to leave the job, not continue with the promotion. I want to forget all of this happened. I just want to feel liked and not lonely.",lonely,I feel so alone today,2019-04-19 23:50:22
473,angelenergies,1555678531,14,"Hey guys, I can’t believe I’m posting here but I guess this is the point I have got to. 

Just after Christmas, I was in an accident that meant I haven’t been able to walk since then. I can’t drive, can’t work and haven’t left the house on my own really. I am finding this so incredibly difficult and I am only 21. I have had one surgery and am awaiting another that will hopefully allow me to walk again (this surgery is scheduled for May but has already been cancelled once so I’m trying not to get my hopes up). I feel like nobody understands how I am feeling.

I have suffered severely with depression before but for the past 18 months have been fine and actually quite happy in my life. I have a great job I love and lots of friends. However I feel so alone right now. I am constantly being let down by people and I’m finding it hard to cope with. I am trying not to allow my happiness to be in the hands of others but it’s so difficult not to do this! 

My friend was meant to come and see me at 12 today for an hour or two but at 12.50 he texted to say he won’t make it. It’s now 13.50 and I feel crushed by this. To him it won’t be a big deal, and he is asked if I’m free in a couple of days. I am free (of course I am) and have said he can come over but if I wasn’t injured I would have said no just to teach him a lesson. I can’t spite myself now though because I am so desperate for the social interaction. My brother works a lot and has a girlfriend so is out of the house most of the time and my parents travel a lot so are rarely around. 

As well of all of this, my best friend just got engaged. I am so happy for her, of course I am, and she has asked me to be part of the wedding but this has all just made me feel even more isolated. I had my heart broken three years ago and still not really over it. I have been texting a guy but his replies are slow and he has a lot of family stuff going on right now so I feel hopeless that anything will come from it. 

I want therapy for my feelings and for trauma that I have experienced in my childhood and throughout my early teens but whilst I am out of work I can’t afford it. I live in the UK and it’s incredibly difficult to get therapy for free and if you do, you are only entitled to five sessions after the two year waiting list so I may as well wait until I can pay for it myself. I don’t want to go back into medication for my depression after I worked so hard to come off it.

478,Anonbotnumber9000,1555657333,2,"This is gonna be a long rant... recently some crappy stuff happened to me. I don’t really know who to talk to about these kinda things so I just want to get it out.

Half a year ago, I met a girl I thought was virtually flawless, freshmen year in college. I thought she was “my type” the moment I saw her in lecture (I couldn’t even see her face). I don’t know if it was “aura” or body proportions or some stupid subconscious blend of traits, but she stood out instantly to me. 

Coming to college from out-of-state, I didn’t know anybody and felt lonely at the beginning of the school-year. So when I somehow managed to talk to her and hang out with her, I was unbelievably, hopelessly happy. 

I escalated our “hang-outs” and eventually she told me that she wanted to focus on school and a particular sport she’s really into. She also said her parents don’t allow her to date. I knew she wasn’t lying because I had talked to a mutual female friend (that was no longer close to her) who told me a lot of things that backed up what she said.

I felt like crap about it for a while but eventually I hit this weird “high” in life when things started clicking and I felt weirdly happy. A month and a half later I reinitiated contact with her cause I still felt like she was a cool person, I was no longer infatuated with her, and I wanted to get to know her more again.

Then the moment I saw her in person again I knew I was screwed. I climbed on this hope that maybe I could change her ideas on relationships sacrificing time for academics and other dedications, and that I could show her that she would be happy with me. It’s cringy and silly now looking back, but I really felt like it was possible so I gripped on this hope.

This time around we did a lot more things together, things that friends don’t really do. I don’t think she intentionally led me on, I think she genuinely had fun being with me and didn’t realize I wanted to classify her as a significant other. As we opened up to her, I kept finding new, inexplicably specific similarities we shared, it just pulled me deeper and deeper.  

Just recently the ambiguity of our relationship finally fell apart, and she told me again that she was not interested in dating and reinforced the fact that her parents were against it.

It just sucks because I feel like paradoxically, I need to wait until I no longer care about her to evaluate whether I can just be friends with her. I feel like me wanting to be friends with her now is just a stupid attempt and salvaging any sort of emotional connection. It feels hopeless. It feels like I’m destined to never see her again. 

For some reason I feel like I have almost no emotional investment on most things in my life. Most people I see often and talk with, most things In my daily life, I just don’t think they can hurt me. Instead, I invested a bunch of emotion into this one girl. I feel like every few times I make myself vulnerable, every time I truly begin to care about someone, I’m devastated.

I feel like I’m getting these romantic ideals beaten out of me. I don’t want to forsake them. I want a shot at something real. I see so many meaningless and broken relationships around me that it makes me think that maybe what I think is a “good relationship” is really something wrong or something that doesn’t exist. 

I feel like I’m surrounded by people that are either immature and can’t be functionally independent, or mature people who don’t see relationships as something special anymore. I feel like she was a rare person with both romantic ideals on love and maturity. Maybe it’s the rose tinted glasses, I don’t know anymore

for a few years now i’ve been dealing with major social anxiety. it really sucks but i’m not gonna sit here and complain about it because i know i’m not the only one. anyway, this might be long but it would mean a lot to me if at least one person read it all.

so when i was younger i moved to this new neighborhood and honestly i was really hoping people like me lived there because i didn’t have any friends initially (cause i did homeschool) so a few weeks after moving in there i was friends with kinda all the people my age and it was a really good feeling to have all these cool friends for like the first tome ever. until one day i got the news that i had to move to a whole different neighborhood AGAIN (i absolutely fuckin hated living at that new place) thankfully, i only ended up having to live there not long. so i guess kinda more “recently” i moved to yet another place (which ended up being permanent) and there used to be people i could hangout with if i wanted to but over time they moved before i even really got the chance to be friends with them. (they didn’t seem like people that would wanna be friends with me anyway) SOOO anyway, putting all of that aside, what really hurts me still to this day is how none of those people ended up keeping up with me. they never even check up on me. which is totally fine i guess but recently i’ve started realizing how truly lonely i am and i’ve developed extremely major social anxiety and depression. i just really miss having real human interaction with people... nowadays i just stay at home because i’m scared of crowds and having to talk to people face to face is scary. but it’s like every time i find someone cool in rl i wanna be friends with they literally act absolutely uninterested which could be cause of my awkwardness. who knows 🤷‍♀️ so since i’m too much of a wreck to have friends in the real world, i’ve decided to check this out one last time. maybe i’ll find someone who has the same problems i do? so if you wanna be friends, keep reading.

514,Meriland31,1555569467,3," 

So a little backstory in reference to my health anxiety/me.

Right before I was born, my dad was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well as heart failure. As a result, he went to the hospital frequently when I was young. Almost every other week. So most of my childhood was spent at the hospital or him talking about himself dying all the time. If I 'was' home (or not in school) I was by myself with my older sister because my parents went to the bar 6 days a week from when my mom got off work until bar close. I rarely ever got to see my mom, and if I did see her, she was belligerently drunk and extremely accusatory. The fights that they had were crazy. My mom stabbed my dad in the arm, cops came to the house sometimes, she threw hot fryer oil at him, strangled him, etc. It was toxic, especially since my dad was a provoking type of drunk. Me and my sister rarely ever had friends at the house cuz we felt embarrassed when they had arguments.

When I was five, I developed a severe anxiety disorder / hypochondria problem. I didn't understand disease or anything I just felt...dread and the doctor suggested that I not watch anything remotely negative or scary to try and counter it. This persisted until I was 12. My mom insisted I try and deal myself for a multitude of reasons but really he didn't want anybody to know that there were 'problems'. When I was 13 I lost 4 close friends in middle school. Asthma attack, then a car accident, then a heart attack, and another car crash. All within 1 month of each other.

Through this time they're still going to the bar, my Dad's health was deteriorating slowly. His legs started to swell with blisters and I would have to put compression socks on him or push the water out of his legs on a nightly basis. My dad was not the nicest guy either once my sister left the house. Once I hit puberty and I started becoming my own person (pianist, cook, making myself look pretty), he would try and scare me out of doing things like..""don't kiss a boy or else u'll get AIDS"", or when I was 15 and drank for the first time he sat on my lap and forced alcohol down my throat to teach me a lesson. These are the kind of things that were prevalent. My health anxiety as I got older wasn't as frequent but were still there and coincided with major events. And with the internet, WebMD became my go-to. I was so terrified of going to see a shrink, being told I'm crazy or something. I tried to deal with it/conquer it myself. From when I was a teen, I was told to get tested for IHSS cause it is 50% hereditary..so that if I had it, I knew my restrictions, but if I didn't know, sudden death was the usual symptom. My mom didn't find this necessary, but my dad did. When I was 19 I got into a relationship with a nice guy who turned into a violent sociopath. Beatings were normal, talking back wasn't allowed, and I decided to leave when he was killing my pets for fun. I had to fake a return ticket back to him so he'd let me leave, but I never came back.  
 When I was 24 I found out secondhand that my dad..wasn't my real dad. My mom had a secret affair with this guy who didn't want anything to do with me. Now this guy wanted back into my life and the dad I thought was mine biologically, was hurt by it.

Skipping ahead to 2015. I was 28 when I met Ken at a 4 day wedding event in Colorado. The sweetest, most healthy, outgoing glass half full kind of person u'll ever meet. We really clicked, hit it off as friends, Etc. At the time he was in a relationship (Angie) which was kind of a bummer but asked me about polygamy which I never really thought about but was open to it I guess?

Skipping ahead a couple months I came to visit him. At this point, we both had admitted we had crushes on each other despite the fact he was in a relationship... but they had an open relationship that his girlfriend agreed to. Ken told me that me and this girl named Sara are the only two people he's ever had a 'crush' on and that all the other people he's dated were just  placeholders for whenever he meets ' the one'...so he isnt'alone'. This Sara pen pal person had helped him through his previous divorce in 2010 and as a result he developed a fixation on her. He wanted a relationship with her, to move cross country to be with her, she didn't want that, he got friendzoned and lost trust in her but they're still friends but he's still clearly butthurt over it.

The ENTIRE time I visited him he was snuggling/canoodling love-like with Angie which was bizarre and uncomfortable, especially since she'hes a 'placeholder' to him &amp; he had intentions of ending things with her. I told him not to string her along before so his romantic actions towards her were bizarre. Ntm the fact I was a friend/guest and when she was around I didn't exist essentially and had to entertain myself. Kinda rude. When I questioned him about it, he said it was just to make her feel better? That she insisted on being there my whole visit.

At the end of that visit, I got a call from my mother and my sister saying that my dad took a turn for the worst. I came home to find my dad in septic shock and all his SATs dropping. He died later that night.

Skipping ahead through a lot of stuff. Ken eventually ended things with Angie, but was relationship phobic/ wanted FWB for now with me which was frustrating seeing as he wanted it so bad with Sara before. We visited each other a couple times, ended up agreeing for me to move in with him.

When I moved, everything was fine- we were perfect. Ken is extremely outdoorsy adventurous. Like sit in a tree and read a book while petting a raccoon kind of adventurous and that's not me LOL. He had a Sara book which had old poems and all this other crap, pics of her, even a list of what he looks for in a partner which was in his stupid Sara book. Needless to say, even though they weren't going to BE together I really didn't like the fact that they were friends given all this shit. About a half a year in, I went on my Facebook and saw he was still logged in so I wanted to see what he was saying to her. I just couldn't help myself. Of course they were talking flirty, etc, she even mentioned taking him to HAWAII, and talking about how good she's with her fingers. Yuk. This was all recent stuff. I flipped on him and his lame ass excuse to the Hawaii thing was "" no we wouldn't spend any time together I lost trust in her it's just a way for me to get a free vacation out of her since I paid $3k for her to get her teeth fixed so long ago"". (Yes, this person he never met but ONCE he hotwired $3k to get her teeth fixed before we met) Totally normal friendship behaviour.

A few months later I kind of snapped. I didn't want him to 'like' her anymore. I didn't want him emotionally cheating on me so I made a dumbass decision and created a fake account in her name spiting myself, and then I showed Ken and he blasted off on the REAL her. She had no idea what was going on and then he defriended her. After it happened, I regretted it. I was so disappointed in myself cuz it wasn't real and it made me an a\*\*\*\*\*\*. It ate away at me. So I told him I did it, prepared myself for any consequences, and he's just like... ""Its okay, I didn't want to talk to her anyway"". Well okay then? So from then until now-- 3 years? He's always told me he doesn't even think about her, he doesn't even want to talk to her,  doesn't care about her, she's just old news. And it was, Sara was old news to me and him. I hadnt thought about her in ages.

Ken asked me to marry him, we got planning underway, I had a 3 week health anxiety freak out that coincided with the wedding plans. I went to 3 neurologists who said I was fine. The wedding came, the health scare went. That was the only 'big' one for the next 2.5 years. (FYI Ken knew I had anxiety/hypochondria way long ago, I forewarned him of it in case I had a spell. He understood.). For the next few years, it was a good structure. I had a job with him, every day we snuggled, went to work, ate out, played cribbage, Netflix, spooning, laughed, talked, enjoying each others company. Most health concerns at that time throughout were quick and transient and didnt really interject. We had so much fun together..but then Kens parents wanted us to move in 3 months with then across country. After I quit my job to tend to getting ready for that, I had a full blown anxiety spell that wouldn't stop (Nov 2018). I didn't help as much as I should, Web MDing, not focused, out of it, scared out of my mind. At this point Ken was writing down logs (not a diary) on what happened/how he felt on it. A summary of it was like...""why won't u get help?"", his frustration that me not getting help for my anxiety is a direct insult to him in our relationship, ""why do I have to be the goto for anxiety Qs? Why cant u ask a therapist or a friend? Which I always tell u to do?"", he tried to do fun things with me but I don't pay attention cuz I'm on WebMD or something, I wouldn't believe him about his feelings, or arguments we had about me worrying about him falling away and him getting completely stressed out, me not tending to his needs/feelings cause I was worried all the time, that I'm not acting like a partner, I'm not acting like the partner he requested, not holding my own, not eating, etc. I kept procrastinating going to get psycho help.. thinking it was not in my mind but really happening to me and he was sick of it. I don't blame him on that. I mean, if I were given a nickel every time he said ""lets go to a therapist, and maybe I can learn how to deal with it too"" I would be rich. This was not a hundred percent constant. I would say 40%. Everything in between was fun and uplifting and amazing but if I was on the phone even for a second, he got short with me. I tried to not bother him with it, deal with it myself, so I don't stress him out/ use him as a crutch.

On April 2, we went to eat, cracked jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go to the movies and he was all for it. I gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting a friend and the text looked like it'd be something bad about me. When I politely asked, he lied to me saying it was about work. I could tell he was lying and asked why and he said, ""cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie"". I got angry, not cause he was talking to her about me, but him lying to me ABOUT me. I blew up. He went to the movie alone, and then he said this..

""

U've never believed how I felt about u. I'm going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with u anymore, I don't want to do things with

u

, u're not the person I want to be with. I gave u many chances to get help, I'm done and I'd like u to go""

I bawled and made an ass out of myself..

Me: ""I'm sorry...I'll get help I will""

K: ""it's too late, I'm done""

Me: ""do u really want me to leave?""

K:""YES""

Me: ""But, I really will go..""

K:""What, u think going to a therapist will make me suddenly have feelings again?""

Me:""u don't love m---??""

K:""Ugh I'm going to bed""

Me:""but..""

K:""BED. I have to be up at 6"" (shuts door).

I sent a long msg stating how I fucked up, he was right, I need help, etc and he didn't budge. I left him alone.

April 3,  I contacted every shrink to get a sliding scale appt...and got one for Apr 5th. I did EVERYTHING to improve the quality of my day. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, made dinner. Ken came home, and seemed..jubilant &amp; carefree..about his day (normal for him) to his folks. The bizarre thing was him being sparingly nice to me cause I was on my feet. I got 1 text from him ""I'm glad u got an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home"". Apr 4th, much the same.

Friday was my appt. I talked all about my past, childhood, fears, and Ken. I picked my fingers till they bled I was so nervous. The therapist mentioned PTSD/Somatoform Disorder and I was scheduled for that next friday too. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me finally and I took that as a green light. He was glad I went..but wary. He wanted to see how things go. He then spontaneously told me then that he started talking to Sara again. I was dying inside. He literally handed me his phone and said i can look at the msgs. (FYI, he's ALWAYS been open with his phone to me and made it clear if I was ever unsure I could look).

S: Why the request now?

K: i wanted to apologize for the loss of it. Long story

K: Sarah was worried I had feelings for u, and what she saw on our FB chat was confirmation enough for her. She snooped through my chats/texts. She wanted to 'test' me to prove I wouldnt leave her so she made a fake 'Sara' email.

Which was ridiculous. I knew how u felt about a relationship, she didn't. It was too much for her that we be friends. I had convos with her which she provoked me claiming u sent her these msgs. That pissed me off and she got the response she wanted. That I dont speak to u again. I didn't want to start conflict so I agreed not to contact u. It wasnt till before the wedding that I saw the acct she made. I thought, do I call this crazy thing off even though we put money into it or live with it? And that's the decision I made, obviously not a good one.

S: So why tell me after all this time? Are u still married to her? Someone who would lie and hurt someone like that? u don't know how bad that hurt""

K: I'm sorry, I told her we're done. I wanted to apologize sooner but I didnt want her to see. IDC what she sees now.

S: I actually feel sick. How many times have I tried to get u to listen to me? That chick is bag of crazy! I dwelled for months cause my friend didnt believe me.

K: Yeah, it made me sick to find out she played me &amp; what I said as a result. I don't want her in my life anymore.

S: I almost didnt take u'r friend req. cause I thought it might be her

K: Cant handle this shit. I don't know what I said to u cause I was talking to her. I just never knew if it was really u or not so i didn't.

(And then a bunch of MISC attempts on his end to start up paragraph long pointless convos despite her 1 word replies and many calls to her after work).  


I was going to vomit. I walked out to breathe. I asked him to come out to talk with me.

Me:""that was painful""

Him: ""yeah, I knew it would be difficult for u""

Me: ""u told her u contemplated marrying me then?""

Him: ""Yeah, that was such a big lie u did""

Me: ""it was, and I told u flat out I did it and was prepared and u let it go..""

Him: ""well thats cause I already knew. I found it on ur comp before u told me.""

Me: "" U didn't tell me that""

Me: Was it true about why u continued with the wedding?""

Him: ""I did it cause I love u""

Me: ""U said the money down was a factor in u'r indecisiveness""

Him: ""Stop. Why do u do that? U always jump to conclusions and not listen.""

Me: ""Do u really want a divorce?""

Him: ""I thought about it the other day yeah.""

Me: ""But, doesnt that even bother u?""

Him: ""U dont get to ask about my emotions anymore""

Me: ""okay..I just don't understand. We love each other.""

Him: ""Lots of divorced people are still in love...""

Him: ""I want to be with U. I love u. I never wanted it to get to this point, to contemplate divorce. I can't live my life like this! U're going to kill me!(cries) with u refusing help.""

Me: ""I'm going to someone, I'm really on this. This is it""

Him: ""I want to see u get help and I want U back""

The next few days, he wanted to do things with me. Movies, BBQ, fishing, bargain hunting, Thai dinner, cribbage. He laughed at my jokes, cuddled me, kissed my forehead a lot and smiled at me. It was a good time. I was so glad I had him back, and I was really working on myself, but I couldn't escape how confused I felt over 'how' he talked about me to Sara, the mistake I made, etc.

Me: (literally explained exactly what I said above about when I looked at those msgs, the Hawaii thing, blowing up making a fake acct, feeling bad about it)

Me: ""I told u that I did it and u let it go. I didn't know that u were harbouring this bitterness over it. It hurt to hear u resurface it like I'm some..monster. Like I'm some detested conversation piece.""

Him: ""Hun, I don't think ur a monster (strokes my arm) I know it was an old mistake.""

Me: ""Then why tell her part reason is cause u didn't want to risk it being me? That u thought I was still doing this?""

Him: I don't think u'r 'still' doing it. I only brought it up cause I had to explain to her what happened. If u and I were going to end, my BIGGEST regret that came out of our marriage was not apologizing to Sara for the horrible things I said which she had NO idea about. I don't even have an interest in talking to her hunny, just wanted to apologize.""

Me: ""When I admitted what I did and u let it go, u told me that u had no interest in talking to her anyway. I eventually believed that cause u always instilled it.""

Him: ""but, u also told me before that u didn't want me talking to her.""

Me: ""Well duh! U seem to think that me assuming u had interest in her based off of those texts was unfounded...do u even recall what u texted her?""

Him: ""Not really..?""

Me: ""U were half-serious talking about going to Hawaii together..while I'm here! U tried to convince me u wouldnt spend time with her there/do anything with her, u just wanted to get a vaca out of it. That she owed u after the 3k u gave her.""

Him: ""Oh yeah, I forgot about that..\*unsure shrug\*.""

Me: ""or talking to her about how ""good she's with her fingers ;)"".Saying that's friendly &amp; meant nothing..""

Him: ""Oh.. \*Purses lips and starts to giggle\*

Me: ""It's like----wait..why are u laughing? u think that's funny?""

Him: (giggling but trying to suppress it--clears his throat)  ""I..I don't have a comment.""

Since then it has been about 2 weeks..and we've been doing everything together, having fun, movies, etc. I've been doing all the house work, making myself pretty, giving him head massages, ASMR, dinners, u name it. About 3ish days ago my therapist suggested I write a single question down for him in a book per day for him to read at his discretion, and for him to do the same if he wants. Great idea and Ken was all for it. That day I asked him this:

Q: This morning I said something about  having other partners that was misconstrued I think. U'r response was ""\*chuckle\* so now I can, when u said I wasn't allowed to"". I'm confused, did u want another partner? I thought we established we only want eachother. Just want clarification?""

Ken: ""Monogamy means I only want u as a partner sexually + emotionally.  I'll work on re-defining what I expect and hope for in a partner""

I looked at his response and said ...""this doesn't answer my question at all..""

Ken: ""It is clear as crystal right there""

Me: ""O....kay?""

Ken: ""Hun, we agreed to a monogamous relationship together, that is what we have. I don't want to look for anyone else, be with anyone else....""

Me: ""Okay, that makes sense. I've just been on edge lately with all that has been going on, I don't understand. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells and I'm scared u are always one foot out the door while u hold me close. (then a small convo about how he'd been thinking of divorce the other week, not understanding how he wanted to never see me again...etc)

Ken: ""Hun...look at me \*holds my hands\* I love u more than anyone, I mean, u made me change my mind on marriage lol..I'll never love anyone as much as I love u . But, if u didn't get the help, u WERE dead to me. If u go back to how u were, u ARE dead to me. Do u understand? I'll always love u , that'll never change. It's like, I love my grandma, but she's dead and never coming back...it's like that. Of course, if u got better/got the help, then I would reach out to u again cause obviously u aren't 'dead' lol. Do u understand what I said?"" 

Me: ""....yes. Was it really that bad? We had such uniquely amazing times. U always said I was the 1..""

Ken: ""...If I'm not the 1 for u, then u aren't the 1 for me (wtf does that mean?) I was faking it those times, if u had looked up from ur phone, u'd see that""

Me: ""Faking it? How long?""

Ken: ""Since u started this anxiety thing in Nov. It wasn't 'all' fake then, but few and far between amazing times. Now I'm going to work on that list of what I look for in a partner and u can read okay?"" 

I read his list and it was literally the most standard list. I think he googled it and wrote it actually. Self sufficiency, selflessness, helping, humor (which is one of my biggest traits), listening, etc. 

That night we went to the club, and he sat just to watch me dance and just smiled at me. We had a lot of fun, of course I was still butthurt, but I let it go for the night. When I got off the floor, he complimented how radiantly beautiful I'm when I dance.. which felt nice. I was drunk and all I remember saying in the car was ""I'm worthless, and u are great. It's my fault, I'm sorry"" and him saying ""oh hunny a lot was ur parents. It isn't all ur fault. U know u are the love of my life"". For the next few days I took him to a fancy restaurant, fishing, all these places...buying him things, apologizing for dry dinner cause I tried BBQing for the first time, apologizing all the time for small things or habits to the point where he's like ""Hunny (kisses forehead), u can stop apologizing for everything all the time. I don't want ""Apologetic"" u... that WAS in my list of partner requirements. Just be  u \^\_\^ I love u"". So now I'm trying to level that out while fixing my anxiety, fixing my habits, not getting angry or questioning.

Due to how the school is set up, we have 2 category for students, 1's and 2's, 1's are freshman and sophomores and 2's are juniors and seniors. then those two groups are split into 2 categories, the art side and stem side. Me and the girl I like are on the art side, although they don't seem to focus on what i'm good at(media arts). I have a total of 3 classes with her, the first is math, but she sits on the opposite side of class so I cant really start a conversation with her. The next class is basically every other subject, and that class is 2 and a half hours long, however we are split into 3 sections, and were in separate sections. However soon we'll be placed in new groups for a project we have twice a year called Confluence which is really stressful, and there's a slim chance we could be placed in a group together. The final class I have with her is coding/electronics, and that class only has people work alone and there's no real way to start a conversation with her. She's pretty quiet so I can't just hop into a conversation she's in, and i'm to nervous/anxious to properly start a conversation.

It was hard to believe at first but I pretty much accepted that it was her time to go since she was in so much pain and was a bit relieved that she wouldn't have to endure it any longer. 

Since she left us, I've been feeling really isolated at home these days. She was always the first person I would look for when I got back from school and I have fond memories of hanging out with her in our front patio talking about life.

While she may have had trouble relating to my problems with school and friends, she would always listen and encouraged me to be strong regardless of what I was going through. 

I thought I could move on but her absence has been bothering me as of recent. She was really the strongest person I know considering she raised four kids on her own and was really the glue that held our family together. She was definitely my biggest influence in life.

Gender: Male

Age: 16.

From: South Africa.

Looking for (Friends, Gaming buddies, Someone to meet up with IRL): Friends I guess? Someone to talk to, share interests with, etc. WARNING: I'm very social and will chat for hours on end. Also, I tend to get attached really easily so I'm looking for a long term friendship.

Contact (Gaming IDs, Social Medias, or prefer to talk on Reddit): Reddit, Discord (PM for username).

Interests: Horse riding, gaming, volunteering on ambulances, technology, music (mostly pop and EDM), history, astronomy, among others.

Dislikes: Nothing in particular is coming to mind. 

Kids/Pets/Partner: I have a few pets, no kids (duh, I'm 16) and no partner unfortunately :(

Interesting fact about yourself?: Because I'm so lonely, whenever I meet someone, they instantly become the most valuable thing to me. This has its pros and cons, being that I'm extremely loyal and wouldn't betray them or intentionally hurt them, ever (pro), but I can appear rather clingy at times (con).

546,BackIn2001,1555507609,1,"Sorry if this is big but.. I'm a 17 yo male and my life seems... stale. As many of you, I also don't have many friends. I have 1 friend who I can really trust but we aren't even in the same school. On my school, basically who was my ""friend"" on other classes in the last years stopped talking to me, with exceptions of course, but we don't talk daily and I mostly need to start the conversations, and when we talk it's when we're going home by foot. This year, I'm glad to say that I found a group. During the breaks I have this group of 3 to 4 colleagues who talk to me, about diverse subjects. But to say the truth, I only talk with 1 of them ouside school. We hanged out a couple of times already so, as long as we stay in the same class I think I can call him a friend. He's also introverted like me but he stays to much time playing video games when he's home, and because of that he barely talks to me online, only giving the basic answers and the laughting emojis most of the time. I'm that type of person who likes to be nice to every one so that's just who I am in my class. Nobody hates me there but nobody loves me either. I'm always that guy who's there when you need your answers for the exam or for your homework. Other than that, I pretty much talk to nobody who's from my class, excluding a guy who sends me some memes online and sits next to me. My teachers are cool tho. The only problem is that we only talk during classes but I love most of my teachers. Really nice persons when you know them better.

I'm a pretty introverted guy. I don't like to do most of the stuff teens my age, older, or even younger like to do. I don't know why but at least who I know likes to hang out to random places that not even my parents would let me go, sometimes at night. I don't like to drink, smoke, I hate social media (besides Reddit of course, which is basically the social media for introverted people), I don't like to hang out just because, I don't like to use swear words, I don't like rap (even tho that's subjective every teenager nowadays seems to listen to rap). No. I love to read, I love to play video games, I love listening to good rock music, I'm currently learning to play the guitar, I love photography, I love to travel, I love to watch movies and shows... Yes, I like to stay at home but I also like to go out. The problem is that I have no one to do these things with. I would love to have someone to discuss the latest book I've read with, I would love to do a splitscreen party with Mario Kart at home, I would love to share my music taste with someone else who loves rock, I would love to have someone who also plays the guitar or even someone who sings while I play the guitar, I would love to have someone who loves photography just like me and we could take pictures together and create amazing memories while travelling, I would love to have someone to watch the latest Game of Thrones season with... Basically I want someone who I can literally love. I know it's impossible to find the ""Perfect friend"" but at least someone who enjoys some of the same stuff I enjoy. Yes, my friends enjoy video games, but they don't like to go out, they don't like photography, they don't like to watch shows, they don't like to read, etc..

And oh gosh, I really want to find a girl like this. Most people think males only want girls because of one thing. But it's not the truth. Well, at least for some. I really want a girl I can love with all my heart. Someone who cares for me, who loves me from what I am. Someone I can be myself with without changing my personallity completely. And I really want to love someone. I want to know what loving someone is besides your family. And *want * to feel love, and feel loved, while doing this stuff I like with that person, and also doing stuff that the other person likes to do. I need someone to hug and to hug me and tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Right now my life feels empty. I don't feel anxious or depressed anymore, because I learned to ignore those feelings. I don't care if you don't like me, because if you don't care about me, why should I care about you? I don't wish to end my life or anything like that, I'm just looking for someone to share it with, besides my family, which I thank them for being so supportive. Without them I would probably be a lot more depressive.

553,LewdLauryn,1555480728,1,"Hey, I'm not really good at talking about myself so I'm sorry in advance

I'm a 20yo female from Northern California. I'm having a hard time connecting with people (guys mainly) after they find out I like to take sexy pictures of myself (it really helps get me out my comfort zone and builds my confidence). Girls see it as body positivity, but guys just think I am just here to please them and I'm really sick of it. I don't want to give up something that I love just for a guy to have a real conversation with me.

I'm debating on starting a 2nd job just to be able to meet more people. The only way I'm meeting people right now is online or a dating app. 

I just feel so disconnected from people and that's it's impossible for me to find someone to be close with because I'm afraid they just want me for sex. 

I'm wanting advice on how to properly put myself out there so I can get something meaningful, or just someone I can be myself with.",lonely,Feeling unhuman,2019-04-17 15:58:48
554,lastcallcarrot,1555480223,6,"Title kind of explains it, as I've dipped in and out of this subreddit on and off over the past year whenever I've felt things get a bit overwhelming. Now though, with things the way they are I feel compelled to post for the first time. 

If you were to take a look at me from across a room, and then gotten to really know the state that I was in, it would be hard to reconcile the venn diagram of those two versions of me. I present and project a very different persona then how I really am. For a while, this really helped me to protect the hurt and pain I felt, but now it's starting to feel like a prison. 

Now, because I can't keep up this facade anymore , as well as me coming to terms with a pretty bad gaming addiction to cope with serious existential issues, I feel like I'm losing a war with myself. And because I've been mending the wounds of this war for the better part of a decade, I've been pretty detached from others for longer than I care to admit. I miss people. I miss love. I miss being needed and cared for. I just want to be wanted and to want in return. I'm lonely.

I'm fortunate to be an introvert, so I dont mind being by myself at all. I feel invigorated by my own company. But to move through life completely alone is not living at all. At least not anymore. I'm like a mindless zombie whose soul is trapped inside a rotting carcass, mindlessly chasing base hungers because the impulse is so strong.

556,goodbrain_nicebrain,1555476154,52,"I have depression, but being so alone seems to exacerbate the apathy of it tons. When I lay in bed during the weekend and think of getting up to do something, I've finally been catching on that the reason I can't find the motivation is a small voice inside that says, ""Why, there's no one to do it for?"" No one to do chores for, no one to crochet for (I've been trying to get myself to learn as a hobby), no one to watch TV with or discuss shows with. So why?

I admire those who are self-motivated, but I seem to lack that almost completely. When someone is around, I get a burst of energy and want to vacuum or whatever. But of course if someone is around it's because they want to hang out, not watch me vacuum, so THAT never works out, haha.

Even when I do manage to get up during the weekend, after a while I can't figure out what to do with myself. So back to bed I go. It's been a vicious battle. And now it's starting to affect my after-work life too (I work the stereotypical routine of Monday-Friday). I used to come home, full of the energy of being around people all day, and get tons done. But now the pressing loneliness is squashing even that. My chores are piling up, not that they aren't never ending anyway. But rather than tackle them at least, I want to go to bed (after I binge on reddit for a bit!).

I'm 38, had a boyfriend once for a short while, see a friend once or twice a month, I'm close with my parents but they're going through a continuing crisis (so I try not to burden them with my petty trials) and they live hundreds of miles away, my cat died, and I live alone. I feel lucky in a lot of ways--with those who are in my life, if distantly; with work; with being able to financially survive ok--but I'm worried that's not enough.

594,honeypilot,1555381001,18,"hi ! i'm new to reddit, just having made my account, so please be kind :-) i did some googling and tried finding a post that explained how i felt, but i couldn't really find one that articulated it correctly.

i just feel .... disconnected from people. i don't necessarily feel disconnected from life, because i generally love life. i think life is beautiful. i think the world is beautiful. i can go and sit outside or go on a walk and i feel connected to the world, to the earth, to life, but not to people. 

i look around, i observe, and it just seems like everyone is like ... a part of something, like they're all connected. and i'm just ... not. it's like i'm looking at everyone through a frosted window. i feel like an alien walking around, trying to talk to people in their language, trying to relate, but i just ... miss the mark. and this isn't new, i've felt like this for as long as i can remember. even when i was in elementary school; i had a large group of friends and was ""popular,"" but despite this i just always felt like an outsider. when i got to high school and got a whole new group of friends, i felt the same. it's like i would be sitting at the table with everyone talking, me talking too, yet i just felt ... separate.

i'm 20 years old and in college now and this feeling weighs heavy on me still. i admit, i am extremely shy and introverted, and so it's already very hard for me to make friends, but even with the friends i have (i only really have like ... 3 friends, and 1 of them is my cousin, and one is more like 1/2 a friend), even with my ""best friend"" (though i don't feel like i actually have a best friend, and i'm not really anyone's best friend), i just feel disconnected in some way. even with my parents. and i've tried to make friends, i've tried to connect; last semester i used to try to stand with some of my classmates before my comp 2 class and i would try to talk and joke, but i felt like i was another species compared to them. 

and it's not like i'm disassociating, because i don't feel disconnected from myself or my body or my surroundings, just from people.

i feel like i'm just some extra character in the background of a movie scene. but i'm not even notable. i'm not really funny, i don't talk a lot, i'm just kind of boring i feel like. and it's like i think people look at me and might think i'm cool, because i'm pretty and i have piercings and tattoos and i look tough and i ""look cool,"" but when they actually talk to me they're disappointed and just think i'm boring or weird.

I am a quiet person, typical shy girl I guess. I feel like an npc struggling to generate different topics when spoken to. My longest friendship is with someone I met online whom I’ve never met. 
I believe I am like this because my father was a very very socially awkward person. As in wouldn’t make eye contact with anyone including me. And he’s a pushover. He stopped talking to me, but that’s a whole other story.
My mother is not a socially awkward person. But growing up anyone I knew she didn’t agree with I couldn’t be friends with. She’s paranoid. And I believe that has driven away lots of friends because of it. I mean. It’s uncomfortable asking your adult friends for their parents phone numbers. And inviting people over is something she hates as well. She convinces me people are out to get me. 

I would like to meet and hangout with people closer to me. I’m twenty two and I already am growing in fear over someday realizing I might become the lonely cat lady of the block. I talk sometimes with my co workers. But I don’t know how to really push that and have conversations. 

If anyone has tips or advice on finding people near me with things in common or how to talk and befriend people I’d really appreciate it.

This guy who rarely comes into the office because he often works from home came in today. I had my headphones in and looked up at him as he was talking to the guy who sits across from me. I took my headphones off and I was waiting to greet him but he also had headphones in and I wasn’t sure if he was in a call, and we kind of just stared awkwardly at each other not greeting each other for a few seconds. I was going to wait to say hi but he just kept talking to the other guy. 

He then proceeded to go around the whole department and laugh and joke with everyone there, including a girl who just started working here a few weeks ago who wasn’t even looking at him and had her headphones in. After he finished greeting everyone he sat down in the seat next to me and we didn’t say anything to each other, and I felt like it was too awkward to greet him after he went around the whole office saying hi to everyone except for me.

Eventually I had to ask him a work-related question, so I made a comment about how it’s good that he’s here so I can learn some stuff from him about this new technology that the company is using, to which he responded, “you’re going to be really annoyed by me being here. I’m too jovial and happy”.???

What the hell? I had a good conversation with this guy a couple weeks ago and now all of a sudden I’ve pissed him off? I can’t put any blame on this guy because he’s literally the most loved guy at the office. I’m just so confused how I’ve pissed him off this badly.

I’m actually so fucking frustrated how this happened. It sounds so petty and trivial but I literally don’t understand what is wrong with me or the way I look. I know I’m not smiley all the time but what the fuck am I supposed to do if he’s talking to someone else. How am I so unapproachable?

Seems pretty standard for a college student right? The thing is, if you replace “college” with “school”, that’s exactly all I have ever done in my entire life. Two decades compressed into few lines of text. And when I look at those around me, I feel like the useless one; the dead beat. 

My best friend is currently working as an intern in Samsung and getting a nice pay for it. One of my lady friends is working in a project to automate production lines using state of the art tech, and getting paid 2K for it. My ex girlfriend studies nutrition and has published an article that has received international praise; she’s also sort of a “web celebrity” were we live and has become the “poster girl” for her college. Another friend of mine has published a scientific article detailing advanced uses of polymer materials in engineering; is currently developing a boat that runs on solar energy AND is an extremely talented guitarist that plays on two different bands. Finally, another friends has just won his debut fight, having a chance to get some sponsorship.

And me? Well, once a week, I take my dog to the pet shop to get cleaned up. And that’s it. 

All the people in my life have accomplished so much, while I feel like a waste of skin. The more time passes, the more I fall behind. I feel lonely, like a little kid who’s trying to play ball with the grown ups, but just can’t keep up with them. While they have so much in their lives, all I have is regret. Just this constant reminder that I can’t never truly find a group where I could fit in, and that all I’ll ever be is just fodder. The friend that trails behind. Am I that one character in a sitcom that never leaves the couch? 

Can anyone give any advice to help?",lonely,Ever felt like nothing happens in your life?,2019-04-15 16:10:45

634,ramenodules,1555299257,3,"Hey. I'm 22/M recently moved to a new city. I've been feeling really lonely lately. I feel like I'm turning into a hermit, shut up in my room on weekends. The few times I do hang out with people I feel like a shell of a person, I just do not feel at ease, it feels like I can't grasp any foothold with how to connect with people. I've also started feeling jealous and insecure when I do go out because I keep hearing about everyone's normal social lives with drama and fun and how they regularly go out drinking or hang out.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm down in the dumps, I keep telling myself that eventually I'll be able to make some friends, get into a normal relationship with someone who desires me. Having a social life is such a basic prerequisite for doing anything enjoyable. I keep reading about how the happiest people are people who invest in relationships and I'm so bitter.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was treated very poorly by my exes and my old friends, with everyone treating me like I was worthless. All factors removed, AT LEAST they have friends to hang out with and I'm so bitter about that. It's painfully obvious to see from my social media and from how quiet I've become that I don't have any friends. I'm quiet, shy, introverted and not quick witted. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I can't express myself clearly anymore. I want to scream or vomit out the thing that's blocking me from just letting it out. It doesn't really feel like I'm living life.

636,the-salty-squid,1555292961,9,"Every once in a while, I always get these HUGE waves of loneliness and a just a longing for affection in general...it's happening again now, and has been for the last month. I don't know how to deal with this. It's such an empty feeling, almost as if there's a pit in my stomach that I can't fill. I just want affection from my friends-since I don't have a boyfriend-but I'm too shy to ask for it.

I also just...don't know how to respond to affection either? like today I was hanging with a few friends, and the whole time we were all sUPER close to each other. My friend, who I'll call O, propped his legs on top of my lap and was leaning against me almost the whole day. I know for a fact, that O is totally okay with giving friends affection (hugs, cuddling, etc) since I asked him a while ago. Another person who was there was leaning on me, and me actually made me wrap my arm around him-which I didn't mind. I just didn't know how to respond to this so I just kinda sat there and did my own thing. It was kind of nice, but I also wanted to have someone wrap their arms around ME but I was too shy and embarrassed to initiate or ask for it. I hate that I don't respond well to this shit. I crave affection, but when I receive it, I literally blank and I don't know what to do. 

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this, I'm just kind of rambling. I don't know how to express my feelings when I'm lonely or longing for affection and attention. I have some bad coping mechanisms I use to get through this, but it's super unhealthy. I just don't really know where to go from here. I want to tell O how I've been feeling, but it's embarrassing for me, and I'm not sure how he'll handle it.

A while ago, while skimming through a magazine about philosophical topics, I stumbled upon a small article in which someone made a theory I still can't get out of my head.

The author, as far I can remember, believed most people nowadays who suffer from loneliness and the effects of it rather have somewhat of an inability of dealing with solitude. 
He went further and claimed that through such things as social media as a fake image that wrongfully displays the seemingly  constant activity and presence of people, humans gradually tend to lose their ability of being alone by their own. 
People, he said, can't be alone anymore because they think they need to be somewhere, especially online, all the time. 

He stated examples, such as many famous people and eremites who withdrew from society back in the earlier days so they could spend their time with ""important"" things such as philosophy, etc.. Comparing them to us nowadays, he believed many people who complain or talk about loneliness rather just have lost their sense of spending time with themselves.


I hope I was able to write down all the important aspects of that article as neutrally and well as I could. If not, I'm sorry for any grammatical or logical mistakes. 



My question is: do you, as members of this sub and as people who probably would consider themselves lonely, think there might be something onto that? Is the author completely right or wrong?



Again, I'm really sorry if this post made you feel uncomfortable in any way possible. I hope I could help you have a clean, rational discussion with yourself and thank you very much in advance for every comment.

I want to start out by saying…..I am sorry I did not post yesterday. I made an awful decision to stay up all night playing The Division 2 because I was talking to some people and replying to posts and I got SO carried away that I didn’t even want to go to bed. I skipped my night time pill that helps me go to sleep and that was not good..I have been noticing some side effects recently but I am okay for now. Anyway...I know some people...or...most don’t care about present problems..You’re all here to hear my story and I’m...I’m sorry for making you wait….So here it goes again….

Growing up, I was very….energetic child despite my health issues. I remember running everywhere and climbing trees. Getting into trouble with my one biological brother , who was always adopted with me, and my foster siblings. Like I said, I was adopted as soon as I was born...I don’t think I told you guys that though….Because of the state of my biological mom, she lost all of her children….But some of them got to be adopted by my Grandma. I remember going to this courthouse in the middle of nowhere sitting in a hot car for a few hours with my brother. And we would either being doing homework or just goofing off. But i remember every time my parents would come out, there would be still lady who would hug us crying. I didn’t know at the time that I was not living with my real family…..I think I know but I didn’t question it at the time. Anyway, later on when I was older, I learned that my biological grandma was trying to fight the system in order to adopt me and my brother so we could be with the rest of our siblings. She went to court three times and….lost three times…...Based on stories from my foster parents, the court didn’t allow her to adopt me and my brother because she already had adopted three of my other older brothers. And the court saw that she was not going to survive financially. So they would tell her no every time….But I learned of this law that is called ICWA. The Indian Child Welfare Act was a law that was put in place in 1978 to prevent native american children from being put in the foster care system if their relatives are still live. Basical, I wasn’t supposed to stay with my grandma or some other relative within my own family….But I’m not sure how I got put in the foster care system…..I have heard a lot of cases where this Act was ignored...and it’s sad not being able to be with your real family...Because growing up, I was prevented from learning about my heritage. My traditions and language…..I remember I always wanted to be Native American...Ha ha ha thinking about that I guess I thought I was white but...I don’t know...I don’t know how I knew something was off…..I just did….I remember going to my foster dad at the age of 8 and ..making the STUPIDEST question of my life….but it made a good story hearing it now….I think?...ANyway I was 8 and I was watching a movie and had Native Americans in it I think? And I went to my dad and said.

“Hey Dad?”

“Yes son?”

“.......I wish I was Indian..”

“Zach...You are Indian.”

“Then where’s my bow and arrows???”

I had a fascination with bows and arrows….I don’t know why though. Some people call it instinct….others call is wisdom...because we remember the things our ancestors learned and it gets pasted on to us through bloodline….god..I feel like I’m just rambling and just pulling everyone in so many directions…..SOrry about that...I...I have trouble focusing...sometimes….ok that was lie...It's a lot….Too much to remember. Anyway, i don’t remember that much of my childhood. It’s just bits and pieces….Some good...but mostly bad….In this foster family, my  guardian father was a paster and my foster mom was a pastor’s wife. They would go on missionary trips to other countries spreading the Christian religion. My foster dad was gone a lot. Either at the office at church or in his home office. I would see him for dinner meals sometimes but only on weekends sometimes. Mostly it was me, my biological brother, another native child that was adopted, and the foster family’s own three kids. So there were a lot of us….I will get into more detail in the next post about what life was like with this family….But I’m going to stop here….Mainly cause I don’t want to bore you guys and girls but also because I need to go eat too….I live on a college campus with a meal plan…..I don’t know why I said that….I feel like i’m still jumping all over the place...Anyway thank you for taking the time to read this. I have another post that I guess goes in to the first part of this...I don’t know what this would be called…..I just call it sharing my story. But you can see all my posts on my profile. So...I will talk to you guys and girls later...And...thanks for being curious about my story….",lonely,My Story...At least part of it Pt. 2,2019-04-15 04:03:03

I never really felt pleasure from it. I never think about it. I don’t go crazy when I go without it. I never actively seek it out. I have little to no drive, *at all*.

I don’t understand why sex has to be such an important part of a relationship. I want a life partner. Someone who I can share in hobbies/activities with, learn things with, grow with, explore new places with, have adventures with, etc. I crave the closeness of knowing someone else inside and out — almost more than they know themselves, and for them to want to know me too. I want to be able to encourage and support “my person” in life to be the best they can be! I want to be there for someone through their lowest lows and their highest highs. I want to be devoted to someone who is as equally devoted to me.

I want to be physically close to my partner too. I want hugs, snuggles, kisses, hand-holding, etc. I just don’t want the sex. But I can’t expect someone to give up their sex life to be with me, and I don’t want someone to expect me to have sex just to be with them, either. I have been sexually taken advantage of before (mostly due to this whole problem) and it has made me feel even worse, as if my only potential value for a life partner is the sex, but not anything else I could bring to the table.

i have a few generic ones, like drawing and gaming, but the issue with those is i rarely have the motivation to do them. therefore have a hard time creating a conversation about them. 

im also into true crime/ supernatural shit but that just creeps some people out. no im not a murderer or one of those people you saw in a video who wants to fuck serial killers, im just interested in the mystery behind it all. 

there's also other random things im interested in that can get a good chuckle out of people. for example, a few disney shows. which i guess sorta warrants a chuckle, but that doesn't make it any more fun for me. 

there's also the issue of some things im into just being niche, not necessarily completely  unpopular but you'd have to have do some digging to find them. think sanders sides or stardew valley. (which again, not saying no one is into those but it's just more and likely if you asked most people about them they'd probably be like ""oh yeah, i totally know about that hahahah."".  it'd be like family gatherings, and im definitely not saying that to be relatable because my family is too much of a spread out, broken mess to ever have one.)

anyway, that's a post for an attention starved me to make and delete soon after for another time. as i was saying there's also some popular things I'm just not into, im borderline hipster at this point because of some of it. not into marvel, not into alot of popular shows like GOT or ST, don't do sports or any sort of smarts (do people even say that anymore, because if not that demonstrates my lack of 'smarts' perfectly), ect.

it feels isolating, especially when something new comes out about those sort of things and you have no fucking idea if people around you are speaking a language you know anymore.

(Long post)

I’m a 17y/o male, kissless, virgin, 5,11 slightly above average looking, slim, slightly athletic build if that matters at all. 

I’ve nearly properly dated someone but she ended it before anything could really start. I don’t blame her, I didn’t know her that well in the first place. (Only two real dates that never hit off)

I’ve posted on here before and received some good advice. And this is something of a sequel to that. Sadly, despite the advice, things don’t look up at all.

So there was another house party or gathering if you will, around 20 people including me who all somewhat knew each other. The gathering was my crushes house, and to say I was hopeful would be an understatement. 
I’ve liked her for years but I don’t think at any point she’s expressed interest in me, or maybe she has and I was too stupid to notice or do anything about it.

We headed to the local park, and all the way there she’s been real close to a friend of mine (not the same one as last time). He’d been acting real nice to her the past 3 weeks, (hugs, compliments etc.) but he’s like that with a lot of people and he’s a fairly comfy guy to be around. That’s when I first noticed it and did nothing, I told myself they were just being friendly, and that if I got the chance I would be the same.

We got to the park and everyone had a fairly good time, I got stoned, most others got drunk. And my crush and friend definitely made out. When we got back I was starting on a low. And they (crush+ friend) disappeared to her bedroom. So there I am wishing I was dead, i don’t know what they specifically did in there and I don’t want to know.

The way she talked to me that whole night was different to the way she talked to everyone else. She seemed like she didn’t even want know me. And I remember she said something mean which I didn’t hear cause i was stoned and half asleep, and she apologised later for it but wouldn’t tell me what she said.

Anyway I head home with the friend because we both need to catch the same bus. And he sees that I look upset and eventually he catches on to why. FYI I don’t want to ruin what they have or guilt them, but it’s still agonising. He’s gotten with every girl he’s ever flirted with meanwhile I’m a fucking loser.

Another thing that pissed me off is that my friend straight up admitted that he only compliments and hugs people for the sake of social advantage or that it’s a “strategy” for getting girls to like You. I feel like shit like that should be genuine otherwise you just devalue those things.

I don’t even want to be around either of them anymore, it’s too painful. She’s gorgeous and funny.
How can I stop liking her seeing as all I’ve ever got out of it was pain for the past 3 years.

As the title suggests, I am currently feeling very lonely at university. I am a medical student at a UK university and started in September 2018, moving from another EU country.

I am living in halls, but I have had issues making friends, and I don't know why and my flatmates and I only occasionally talk, and when we do, it's very short and curt. I am usually rather outgoing but I have not 'clicked' with anyone from my course except for with some people I sit next to in lectures. With these people, I have tried to suggest going out for a pint or going to a film, but they always seem to find an excuse.

I know that most people at university have trouble finding people right away, and that many are good at creating an illusion that they are having fun and partying all the time, but many I speak to are content with where they are; I just cannot be. 

I am also restricted by the fact that I am at medical school, and many societies I have tried joining have socials when I have lectures/am not available, so my question is whether I can do something at this point, or whether I should suck it up and let time do its thing.

I don't eat animal meat, and it's important to me. Up until now, I haven't had a single, lasting veggie friend and would like to change that. Why lonely vegetarians? Because I was once one.

Right now, I'm having a bit of an emotional metamorphosis of a sense. For years, I was just numb due to an emotional breakdown I had in December of 2012, where afterwards, I was so numb. I couldn't feel anything. I had nothing to offer anyone anymore, and little by little, became removed from people I knew, by choice, until I left it all behind in Mid 2014 when I deleted all social media and cut contact with everyone. I was alone because I wanted to be, and I didn't feel lonely; I was proud of that. 

But after all these years, I feel like I am capable, and am willing, to provide so much of what I was lacking before my emotional breakdown (love, attention, affection), and afterwards (understanding, validation, closure), until there was nothing left(removal, numbness). 

Up until now, I have known loneliness; foregoing loneliness for  numbness as a state of existing to avoid conflict and maximize peace; solitude as an ideal to be reached; being alone without feeling lonely; and solitude as something to overcome for the sake of ending a repeating cycle of numbness and venturing for something new in life (the beginning my current phase).

So I know quite about this subject matter. Hope to hear from someone. &lt;3",lonely,any lonely vegetarians out there?,2019-04-14 04:07:01

708,Supib,1555145269,0,"*these are my own thoughts and ideas I never meant to antagonize anyone. If I did. I'm terribly sorry.*

I'm writing this after a heartwrenching break up where I got left because my ex lost feelings for me. Sad boys. I've come to realize how lonely I've become without her. Sitting here reading the many post made by similar lonely people I feel sad.  I've come to terms with my loneliness. But I just can't stop thinking of how big the problem loneliness is to the younger generation (I'm 21). 

It has dawned on me the ""power"" the thing called the internet has done to society. It has created infinite platforms where communication of all levels can be achieved. This ""power,"" in my mind, is bringing death to the younger generations. They (the younger generation) choose to make friends with people via social media but often times the friendship is superficial, it ends just as fast as it started. Society has lost the aspect of face to face interactions, which I believe, is where we truly find our life long friends. It's not just what we say but the actions, the emotions, the touch of the person (friend) where we truly find our significant other or our true life-long friends or quite simply friends. I hated talking to my ex on social media, it just ruined the aspect of what communication  is really defined as. This was a huge part of why we broke up. 

Sorry I was diverging. 

Communication. Friends. Love.

If you have none of these, wouldn't you be lonely? 

The aspect of communication have been digitalized. I'm wrong? Prove me wrong. Where is your handwritten mail?  Humans were never built to communicate without seeing the person being talk to. We were built to communicate with our voice. Humans is on top of the food chain because of the ability to speak and communicate ideas and knowledge. Without speech we would be useless.

I am not really sure why I am even starting this as I'm normally so protective of any possible vulnerable emotion. 

I work as a first responder in a major city, in 2012 I was diagnosed with PTSD after witnessing a particularly disturbing call. I used to be a fairly out going individual and though I seem to make initial friendships, I can never form any lasting connection because I am incredibly shy and self conscious. I am not sure what has changed in me, but I feel like I'm a kind gentle person who can no longer socially connect. I find myself doing things like going to the gym or library or coffee shop just to be around other people. And as I'm now 33 I feel like I'm passing any possible chance to form a caring relationship. I am not really sure what to do... you don't make new friends at 33.. and I distanced myself from my old friends.

Anyway, I guess I could go on for 20,000 words about my problems. If there is any like minded individuals who regardless of age just want to be in contact with other humans who at times sufer from the affliction of having to be social beings, contact me!

Like I said, I am a 33 year old male, very liberal I am a pretty avid gamer so if any other lonely soles want to hang out on discord and game or watch twitch or a movie or talk about cool new science etc please let me know.

I liked it because their personalities clashed yet they were still best friends. You had Yahtzee, the English cynic who saw fault in everything and had next to no joy in his life besides video games and alcohol. And Gabe, the optimistic Australian who had overcome depression and drug addiction with a story to tell and a smile.

It doesn't sound like much, but I used to watch it every Sunday when it was uploaded - there was a as all chance there wouldn't be an upload. Whether or not it was uploaded determined how good my Monday was. See, at the time I was in my last year of high school and I couldn't wait for it to be over. I hated high school, I knew I was gonna fail my exams and I really only had one true friend.

Every Sunday morning I'd make bacon rolls and watch the show. If it was under an hour, I'd watch it all at once. If it was longer, I'd watch half in the morning and half at night before bed. This was my ritual.

And then it ended. Yahtzee moved to California, leaving Gabe behind in Australia. They decided to end the podcast there. It ended on August 27th 2016. I'll never forget that day. I lost something special to me, my Sunday podcast.

There has been so much on my mind the last few years that I feel I need to scream it into the void because I still cannot fathom how to deal with it. Anytime I write or talk about it all I cry. I end up writing screeds so I just want to bullet point some of the main parts.

&amp;#x200B;

\-When I was 13 I was groomed at raped by an older student in my school. I didn't understand or realise it at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

\-When I was 15 I realised what had happened, told a few close friends and became really depressed

&amp;#x200B;

\-Friends became distant, started cutting me off, including my lifelong best friend. I dropped out of school the day I walked in, sat down and a table of over 20 girls all stood up and left. No one would even speak to me, and no one really has again

&amp;#x200B;

\-Despite dropping out and not studying, I sat and passed 3 exams with good grades, went to college, while battling trauma, depression and insomnia, and loneliness form no friends and a young, emotionally abusive boyfriend

&amp;#x200B;

\-I tried to go to therapy, but my GP sent my files to the wrong place 3 times while I attempted suicide on several different occasions, ending in hospital visits. I had therapists stand up and walk out on me, because I was in the wrong age bracket.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My emotionally abusive boyfriend constantly argued, put me down and dumped me, then done a 180 apologising, I was young, naive and suffering from such loneliness I kept taking him back

&amp;#x200B;

\-I can only assume my old friends spread what I told them about my rape, despite it being told in confidence. I got a message from the person who done it, saying they heard a ""awful rumour"" from an old friend that he had raped me. I ignored it.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I was on a night out with my boyfriend and his friends.. That night I was uncomfortable because my rapist was there, but my boyfriend refused to leave. Once the guy left, a group of his 20-something friends came over shouting to me, attacked me and threatened to kill me. Did my boyfriend or his friends step in? No. In the days after when the police needed any evidence they could get to charge these people, did any of his friends help me? No. Straight up refusal, even though they witnessed the attack.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I reported my rape officially to the police, something I had never wanted to do, but I was now terrified of this man, alone with no friends and felt I needed to do something. I had little control over how this was investigated apart from my statement, and names from the people in my life at that age. I wasn't updated regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My boyfriend confessed to me that my old best friend from school, a relation of his, spoke to him in a pub at length about me on a night out. She grabbed him and kissed him twice. It sure hurts when someone you once considered a lifelong friend goes to those lengths to hurt you. Although I was doubtful of this at the time, on another occasion I ran into another one of the people from that group, who confirmed that it happened (and expressed how awful that girl had been - which confused me, as they are close friends, but at this point I hadn't seen them in years)

&amp;#x200B;

\-Another girl from my past ran into me on a train, and started shouting at me about ""sending police to her door"". Busy train, in front of so many people, she shouted about the case, how I had no right to ""scare her mother with police at the door"", that I was stupid, etc. She then sat on the phone to her mother for the whole train ride, talking loudly about me, how pathetic/stupid/ignorant etc. I was while I sat mortified on my way to study at university with a student I barely knew. I couldn't understand the hatred she must have had for me, I know if I ever had the police at my door asking for help on a rape case of a girl I went to school with years earlier that I wouldn't be mad at the girl

&amp;#x200B;

\-My rapist was questioned, in jail for a bit, then released. He confessed to what he done, so I was told by the police, but it didn't get through court due to ""not enough evidence"". When I asked the police on this, it was due to what my old friends had said in their statements. These girls were my only friends in school. They knew me, knew the person that raped me, saw me fall into depression and drop out of school. I never knew why they all cut me off. Or why suddenly one day they were writing screeds of hate about me online. Writing horrible comments about me on pictures of us without realising I could see it

&amp;#x200B;

\-I found out I may have Aspergers, asked my psychologist who helped me but cannot confirm. I cannot afford a psychiatrist to confirm for me, but after reading it 100% describes why so much of my life has been a challenge. I struggle to make friends, hold a job, I don't understand social politics and I actually haven't had a friend in so long I have forgotten how to socialise, and before it was already so much of a struggle. I can barely remember friendship yet I long for it so much. It has been 7 years. Everyday I lie in bed and think about how much I want to die, the only thing that stops me is putting my mother, and other family, through any more pain than my unfortunate teenage years already brung

&amp;#x200B;

\-After a relationship of lying, cheating, constantly getting put down and dumped just to be begged back, I finally left my ex. It was a horrible relationship that made the above all so much worse, butI sincerely hope he changes and that his next girlfriend is treated a lot better.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a ton more of these situations I could write here. I do not think I am a perfect person, and I have been mean to people, but it is always in retort to these situations and I tend to cut people off instead of turn every single person against them. I once had to walk out of school through a crowd of people who lined up to chant that I ""took it up the bum"", referring to my rapist, because he told everyone he done that to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The above has been happening over 7 years. I completely hate myself now. I feel ugly, stupid, unwanted and unloved. I am forever grateful for my family, who took my side and helped me, but I still feel so incredibly alone as I haven't had a proper friend in 7 years.  Everytime I accidently come across photos on social media of the people from my past, all together and still friends, after everyone has been so shit to me, it feels like a stab in the heart. I don't want anything to do with any of these people, but I still feel so pathetic and alone. It's hard to change your mindset of yourself when my main experience of people has been this. I just don't know what to do. I feel like help with aspergers would help me, but I'm stuck behind a paywall and I just don't have the money. I know friends would help, but it's incredibly hard to seem to find people at my current age - I thought it would be easy but everyone already seems to busy with all the friends they've had throughout their life.",lonely,I feel like my past has ruined my life and I don't know how to deal with it.,2019-04-13 10:11:28

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in a hospital on March 4th, 1991. An age where technology was only starting to expand in an advanced way. I was born to a woman who struggled with alcohol and drug abuse for a long time. She had given birth to 6 boys....A miracle in itself....because my family had a history of only produces male babies. Anyways...I am the fifth son of out the six....When I was born, I suffered from infant alcohol syndrome....that lend to complications during birth...For one, I was born premature....doctors' said I was a miracle baby because I weighted just under a pound and was small enough to fit inside an adult hand. Body and all.....But I was always suffering from water fluids being forced into my lungs....One sec I was breathing....and the next sec, I was dying....I was rushed to the emergency room to an operation. With a very low success rate considering my size....But somehow I managed to pull through. I was died for 4 minutes....But I don't remember this....only what my foster parents told me. Because of the operation, I couldn't breathe well so I had to be put in an incubater. Its odd saying that because I remember being inside of it....It was really cold...and it always felt like you was stuck in a windy cage....I don't know how long I spent time in there....If you think to problems stop with a near death experiences, you will soon learn why I was called a miracle child....I only remember this from talking with my foster parents but I also was born with fragile retinas....The back of the eye socket where the tail is didn't develop properly so I had really thin tails. I don't know what the tail of the eye socket is called....I can't remember certain things...Anyway not only that but I also had a hearing problem as well...I had surgery to fix the ear canals in my head with plastic tubes....I honestly didn't even know I had tubes in my ears for a long time....I always thought they were still there but I had another surgery to have them taken out....All this time growing up I was telling up I had tubes in my ears like it was a gold ticket. I was kinda of a ridiculous child with a wild imagination.....I don't know how long I was in the incubator....how when the surgeries to fix my ears happened....I do know that I had three eye laser surgeries to fix my eye tails but because they all went unsuccessful it got too thin to fix so now I wear glasses....I have been wearing glasses all my life...I thought about getting contacts but I'm honestly scared to put things near my eyes. For fear of going blind...And because of having thin eye tails....fucking eye tails....someone please tell me what the part is actually called...I feel silly saying eye tails...Anyway because of how thin these were, I couldn't play contact sports like football or baseball....cause the rumor was if i got hit hard enough in the head, the ""eye tails"" would tear and I would go blind permanently....But do you think that stopped me from rough housing it with my siblings? Not...one....bit.....ha ha ha....ah.....anyways...I think that's all I will share for now...I will post more tomorrow. I think...depending on how this does.....

&amp;#x200B;

Um....If anyone would like to talk to me,....please let me know....I don't have that many people to talk to....so I hope I get to meet some of you....thanks for the support too.....It was....really emotionally draining but in a good way....

More and more, I find myself in overwhelming disbelief and dissociation with the world. I looked in the mirror this morning and couldn't fathom that the disgusting creature looking back was me. At multiple times during the day, I will forget where I am and what I'm doing. I'll become, for a moment, completely detached from the world. It's like an inverted version of those brief moments of lucidity you sometimes have in your dreams.

That's what it feels like a lot of the time. Like this is all just a really bad dream. It's so difficult to believe that life can be *this* bad. I just want someone to love me. That's all, and it seems like so little to ask for. It's so common, it's so banal, so everyday. It isn't every day that someone becomes a billionaire, or rises to power, or attains international fame.

But I don't think a day goes by without one human being loving another human being. Exclusively, romantically, mutually.

That's my aspiration. That's all I want out of this life. That's all I've ever wanted. But it feels like the one thing I can't get. I've been depressed about this for years, but it feels like it's going to reach its peak soon. I hope I'll kill myself on impulse.

I've been really angry and frustrated about all this. Shouting, throwing things, ugly crying, all that... Sometimes everything feels all too immediate, all too much, all too real. And sometimes it just feels so shockingly absurd and satirically awful that I just can't process any of it as reality.

I just want love. That's literally it. That is all. That is the one thing. And I'm never going to get it. I've been trying to improve myself, but I can't outpace this creeping depression no matter how hard I try.

I always end up meeting people, normally tourists and people here on work visas because there are a LOT of them in this city, but it’s not like I end up making meaningful connections with 99% of them, and I have to spend a LOT of my time fending off advances from men who see my little blonde self alone in a bar and circle like vultures.  Usually though I end up with a group of drunk girls or a group of tourists just hanging out. I feel like it’s hard to explain to my bf and to others why I do this... but at the end of the day it’s because I’m lonely. I’m lonely without friends. I’m lonely not having anyone to do things with. My boyfriend is wonderful but he can’t bear the burden of being my boyfriend and my entire friend group. And I pick bars because you can’t just walk into say, a coffee shop or a mall and go up to a group of people and be like “hey wanna hang out?” (I mean you could, but I don’t imagine you’d be very successful). 

I just need to know I’m not the only one who does this. The thing is I wouldn’t even bother if I just had friends but... I don’t.

My first friend, I don't remember at all because I was around three when I was friends with her and she wasn't even that nice if I remember correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

My second friend, however, was incredibly toxic and I was friends with her for five years. I was considered ""special"" by the teachers due to my undiagnosed autism and this person used me to get special perks at school. What makes it worse is they would constantly lie to me so much that I don't even know what was true and what wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

My third friend was only my ""friend"" because of ""friend"" number two. These two use me at the same time and this person really didn't even hang out with me or even try to get along with me, she was just constantly hanging around ""friend"" number two.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it all got too much for me and I left that school to go to another one far away from those people, I was there for two years and didn't make a single friend. Then I left that school too and didn't go to another one because of my autism.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years passed and I was still not at school, so I had spent those two years writing and one day I found someone who liked my writing and contacted them. Eight months later and she's my first ever friend to have not been toxic or easily forgettable.

I am having trouble dating and getting into relationships. I do have a lot of social anxiety, but I have grown/worked through it a lot in the last 4 or so years. 
Nobody ever asked me out in high school or university. It just never happened. 
This had always affected my self esteem A LOT. I thought I must be hideous, annoying, ugly etc because I still did not kiss anyone till I was 21. It made me feel horrible, very unwanted and discarded. Because everyone eventually starts dating, right? 
I did not go on a date until I was 21. I did not get an actual boyfriend until I was 22, same age I had sex for the first time. We dated for about 3 months, until he broke up with me. He broke up with me because he was depressed and did not feel like it was fair to me. I tried to protest this and said I was happy with how I was being treated, but it ended anyways. 

Pretty soon after that I dated another guy for about 2 months, but he also broke up with me because I guess he realized he didnt actually like me but did not want to break up with me over the holidays? I felt like he just kept me around to have sex with, not because he actually liked me. This made me feel very bad. The day before he broke up with me we had sex and the condom broke so I had to get a Plan B pill on new years eve. The next morning he called me on the phone to break up.

Just last week I had things broken off with me again. This guy was so so promising though. I never felt like I hit it off so good with someone. He was caring and sweet and really seemed like he liked me. I did not feel any pressure or much anxiety around him. It felt good and I was always excited to see him and i would get sad if I didnt get a reply from him for a day and a half. We went out for about a month. We didnt have sex or define the relationship. He said he wasn’t sure if the feelings were there because he said he sometimes feels like he doesn't feel things strongly in general. And his Grandma just died but he said he isnt close to his family. I cannot understand how someone who would say things such as “my bed smells like you” or “i wish you where here now” would suddenly turn on me. He said he prefers to wait to have sex, which I am fine with, but even when I slept over at his house 3 times he never tried to cup a feel.
I re loaded dating apps today. I saw his profile on hinge and I am a bit confused, I dont know if its an old profile or if he is looking to string someone else along just to throw them on the side of the road.

I feel consistently abandoned again and again. I dont know if I can handle this. It makes me feel HORRIBLE that I am 23 and I have never had a relationship for more then 3 months. I mean 16 year olds have longer relationships then that. It makes me feel so ugly and unwanted. Like why would anyone EVER want to date some girl who cant keep a guy for more then 12 weeks? 

No one has ever told me they love me in a romantic context.

I feel like no one ever likes me. It makes me feel so empty and depressed inside. It makes me think maybe if you get a nose job, a brow lift, this surgery and that you will be attractive enough to the point where they will not leave you. 

I dont know how I can wear my heart on my sleeve again and again if everytime I do someone just leaves me to die and bleed out. 

Why do people leave me? I dont want to be abandoned. Its a constant fear that looms over me. I just feel like such ugly garbage. i am not enough for anyone, no one likes me.

776,pequenodsastreanimal,1555006386,32,"Sorry but... this bullshit is gonna be long. I’m 17. Really introverted. I’ve always sort of liked being unnoticed, because I generally can’t relate to how most people my age are (I don’t like drinking or partying), so I would just spend time with who I truly felt I was comfortable with. That means I’ve always had only one or two close friends, perhaps within small groups up to five or six people. However, there was always that one friend with who I would spend loads of time, just the two of us, because we truly matched and understood each other. It’s been years from that, and they all have found other friends and changed. And I don’t think I have. 

However, it’s not that I want to (change), because I am mostly ok with myself. The thing is that I don’t really seem to be able to create new friendships (although some of the old ones still remain), or even get out of my comfort zone and meet people. I’m referring mainly to the highschool environment (which is where I spent more “social time” these days). Most people just ignore me, and if they talk to me it’s just because they need something. May have something to do with the fact that I’ve always liked learning and mostly had good grades, while most of my peers are truly dismissive of highschool. You know, the “nerd” thing. People just talk to me when they need help, because they see me as a boring, the “only cares about studying” kind of person (which, by the way, couldn’t be further from the truth), I suppose. I don’t really know how people think I am. It has never interested me that much, but the fact that no one ever seems to be interested in me has me thinking about it more often than I would like to. 

It’s true that I don’t have any initiative when it comes to social situations, but it’s just how I am. I don’t like small talk. Sure I talk to people everyday, but I don’t feel like I have any real bond. I crave for deeper, meaningful connections. I don’t see why I have to force myself when I’m not enjoying social interactions, but at the same time I feel frustrated because I have very few people to turn to. Even when I’m with one of them, I often feel like they aren’t truly interested in what I am saying. However, I know it might be just my perception, because I am aware that my self-esteem isn’t really high. 

Idk. I have two or three people I can count on, but I feel like they aren’t enough. I would just like to find people my age with similar interests. I know maybe this will sound pretentious, but I feel as if I were an older person trapped in a teenager body. Most people my age seem quite superficial to me. I don’t like shopping, exposing my life on social media or talking about gossip. I like reading, listening to music (mostly indie rock), drawing (mandalas), watching films and TV series, staying in and doing all the above (as well as talking about all those things), going for a walk with my dog... I mean, it’s pretty normal stuff. I don’t have a really high concept of myself. I just can’t understand why I can’t find anybody who seems to share some of those interests and wants to get to know me.

So during freshman year I went to a new school and found a great group of friends. We would talk in group chats all the time, go to each other’s houses, the mall, movies, etc. Then sophomore year came around and the beginning was nice as usual. We still talked and I really thought we’d stay close as usual. Then around my birthday it seemed like we wouldn’t ever talk and i thought we were all just falling off. 

Apparently I was wrong as they just wouldn’t talk to me. They began going places without me all the time, even when they know I’m at home by myself. The thing is, I never did anything or said anything that would make this happen. They just always exclude me and I never get invited anywhere. 

Sometimes I get invited but it’s only after I’ve posted something about being lonely on my Snapchat or instagram story so it doesn’t feel the same as them inviting me out of the blue.

A few years back when I was maybe twelve or thirteen, my dad outright screamed at him for God-knows-what-reason for what seemed like hours. And the abuse goes past my poor grandfather. He verbally abused my older brother and I. He always yells at me and complains when I act openly depressing, because I'm goddamn depressed and suicidal, and despite knowing I'm depressed  (but not knowing I'm suicidal), he still treats me like shit for it. He says I don't do anything right over the simplest things. He threatens to take things away from me when I don't oblige. Again, the list goes on. He even used to hit, not slap, not tap, PUNCH my oldest brother when I was a lot younger, according to my mom. Said brother now never goes to his house and hasn't for about two years now. And to top it all off, one of the most horrific things I've seen him do, though it's still low on the list, is how he treats my poor dog, Candy. She's technically his/the whole families, but I have her in my room almost 24/7. He's better with her nowadays, though not by much, but it's still awful what he did. He would hit her, and a lot. Punch, smack, kick, even throw sometimes. One time, she was being yelled at by him, and she jumped up on a chair and was cornered by him. She was afraid. He kept yelling at her to get off the chair in front of my brother and I, but she was too afraid to move. After a few seconds, he picked up a curtain rod, one with a big metal ball on the end of it about the size of a marble (or bigger), and he whacked her thigh with it. Over. And over. And over. She yelped in pain as he did, him hitting harder and yelling at her to get off louder and louder. Eventually, my brother and I stepped in and goddamn yelled at the guy, basically telling him to piss off. He got mad at us for defending the dog, and stormed out of the house. He doesn't hit her as much or as hard anymore, just taps on the snout, but he still unjustifyingly puts her in her cage and yells at her. He does it if she follows him, if he's cooking and she stares at him, when she stares at him in general, whenever she wanders and doesn't lay down, whenever she licks the kitchen floor, and more. She gets yelled at and put in her cage for no good reasons. She's such a sweetheart, too. She almost always listens, she's never went to the bathroom in the house, and she's always nice. And still, he acts as if her abnormal anxiety and behavior is so random and bot warranted. Always saying she's probably just dumb, or that her previous abusive owner caused it. Yes, she had an abusive owner before us. The guy even threw her out of a moving car. Anyways, it's ridiculous. I think he's bipolar. One moment he loves the goddamn dog, the next he hates her. Same goes for people. As if my physically abusive stepfather wasn't bad enough, my actual father is horrible too. Sorry to make it about the dog. Anyways, this is a heavily watered down version of everything, he's a lot worse than I may have made him seem, but I just wanted to vent after he started treating me like shit for being depressed again. Sorry for any typos too, I rushed this in case he may have seen the title. If anybody has advice, please tell me. I feel imprisoned by him because he's my parent.",lonely,I hate my father.,2019-04-11 06:54:54

814,TFL1984,1554904885,1,"Hi there, and thanks for choosing to click on my post. I'm the male portion of a happily married M/F couple of twelve years. Together she and I have both discussed and made the choice to open our lives in search of someone who has the interest in getting to know us both, and allowing us to get to know her. There are several points that I'll touch on here that I hope will help to convey some of our feelings, and understanding of this lifestyle to potential partners. Please understand that I'm going to make my best effort to be as thorough as possible here, without rambling on with needless filler. 

Foremost, I should probably explain that this type of poly relationship almost always comes with many pitfalls, hurdles, and potential problems. In my opinion, more so than any other type of poly arrangement simply because it's tricky. Three is an odd number, and can be difficult to balance in reality. I understand that many monogamous couples have a hard enough time as it is just managing one another's feelings, expectations, and needs - much less throwing a third person into the mixture. As the old adage claims though, nothing worthwhile is ever easy. I feel this holds true for any type of relationship as well. The bottom line here is that YOU are a person. A real person, made of bones, organs, flesh, blood, and most importantly - feelings. Your feelings matter. Your thoughts are important. Your safety, care, needs, wants, dreams, desires, ambitions, goals, fears, and everything in between all matter. Every bit as much as all of mine matter, every bit as much as all of my wife's matter.

Couples/spousal privilege certainly is a real thing. I won't sit here and blow hot air up your butt and tell you that it isn't and that ""jealousy isn't an issue"" or any of that BS. It's real. It rears it's ugly head from time to time and can cause problems if it isn't managed properly. I understand fully that it's intimidating for a third person to join an existing relationship (especially one with tenure), and that it's completely unfair and unethical to strap a new partner down with ""rules"" right out of the gate. For that reason, there's only ONE rule. Just ONE, and it applies to EVERYONE involved.

Rule #1 - 100% transparency with everything.

Not 99%. Not 99.999%. 100%. With transparency comes honesty. With honest comes respect. With respect comes trust. With trust comes fulfillment. With fulfillment comes happiness, and at the end of the day - happiness gives zest to life. 

For a moment, I want to also touch on the whole ""equality"" thing. It's my thinking that true equality doesn't exist and that it's theoretically impossible to achieve true equality.. For me to tell you that everyone in the relationship would be equals is a blatant misinformation that automatically breaks Rule #1. What is possible? What is attainable? Fairness. In my opinion, fairness is easier and holds more value than equality. Person ""A"" treats person ""B"" and ""C"" fairly. Person ""B"" treats person ""A"" and ""C"" fairly, and so forth. What does fairness mean in this situation? Personally, to me, fairness entails listening, compromising, being compassionate, and above all, being understanding. Fairness doesn't exist without those attributes, and providing/receiving such fairness is another vitally important aspect.

With those formalities out of the way, a bit about who we are, because that's important for a potential partner to note! 

*Myself* \- I'll be 35 in a few days (Taurus for those of you into astrology). I graduated from a local university in 2007 with a Bachelors of Science in Aeronautics (Aviation). However, my line of work ended up being nothing near what I'd studied for due to a couple health pitfalls, and long story short, I'm unable to pass an FAA commercial pilot physical examination due to personal circumstances. I do thoroughly enjoy aviation and flying as a hobby though - I've just came to terms that I'll not be able to do so professionally. My other hobbies include diesel performance (drag racing highly modified diesel pickup trucks), ham radio, DIY projects around the house, and Sunday naps. I don't watch a lot of television, but when I do, some of my favorite shows are Better Call Saul, The Grand Tour, Street Outlaws, and documentaries on The History Channel. My tastes in music are really all over the board. My iPlaylist consists of a mixture of Johnny Cash, Billy Idol, Waylon Jennings, Stevie Nicks, Ice Cube, Tupac, Jason Aldean, AC/DC, and Old Crow Medicine Show. My personal goals include learning to play piano, retiring with a well diversified financial portfolio, bettering my health, and learning to enjoy the basic things that life has to offer. 

*She* \- She is 38 (Taurus as well), and a Pharmacist. She's been in pharmacy for the better part of fifteen years and enjoys what she does. She's very much a giver, wears her heart on her sleeve and has a drive to help and care for people. She's a HUGE animal lover and often dreams of working in a veterinarian clinic or volunteering with an animal rescue. Her hobbies range from gardening, little DIY crafty project things (Pinterest), cooking, baking (my God, can she make a cake..), and tending to the hummingbirds during the springs and summer. We usually have around 40-50 of them that spend their summer around our home, sipping from one of the EIGHT feeders she puts out with her own homemade hummingbird food. She is very much into paranormal kind of things and likes all of those ""Ghost Hunting"" shows on TV. One of her personal bucket list items is to visit Waverly Sanitarium in Louisville overnight. 

*Potentially you?* \- Have children? That's great! We don't because she is unable to conceive. Have a crazy family? Yeah, let me tell you about mine.. Do you smoke? Drink alcohol? Partake in recreational substances? Mix ketchup and mayo together? (GAG).. The thing is, you're going to be different from us in several aspects, and you may be the same as us in several aspects. That isn't of great concern at this time because NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. There's going to be things about me, she, us, our dog, that you might not like. So it would be incorrect for me, she, us, or the dog to pass judgement without giving you a chance, right? The same can be suggested for you. It isn't about finding someone who 100% agrees with everything about a person or a situation. It's about finding someone who understands that people are different, and who understands and accepts a specific person (persons?) because they compliment their life in some form or fashion.  I don't like ketchup and mayo together, but if you do - I'll gladly stir it for you (and then proceed to vomit). 

It's worth noting that together she and I share a very special and spiritual BDSM centered arrangement. Basically in a nutshell, she is a collared slave. Simply, not because I want her to be (because I do fancy the arrangement) but because she **chooses** to be. She has the heart of a servant, the will and never-ending urge to please, and she does so because it's who she is as a person and where her comfort lies. Of course I have encouraged her to embrace her feelings, explore her desires, and she does just this. For the past twelve years she and I have shared marriage and this special dynamic together. *A disclaimer though that's important to note: This type of dynamic isn't for everyone and it is NOT expected of you to follow suit. What IS expected of you is to explore your feelings in the same way I have encouraged her to explore hers, and choose for yourself the things that you feel would best fulfill your own personal needs - and then communicate those things so that she and I may properly support you in achieving your own goal.*

Goals are important. Obviously you have goals, I have goals, she has goals, and as a group, we should ideally have goals. Instead of setting goals immediately without the input of a potential partner, I'd prefer us to all sit down and set goals together as one - so that YOU aren't entering into a relationship with the expectation of adhering to what's already been premeditated without your input. Basically though, the core initiative at this point is to simply develop a connection with a woman (of the female gender) whom has the desire to get to know who we are as people, and go from there. An airplane will not fly unless you put fuel in it first - so what we want to do is simply fuel the airplane at this point. If you're interested in getting to know us, let's build upon that. Let's pour in some fuel, and when it gets full, we can ALL discuss where we are going to fly to. 

Short term goals! - Let's fuel up the airplane. Let's chat, get to know one another. Exchange friendly banter, play twenty questions, discuss likes/dislikes/etc. 

Mid term goals! - Let's pre-flight check the airplane. Dinner, lunch, breakfast dates together and separately. ""Girl's day"" outings to the salon and shopping, weekends on the pontoon boat cruising the lake/river, picnics in the park, and even just hanging out watching a movie or grilling out and having a heart to heart discussion about something. 

Long term goals! - Time to plan the flight! The airplane is ready to go. Fully fueled, everything is airworthy. These goals will come JUST before all parties have the interest in proceeding with a genuine relationship and have agreed to proceed. These are goals that will be discussed by all parties, and only after approval by all parties - will the relationship become official. What if the goals are not approved? What if we have differing opinions and feelings? We communicate. We examine things. We discuss and we make FAIR compromises if at all possible. It's perfectly okay to DISAGREE! It's ABSOLUTELY NOT okay to argue and become abrasive. 

***But what if..*** What if? What if things don't work out? What if you join us and things take a nose dive? Crash and burn? There's jealousy? Someone doesn't follow Rule #1? **We communicate as adults above all else.** What if things don't work out? So what? You'll absolutely NOT be kicked to the curb or come home to changed locks on the doors with your possessions (our possessions?) laying in the yard. My coffee maker will be YOUR coffee maker, and I'm not about throwing that out. If things don't work out, we develop a premeditated exit strategy that everyone agrees on and that is FAIR to all. Kind of like a fire drill. You hope that you NEVER have to use a fire exit and run down the stairs - but it's there so in the event of a fire, everyone knows what to do to get out safely.

**What do we have to offer?** Our hearts. We are both willing to put our very hearts on the line for a person whom will do the same. We have material things to share - a home, cars, a boat, and it's all great - but, without the aspect of compassion, it's worthless and meaningless. A house is worthless without caring people to come home to. Basically, we have our entirety to offer the right person, and honestly, to NOT offer one's entirety to each person in a poly-relationship just isn't FAIR.  Money is money. A house is a house. A car is a car. Genuine feelings and to look into the eyes of another and see them filled with legitimate love and care? That's the real stuff right there, man. It's like a sip of water to a person burning in eternity. 

So in essence, am I ""unicorn hunting""? Perhaps. Or, as I certainly feel my intentions are genuine - am I myself *the* unicorn, which *is* hunting another partner? So many couples are out there today just looking for some bedroom fun or for the novelty of the experience, only to disregard the feelings of the new person when it's time to be adults and solve a problem. How many couples are there who legitimately have discussed, soul searched, and have more of an interest in touching another's heart instead of touching another's butt? Few, in my opinion, and that's why I absolutely disdain the term ""unicorn hunting"", and the term ""unicorn"". 

Perhaps all along, I've been the unicorn, and you've just been another person looking to not be envisioned as a toy or a doormat.

Let's chat. You have questions, I have answers. You're likely (and should be) cautious just as I am, so let's communicate to address your thoughts and feelings and see where things may end up. :)",lonely,[M4F] I'm a unicorn.,2019-04-11 00:01:25

We can feel lonely even in a relationship, or among people..
Deep inside we only want to stay attached to other people for forgetting ourselves, and treat the other person as an object to fulfill the emptyness.
Also we feel lonely when we can't stand ourselves,when we are alone, there is only you and yourself,
And if you can't get on and stay ib peace with yourself dont expect that others can.
So the first step to get out of loneliness,
Is to learn and maybe change yourself  when you'll stay in peace with yourself.
You'll atract others
When we are lonely we search for other
And depend on other people energy,
But don't do that, don't depends on other

So, I'm a young 24 year old guy who is having trouble making any real lasting connections. Platonic, Romantic, or otherwise. I just feel a real lack of kinship with anyone my age especially. I'm a very old-school type person. I don't have a Facebook/Instagram because I feel like those sites are pretty vain. Just a pit of people either arguing or showing off. I am not into showing off or arguing. I feel like social media isn't social at all. This whole idea of ""Wow this is really helping people socialize"" is wrong. It just further separates people. While yes I have friends in a very limited wavelength, There is a hobby that I'm sorta into and all of my friends are ONLY in that hobby. It sucks. I wish I had a friend whom I shared at least 2 attributes with. I feel like for the past 5\~10 years of my life I've only had friends in a very limited sense. There is no true understanding between me and my friends in my life. Just things to do with that one particular hobby. Any attempt made by me to swerve the conversation into a more interesting direction is usually met with resistance. I have also been going to school and have very little luck meeting anyone who is on the same wavelength as I am.  I have tried dating apps too and I kinda feel like they are fundamentally flawed in the way that they are set up. They are 100% based on looks. And while I would consider myself a solid 6/10 in the looks dept. (5 being average) that still doesn't make me feel any better about the situation. That whole swipe thing is retarded I hate that system. I know I am a decent guy and everything, but  I also have trouble meeting anyone who isn't obsessed with their phone. Everyone I talk to has this weird glazed over/far away look in their eyes like they aren't even really there. Especially millennials. I've straight up walked out of restaurants because the people I'm with won't stop looking at their phone. I've even texted a few girls back and forth, and then when you try to get them to talk to you on the phone with your real voice they stop talking to you. What kind of mental ward have I been dropped off at? Because I didn't get the memo. It sucks because if a girl actually gave a shit, who was even a 4/10 on the looks scale, She'd be my world, but alas since I have standards I'm doomed to be alone. I don't know what is going on... It's upsetting to me. I don't even know how people meet people anymore. Especially millennials. I've even tried to find hiking buddies too and they all cancel on me. I have tons of interests and I am a very intimate and social person, and I feel like I have decent charisma and confidence. I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends and never plan to, but I just get tossed aside over and over.

Yesterday, I went to see a therapist. The therapist was very friendly and had salt-and-pepper hair. I asked him what I would do and he told me to have a seat. After about an hour of back-and-forth, he said,

""Have you tried the Nicolas Comics method?""

842,ChocolateChip-bunny,1554841677,67,"*I actually posted this days ago and deleted it because of my anxiety,  but I've decided to post this back up for people that may be going through the same thing or something similar. 

I need advice. For the past 18 years of my life I have never been able to attract the opposite sex. Given for those past 17 years I wasn't very  good with keeping up with my appearance and kind of looked OK-I was considered cute-, but this year I glowed up and started wearing makeup and dressing more fashionably. I received a lot of compliments and people saying I was pretty and that they admire my style. I work in retail and get called beautiful by customers all the time. The thing is, I'm extremely shy and insecure, and I take these compliments with a grain of salt. I'm grateful for them,  but I often have a hard time accepting I could be attractive and get embarassed by the attention. It's hard for me to consider myself attractive even though I know I am,  but it's very hard to think that when I get no male validation.  And I know people are gonna judge me and say that you don't need male validation to know your worth,  and I believe that 100%, but it's hard to believe this when I receive no attention by men-I will admit that I have been hit on by one or two but they've been by very old and very CREEPY men which I don't count. Most if not every compliment I've been given has been by a female, and if by a male,  they compliment me with no romantic intentions. This has been a struggle for me because I'm a very romantic person. I love playing matchmaker for my friends and  constantly give love advice and  encouragement. I'm a hopeless romantic and can't help but to yearn for romance. The thing is, I can never get the right attention from men. No one has ever confessed to me, hit on me, shown interest-hell I can barely get eye contact; I've never caught anyone starring. This is so disheartening and has given me a real blow in my self confidence. I'm at a period where I really desire companionship and feel immensely lonely. Recently I confessed to my crush and got rejected. He was smart, super funny and sweet. My friends were surprised because he was really below my league in looks and he was awkward,  but I saw past his looks and became really attracted to his personality. To me he was an awkward, nerdy,  weird,  guy and I really liked that. I sent him a confession text because he was too busy for me to do it in person and said back that he was flattered but didn't feel the same way and wanted to be just friends. I felt devasted because that was the first time I ever showed my feelings and pursued someone. What made me feel worse is that I got rejected by someone people kept saying was below my league. I always felt that the guys at my school saw me as weird, because regardless that people say I'm a nice and pretty person,  guys show me no interest and act as if they don't want to be near me. I've had a few guy's avoid sitting near me and most of the time ignore my presence, especially by previous crushes who've suspected I liked them. I suspect this is because I'm very shy and quiet and it may be awkward to be around me, but I can be open if someone makes the first approach and am very friendly and can be conversational if someone wants to talk. I'm at a point where I don't know what to do. I should add in I live in a small community and there are a lot of couples,  but idk what's wrong with me that girls meaner and less then me in looks can trap guys like flys and I've never had a boyfriend or had a real boy as a friend even. I don't mean to sound narcissistic at all, its just this has fed into some deep insecurities and has made me closed off to everyone and very lonely and emotional. I feel hopeless and undesirable.

I really do promise I'm worth getting to know. I feel that I'm a very different kind of guy, with different convictions that most people tend to not agree with, and that's okay. I'm posting in polyr4r because I am happily involved in a marriage with a lovely girl who compliments me and I'm seeking another female who can benefit/provide the same qualities that I/we offer.

I'm not going to promise an ""equal"" relationship, but I can promise an extremely FAIR one for all parties involved. I'm also not going to promise a garden full of pretty flowers, but I do promise to stand alongside and help you through the thorns when we have to get through them. I know, I know - talk is cheap, so instead of going on and on and on, just know that I'll gladly prove it all to you.

About me, I'm 6'4"", athletic ""football-player"" build (though I don't play any sports), well educated, and professional career minded. I graduated in 2007 with a BS in Aviation, and am currently an insurance agent for one of the largest nationally known insurance companies. Yeah, I understand that's a bit of a difference in education vs career path - there was a very legitimate reason for such, in which I'll explain to interested parties. I'm relatively healthy, drug, tobacco, and alcohol free. I also have a strange obsession for hand washing and brushing my teeth. I normally brush my teeth three times daily.

My hobbies include aviation, ham radio, diesel performance (drag racing highly modified diesel pick-up trucks), and BDSM (real BDSM, and not some Christian Grey fantasy-land stuff..). I'm a man of many skill, and a few that I'm relatively adept at.

I have no children, because my wife cannot conceive. We have been planning to adopt. Speaking of which, my wife is openly bi, and experienced sexually with females, and in the past few years, she's had the desire to cultivate romantic/emotional relationship with someone of her same gender. The poly (polyexclusive?) lifestyle was originally an idea of hers, and I've came on board with it as well, as I certainly understand her feelings of developing an emotional bond with more than one person. We do have a small dog, a 4 lb yorkie - so being an animal lover is pretty much a requirement.

I have a lot to offer the right person. We both do. While I am a firm believer that happiness does indeed come from within, it's the people and events that happen in our lives that help to bring along reasons to be happy and enjoy our short time alive. If you'd like to chat further, I'd love nothing more. I've added a picture of me, and have more (fully clothed) to share.

The smile when she just sat there listening to you talk about the crazy stuff you're passionate about cause you meant the world to her. The smile when you did something to make her feel more special than she already is. The smile which she smiled when y'all just finished an argument and you managed to make her laugh. That I can't believe you're such a klutz smile when you did something stupid. That smile when you'd write her a poem and she'd read it like it's the greatest literary masterpiece ever.

Ever miss the hug she'd give you, the tightest one in the world? Ever missed having her to wake you up with an I love you every morning and then another people sleeping? Ever miss catching her eye while she is just looking at you all silent like?

Ever miss the feeling of being in love? Ever miss not being heartbroken? Ever miss being able to believe in the promises people make? Ever miss not feeling clingy? Ever miss believing in happiness? Ever miss being happy?

Ever miss her?

Ever miss believing that you could fall in love?

Hope this is the right place to put this. I started my new job at the start of February. Working in social research for a major hospital in the UK. In terms of the job, this is a pretty prestigious place to work so when I was successful at interview, I jumped at the chance to take it. I left a job that was in summary rubbish.

I’m moderately successful, my friendships are strong, I get to do the things that I want, I live in a country where I have the freedom to be openly gay and to express myself however I like with little backlash.

I am not the type of person that thinks they need a partner. For the most part, I am incredibly independent and unapproachable.I’m not much for hugging and outward displays of affection. I very much subscribe to the notion that one does not need to be in a long term relationship to be considered a success as a person, and am extremely dismissive of people that suggest that I *need* a partner. Because I don’t.

But every so often, a melancholy descends. I have times (mostly nights) when the only thing I want from this world is a hand to hold, someone to be there, and to understand me in a way that my friends can’t. Someone to love, cherish, and support me, who I can curl up next to, or will come up behind me and surprise me with a hug. I want intimacy, I want closeness, I want to feel connected to a person.

Tonight is one of those nights. And I blame myself for not being kind, warm, or even just a bit more approachable. These things all remind me of a vulnerability that I’m unable to engage with for a variety of reasons that ultimately stem from an abusive upbringing.

I am coming to terms with the fact that my best friend probably doesn’t really want to speak to me anymore. He has been avoiding answering any calls or messages (we live on different coasts). I really *really* fucking value him as a friend, but I guess that isn’t reciprocated. Even on its own, this is just such a horrible thing to come to grips with.

I still have one friend, my ex that broke up with me in November. And she is still dating a couple of other girlfriends, so I have to know she cares about me less than them.

People keep ditching me as a friend after a while. I had four close friends who over the course of this academic year just decided to ghost me, or at least soft-ghost me. I have to live knowing that something about me bores or annoys or exhausts people after enough time. The natural life cycle of a friendship with me just ends with them leaving me behind.

I am trying to move to a new community next month. Maybe I will make some friends there. But I have no reason to think they won’t just leave me eventually like everyone does.

Perhaps I'm too dumb. I'm failing half my classes, I've given up basically. But failing kids still have friends, I've seen it. So that's out for now. 

Maybe boring? It wouldn't surprise me if that was it. I'm a borderline ""hipster"" sometimes (quotations because it's a buzzword at this point, in this case I mean there's a lot of popular things I'm not into), which isn't on purpose. I don't choose not being in love with pop/rap or being uninterested in Marvel. Though that stuff doesn't inherently make me boring to /everyone/, hipster is in the dictionary for a reason after all- even if it seems to have a million different meanings. 

I guess I still could just be plain out boring and awkward socially. But I feel like the issue has to be greater than that. I mean goddamn, there's 7 billion+ people on this Earth and I live in a decent sized community. 

Maybe it's just me overall? I mean I'm fucking a closeted trans/bi, unattractive, writing what would go in a diary onto reddit at 2 am, a loner, and am always hyper focusing on new shit randomly. Some of  the shit I'm into can be seen as childish too... cartoons, anime, video games- all what I'd call a sign up sheet at my school to being known as a loser. So maybe that explains it?

I guess I'll have to go back to my first point of maybe I'm a shitty, rude person and don't even fully realize that's how I am to others. But I'm not always sure if I'm like that to everyone even if I can be considered that to certain people---like my mom---though I think I'm more distant and moody (hormones, family issues, my mental issues, and her always being the type of parent to yell/throw insults at you for something she did ig) rather than just plain bratty and spoiled. But that's what they all say isn't it? And either way it's bad.

I was offered a job as an automotive technician which is better than a retail worker job in terms of pay. I've hated both school and the work practicums at my new job and I'm certain I don't want to be a technician but my dad is so proud of me and I don't want to disappoint him so this is what I'm doing.

I'm scared of ending up completely alone. I don't know how to make friends outside of work. I'm socially anxious around everyone, it's not until recently that I began to get comfortable with my co-workers after more than a year.

Although I'm not yet hired, I've worked for 2 weeks full time at my new job during the practicum and I already dislike most of the people there. It's filled with drama and hate towards eachother. Terrible environment. Racism, homophobia, sexism. The customers already hate us because no one wants to being their car into the dealer anyways.

People have told me to just ask my co workers to hang out but to me there literally all I got, while to them I'm just another person in their huge friend groups, easily forgettable.

870,FallOutFighter,1554764598,16,"This is my first post on r/lonely so hi everyone!

I don't think I always feel lonely but this seemed like the best place to post this. I just turned 20 and for the last few years I've been thinking a lot about my childhood. My life was incredible as a kid. I grew up in a city with everything a child could ever want and I lived in a housing complex full of kids my age. It was the last time I had meaningful friendships in my life. Every friendship since then has felt artificial in comparison. We had our own playground and lots of pathways between houses and alleyways where we could play all kinds of exciting games. School was completely stress free and consisted of goofing off and having fun and I never had tests or homework to worry about. I would wake up every day ecstatic about the day to come and practically run out the door. 

I miss the pure wonder and joy that engulfed my life at that point. I don't know why everyone my age enjoys having responsibilities so much. The best times of my life where when I had nothing to worry about. I didn't know what a ""job"" was or even knew about the concept of death. All I knew was how soon the ice cream truck would be driving by my house or when it would be warm enough to set up the outdoor pool. Every day was like an exciting adventure that I was the protagonist in. 

Childhood to me was how I imagine powerful drugs would feel. All my senses were boosted and everything seemed ""cool"" and interesting. The bus stop wasn't just a bus stop and the mall wasn't just a mall. I actually grew up near the 2nd biggest mall in my country and I have so many memories of exploring it as a child. Stopping in a Toys R Us was like winning the lottery and being allowed to pick a toy was like a dream come true. I could go on for days but what I'm trying to say is childhood for me was an incredible experience. I have all kinds of extremely intense nostalgia for those times and I still sometimes visit the place I grew up. If I could sacrifice the rest of my life to relive my childhood I would. No loneliness, stress, or anxiety. Just pure unadulterated fun. 

td;dr - I had an incredible childhood and I can't stop thinking about it. I miss the times when I had almost zero responsibilities and true friendships. I would give anything to relieve those years of my life.

871,DemonLordMammon,1554763206,2,"It's not so much that I'm lonely, I've generally always been by the way side when it came to popularity and friends. I'm seen as weird for whatever reason.

The main reason is that I feel depressed through constant cycles of the same shit, but at the same time I hate anything new I try.

In my free time, I play basketball and volleyball. The issue there is that I'm on a national level with volleyball but shit at basketball. I'm always sat away from the other guys on the team and there is this one fuckwit on the basketball team that makes me want to quit and is making me hate the sport I once loved.

Even when it comes to romantic endeavours, I feel lonely. I've been talking with a guy for 6 months or so now and am desperate to get messages from him. When I see my phone blank, it's a bit depressing and makes me feel lonely.

Basically they gave me a lot of think about, I might need to do a bit of self reflection. Anyways I wanted to share a story I have as an example and see if I could get some thoughts on this?

I knew this guys that introduced me to his friend, a girl he knew. We spoke a lot online and quickly became kind of close, at least it felt to me like we were close. The three of us could talk about almost anything and we would have a lot of fun together.
Eventually the girl confessed to me she had a crush on my friend, which I had suspected for a while. I helped push her to gain the courage to tell him and soon enough they started dating. The three of us still talked a lot but at some point they just kind of stopped talking to me. I expected this since obviously they would want time alone but as time went on we never started hanging out again and now that they had eachother they ni longer seemed to need me, thus losing all interest in me.

873,justalonelyboyyaknow,1554761931,2,"I posted this in r/depression but I think it might be more fitting here.

&amp;#x200B;

Could use some input. Not sure where to go. Sorry for the way that I am writing this, it's going to be more of a thought stream.

Im not happy and Im not sure if I would necessarily label myself as depressed, but I do go through episodes of depression. My biggest issue right now that has more recently begun to seriously affect me is that i have a hard time connecting with other people and i have no friends.

Ill be more specific; i have one friend who I'm not always sure i even like very much but i keep him around even if at arms length because he is my one friend. He's been my friend for many years. I am 26 now and have known him since i was maybe 13. It may seem that I am alienating myself from the way i just described this friendship so ill go into some detail. I love him as a friend, care about him, and have found myself there to help him when he's seriously needed me. That said in short he's just a strange person. His strangeness never really was an issue to me until one night when we both tripped on acid together and things got very weird. I don't want to go into much detail as this isn't the point of the post but just to put things into context ill say that he was the aggressor in my bad trip where although nothing physically happened there was this rapey/dominating energy being imposed onto me and the whole thing really opened my eyes about the weird way that he views our relationship. Im trying to move past it but i don't think i can. He still makes me uncomfortable especially when i analyze his words and actions against the deeper parts of him i saw that night.

I have another group of ""friends"" who are really like music festival friends essentially. We get along. They invite me out and I appreciate it dearly. I love them as people. But I still feel so alone when Im with them. I feel like I have nothing to talk about with them usually. Theres nothing to connect over except music it seems. Which although music is something I'm dearly passionate about, the areas that we have overlapping taste is a mere fraction of the stuff that Im into. I usually always have a good time with them and i value them greatly, but they also live 2.5 hours away so i don't tend to see them much.

I guess Ill tell you guys a bit about myself, I'm going to try and be as honest as I can but I'm sure there will be some bias. Im male, 26. Ive lived on my own since I was 18. I am decently smart I guess. I don't usually feel particularly intelligent but at work I'm assured fairly often that I am. I did graduate college with an associates degree suma cum laude with a gpa of around 3.93. To be fair it wasn't a particularly good college, but good enough I suppose to be considered an accredited university. Im decently attractive, but I guess it depends on who you'd ask. 5'11, 165 lbs. I have a good job, decent car, I make good money particularly for my age. On paper there's not much wrong with me. I do go to therapy every week. I have of course explained all this to my therapist, and he believes that my biggest issue is that i can't connect with people my age because of my maturity level (when it comes to having my shit together because I am definitely not ""mature"") and because my biggest interests are more intellectual or something.

My interests and hobbies:

listening to music and going to shows and festivals, I do this very often. Maybe four to six festivals a year of different sizes. Shows oftentimes every other weekend. When Im home I play video games, I read sometimes, I am learning the guitar, I go to the gym about three days a week and weight train, i enjoy learning and am very interested in psychology and philosophy. I also take drugs recreationally. Primarily psychedelics. No opiates, no cigarettes, no uppers. No prescription meds. I think about many things through that lens (not many people do I guess)

At work I am well liked. Before anyone offers the suggestion that I should befriend my colleagues, Ill mention that I work in a different state than i live. There is also a huge age gap between myself and my colleagues. One of at least 10 years. My last job had some guy my age and we've been out a good handful of times. But they usually go out without me. When asking my closest friend of that group if there was a reason during a particularly honest conversation, he didn't have one.

When I go out, I can usually strike up a conversation with anyone. Im not particularly shy unless we're talking about a pretty girl in which case I crumble. But it's not even pretty girls that I am really after, Im dying for a ""bro"" that's just down to grab beers and play couch co op. Those conversations I do strike up, I have a hard time bridging the gap between acquaintance and friend.

Speaking of pretty girls, I do have a tinder. Im pretty successful I would say. I have well over 1000 matches now and comparing that to my other male friends who use tinder i believe that's a lot for a male. I don't really use it to get laid, and if that's specifically what i was after i feel like id be able to get it easily enough. but actually meeting someone and connecting with them and vibing with them is soooooo much more appealing to me. that said, I just have such a hard time finding someone that resonates with me the way i crave. and the last two dates i went on where i was interested in the other person, they really didn't seem very interested in me. So again, finding worthwhile companionship on this front has been very difficult for me too.

I guess none of this has really been about ME though so let me attempt to describe myself. I would say I have a good heart. I can be selfish, though I really make attempts to check myself so that I am not acting on anyone else's expense. Im sarcastic, a little cynical maybe, though I care deeply about humanity. Cute animals will have me making the least masculine noises you can think of. if the right song is playing at sunset, i might start crying overtaken by the beauty of it all. I regularly help strangers, give homeless change, etc. I've donated to vetted causes when i had the funds. When i have the money, ill just buy people shit. Like if I wanna invite someone to a show and they don't have the money, ill just take them. Ive paid for damn near 1000$ in tickets for festivals and shows for other people over the years and never wanted anything more than company in return. If you're beating me in a game, ill talk shit the whole way down. I have like an ironic confidence because I'm also the most well versed in self deprecating humor. I try to stay humble. I am grateful for everything good in my life, and often remind myself to be thankful for the experiences I'm having and the things i have. I remind myself often that despite my suffering I am incredibly fortunate in many domains. I don't really know what else to say.

I know this whole post is all over the place. I don't know what to say. Im just spilling all of this in the hopes that someone can give me some insight or if someone can get an impression from what I'm saying here what my problem might be. For the most part as far as i know people seem to share the same nice opinions about me; smart, good looking, cool, chill, etc etc but if all that crap is true, then why do i feel so alone? I have the suspicion that people just aren't being ""real"" with me. because if they are, then Im not sure if i would be going through all this. this isn't a humble brag this is a call for help",lonely,Could use some insight,2019-04-09 08:18:51

Because I'm a hyper sensitive person, I'm easily hurt by people I know in the real world whether they intend or not. I've no control over my emotions and anyone can hurt me. That's why I try to stay away from people which brings me here, to you. 

About me: As mentioned, I'm a Hyper Sensitive Person and also an INFP. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I'm extremely introverted and I like reading, writing, studying. I'm interested in science &amp; maths although I don't have vast knowledge about these but I try to learn as much as I can. 

I love to play table tennis, badminton, video game. I also like travelling a lot. That's my only goal in life. To travel a lot and meet a lot new people, live with them, know their culture. One of the reasons I want to have online friends is because I want to know different cultures. 

I also love to watch movies and TV shows. I'm a Marvel fan (a big fan of Captain America). I'm also a fan of Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory and a lot other shows. My favourite movies are The Greatest Showman, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, The Imitation Game and many more. 

And the most important thing: I'm alive and in sanity because of music. My life without music would be a mistake and impossible. The only way to not feel depressed is music. My anxiety and stress reliever is music. I basically live on food, air and music. 

Also I love dance. 

And I'm willing to try out almost everything &amp; anything. We can talk about games, universe, puzzles and quizzes and anything you want to.

I kind of started panicking when i realized that i didn't know that many people but faced it as a challege and told myself ""you're gonna make lots of friends there"".
 I've always struggled with that. Have no problems talking to people and can actually keep a good conversation but I can never get to the friendship itself. it's always so superficial and it never goes deeper than some short interactions, probably because i overthink too much and can't be spontaneous.
 It was going relatively well at first since I had already talked a fair bit to a reasonable amount of people I didn't know but soon I realized that I was lonely. I started realizing that not a single person there cared about me being there or not. They had their groups of friends, their inside jokes and there I was, that couldn't get close to no one. No one would notice if I starved to death, if I did this or that. I kept telling myself ""don't be like this, you're better than that"" and tried to enjoy the beautiful country I was visiting which I did but things are so much better if you actually have someone that remembers about your existence.
 I started thinking that it's this that keeps happening pretty much all the time, no one caring about me and me feeling lonely because of that, but I have my home and my family that make me keep going and make me feel loved, although I didn't realize that. So when I feel horrible because of that I get home and I'm suddenly fine. But there I didnt have anyone or anything, only a filthy room that I had to share with 3 more people that didn't care. This helped me understand how important love is and particularly my family's. 
 This trip also helped me opening my eyes, because one of the people I thought that cared about me would completely ignore me most of the times. I understand she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend but there were so many couples there that talked to their other friends. And it makes me sad she didn't even try to reach me.

I used to be very close to 4 friends. now we hardly speak to each other so I am always by myself. My first friend has cancelled our plans four times in a row, then hangs out with other friends right after. my 2nd friend is an hour away at her college, so I barely see her once every two months. my 3rd friend was the person I was most close to. we always shared everything and he was always supportive and loving during my depressed and suicidal episodes. but now he never answers my calls, and is always with his other cool friends, leaving no time to hang with me anymore. we used to hang out at least twice a week, but in the past 2 or 3 months I've barely seen him twice. my 4th friend is basically the only person I've hung out with for the past two months, as shes the only one who seems to want to hang out with me anymore. but shes in Mexico right now for a few weeks. so that means I'll either only be by myself, or with my parents. I know my mom would do anything to help me, whether she just listens to me or gives advice. however I dont like to burden her with my depression and suicidality. 
the only things I do with myself anymore are go to work nearly everyday (hostess at seafood restaurant), sleep, eat, and browse /r9k/. I really enjoyed my job the first 2 months, but lately my anxiety has been so bad I want to quit. 
I also downloaded tinder a month ago and hit it off with a guy, M. we went for a date at the pier, then the next four days I spent at his house. we cuddled to netflix movies and made out and got touchy. I've never had anything like that so i was very happy and out of my depression for a bit. but now I havent seen him in nearly 4 weeks. First it was becos he got his wisdom teeth removed, and it was healing very slowly. then he said he doesnt want to hang for another 2 weeks becos his friend is visiting. he has been pulling away from me as I only get one word responses when I text him, no matter what I say.

There was this one guy i really fell for but he broke my heart as usual and i ended up alone again.. there have been some guys that showed interest in me but tbh my last realtionship made me veery picky and i tend to search for red flags more than ever before. I dont know why. I start liking a guy. But tbh i dont feel the usual vibe i often got. The vibe where you feel safe and happy.  I dont know. I want a relationship really badly but at the same time i wanna be alone. I dont go out much so the only way i meet guys is trough tinder (bad choice tbh) i kinda think that theres someone waiting for me and when i meet him i'll finnaly know what love feels like. But on the other hand i feel like beacuse im so picky i'll be alone for the rest of my life.
Does anyone have some advice for me? Any kind of advice?
P.s. i dont go out much cuz i live in a city where nothing happens. No parties and nothing fun to do. I have to go with a train 2hours to another town if i wanna party. But i dont do that cuz 
#1 i have noone to go with
#2 i watched too many crime related stuff on tv and youtube and to be completly honest im tooo scared to go anywhere alone cuz u never know who can hurt you or drug you or anything.

But i can tell a little story of this saturdays events:

On saturday i actually went out with one of my guy friends i havent seen in a while and we dont talk much but he said if i wanna go party with him. So when we got into town we found a pub with bager music.. he was my wingman even tho he just sat there cuz he was tired.. i went on the dance floor and everything. Danced with some guys. But there was this older dude idk around 35yo he consantly was trying to cop a field.. rubbing his dick on my ass and his hand was either on my boobs or my vage. I expressed i didmt wanna dance with him or anything. Thank god some other guy told him to stop. Cuz 5 mins before that he waited for me at the bathroom blocked the entrace so i couldnt go away and he wanted to kiss me.. i ran out like usain bolt and stuck by my friend the entire nigh. 
So my paranoid little ass aint goin to parties anymore.

P.p.s
Im sorry for the long story. Im bored and have noone to tell this too so enjoy

I'm writing this because I finally went to see 2 hooks and it was great, way better than I expected and it helped me a lot and maybe some of you could try it? It will especially work if you know you are good in bed and you know you're good at pleasing women but no girls ever let you touch them.

   
 

I'm 35 white male with ugly face and ten pounds overweight. . Gnarled weird wrinkly face. Seven hells.

   
 

I don't consider myself attractive at ALL and most women would agree. But I have had several women if my life, who I consider attractive although most of them were chubby, but I don't mind a chubby girl. Not fat but just a little overweight So maybe many of you would think they weren't hot or attractive. But that was a LONG TIME AGO. These days I'm getting less and less girls almost down to completely none the last 7 years because I'm losing my hair and look ten years older than I am  and my nose is deviating making one of my nostrils bigger than the other... and I'm getting uglier everyday to the point where I was thinking that maybe no girl I find even remotely attractive will want to touch me or kiss me or sleep with me at all ever again the rest of my whole miserable life

So I joined this sub. :0

   
 

ANYWAY point is I haven't had a girl in fucking YEARS. YEARS and it's extra hard for me because I am good in bed probably because I have so little sex so when I do I make it count and try to be the best at getting the girl off and pleasing her and taking in their bodies because it's so goddamn rare. Because I don't hate women I just hate that I love them so much and they want nothing to do with me. 

I was starting to lose my mind a little and snapping at everyone and being a real prick and hating my life and having road-rage. So I finally pretty much gave up and it was bumming me out, especially when I saw other girls at work or other girls anywhere dating or fucking these complete fucking selfish LOSERS who just happened to be better-looking than me. I started almost to hate women too and really didn't want to. But I couldn't help it. I started to be mad at every girl who wasn't taken already that wouldn't consider me a suitor, even the nice ones who were really nice about declining, even the hot girls I never asked because I knew already it didn't matter if we were fucking soulmates it would never happen unless we were on a deserted island.(Does anyone else have this fantasy of being with a hot girl and you two being the only survivor of a plague or apocalypse so she has no other choice.) 

   
 

But even knowing that I shouldn't hate women I still started to hate them, especially pretty ones. Especially the ones who ignored me and didn't even try to be my friend. Like you don't have to touch me or have sex with me but just acknowledge me as a human-being. And there really are girls like that, who just ignore me so I try to be nice to all the ugly girls out there, to be a friend to them because i know how fucking hard it can be and you're a bad person if you can't talk to somebody of the opposite sex because they are ugly and you have no physical desire for them. You can still treat them like a person and listen to them and don't make them think you think they are a ugly person because you know how much that hurts.

   
 

So I was getting so lonely and horny that I finally started looking at hooks online, much to my shame. I don't live in a big city so the closet small city was a few hours from my house and I started looking there to plan a date for the weekend. And then one weekend I set up something with a older lady with perfect body after she checked me and then I backed out at the last second and she was pissed. I apologized but I couldn't go through with it. 

   
 

Drive 3 hours AND pay for it?!?! I wanted a girl to love me for who I was and how smart I was and how witty and funny I was. For years I wanted to just find a girl to like me for who I was, no matter what. I tried so hard and 99% of women I found attractive never wanted to have anything to do with me, except maybe sometimes as friends, and then every-time I would make a good female attractive friend I would screw it up by ""falling in love with them"" or some other wimpy seak shit.

I even started lowering my own low standards and tried talking to very overweight girls and nothing. I realized how unattractive I was and it made my once funny interesting personality turn dark and I was moody and I letting it out on the world. So now I was ugly AND crazy but I was only crazy and angry because i wasn't getting laid. If some hot girl just loved me for who I was I wouldn't be angry anymore. 

So I stopping pining after girls and trying to get them to like me even after they told me no or even if we got along better than any two people in the universe. It wouldn't matter to them. I could make them laugh harder than anyone else and it wouldn't matter. 

Then I stopped trying to get with girls at all, knowing I would never have a chance. Or being pissed off that I ever hoped to get one I'd have to go through leaps and bounds and endless bullshit to even have a chance. Where some guys don't have to do a freaking thing. I would assume every girl I am just meeting for the first time thinks I'm ugly and wants nothing to do with me. Where if a even semi-pretty girl even talks to me I would get suspicious what she wants from me. I would always know that from the start of meeting me girls would not like me at all and I would have to do work and be witty and interesting and all that to even register to them as a person. I'd start as an ugly slob in their heads and if I was witty and charming and funny and really tried as hard as I could I might work up to a platonic friend. And even if we became best friends as in really best friends and not just in my head, which happened to me maybe 3 times, a true hearts best friend I would always fall in love and ruin our friendship altogether because they wouldn't give me a chance, and then I would resent them and always fuck it up, even if they were nice and understanding and never rubbed their sex life in my face at all I would still always try to make them feel bad. Looking back on it now I lost a few very treasured friendships of mine because I was so lonely and so in a rage that everyone else in the world had one but not me. I regret that now. And realize guys if women turns you down she is unlikely to EVER change her mind, especially if you keep asking her about it. So if she wants to be your friend then be her friend and don't be a selfish prick and beg her to love you.

   
 

Anyway POINT OF THE story is this week I finally went through with it and drove a few hours and got a hotel room and paid for it. Pushed my pride aside. Because even though I was interesting and funny and smart and a good listener I couldn't get laid and it was making me hate the world. I was going to explode I think maybe. I couldn't believe i was about to pay for a...all the bad thoughts and unsanitary things entered my head and all the other guys they....well you know.

   


And I set it all up online and researched like I research other stuff I buy. 

So I got a hotel room and planned on getting one hook one day and a different hook the next day. The first one came to visit me and all you sad lonely fucks out there like me it was fucking great and I don't fucking care how many guys she was with or that i paid for it. I was nervous at first and she was nice and i offered her a beer and hugged and kissed and it was the best time I've had in LONG TIME. And she told me i was cute and she said she was so happy when she saw what I looked like(and guys I believed her, I believed that as far as guys she sees goes I probably WAS above average) and she listened to me and gave me a back rub and let me do whatever i wanted to her. She even liked it and told me what she wanted and talked dirty and if she didn't like it she pretended like she did. My confidence soared and it was more than just getting laid. Having a girl give you attention and hug you and talk to you.

Afterwards we talked and she told me stories and it was fun and she had manners and was she was hot and liked me and I couldn't believe it. I was on cloud 9 after.

It was the best time ever until the next morning when I paid a little more for another hook and went to see her and just omg. She wasn't as girlfriendly or quite as open and but she was even better. She was shy and didn't want to rush me or jump on my bones. Talked first, flirted, SO HOT! She was SO HOT and young and i KNOW FOR A FACT that i made her cum, and I didn't ask for anything dirty or even a bj because I wanted to please her because its' not all about you you selfish pricks. I wanted to worship her young body because quite honest it was the hottest youngest body ive ever had in front of me and I just wanted to touch her and lick her and kiss her and she let me and talked to me and made me feel like a man. This girl who was so hot I could never get her in real life unless I was a millionaire or famous....but I could donate $250 and have my wildest dreams come true.

907,ChocolateChip-bunny,1554702478,1,"This is the bravest thing I've ever done but I need advice. Sorry in advance for the length of this post but I wanted to provide enough context. 

For the past 18 years of my life I have never been able to attract the opposite sex. Given for those past 17 years I wasn't very  good with keeping up with my appearance and kind of looked OK-I was considered cute-, but this year I glowed up and started wearing makeup and dressing more fashionably. I received a lot of compliments and people saying I was pretty and that they admire my style. At my job I get called beautiful by customers all the time. The thing is, I'm extremely shy and insecure, and I take these compliments with a grain of salt. I'm grateful for them,  but I often have a hard time accepting I could be attractive and get embarassed by the attention. It's hard for me to consider myself attractive even though I know I am,  but it's very hard to think that when I get no male validation.  And I know people are gonna judge me and say that you don't need male validation to know your worth,  and I believe that 100%, but it's hard to believe this when I receive no attention by men-I will admit that I have been hit on by one or two but they've been by very old and very CREEPY men which I don't count. Most if not every compliment I've been given has been by a female, and if by a male,  they compliment me with no romantic intentions. This has been a struggle for me because I'm a very romantic person. I love playing matchmaker for my friends and  constantly give love advice and  encouragement. I'm a hopeless romantic and can't help but to yearn for romance. The thing is, I can never get the right attention from men. No one has ever confessed to me, hit on me, shown interest-hell I can barely get eye contact; I've never caught anyone starring. This is so disheartening and has given me a real blow in my self confidence. I'm at a period where I really desire companionship and feel immensely lonely. Recently I confessed to my crush and got rejected. He was smart, super funny, and sweet. My friends were surprised because he was really below my league in looks and he was awkward,  but I saw past his looks and became really attracted to his personality. To me he was an awkward, nerdy,  weird,  guy and I really liked that. I sent him a confession text because he was too busy for me to do it in person and said back that he was flattered but didn't feel the same way and wanted to be just friends. He liked someone else. I felt devasted because that was the first time I ever showed my feelings and pursued someone. What made me feel worse is that I got rejected by someone people kept saying was below my league. I always felt that the guys at my school saw me as weird, because regardless that people say I'm a nice and pretty person,  guys show me no interest and act as if they don't want to be near me. I've had a few guy's avoid sitting near me and most of the time ignore my presence, especially by previous crushes who've suspected I liked them. I suspect this is because I'm very shy and quiet and it may be awkward to be around me, but I can be open if someone makes the first approach and am very friendly and can be conversational if someone wants to talk. I'm at a point where I don't know what to do. I should add in I live in a small community and there are a lot of couples,  but idk what's wrong with me that girls meaner and less then me in looks can trap guys like flys and I've never had a boyfriend or had a real boy as a friend even. I don't mean to sound narcissistic at all, its just this has fed into some deep insecurities and has made me closed off to everyone and very lonely and emotional. I feel hopeless and undesirable.

I have a job as well, and pretty quickly made a handful of close friends through work and school. I love my friends, but they all have families and SOs, and I’m just me and my cat. Dating has been mostly a bust. I typically spend my weekends mostly alone. If there’s a special event (concert, book reading, etc), I usually fly solo as well. Like I said: my friends are great, but they all have other things going on. I’m also a bit of an introvert, so it’s not in my wheelhouse to walk up to strangers and strike up a conversation. 

I have hobbies (weekly music meetups), volunteer weekly, and go to the gym regularly. I think I’m pretty likable. I make eye contact, smile at strangers, engage in small talk when appropriate. 

I worry that I’m getting too conditioned to my solitude. That I’m so used to do everything alone that it will just stay this way forever. And the idea of joining another group just sounds terrible. I guess I’m just not sure what I’m doing wrong? Honestly considering just leaning in to my destiny and getting another cat. ",lonely,Friends in adulthood,2019-04-08 13:40:08
913,Malammore762,1554693958,1,"There are so many situations where I felt either wronged or cheated. I don't enjoy conflict but I also can't live with being a fucking doormat. I've personally burned a lot of bridges I felt justified and as a result I don't have anyone. It's like I put myself here instead of feeling like I was taken for granted. I know people don't owe me anything but if I'm not getting back what I put in I just can't help but tell them to fuck off. I'm sure I was the one who was wrong a few of those times (nobody is infallible) but for the most part I really don't have any regrets. 

The finality of it all is right here. By myself. Completely solo. I'm lucky if my phone has even four notifications of correspondence these days. I won't be cliche and say ""people suck"" (because they don't) but I feel majorly disappointed. I left this whole path of destruction behind me because I couldn't stand the thought of things being one way.

916,avengethehero182,1554687853,1,"These posts are a dime a dozen but I'm desperate and trying EVERYTHING I can at this point to connect or at least feel like I tried. TL;DR - lonely and sad.

Maybe one day I'll post the full story (which is somehow longer than this) but just to get this out there:

I moved to a new city 7 months ago to live with my girlfriend. Was able to transfer and keep my same retail store manager job and move into an apartment we found together for her to live in until I could move. Lots of bad stuff happened and I found out some depressing stuff she had done that I dont feel like getting into but it really set the tone for me and f***ed my mental health that I had FINALLY gotten some control over.

I have no friends here. Im completely socially isolated and havent interacted with a SINGLE person that isnt my SO, beyond customer/employee interactions, in 7 months.
I took over a store that was in the shitter and has required/is requiring SO much work to turn around. I used to have 4-5 employees, and they were around my age so I had work ""friends"", now I have 2 employees who are 40+. 
I live in an apartment with super finicky neighbors so I can't play guitar (one of the biggest motivating and mood lifting things I would do before); I played through headphones for a bit but its not the same or invigorating - just frustrating and depressing that I can no longer record covers of songs or get the right tone. PLUS, I had finally cobbled together a band with an old best friend I had reconnected with before moving, and had something to work towards.
I used to enjoy video games and would play online with friends decently often - now I cant afford any games that come out (even waiting until they're used) that my ""friends"" now play and have replayed what I own over and over.

I'm BEYOND broke, my (now) fiance pays more of the bills than I do because she's working in an actual career, having just graduated college (which is why i was the one to move). I cant afford to treat myself to fast food, new games, cheap guitar stuff to try and regain interest, etc., and after budgeting (due to credit card debt from my ex of 5 years) it looks like none of that will change for a couple years at least.

My mental health has tanked, despite staying on top of seeing my psychiatrist to get a higher dose of antidepressants/my meds and regularly seeing a decent therapist (including couples therapy). 
My job has gotten more stressful and the standards are higher and harder company wide, while this new store is incredibly difficult to improve (which means the $600-$1000 bonus I used to get every 3 months, I no longer get). 
I work 6-7 days a week, and my single day off isnt consistent (which means sometimes I work 10/11 days in a row) and my store hours mean I'm not home until just late enough to have taken up my evening. 

I've gotten desperate enough to try meetup and other ""find a group"" sites, I've looked for support groups for my ADHD, bipolar, etc. and asked my therapist if he could find any around here (he embarrassingly came back and said he couldn't either) to connect with people, I've tried ""find musicians"" apps and sites, I've gone to local tabletop game stores/music stores and nobody seems to want to hold a conversation because they're all cliqued up.......and honestly? That's all probably the worst part. I force myself to go out of my comfort zone and TRY to make things better and still get nothing. 

I sit sit at home most nights nowadays staring at my phone with nothing even up. I go to work and come home and sleep (3 hours if I'm lucky thanks to insomnia) and go back. I have no interest in suicide at ALL, and have realized that im going to live like this and exist in this absence of anything worthwhile for the foreseeable future. And it's hard as hell to accept.

I also had my father abandoning me when I was born and my mother was not much around and always neglected me. So I don't know if this has an impact.

I only had a relationship where I was abandoned just like my father did and that ex verbally abused me, always harassed me for money and he cheated on me. But that person is all happy with someone else who is getting married to. I tried to get someone else and 4 years later, nobody bothered with me. I am really past my ex, the only thing that makes me wonder is how a scumbug like him managed to get a girl so quickly and they  are being together for almost 2 years.

920,Lean_Drop,1554683774,2,"The last 5 years of my life have been so lonely. I'm 18 and right now I have no social life, no friends, no girlfriend, nothing.

In seventh grade I was a troublemaker and I'd get suspended a lot for the dumbest things like getting in small fights and being disrespectful in class. I also had really bad grades so that didn't help my case. My mom had enough and by the time I was supposed to be in eighth grade she signed me up for online school with the promise that it would only be for a year. Now, I didn't really mind this since hey I'd get sleep in and not wake up early anymore but she took it to a extreme. She didn't allow me to go out on my own or even hang out with my old friends. I think she let me once but I had to practically beg her on my hands and knees and I was only able to go with the condition that she was present at all times. Wanting to spare myself from embarrassment I never asked her again. 

A year goes by and i'm still in the online school. I didn't do so well academically and she decided i'll be staying indefinitely.  I ask for tutors and such but she claims I don't need one. My friends on occasion call and ask if I'm doing alright and how much they want me to come back. Even a girl I used to really be into calls me and asks when I'm coming back. Then another year goes by and I'm getting less and less calls. Soon by the time i'm in 10th grade I get no calls. My friends moved on and the loneliness gets to me and I just stop caring about school and my life in general. I eventually fail 11th grade and get held back. 

By some miracle the teachers at my online school offer me a second chance and let me take credit recovery courses alongside 12th grade courses.  Here I am now nearing the end of the school year and I have great grades now and have a real shot at graduating but I'm still lonely and have been recently plagued by dreams of my years in middle school surrounded by old friends and its driving me crazy. I figure if I go to college I might make new friends but I haven't spoke to someone my age in so long that I feel like i'm now socially inept.

Late last year he had to go away for a few months and could have no contact with her and she was distraught. I was so worried about her because I felt like she placed too much of her happiness in this guy. So I tried cheering her up. The first weekend she was alone (her and her bf live together) I went over and spent two days with her. Told her she could come over to my house but she never came. 

We would text literally everyday. Meet up and run stupid errands. I'd leave my house on a wim to go places with her and I was anxiety so it wasn't easy for me but I knew she wasn't feeling the best.

Her boyfriend came back in January and its almost been radio silence since then. I used to try to message her but when I did I would get boring replies back so I assumed she didn't wanna talk and just left her alone. 

It's been weeks and not a peep from her. I see her on histogram and Twitter but she doesn't even interact with my posts. I'm wondering if I should just give up on our friendship cause obviously I'm more invested. She knows I'm not exactly mentally stable (depression and anxiety) and she just hasn't contacted me at all.

In June last year I finally escaped from an abusive &amp; extremely violent relationship.  It went to court &amp; I was granted an injunction against him.

He constantly broke the injunction by emailing me &amp; ringing me. I even had an email from his mum &amp; sister saying I should take him back and I deserved what he did because j had been out drinking with my work mates for my leaving do.  (It was a Friday when everything culminated &amp; I was due to start a new job on the Monday)

I should also point out that he is Albanian &amp; I’m English so his attitude towards women is that we are second class citizens,

Anyway, I allowed him to see the children every Sunday but then in turned out that he was now abusing my son.  I only found out in January &amp; I immediately cut contact.

The day I went to see my solicitor I prolapsed a disc in my spine and by the time I got to the office I couldn’t walk. I don’t even know how it happened!  After seeing my doctor and being pumped full of drugs which weren’t working my mum thankfully paid for me to go private.

The MRI showed a very nasty slipped disc out first attempt to fix it was to have a spinal nerve block injection.  This didn’t work so then I had to have surgery to remove the protruding disc.

Bear in mind that while I’m in &amp; out of hospital I’m also having to deal with police, solicitors &amp; social services to keep my children &amp; I safe.

I had my first surgery on Friday 29th March and for a few days it was great but then on Wednesday the disc went again!

I had a second round of surgery this Friday and while I was in hospital I had an email from my ex!  I came home today and the first thing I had to do was report it to the police.  It might only be “just an email” but I can’t describe the fear &amp; stress it caused me when I saw it in my inbox.

I went to bed this afternoon &amp; when I woke up I went downstairs to get a drink being extremely careful and guess what happened. MY DISC HAS GONE AGAIN!

I’m now laid in bed in agony and don’t know how much more I can take.  I need to get better for my children (who have been staying with my mum while I’m recovering ) and I also feel like a sitting duck.  My ex will have received a letter stating that he is not allowed contact with the children and I’m petrified of how he’s going to react.

I’m sorry for ranting, there’s so much more to be said but everything is all interlinked &amp; tangled timewise.  

I’m just so lonely right now and I’m scared.  I don’t know what the prognosis is going to be for my back long term, or even short term, and I don’t know if my ex is going to do something stupid.

Before I got really tired of friendships/relationships just going poof for no reason, never taking off/dying or becoming toxic so I decided I didn't want any more friendships/relationships. And that was fine til my heart was like ""Mmm... I don't like going cold turkey so one friend would be nice."" And I was like ""Ouchie, that's too much to ask for you know."" I wish my heart would accept what's logical but it doesn't work that way.

I do reach out for friendship on rare occasions knowing full well I'll most likely get ignored or the person won't try as much as I do but it would be nice to be surprised at least once in a while even if it is just a one day conversation .-. 

I used to frequent r/foreveralone years ago but it was just a lot of guys wanting a girlfriend so it was more isolating than I expected. I'm not bashing people who are lonely because they don't have a girlfriend even though they have friends but the type of loneliness they are experiencing is much different than mines. It's just wow to me when people want more than they already have while I'll be okay with the absolute minimum. O: Buttttt I guess it's fine/to be expected to ask for more when you already have something so I can't really say anything about that.

It's rare for me to click with any people because my personality is drastically different. A lot of people are into social media, outgoing, hipster/swag stuff, going to the gym and playing fps and massively popular online games and I'm just a homebody that works on a show idea and mainly playing jrpgs and anime style mmo's sooo quite different. I suppose I could fake it but it would be sooo tiring, dishonest and people would know I'm a fraud sooner or later.

Technology isn't advancing enough to fix these issues. I just hope I'm not dead by the time it's advances to my liking. In the mean time I hope no more babies will be made in my family.

People at my age love clubbing, partying.. But to be honest I don’t give a damn to clubbing. Nightclub is usually so noisy and how can people socialize there? I’d rather do my fucking homework instead of going to nightclub.

I don’t have my favourite music artist even though I listen to tons of music, I don’t watch tv shows, I like some movies though (crime movie) but usually I watch alone. I don’t go to any cinemas for movies.

Tried cooking, that’s a no to me. Tried board game, that’s a no.

People are saying Toronto is such a fun place that you can always find something to do.. well perhaps I’m the only exception. I’d rather move to another city for my further study. It’s not people’s fault.. but I’m just a super boring person that maybe a boring city suits me better.

sorry for this post probably getting a bit longer. So I (M, 23) have been a loner most of my life, I have a handful of longlasting friends, but two years ago I moved to another city for a job and therefore rarely see them, and even if I am around they are mostly busy with their girlfriends or whatever. Back then when I still lived in the same city I slowly stopped getting to attached to them as I was always feeling like the third weel and wanted to explore life like I imagine it. Since then I have been travelling alone, living alone, going to clubs alone, eating out alone, selecting hobbies that are great alone and so on.

The thing is, I agree that this type of freedom with pizza, netflix and joggers is nice for a certain time and I never had a problem with it. But  slowly I am realizing that I often feel lonely on weekends, as I would love to do more things beside getting pizza, watching movies and playing videogames for the rest of the day, but then I realize you often need friends for certain things to actually be fun – I mean sure you can go to a club on your own (just an example), but anytime I tried it I ended up getting some drinks, standing at the bar watching people having fun and then left as it felt akward to dance alone.

So what can I do to fill my weekends that is actually fun where I can maybe also meet new people? I feel like I am wasting life at this point, working during the week, making plans for the weekend only to realize there's actually noone there to share the fun with.

So I tired actually making “friends” as in strangers online because I can’t well don’t know how to make friends in person or that.?  I work a lot and try my best to get as much overtime as possible because being alone and nothing to do for a day I get very depressed and my head doesn’t stop thinking and thinking and it just I don’t know how to explain it. 

So two weekends in a row when I have a Saturday off and this current weekend both Saturday and Sunday off. 

Last Saturday I planed a meet with this other human being online. We have been talking for a while yet on the day we where to meet she cancelled said she felt sick. Ok. I said . I just I. 

So I tired this weekend and getting my other Actual real life person. Not my friend well it’s complicated. I said if she wanted to hang out and she said sure. Then as I said when I was free she says. “Actually I’m working all week and the only day I have off is Tuesday and I’m spending that with Lewis(BF).” Ok

(btw she is my ex and first love. I had a mental breakdown and started talking to her last month. I feel I made a mistake as all I do is hurt now. Quick version I have never stoped loving her even tho I have desperately tried to stop. Yes I know. I know.)

So why bother telling me she’s free then tell me no and all that. Fucking why do I bother. 

So I tried another guy I have known for a few months. He says yeah. On the day. “Actually I got a doctors appointment sorry” I’m done. I no longer what to try.

I introduce myself, I am a man and I am 23, in a few months I will celebrate my second year of celibacy, for some people it may seem very long, but for me it's just something basic and it's it hurts, I never chose to be single, actually I'm just waiting for the arrival of a girl in my life, while some of my friends are already expecting a child, I'm the single bachelor among my colleagues at work and I do not hide the fact that the atmosphere is heavy in the long run, between thinking that I am gay because they have never seen me with a girl and tell me that finding someone is not a difficult thing, by the way is I really bother to meet someone? I earn more than the SMIC, I am sporty, I am sociable, I go out as much as I can, I am funny, I travel several times a year, I think I do what is necessary to at least meet people a girl, and it works, BUT, it never goes further than the stage of friendship (which explains that half of my friends are women)

To tell you the truth, I just know a friend who is in the same situation as me, except that he does not look specifically for it and waits for it to magically fall on him, but I doubt that by not doing the minimum we can actually meet someone, however, begins his fourth year of celibacy

Here is basically my diagram of the famous vicious circle:

Want to build something for my future family life&gt; Waiting and looking for a partner&gt; Meeting a woman&gt; After a few weeks: friendzone&gt; Repeat the diagram many times&gt; See my family future collapse&gt; Frustration&gt; Sadness&gt; Hate &gt; Black Ideas&gt; Depression&gt; After the storm, repeat the pattern

And that for a long time now

Here I say no more about my situation, actually I just have not enough strength to write more, I need to rest now

Thank you to everyone who will read me and answer me, good day to you",lonely,"Unselected celibacy, I have been living in a vicious circle for too long now",2019-04-06 22:38:20

I stopped playing on my PS4 because we used to do that together, I haven't really watched a movie or TV  since we broke up, we used to do that together too. I can't bring myself to go see endgame this year.
 We used to watch all the marvel films together I remember seeing Thor rangraok in Liverpool when we went away, I remember seeing black panther for Valentine's day, I remember how hyped we where to go see infinity war and how excited we we're for the second film, we left the theater grinning and excited and I just can't even think about it anymore. I know she went to go see captain marvel with someone else and it will probably be the same with endgame and that sucks man, it must not have been as special to her, just like me lol. 

I should be happy about that tho, iv lost alot of bad habbits. And I've been only productive every day all day, I keep myself busy all the time and I don't procrastinate anymore because I don't like spending time doing nothing and thinking, but it feels like it's for the wrong reason. I'm not the same person anymore, I'm fitter, I'm getting smarter and more wise and we'll rounded, my sense of style has changed,im learning and developing all the time, I'm even growing a beard but I don't know if I like who I've become, i don't like how complicated my life seems to have become and it sucks, I miss the happy feeling I had on the way to the cinema to see infinity war.

I recently was pushed out of a group of friends due to some really tough disagreements with one of the members of the group, and everyone in it abandoned me and ghosted me online. It makes me wonder if they never felt close to me in the first place, and how I could have developed deeper bonds.

I’m in college and have joined new clubs and started talking to people in classes, which I hadnt previously done. But I haven’t had a “spark” per say that you feel with a close friend, the type of thing that makes you want to be around them.

Anyhow, since dropping out of school due to mental health issues, I've obviously been seeing them less. I try to meet up as much as possible, but I don't want to push as their exams are coming up soon, and I don't want to be in the way. 
I asked my closest friend a few days ago if during the two week period they have time off for Easter, if he wanted to meet up with me and maybe just one or two others to watch a movie, just a 3 hour thing at most in the evening to take up as little time as possible. He oddly declined, saying that it would take up too much of his revision time. I find this weird, cause he always does so good even without revising a lot, and yknow, 3 hours out of two weeks is hardly a lot. It wouldn't eat into anything, it would just be some relaxing time with friends at some point. Feeling a bit down, with how alone I've been recently, I just shrugged it off.

But now, I learn today that he's thinking about going to an Easter party organised by some other friends. Which, I of course thought was ridiculous. He'd probably be at the party for at least 5 hours, 2 more than what I wanted to spend the most time doing while watching something. But, knowing him he'd likely get drunk and stay there for much longer. 

I know I'm probably overreacting, but I just can't but feel that he wanted to avoid a more boring activity with just me, and would prefer being with others that he finds more entertaining.

In the last week, a waiter at a restaurant threatened to call the cops on me for wanting to eat in the restaurant (I am dressed cleanly and shower daily and brush my hair and teeth, etc) because he found me ugly.  A guy screamed at me for wanting to pet his dog, my looks being the reason.  And when I try talking to guys they get offended and angry.  But if I talk to girls in the same way (such as complimenting their outfit) they are happy and say I come across as confident and bubbly, so it's my looks that make men uncomfortable.

I've struggled to make friends, I've tried going out and getting involved in things but I never felt like I belonged. I'm married, but my other half lives a separate life from me (long story). I've felt so alone for so long, when I came here for them I thought those days were over. But I was wrong.

I got irritated and vented on a local message board - I posted under confessions that I was sick of having no friends.

Surprisingly, someone answered and said they were too. So I suggested being friends. We hit it off instantly.

I was happier than I had been in a long time. We had so much in common. They talked to me every day, even if they were out doing something. They shared their deepest fears and dreams with me. We hung out at least once a week. I finally felt like I mattered to someone again.

Several weeks passed...then they began to grow distant. They stopped staying up late to talk to me, even when they had nothing to do the next day. The deep conversations disappeared, I would pour my heart out about something only to be met with cold silence. I'd ask them if anything was wrong and they said they were okay. They wouldn't open up to me about anything anymore.

Today we were supposed to spend the day together. Last night they changed the time they would come over to several hours later, saying they had errands to run first. Then they cancelled completely this morning, saying they were sick. I've seen them playing stuff on their PC despite them saying they are sick as a dog.  I had bought food and drinks for them yesterday, stuff they had asked for, and now looking in my fridge just makes me sad.

I'm overreacting. I know. I'm just so tired of being so lonely, then reaching out thinking I have a chance, only to be abandoned later once they got tired of me or found better friends. This has repeated itself time and again, even before I moved.

I can feel it happening again. I'm bracing myself for their eventual disappearance from my life. Even though it's happened several times, it never hurts any less. I wish I could just get used to it.",lonely,I dont know why I still try,2019-04-05 22:23:36

I have a somewhat medium to highish tolerance. I don't know. I'm an American mutt of Irish and Polish. Lot of alcoholism so I try to play it mild. Tonight I improvised whiskey sours with oranges instead of the lemons with a couple people- a friend of my ex, her ex, and my ex- with my ex and the other ex not drinking. I probably made each sour with two shots per person, most likely less; drank two or three shots of vodka; another sour; a shot of whiskey with tea and orange that tasted awful; then two shots in tea after taking my nightly nortryptaline when I still didn't feel much. 

I hate how much of this awful tasting stuff- $14 whiskey, but I don't like almost anything I've had- I have to drink to feel a buzz. I've only gotten wobbly, for longer than five-ten minutes, three times. Tonight that lasted half an hour. It's 3:43AM and I am already practically soberish.

So, my big rant: I am tired of my closest friends on the campus a dude who really doesn't see me as much of a close friend, and my ex. I am tired of everytime I open up or become vulnerable, I get hurt. I am tired of having no one I can confide in. No close friends. 

I am also tired of constantly being reminded my college sucks and my degree/college choice was a mistake. I am tired of being reminded I am going nowhere. I am tired of being reminded my brothers are high paid and/or in masters, doctorates, that my cousins are D1 athletes and/or getting art scholarships or music awards. I am tired of never getting to sleep at a good time and constant FOMO.

I was reading about a lady who died but no one found her body for three years, even with her TV being on, because she had no close friends or family, just 'friends of whoever she was dating at the time.'. That could be me so fucking quickly it scares me. 

I am also scared that I will fall into a toxic internet community... It seems almost every community or person you think you can find solace in, as an isolated male in search of guidance, in search of that absent father, turns out to be a trap. The first couple minutes or the first video might seem good, then slowly brings in weird stuff, whether it's about God or politics or alt right or MGTOW.

That's it for tonight. I hope you all are doing well as you can during episodes of loneliness.

1029,Malammore762,1554446922,151,"Man this one is hard to explain. I'll try my best.

I often feel like there's a love interest out there for me who I simply have not yet met. I imagine all parts of the world there are individuals like myself who feel not only lonely but sad and broken. From Juneau, Alaska to Mumbai, India all the way to Sydney, Australia. I'm sure there are good candidates everywhere for everyone but the problem is that an opportunity to meet one another never presents itself. It's truly heartbreaking for me trying to imagine the possibilities. These people literally go through life passing one another feeling lonely and hopeless.

7 billion and we still feel lonely. Think about it. There's something very wrong. Obviously there are factors like distance and language but just imagine for one moment two individuals from each of these locations were to cross paths and able to understand one another. They meet. They like each other for who they are. They go on their first date together. It's magical. The next thing you know they're snuggled up in bed as a couple. It's that simple. If only there was a more efficient way for people to meet and interact...

It's just a complete mindfuck for me that we can do things like put men on the Moon and understand shit like micro technology or hyperspace but still can't figure out the basics like human interaction. I'm convinced there's some beautiful young lady who is just like me that also feels lonely from a COMPLETELY different background that I will never get to meet. Not just me but for everyone. 

You have to be extremely lucky and in the right place at the right time. If you're off by even a fraction of a second you could miss your chance. 

I'm not afraid of sticking my neck out and testing the waters but I grow weary of the fucking disappointment of it all. I've tried so hard to be patient and not let it get to me but it just feels like an endless cycle of failure after failure. Like I'm destined to be punished or something.

Do you ever feel that there's something that just doesn't want you to find happiness? Something just in the way?

So I’m looking for someone who wants to talk to me and genuinely get to know who I really am. I have a total of two legitimate friends and everyone else in my life is essentially just filler. I’m tired of that, and I’m at the point in my life that I’m about to do a major flushing of people in my life. My circle is small, I intend to keep it very small, and I’m looking for someone who wants to become one of the very last parts of it. 

I’m not really a special person, I’m actually pretty fucking weird. What I’m offering though is special and rare, and it will take a rare person to fit into the little slot that’s available. I value a person’s core personality and what one’s soul
Is made of. Looks are nice, body is nice, but at the end of the day - if you’re a cunt - you’re worthless to me. I want someone in my life who wants me in theirs. 

That being said, you need to understand something that will likely be damning. I’m married. I’m happily married of twelve years and that will never change. My wife is also my collared slave. She has the heart of a servant and is a lovely soul. I and she are also polyamorous, and seeking someone who wants to discuss joining this family. She is as interested in this as I am, and it’s really beginning to dawn on us that literally no decent females are worth a shit. Prove me wrong? 

I don’t want your nudes. I don’t want phone-fun. I don’t care about any of that. I want substance. I want someone real and someone who has their own way of thinking. You’re not a doormat, you’ll not be treated as one. You’re a human. You have feelings and to me, those feelings are vitally important. 

So get to know me. I promise I’m worth getting to know, and I promise that if you’ll give me a chance and not ghost me, you’ll get to know someone that very few ever will. I’m a real person, I have real feelings, and even though they’re odd, and my convictions are weird, they’re my feelings and are genuine.

1057,Exploreptile,1554395056,3,"Okay, so I'm going to start this off by saying that I'm not looking to 'play the victim' here. I blame no-one but myself for the situation I'm in, but I just want to get this off my chest.

So, throughout all my life I've considered myself somewhat of an eccentric person--one that never really lined up with anyone else in the way I'd like. I'm sure this is familiar for a lot of people on this sub.

For several years, though, I always used to justify it to myself by blaming the people around me for being 'inferior' in some way. I unironically considered myself a ""true ~~boy~~ man of culture"", compared to the other people I encountered who were simply *different* from me. Despite that shitty mentality, though, I never openly attacked anyone for it--most of the time anyway.

I guess you could say that I respected people's opinions, even though I ""knew"" they were wrong.

It wasn't such a big deal early on in my teenage years, but as I started to lose more and more connections (through unrelated means, surprisingly); the sentiments grew stronger to compensate, straining the few deep friendships I did have past school when combined with the differences between us that had magnified over time and unrelated drama. Even when I came across reddit, I never really found the camaraderie I was looking for among the spikes of validation those little orange arrows gave me.

“r/worldbuilding? Too ‘Western’, and obsessed with being ‘out there’ and ‘original’.”

“r/FanFiction? Too fluffy and cuddy and lax. We suddenly need *permission* to criticize now? Grow a spine.”

“r/Pokemon? Too sentimental, and I always see the same dumb things over and over.”

Etc., etc. Some I left, some I stayed in for those little upvote highs. Overall, though, nothing much changed for the better.

This toxic mindset finally bit me in the butt when a few events confronted me with the fact that the sole friend I still had on Discord was part of a group chat with a few people he was chummy with, and was part of a guild on another game who actually considered him family to an extent.

He, the person who I had nagging thoughts of as “too soft” and “whiny” and “clingy”, a person with “shit taste”, had a more stable and functional social life than I could ever hope for.

When I came to realize this fact, I *snapped*.

It started with passive-aggressive banter and eventually culminated in a full-on tantrum. We’ve had our arguments before, but I’d never thrown so much shit at him before in my life. The worst part is, as I said, he did absolutely nothing wrong.

I know I’m not on r/AmITheAsshole, and I’m not asking that question. I *know* I’m the asshole. But I’ve calmed down, recognized myself for the freak I am, fell into a slump, and reflected on the past years of my life.

I’m still wondering on what I should do next.

For now, I’ve been trying to accept the fact that I’ll probably an anomaly for the rest of my life--even among other people--and none of *them* are to blame. Though, any suggestions would be appreciated. I kind of feel lost right now.

Every since I was a kid, my teachers kept on emphasising on how secondary school life is actually better and more memorable than primary school.

 Except, it just got worst for me. I suck at making and continuing conversations. Now, everytime someone calls me out or call my name, I just freeze. I'm always so silent and quiet unless its needed for me to response. I think the teachers and my juniors/seniors at my school activity club think I'm stuck up because of that?


 Sure, I got a few friends from secondary school who I'm friends with but they are normally just making jokes,memes and having fun. But at the end of the day, I'm just left alone. No text messages unless they want to copy my homework or ask about school stuff. 

  I feel selfish when deep inside me, I just want a friend who I can be 'me' and not be afraid of sharing my interest or problems. I don't want to walk around the school alone everytime during recess like some idiot. I don't think anyone would even notice me if I'm gone but I wish at least one person would. 

  Everybody around me has their own group of friends and they seem to be really close and attached to one another. I wish I could spend my teenage life like that one day.

&amp;#x200B;

Back story: I grew up in a small town, my parents seemed happy. I have 3 siblings; an older brother an older sister and a younger brother. We had it made, we rode bikes with friends to school and to the beach in the summers. In 5th grade my parents decided to get divorced, my dad moved out with a woman he as having an affair with through work. I found out bout the affair when i was in 7th grade. My mother is an alcoholic and she was sober for 25 years leading up to my older brothers 25th birthday. Before he turned 25, my younger brother was entering the high school i attended and he was involved with drugs and a high profile gang. I learned this information through friends as well as him being boastful about his involvement. I talked to my parents and my mom decided that with her full time job she could no longer take care of him. He moved in with my father his freshman year of high school. My mom relapsed and ended up in rehab. She found a boyfriend through her new job as a counselor for substance abuse. I spent countless nights finding her eating raw chicken in the kitchen or passed out drunk in the family room. I became a recluse in my room. (my room was in the down stairs of a bi-level home i made it a man cave with a mini-fridge) I soon became a room mate of my moms. I refused to spend time with her because it made me resentful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving onto the future: I will add a tl;dr disclaimer at the end, Im doing my best do describe my situation. My work history is interesting but Ive worked my way towards a director position for a company at 26 years old. It forced me to relocate and I have started to notice signs that living on my own I am extremely unproductive. I know i have earned the job I have and take it seriously but my concerns are how i conduct myself when I'm alone. My new apartment is a mess and i have no desire to take care of myself or contact friends or family. it has ruined my motivation completely. I would like to hear from other people who live alone and understand how they live a productive lifestyle. I feel as if I was more productive when i had struggles to deal with.

If it would be posible to watch TV together with your friends, family or other (unknown) lonely people while the both of you are sitting in your own lazy chairs in your own homes, would you be intressted to use something like that?

I am working on a innovative device that could make this posible. The tv's audio will be seperated and filtered from your voice while using it. A (kind of) handsfree kit thats on your table. It would give you the feeling there is someone sitting on the couch right next to you even when you are miles apart.

Maybe you will think this is posible already with a phone or App but its absolutely not, the background noise (feedback) of your TV will make it imposible to be able to turn the volume of the TV to an hearable level.

You don't have to talk all the time but when you say something you will be heard and if you laugh someone can laugh with you,, just like when there would be someone sitting in your livingroom right next to you..

So you would be able to watch that soap together with your Granny or watch that big sportsgame with you father even when the both of you are not really together.

What do you think? Would you use a device like this?

Giving back cozyness, thats the spirit..

My closest friend of my adult life (I’m an elder millennial) passed away in July 2018. Im a person with Asperger’s so making friends is really difficult, but this woman was so kind to me. She brought me into her inner circle by introducing me to her 2 other bffs. I was her work BFF, she also had a childhood BFF and a college BFF. We hung out together at least once a month, and kept a group chat going constantly. The support and love and friendship was one of the most beautiful things I have ever known. When Leah died, it fractured everything.

1098,Untitledexistence,1554285487,2,"Hello everyone, I tend to lurk and read post on reddit from time to time but this is a last resort approach as I don't know where else to go. I don't know where to start or how to say this but here goes.

I am a 26 year old male, from the uk (Yorkshire. Caucasian. 

I am currently in full time employment on a temporary contract and my contract ends in September 2019 but so far I am currently 11 months into the contract. I work as an assistant (support worker) and help adult with housing needs. But as it get's closer to the the summer it will get close to the point where I will not be sure what else to near the time when my contract ends.

I do enjoy my job, I have my own place and space. I don't have kids, I don't have any family. I have around 3 friends but I don't always see them as we all lead busy lifes and that's ok.

I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder which sometimes effects me getting a full nights sleep from time to time), Mild Depression, and I am partially dyslexic. None of these effect a persons intelligence but from time to it can be challenging in the terms of life. I tend to hide it, very few people know little bits that I've disclosed overtime but i'm rather a private and guarded person and it takes me a while to trust people but when I do feel like I can trust a person I do gradually open. I rather strict on keeping to myself at work and keeping a work life balance separate to my private life it's just how I roll.

Despite myself everyday trying to do my best with my job and my hobbies outside of work. I find that when I am at home I feel lonely, empty like I am nothing although I know I am not. I can't articulate entirely that feeling but it's always temporary. I'm not sad or depressed yet I feel like shit in myself sometimes. 

Overtime I have tried everything from counselling, stress courses and i'm out of options. Everything i'm trying to do in the aspects of improving the quality of my life is fine but it's just the other things when it's not about work or my hobbies. Yesterday I was off work because I had a spiral of anxiety which lead to me not being able to sleep, It comes in phases I am go weeks and months of sleeping and feeling fine then the next I can go from not sleeping much and in rare occurances not being able to sleep where I am so exhausted I just can't function. Eventually I do sleep and I am back on track. 

Everday I feel lonely, I feel nothing and I've learn to be alone ever since I was a child. I can even feel this way even when I am around people. I'm quite ambiverted as a person so I do enjoy my own company mostly from time to time but sometimes I just want to connect and it's not easy. 

I haven't dated a girl in over 5 year and haven't got lucky in that aspect if you know what I mean but that being said there's a lot to life and I wish I had someone to speak to sometimes or to share good moments with. There's times when I don't really have any friends to speak to except the ones I have. I just don't know how else to go with this I just don't know sometimes it's hard to reach out even when we do speak. Yesterday I spoke to a friend and I was honest and it turns out I wasn't alone. 

 I've not had an easy life, my past is rough and dark. I've had to fight and persevere through some of the worst circumstances and situations to get to where I am now and I'm at a point where I feel like I am managing but I guess I just wanted to say hello on here. 

Thanks for reading fellow humans. ",lonely,"First time for everything, I'm not sure what to do or how to go about this but I need advice. I am lonely. Hello.",2019-04-03 20:58:07

We were inseparable best friends, we did everything together and we’d do nothing but talk about each other when we were apart. We had a physical relationship that she was more than encouraging but I knew she’d felt guilty at times and had never been in any relationship let alone a serious one so I took things slow. Then suddenly it was ruined accidentally in one night when her parents found out and her separated us. She might’ve been hurt initially but I know she’s carrying on and the fact that she can even do that and that she never breaks down and reaches out like I do just hurts so bad. Her parents have so much pressure on her to stay away and they’ve probably convinced her to hate me cause I’m the sinner that deceived them and all that but it just feels so unfair, she was head over heals for me a month and a half ago to have her not give a shit? It’s just too much. I know it’s all about her religion but I promise I couldn’t have treated her better. We were just too happy and comfortable the universe couldn’t let that balance last.

1101,Thravik_,1554274147,1,"Before I get into this, I'm just going to make it clear that I'm in a relationship that has made me happier than I've ever been, but that's not necessarily my problem. And I may say a bunch of random shit that's all over the place because as of writing this I'm not in a good mood so keep that in mind. I'm not really looking for advice, just letting my thoughts out there but any opinions about this are welcomed. 

Lately I've been feeling somewhat alone. Doesn't have to entirely do with my relationship, but life has gotten us really busy. What my problem comes down too is socializing. I've always been an introvert, I have been trying to socialize when I could or wanted to. And it isn't like I rarely done it, I've helped people with their issues for quite a long time and had some conversations with people somewhat often.
 But I have a hard time talking to them. I'm not the type who gets too nervous about talking to people, I just find myself in so many situations where I can't connect with others, having this feeling of rejection during conversations in groups. Like what I say doesn't matter and stuff like that. It isn't that I want to be selfish, I'll admit sometimes I do that unintentionally, but overall I just want to feel included. Like I matter.
 It's something I didn't really get, due to a bunch of shit growing up like neglect, being pretty much disliked during my years in school, and other traumatic shit.
I always get the feeling like people don't want to talk to me.
And I wouldn't really blame them. I'm not the easiest person to talk to and since they don't know me well, they wouldn't know how to react compared to a best friend they've known for years.
People say I should make friends, socialize more, etc. But it's never been easy for me. I've only had a select few friends. I have tried being more social but it hasn't gone well.

At this point I'm questioning a lot about myself. I ask myself why do I care about this kind of thing, how would that even help me? Most of the time I just try to brush it off, trying to not let it get to me and move on but I can't help it. It's like there's a looming loneliness behind me that I can't shake off and it's only more apparent whenever I try to socialize with people. I honestly don't know what to do about it.

1105,KombuchaShotgun,1554255750,7,"I moved several states away from all my family and friends about 8 months ago to further my education. The feelings of loneliness were/are pretty difficult for me, and I got tired of hearing the oft-spouted ""meditation, therapy, and exercise"" suggestions. While these factors help, they are also obvious. I wanted to share some of the smaller, weirder, and more obscure techniques that I discovered helped my feelings of isolation:

* **Live gamer streams** \- I am not a gamer, but found that tuning in to twitch videos was really helpful on those difficult nights where the loneliness felt intolerable. Even if I have the window minimized or scaled to super small proportions in the corner of my screen as I tend to other business, it's a relief to hear someone else in real time. It's helped me to think of it as a casual chill sesh with another person with both of us doing our own thing, together.
* **""Study with me"" videos** \- This one is more for the students, but could also be a good option for those who don't like the noisiness of video game streams. I am in a pretty rigorous academic program and spend many days and nights studying alone. Not only does this leave less time for social engagement, but it is hard for others to relate to, and thus can be isolating. I've found that ""study with me"" videos help me feel less lonely, and also motivates me to stay focused. A double-win!
* **Weighted blankets** \- I always hated the idea of weighted blankets. I thought they'd be too hot or make me feel trapped, but let me tell you: *weighted blankets are the good shit*. Something about the heaviness distributed over you is surprisingly calming. If you are an affectionate person with no people or pets to cuddle, a weighted blanket is a great way to mimic the feeling of being held.

These techniques are not going to alleviate the root cause of my problems, but they sure have helped me take the edge off some tough nights. I'd love to hear if anyone else has any creative solutions to share! At the very least, I hope my techniques prove helpful to you. Just remember, folks: we will get through this!

1118,Artiscan,1554233577,1,"This occurred about two weeks ago. It all started when I got into a car crash right after a series of events happened right after such as getting 8 million stolen from my crypto wallets, the business deal went south, went into a panic attack after = hospital for a day. This wealth was all self-made by myself; I came from a middle class family and it started when I was 15, became a millionaire at 17. Had the best time of my life; when I was 18 traveled to Korea, 2x Japan, Macau, Hong Kong for 1.5 months. Did all the stupid shit such as ordering shit of food or spending a retarded amount of money on stuff. Bought my first luxury car at 18 due to parents request; originally I was going to buy a civic. That luxury car saved my life from the car crash that happened 2 weeks ago and It still works. but I never flexed like buying a stupid amount of luxury clothing, accessories since I was low key with my wealth around certain people. I always wore Uniqlo outfits because I didn't need to show that I was wealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have this ego when I was rich ""Haha, Fuck you! I'm rich, and you're not,"" but I would never say that, just in my head or ""Idgaf"" ego. Now what I have in life is about 10k\~. Man, Life sucks because I don't know; what to do anymore.  Since, the only skills, I know is finding loopholes ( Bug Bounty ), Importing products and selling them but that requires 40k capital since it's bought in bulk and cryptocurrency trading; I stopped since August, and I doubt my strategies even work now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly, I do have real friends more than fake friends, but most of them have moved on in life such as; having a girlfriend, going to college/uni, have a job/busy life. I had alot of people looked up to me as an inspiration/role model for being so wealthy at a young age. At the moment, I am lonely, sad, scared literally don't know what to do and have bad social skills due that I have an INTJ personality type. Lost all confidence in myself. I just feel really behind in life now. Huge Setback. My goal was having a net worth of 100 million dollars by 40.

One year ago today, i got married to the love of my life, or at least i thought i did. Between that day up until now, she asked for a divorce, told me she cheated on me with her step brother, and had cheated on me before she came to Canada(where i live) to be with me in person(we had been dating online), and lied about everything, including her drinking. And if that didn't hurt enough, well, i got married to her at 19. I'm gonna be a divorcee at 20 years old. Oh boy, mistakes were made. And now it's the anniversary. It's almost ironic, considering i feel like a fool. 








I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'm looking for attention, maybe I'm wanting to talk to someone, or maybe i just needed to vent somewhere. Part of me wants to say I'm looking for people to talk to or to make friends, but honestly i don't feel like that would make me feel any different. I'm considering posting this in the make new friends sub and the meet new people sub, but i don't think this post qualifies in either of those subs. Plus, i don't see the point in posting in those places, since this post is more so just me venting. Not to mention, this probably isn't the best way to make friends, since it's a post of sadness and people may only talk to me because they feel bad for me. I don't know. Life is confusing.

My family being around me and helping and supporting me throughout the day today.











My favourite show returns today after being on a hiatus for the last 4 months.

I know I'm responsible for my own misery and I'm trying to become better. It's just so hard. :( Even though I consider myself very flexible (well, in some ways) I'm still a human and humans get stuck on their stupid ways. 

Anyway the thing is, I push people away. I like the thought of people and I like to help and listen to them but I don't let anyone in, ever. I'm polite and likeable (to most people. Unfortunately some people hate me and I find that very hard to accept) but I don't show any sides of me other than the bright and smilish sweetheart-one, which then makes me seem uninteresting and one-dimensional. I've always believed that I in fact am that way (still very much possible), until in one special moment I realized no one actually knows anything about me. It's like, how do you form an opinion of a twig lying on the ground. It's just there. No one cares. Maybe some dog might. I love dogs. Love me dogs. I wish I was even mysterious in a cool way but I'm just hiding in plain sight. I'm too shy and quiet and insecure, unconventional and guarded, blah blah blah.

Ever since when I became too heavy and big for my mom to carry around I've spent most of my time in isolation and it's the way I feel most natural and comfortable. I don't like being around people but of course sometimes you crave it. You know, 🎶*I wanna be where the people are.*🎶 Maybe if I had just one or two people who I could be with, JUST BE, feeling no pressure to please or to speak or to do anything at all. Going on adventures in nature together, listening to the quiet, that would be great. And then talking about cool shit when we get back, listening to some gr8 pops. 8) :(

Lately I’ve been feeling even more down and basically it’s been four months since the breakup with my boyfriend and I’ve been really sad since then. However, the other day I tried changing the way I was acting towards others and I was happy and positive and it actually worked so thank you everyone for your support on that!! I still feel like there will definitely be lows and the lows are to be expected. Last night I laid in bed writing about everything going on and for the first time since I broke up with my boyfriend I cried, so much, and it felt great. I let out all of the pain and emotions I’ve been concealing since then. I realize it may be ridiculous to cry over all of that four months later but I’m telling you writing felt so good. It’s like I could put everything out on paper and no one would ever see. Still I lay awake at night and struggle with the hard feelings. The feelings that no one would ever love me again and I will be alone forever. But now, I wake up and I know that I will be happy again, and that’s what I keep telling myself because I know it’s true.

1157,justathrowaway2736,1554126047,4,"I know that seems like not much to ask, however I'm a very different kind of guy and not many people particularly like me due to the things I'm interested in, and how I've structured my life. Furthermore, even fewer are interested in being what I'm looking for - and I completely understand that I'm searching for someone who is the rarest of rare. 

&amp;#x200B;

To begin, here's a little primer on ""who I am"" - in hopes it catches someone's eye. I'm 34 (obviously), of the male gender, and I reside in Kentucky. I'm tall-ish, 6'4 and stocky ""football player"" build - though I've never played any kind of sports. I really don't understand how football works honestly, I've never paid much attention to it. So I'm definitely not a sports jock who's glued to ESPN every weekend. That being said, I'm also not a gamer geek. I had an XBox a few years ago and gave it to my neighbor's kid because I never used it. I do still have my original Nintendo in the closet though, I've still never beaten the original Super Mario Bros. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a professional career in financial services, I'm an insurance agent for one of the largest nationally known insurance companies. It's not what I particularly enjoy doing, but it keeps the lights on. I also own my home, vehicles, and a pontoon boat that I've been restoring. My hobbies include aviation (I am licensed to fly), ham radio, electronics tinkering, and being involved in the kink lifestyle. I have no children, but do have a small yorkie. He's my boy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm going to explain something that you'll probably not like, but hear me out. I'm married. I'm happily married of twelve years this November. That's not going to change, ever. I'm looking for someone who is okay with this, who is understanding of this, and most importantly, someone who could develop an interest in becoming part of my family in the future. She and I both are polyamorous - or more specifically, polyexclusive. I hide nothing from her, she knows I'm typing all of this out. She hides nothing from me, she's reading everything I say. We base our entire relationship and lives on honesty and transparency. I know many of you are going to scorn me for posting this, or scorn me for my choices in life, and that's okay. You're free to cast stones as you wish - but understand - my life is mine and nothing you can say or do will change what brings me happiness. I feel that love and emotion are limitless feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're still following me after that bomb drop, I'm impressed and excited that I've not appalled you so far. Please consider messaging me because I'd love to tell you more about me, my life, my lifestyle, in hopes you can find something within me that will compliment your life as well.

Alright, all joking aside. Shit sucks currently. Well? Actually, life sucks in general, but I could imagine that we've all been made aware of that by how we're suddenly dropped off the edge of comfort cliff, and now we're currently destined to do a face-plant into responsibility rapids. Just to be swept away before we're able to grab hold of anything, and do anything with our time. Which probably explains why I don't feel as if I've done anything good, or met anyone that's seen me as worth their time.

I could imagine that would be a lot of effort to try, and get someone currently tumbling down a river at high speeds. So, I honestly don't blame them for not trying to help out, or do anything. I am just a stranger after all, a good for nothing stranger that's got nothing to give. Anyhow, that's enough rambling, and metaphors for me today.

1160,sykoste,1554118713,4,"Hey all ☺️

Let’s be honest, no one really care’s we all have are own shit that we are going through and that’s life innit but we try and survive,

All we can do is truly care for each and everyone of us and listen and be there for you. 
Everyone has a story and here is mine.

I moved from the UK to Australia at 18 thinking it will be better for me and it kinder was, but I’ve only every felt loneliness for that last 14 years I’ve been here, I’ve never really felt true friendship like I did from people I spend my last 8+ years of my life in the UK,

Everyone has always wanted something out of me, to elaborate I’ve DJ’ed for 15 years nearly and that’s all it’s been, I do have 2 close friends but one left the state and the other is happy saying home playing xbox but the last 3 years it has drifted.

Alcohol and gigging kept me shallow, was never happy and knew what was causing it but I had nobody but a brief moment of happiness, no real friend tho, I just serviced there needs and made me feel slightly wanted but I know that was never true start.

I met the love of my life 7 months ago and gives me a purpose and never in my life felt so happy and I would lay my life down for her and do anything for her and it saved my life! She saved my life! 

She is amazing and love her so dearly and I adore her so much and she does me too and it’s amazing I can’t imagine my life without her, when she’s around I finally found peace after 32 years of life.

I just have this emptiness of not having true friends, I’ve very introverted so don’t like many people unless I feel a connection, but alcohol and gigging gave me somewhat a extroverted outlook but come downs to it was never happy and I just tried to be.

I left it all for her because she was worth it and was  killing me, you can’t hold a real relationship working through the night on the weekends, she has so much important job than I do as a second job on the weekends, and left it 6 months ago and don’t miss it one little bit, thought I would but not even for a second and know I made the best decision of my life doin it.

She has my heart forever and I’m forever greatfull for it, she saved me and her too, she’s my best friend and I love her more than anyone will ever know.

I know real friendship Is something I’ll never really ever feel again.

One thing I know I’ve got her pure love and friendship and that all that matters.

I may never meet you but know I care and love you too, all we have is each other.

Much love xxox

I usually never post on reddit but as I wrote in the subject, I’m feeling super anxious right now and everyone I can talk to is either asleep or not answering me. Anyway, I feel very lonely right now. I have struggled for many years with the fear of failure. I have always been a very good student and over achiever because of this fear. It has been a huge motivator in my life but as of right now, it is affecting me hardcore to the point where I feel like I’m on the verge of crying at any second. Anyway, I have a huge test next week that determines whether i graduate university or not and it’s really weighing on my confidence, strength, and abilities as a person and student. I am usually a good test taker but even after studying for over 3 months, I still am insecure about this test. After taking numerous practice exams, I’m still not getting the passing score. My point is that none of my friends understand the struggle I am going through and every time I try to complain or vent, they just tell me “Oh you’ll be fine” and kind of dismiss the whole conversation. I don’t want to brushed off, I want to be heard and helped. Just because I have passed exams in the past, doesn’t make my anxiety for this test any less important or real. Anyway, I just wanted a place to vent and I’m sure no one will actually read this. But to anyone who struggles with feeling alone, I’m here to talk if you need someone.

Along with struggle with language, I was a child with psychological issues. Teachers had constantly prescribed therapist after therapist, and it was no help. However, by seventh grade it had dissipated somewhat. But in eighth grade, I was a violent kid. Bullying towards me in seventh grade had me bitter, and as a kid who had a whole sleuth of different mental issues since he was a child, I did not respond well as I went into eight grade. Due to violence in multiple incidents throughout the year, my parents had decided to force me into an online high school. I’m in eleventh grade now, and there has been an insane amount of things that have happened in between, but to sum it up, I’m not violent anymore, I have dissipated my anger issues, yet I have been continuously depressed for over four years, and have continuously had OCD since I can remember. I’ve improved myself a lot, I’d like to think. I go to the gym, I get straight A’s, and I’ve tried my best to become the most compassionate human being I can be. But the problem is that, it’s been three years I’ve been in an online high school, and I have absolutely no friends. Sure, I never really had any “friends” throughout my school years, but I legitimately have no friends now. Hoping to make some, I recently joined a youth orchestra for the state.  Well, actually, I joined for this one girl I have liked since I played in this orchestra three years ago. However, it is only making me more miserable as I am unable to talk to anyone, especially as I know absolutely no one in the orchestra except for that girl I like who doesn’t give a shit about me.

I’m a stocky dude who’s not extremely fit, but I’m not fat, and I’m relatively muscular, although I admit that I’m slightly pudgy. However, I don’t think I’m too ugly for this girl I like to like me.

I can’t find any opportunity to talk to her, or rather, I can’t find a situation where I would be forced to talk to her. Along with that, I’m losing hope that I would make any waves if I did talk to her, as she clearly doesn’t give a shit about me.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't be a dick, and if people are into things you're not into, that's fine, just leave them alone and ignore them? Easy

1187,ProgressRoute,1554041639,0,"Every time I see a good looking woman I'm almost certain she's having the time of her life being pounded by huge dicks which few men have.

Those men are the luckiest ever and they get the top women even though for relationships or just casual sex.

I once saw in the car at the stop light  in front of me a woman caressing and nurturing a guy and kissing him. I'm sure this guy is tall and/or has a big dick otherwise this good things wouldn't have happened to him.

That's Eastern Europe, if I had been a tall guy with 8"" dick I would be so happy and surrounded by women.  It didn't matter how I talked , how I dressed (ofc not like a hobo) and even how much money I made . 

Just the bulge in my pants and/or my height would be enough to get the woman wet .
