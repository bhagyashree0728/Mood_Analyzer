1,Skinnbinn,1609417812,1,"When I was little, my parents always said things like “you need to fix yourself” and “If you don’t start *blank* I won’t love you anymore” and have threatened to send me back to my “real” parents (they used to lie about me being adopted). When I was the new kid at an elementary school and tried to make friends with a kid who looked  lonely, she was immediately aggressive towards me and soon said something along the lines of “No one will ever want to be your friend or like you. You’re gross, ugly, and stupid.” When I was in middle school and actually managed to get some friends, and introduced some of them to each other, they started to hang out with me way less. I remember in 6th grade I went up to a friend because he promised to work on a group project with me and he told me “go away and work on it yourself.” I got upset at him and all he told me in response was, “You know what, I don’t even want to be your friend anymore.” I cried during lunchtime and he had the audacity to get a lunch lady to tell me to “stop crying because it was making him uncomfortable.” Speaking of group projects, they have always been among the worst experiences for me. I got called too stupid for drawing poorly in middle school and I forgot how to do something in science and someone said “wow you’re not as smart as I thought you would be.” Group projects became hell in high school. No one wanted to be in the same group with me for one project, so I had no choice but to not only work 4 times as much (it was a 4-5 people group project) but also present to the class for four times as long while trying to overcome anxiety and the terrible speech impediment I had. I got a C(+?) mainly because of “my constant stuttering, trouble focusing, and working alone,” according to the teacher. In another project, I was literally locked out of accessing the presentation online because a group member felt “I was getting in the way” even after I helped bring information and organized it; they kept my contributions in tact, I guess they just didn’t want me to be there because they disliked me. There’s also the time when I literally just asked a question to my group (a different group that is unrelated to the last one) and the leader straight up told me, “Everyone here agrees and understands except you. If you can’t be on the same page, then maybe you should just leave the group” even though I had tried my best to be helpful. I’d go on longer, and talk more about events that are unrelated to school, but this post has gotten too long already. Those same people are the ones who get awards, have loving families, friends who support them, ect. while I’m the one who’s stuck crying in bed. I wish I could live happily like they do and I’m trying my hardest, I really am. But it begins to feel impossible when you have been let down so many times and have had your self-esteem destroyed. I wish I weren’t so awful so the world wouldn’t have to think I deserve this. I feel so stuck.",lonely,I feel so unwelcome around other people,2020-12-31 23:30:12
2,Ethansracing,1609417797,1,"This is just a simple scramble of texts. Honestly I only wrote it because I’ve been way to uneasy and unable to sleep so this helped my mind ya know!
Anyways lmk what you guys feel, am I the only one?

I’ve had this uneasy feeling lately, the type that drifts a mind towards a distant thought. I’ve seemed to catch a trail of thoughts, a way of thinking you could say. How would the world be any different if I wasn’t here?
What have I truly done to affect anyone around me? No I truly I say, anyone, any small person, doesn’t have that much of an impact! It’s jaw dropping to think of ourselves in comparison to the vast world, billions of atoms and molecules forming that which we call human beings. The hollow shells of people, it would be impossible to tell the difference between those truly living, and the ones who have been forced to go on, hollow shells living a life. The dreadful walk of a lonely being, so heart wrenching, the path of a wanderer, still searching. I guess I could say I’m still searching- what is the impact I have, how would this planet take in effect my disappearance? 
Love, the expression of temporary feelings, friends the temporary love that we try to feel, and hope, something we try to convince ourselves in, just to be let down. How can hoping in something truly do anything else than convince our brains a lie about the future we hope to have but never achieve? In the end it just leaves us locked in a disappointed present. 
The future is uncertain so why would we hope. Millions of variables play into the outcome, a simple smile, could it have the ability to change the future of someone else’s life? Could someone who tells you that you don’t matter change the outcome of your story? So truly I ask, how do you affect the world around you? Do you make enough of a difference? 

So I sit and ponder, “what would the world look like without me”. We know that a simple word can change the path of a human, so I can choose to use my words; I can use my actions. Yes, I will choose to help others, to lift them up! My words will be a light so others don’t have to feel the pain, the depth that spans the distance of a cavern in my heart. They will never have to experience this unfulfilled longing, I will try to give them hope, the tool that doesn’t work for me. But wait again, these people I try to lift up carry a sword, a dagger to betray. They have taken my cup and drank from it, leaving nothing for me. I’m left stranded in the desert alone, betrayed by the light that I have given others. Why do I ignore my pain and to help a friend just to get destroyed by others in the uplifting of their lives? How can I be so naive?! Never again will I allow myself to get hurt. I cannot trust, I cannot be trusted. I’m going to let down, and I’m going to be let down. Don’t give me hope, and don’t ever hope in me, for the end is uncertain, and the millions of variables have a way of scheming against me. The world is tilted to curve in my wrongs, it has given me the wasteland to make crops grow. How can I produce anything with the cards in my hand? That is why I sit and watch my body waste away. 
Oh how my heart longs to go somewhere, a land far away! Take me away from the barren desert that I’ve been dragged to. How I sit here in betrayal, I want to live in another place, the place where I don’t have to hope, where I don’t have to be let down, where no one can betray me. I want this place where I know I won’t have to worry about being missed. I want to catch the wind that pulls my sails to the foreign land, oh how my heart longs for such simple things. This peaceful land is what I long for, but again, I fail to realize, this is a longing (a hope). My heart has betrayed the logic in which I use. My very first principal, hope, so useless, I have fallen back to the start. I’m longing for a world which I will never see, how foolish I am. My heart cannot see an end to the chaos, my longing can never be fulfilled. I will never grasp the reality, how far I am from the reality I seek. Take me away! Take me out of here. There’s nothing that makes me feel more than a waste of a life form. So many people could do better with my life, and yet I feel like I’m in such an awful place. I can’t escape the pain, it chases me down, there’s no where I can go where I don’t feel the pain. I’ve tried everything, I’ve tried Jesus, I’ve tried praying, I’ve tried finding it in love, I’ve tried finding it in friends, and I’ve tried hoping. I’ve hoped, I’ve longed, I’ve dreamt, I’ve wished soooo hard, but it’s so far away. It’s the land I can’t make it to. I’ve accepted the pain, I understand it will always be here, but what is the pain? To be honest, I don’t know. A feeling maybe?- there’s no real way of putting it. I feel so lonely, so unappreciated and so dreadful. I feel a huge weight, I’m downcast to the abyss. I can’t escape! I feel like no one cares and I’m always called useless, I’m always told I’m never enough, that I’m a loser who does nothing, I’ve always felt so useless.
I want the land, I want the peace, I want to be away from everyone- everything. Please take me to this land, whatever can do so will make me understand that maybe I’m not alone, but no one will be there. So I don’t hope, because I understand that no one will take me to this land, there is no path that brings me here. So I sit and ask myself how this world would be without me.
I’m afraid so I won’t do anything. I’m scared of what will happen, so I lay here, unable to move. I am incapable of moving.",lonely,What would a world without me look like?,2020-12-31 23:29:57
3,White_Caladrius,1609417128,1,"I (19M) feel so mentally isolated from other people. It’s really hard for me to trust. I don’t want to tell the people around me how I feel because it might negatively affect how they think of me. 

So much of myself is hidden out of sight that it seems like I just exist in other people’s world. Support from people who don’t know me feels so shallow and meaningless. I understand and respect them for being nice and courteous but it doesn’t mean as much as I want it to mean. 

I wish I had someone that knew me and cared for me as much as I care and know them. I’ve made it this far in life thinking to myself, hiding, alone but it feels like a need. Like I need somebody to love. I wish I had someone to share my vulnerabilities with, without them having a negative view of me or using them to hurt me. 

I’m sure this is all amplified by the current state of the world and my career so I’m hopeful I’ll have the freedom to find someone to share myself with in the future but waiting fookin sucks!

Thank you for reading this! Maybe you feel the same way or slightly different, either way, I hope you have a good day (or night)!

5,Air-Constant,1609415900,1,"Yay, less than 12 hours and this 2020 will end. This year sucked for almost everyone. I've lost many friends for the most dumb reasons, I've split up with my ex girlfriend I've been with for 5 years. A girl I liked so much treated me like garbage and harsly ended a very short relationship, mostly based on sex. I've lost my last grandparent. 

The only 3 things that I'm Happy for are: 1- at least, my family is ok and my 4 most sincere friends are still here (most important), 2- college is going very well and 3- I improved so much in sculpting.

But I often feel so alone and forgotten. The people that treated me like a piece of trash are now happily engaged (I'm not a Saint, but jeez they've been ways worse) and many """"""friends"""""" (even the ones I knew since middle school) don't even reply back to my messages, without even giving me a f.. reason. The only girl I like told me that She needs time to think about something I don't even know (I totally respect this decision and her spaces) and proceeded to basically Ghost me since the last 2 weeks (this is going on at the Moment), and this makes me feel even more miserable.

8,Nillerpiller,1609414608,1,"I have everything.

A very intelligent daughter with a great woman. A great job working on planes. My own place decorated perfectly. Two cars. 5 or 6 good friends I talk to daily, 20-30 friends I talk to here and there. I'm fit, I've always heard I'm pretty attractive. I'm very involved in my hobby (boxing) and work out for a few hours a day. Everyone says I'm pretty intelligent, but I can't help but disagree lol. My mother and father are both pretty great and are very involved in my life after going through a rough childhood.

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm bragging, I'm not trying to, I'm just shocked. I was told all of these traits makes for a good meaningful life, but every day I get home from work and just feel so lonely despite a full inbox. It seems like everyone that talks me never actually says anything of substance, they just talk to say something and keep their minds busy- maybe something else, idk really. I wasn't too bothered listening to everyone else talk about their interests and hobbies at first, but then I realized how happy it makes them when I listen to them, and how whenever I try to talk to anyone about what I care about they just... instinctively lose interest or focus. I don't blame them, they've got their own interests. But man, why do I feel like theres 7 billion humans but not one I can be myself around. I just kind of smile and crack one-liners to make OTHERS smile- if only for a second. In reality my tone is pretty mellow, my interests are kind of boring. I feel like I'm losing who I really am because I don't have opportunities to express myself. I feel this fog creep over my memories and interests. Even my vision and hearing get foggy. Come to think of it, food doesn't taste good anymore, and when I touch things its almost just- numb. 

Why can't there be one person just... a little bit like me?

13,Responsible_Ad5920,1609409909,1,"I was super interested in this girl and I kept getting to know her but never really made my move because I didn’t she saw me like that. One day while at school(university), I waited in the library for her to finish classes as I was doing my own work and tried to ask her out. She ran away before I could even get the words out of my mouth. I took this as an ultimate defeat and basically stopped trying to make an effort and basically had a “she don’t fuck with me, I won’t fuck with her” attitude and I just became cold and distant. This girl has a history of depression and anxiety and because I got to her for her real self, I kinda fell in love with the real her but didn’t want to admit it. It pained me not speaking to her but I told myself it was for the best. 

I realized the only reason why she kept answering me was because I was always the one among the effort to call, FaceTime and check up on her while everyone else just left her alone. I stopped calling and FT and started to get to know other women and started going out with a couple and things started going south. Mind you I was finally getting over her and doing me and she hits my phone saying “I need to talk to you, I’ve had something to tell you for a long time but call me whenever you have the chance.” 

I call and when she picked up, she started rambling about how her life is going this that and the third. Before I would of given her my full undivided attention but I had an epiphany. I was her “information dump,” I kinda got tight and hung up the phone. She then texted me saying “you’ve been distant and idk what’s going on” to which I replied “I’m just giving my attention to people and things who are going to keep me happy in the long run”

She made no remark to ask what I meant and then proceeded to send another long ass paragraph about her day/situation. Again I gave no response and that’s when her best friend had to come and tell her what’s really going on but by that time I gave no fucks and was over with her and seeing a future with her. Her best friend, Rennie, contacted me telling me about what she had done and I simply had no emotion or a response. I was so over this girl and the 9-11 months that I’ve wasted that I didn’t care for a response. Rennie then told me that she( girl I had an interest in) never got the intention that I wanted something more. But she then proceeded to bash me saying that “I’m not relationship material, I am immature” and much more. I took those words like bullets but still didn’t give a reaction.

56,owlpod1920,1609390808,1,"Needed to vent and seek a bit of advice I don't know of it belongs here. Please delete if it doesn't. I just had to talk to someone about this. I am  27 F pansexual. I have been with guys and I have been with girls. There have been some decent people and there have been absolute fucks. In this year from hell I was doing fine, there have been one or two casual relationships. But I was very content with myself. This is the year I decided to not get into an arrange marriage (it's common in where I live) and made up my mind that I don't want kids. Between cooking, learning new things and gazillion video calls like everyone else I was fine. Then came a boy.

I had known him for a while and then a work trip changed everything. I was attracted to him to the point of felt like I was a teenager again. There was something about him that felt simple. He was a simplistic guy who shared the same vission about life. He was kind, down to earth  street smart, smart enough to know his way around. He was a good friend, kinda meme buddy, we could laugh at each other's poor jooks like litte kids. I felt more authentic around him. He always texting me first when we were just friends. We spoke about our endgoals in life and we have lots of things in common (eg... Not wanting kids). After a long time I felt something genuine for someone and I completely fell for him.

There were multiple instances when it seemed like he might have felt the same way. So after flirting and seeing how things go for two months I finally told him how I felt. He was taken by surprise and told me that he hadn't seen me in that way. But he wanted to give this a shot. Told me wants to take some time. I was over the moon initially. But things changed drastically. He became extremely cold. He wouldn't text first. Stopped sending memes. Would give generic replies when I tried to make convo. It went to become from this to one word replies to single letter at one point. This time around I asked him if he's not into it, should just spit it out. I am not in for this half assed thing. Will be fine just being friends. He again assured that he wants to meet and give this a shot. However while I asked him out a few times in the past one month his answer was always something ambiguous as ""let's see"". When I pointed out that he's been terrible at communicating he told it's how he is (he's not, we used to text all day as friends) and he's sorry that I felt bad (what even). Nothing changed. At that point I knew it was never going to go anywhere.

Since then I have been treating him with the aloofness he has been showing me for the past one month. He's been replying to my texts taking the exact amount of time I took to reply. If it's 10 mins from me, same from him. I am really tired of all these. I guess he wouldn't make up his mind and say no. I could really use a rejection right now. Just tell me that you're not into me and I will be done. If he had done it in the first place I wouldn't have minded at all. I valued our friendship more than anything. But now it's been annoying and I feel like played on. I lost my friend in the process.

Someone gave me a really good relationship advice that don't go for the nice guy and look for the actual good guys. Know the distinction between the two. I want to learn from the past and meet someone good in 2021.Less drama a simple relationship for a change. My friend's advice came as an eye opener. Maybe he's been a nice guy and not a good guy. Maybe I was projecting my idea of him. All these have me questioning everything. Maybe what I thought was genuine humbleness maybe it was just tactical workplace politeness. Because when the power structure changed, as I confessed he went from nice guy to not so nice guy.

Next year I want to make better choices and not jump into anything. I hope to learn the difference between nice guys and good guys and someday I find someone who would give me their time and cherish my company.

Right now after a long time I am aware of my loneliness and it's a not a great feeling. All of my friends are in relationships and some of them have even started to move in together. Visiting my friends this time I was painfully aware that I am the third wheel and my life's gonna be pretty lonely. I hope I will find my rhythm back and not descend into depression.

I guess I made this post because I had to get this off my chest. I felt very stupid for a while, blamed myself fr catching feelings and in for not listening to my closest friends about not confessing my feelings to this guy. I felt very strange at points because there were times when I was depressed and he offered to be there for me. Telling me that it's ok to talk to him about these things. And then the same guy turning cold and simply replying ""there there"" when I tried opening up to him this time around. Something did not add up. This guy who would talk about our favourite movies and stuff till 2am and tell me that he can still go on when I would say we should get some sleep, now when I watched a movie he had been asking me to watch for months, his reply was ""O"". A single fucking letter. And I thought I was going crazy catching feelings for this guy while he might have never actually liked me even on the basic level.

I guess I am seeking advice on how to be normal again. Not see this life as a lonely one where I would come back home to an empty apartment after work. Right now life, it feels fucking long and difficult to make through.

64,anonanon583,1609388985,1,"Big fat trigger warning! ⚠️ 

So this is where I’m at without talking about past experiences/events that have happened to me because I don’t wanna throw that in here and also there are a lot of different ones and I don’t want this post to be super long.

Every so often I think back to what a girl at school once told me. “Some people are meant to be alone” she was saying this in regards to me being single. Sure it was hurtful but the more I think about this (this was literally years ago) the more I think it’s true. 

Not only does no one I like ever feel the same, I also can’t keep friendships with people who socially attract me. I genuinely don’t know the last friendship I was secure in. I met someone this year who I thought was my friend but I tried helping her when she was in an abusive relationship and after she broke up with him, she said that she understood why I called the police on her abusive boyfriend (who literally raped her) but she didn’t feel she could trust me or continue the friendship. I did it because I felt I had to as I’m an adult and she was 17 (legally a minor) so I felt it was my duty to report it.

Separate from that friendship, I have a lot of my own problems. I’m in desperate need of mental health support but that won’t happen till covid isn’t as much of an issue so I can see my (to be) therapist in person.

I’m not able to socialise. I get told I can be too much/needy, inappropriate or too blunt. But I haven’t been seeing people for pretty almost 4 years and that’s not hyperbole, I have only left my house a handful of times in that time and people never message me first so I don’t get any interaction. I have a fuck ton of trauma, I’m not in a great or even good situation and I’ve never received the help I’ve needed. So it’s no wonder that I’m not good at this shit, I struggle with select mutism and as a child I had a stutter and at times when I’m stressed or nervous (which doesn’t take much) I’ve noticed it sometimes comes back. Also if that wasn’t enough to leave me a complete fucking mess I also have autism and while I don’t think it’s something to be cured or anything, it does complicate things a bit.

Suicidal thoughts are something I struggle with and have for years but I’m not usually an impulsive person and I have no plans to so I’m not sure I’m at risk at the moment but that has fluctuated in the past and I doubt that’ll stay the same forever.

Also there’s all my previous post about a girl I dated this year (this was the most eventful year still not much actually happened I guess but in comparison a lot happened)

So yeah in conclusion no one I find romantically/sexually attractive feels the same. People I’m socially attracted to don’t seem to want anything to do with me and this all leads me to believe that some people (in this case me) are meant to be alone.

Basically, I’m always crushing on someone whether they be a classmate or a celebrity. Every crush I’ve had is with a guy I’ve never spoken to, so I’m only obsessed with the idea of him instead of who he really is. I kind of know I’m still not emotionally ready for a relationship, but I still like to fantasize about being with someone. Recently I’ve been watching this ‘90s sitcom and there was this actor who was around my age at time of filming who I thought was very good-looking. I spent a couple hours googling articles and reading interviews about him, and found out he is more deep than his television character portrays and he enjoys doing the same things I do. Now for the past week all I can do is fantasize about being with him, which is pretty ridiculous considering the fact that he’s in his 40s now and there’s no way I’d even be able to meet him and form a relationship with him. But all I can do is imagine him in his younger days and me being his girlfriend. I don’t know how to break out of this spell.

76,memories_torn_apart,1609384297,1,"I’m recalling back to some time ago, during my sophomore year, and it was during my Chemistry class. It was during a lab, and I remember my two lab partners (I didn’t know them, but they knew each other well) were just casually talking about sex, and like with a clear level of familiarity. Now perhaps they were just bloviating but they weren’t exactly that type, I knew for a fact both of them had GFs and a active social life, but it struck me. And I think it was because I very much thought, “No one is actually having sex or ‘serious’ relationships this early on in life, right?” But this snippet of a conversation I overheard completely blindsided me for some reason, and I was just left feeling, “Oh no, normal people do actually do that sort of thing.” But it was only a sample size of two, so I buried the thought for a while. My day wasn’t ruined or anything, I’m not a hopeless romantic type, I don’t really seriously care for that sort of thing right now, but it made me think that I’m so inwardly focused that I didn’t even consider it a possibility that people would get up to that sort of stuff at this stage in life. To even write it out feels weird. I thought it was a thing in media alone. And I admit I like to overhear conversations, not in a creepy stalker way, I just like that sort of thing, I’ve always done it, and I could never tell you why. And I started to pick up on this sort of stuff more and more. Peers casually talking about their relationships and private lives, the type of thing I didn’t think anyone actually did, and even more basic stuff, like hanging out with friends and planning things after school, or even more intricate events. For example, I never thought real people did things like “sweet 16”s, but then I overhear a bunch of people actually planning them and having really detailed ideas and invite lists and who’s going and who’s not, etc. I was floored again, I never thought they were real things. And hilariously when my school was forced to shut down not too long ago when peers were hosting packed parties (COVID and all that), my first thought was “wait, kids actually have parties? And an amount not so insignificant that they actually had to shut down the school?” And I think after a while I was forced to realized that real, normal people have actually pretty active and healthy social lives, and I that I had previously dismissed this stuff as “fake” as a coping mechanism in order to make myself feel less weird. I don’t think I’d really want any of their lives or that I’m jealous, but I’ve been left just emptier. I feel like I’m on a different plane of existence, where even the idea that people even just planning to meet with friends casually seems like a mythical idea, when in reality it’s the normal way to be (outside of this year, ofc). My cope has been proven to be a complete placebo, if that makes sense.

End rant, I’m not even sure if there was a real point to this or if it’s even coherent. It probably comes across as helplessly juvenile, my apologies.",lonely,"Did anyone else think that ‘real’ people don’t actually do much, and then get proven very wrong?",2020-12-31 14:11:37

This year has been the worst. Since i remember myself i have always been a bit sad but i didn’t think anything about it. Last year i changed shools and i had to make new friends. I lost my only friends because of my mental health problems, i started to feel left out and like im not fitting in this group anymore, even we where friends for at least 10 years. To one of the girls i told everything i thought about, how i felt left out and missunderstood.). I said that i didn’t like how she acted and other stuff. After that she called everyone and turned against me. She told them that im not normal. (There where multiple times that we went out and i felt really sad or ignored. When i quietly left they always were super meant to me about that but i just didn’t want to ruin their night.) They always were so fun and everything but since we changed schools they started to act different.  In new school i made few friends but they sometimes make fun of me- they comment negative things on my clothes, they sometimes make negative comments about my looks- like im not pretty and why i would thought that im pretty enought for that boy. I of course ignored that and always tried to be nice to them. Even when they were annoying- i never said anything ,but if i did something wrong, they would make me feel bad about it. As they have a lot bigger following on social media they didn’t include me in photos or posted pics where i looked bad. Every boy likes them but im just like the ugly friend. Im 17 and no one has even once asked me out or anything. I never thought of myself as being ugly but now... im not so sure anymore. I try so hard everyday to look good and im nice to everyone. Since quarantine, nobody has been wanting to talk to me. They only hmu when they need homework or something from me. I want to leave them but i know that they are gonna turn everyone against me. I really don’t have any real friends and i don’t wanna miss out on my teeneger years. I know that when im gonna be older i will be sad that i missed out on those years but i really don’t have anyone. For the past 2 years im always at my home, crying every day. I even haven’t been to invited to any party.

Feeling lonely today so was looking up psychology stuff online and came across a post (it's a review of a big study) that shows loneliness makes pain worse. Then there at the end also saying could go in the other direction too. 

In my case, I have anxiety and depression, which sometimes comes out in physical ways, like I get back and shoulder pain when I feel distress, which makes it hard for me to go out and socialize. But also when I feel alone, somehow either I become aware of the pain or the pain gets worse, but it's such a strange thing. Like if I listen to the pain, it seems so real, but if I'm around some people who are validating and kind and make me feel I matter and I kind of forget myself and somehow the pain is just gone.

Don't know if any of you also noticed the pain/loneliness connection....

I (20/m) have been lonely since my first days, I just have one friend, I have never had a relationship, I have never kissed a girl, never held hands etc. I constantly think about how amazing it would be to have that special girl that I love and that loves me, and I create scenarios in my head, often involving girls I talked to once or twice but only brief. You know, stuff like we hang out together, we fall in love, happily ever after, maybe even get married one day. I feel ashamed because of that. I'm such a pathetic loser, the desire for a girlfriend drives me crazy, and the fact that I create these scenarios involving various girls I have absolutely no reason to think they are into me, makes me feel like a joke.

I am constantly alone, always on my own.
I don't know if I classify as depressed yet.
I just feel like shit every day, so much that  feeling a little less shit has become my definition of joy by now.
I can't even cry, I tried a few times, I thought it would be a release to all the misery I have bottled up inside me, but I just can't. I just sit there and stare.

I don't know if I can keep it up much longer. I still find refuge in books and music, but when I can't distract myself, I am back on my schedule of being miserable basically 24/7.

I don't know what to do. I suck at anything social, I can't make conversation with strangers for shit, I constantly struggle with myself over anything I do.

I have thought of telling my friend about everything but I feel like that would completely fuck up everything between us, that she would see me with different eyes, like I'm broken, a raw egg that she has to be careful with all the time. I feel like our friendship would be based more upon my desperate need for any human contact and her pity for me.

Citing the need to nap and recharge and read, or rest before and after working overtime. She was an introvert, and in our last year together, I ended up seeing her 4 - 5 days a month. Weeknights, when we used to do an hours video chat (we lived 50 miles apart), suddenly she was busy, napping or reading and ""unavailable. I was also getting excluded from her family events months before we were to get married.

There is a Robin Williams quotation, "" I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.""

So I used to on PlentyOfFish dating site, create a fake account with fake pictures of a handsome younger man, and locate me thousands of miles away, or in England or Australia, just so I would have someone to chat with. And it worked. It took the edge off the loneliness. Native email messaging was all that took place. The personality behind my fake account was real. 

After she set me up and finally broke up with me, calling me selfish (Don't even go there, the imbalance of who did what for whom cannot be measured), and the pain of losing her wore off, I pieced many things together and am certain she was regularly cheating on me. Like she cheated on all her ex's. Body language plus carelessness on her laptop and other electronic signatures proved it.

Not in a relationship now. Not for a year since my last ex (the one after the one I mentioned) left me March 2019, returned November 2019, only to leave again for her secret lover she had left me for the first time.

My girlfriend has asked we go on a break because things are so difficult at the moment, and I have no family to talk to because they are so toxic (I've had to fight to not fall back on them because of how detrimental to my mental health it will be). My few friends are with family so are unavailable to talk to, and obviously they can't help with the intimacy issue.

Could you please make suggestions and help me work out what I can do in the evenings (on my own preferably) to keep myself from feeling so lonely, anxious, and low?

In school I was always an outcast though at least in high school I didn't get picked on. I got used to having online friends but those friendships are usually quite temporary.

When I moved countries for university things changed. Suddenly I was in groups that accepted me and liked me. I felt a freedom I never did before ein expressing myself. I even have a group of friends of 3 years now.

Im tired of them though. None of them ever message me first. When I ask to hang out online and play games the evening no one is usually free. When I do see them in the voice chat they never think to message me to hang out.

For the past few months it's mostly been me organising a weekly hangout but I'm tired of being in charge. Im in an earthquake hit area for the past few days and for the last 6 months I've been in a country where I don't have any friends anymore. Im tired of putting in all the effort. I even had a stressful breakdown in the group chat the other night and no one even checked up on me today.

I feel like Im alone in a crowd where everyone just goes by the motion of asking if you're okay out of politeness rather than care.

I can't even go find friends in my area because of covid and the fact I'll probably move soon.

But... I've never loved anyone or felt loved in a romantic way. When I think it might be the right time, I just end up realizing this might not be the person I want to be with. I always try to be honest with girls, and I always tell them I have no feelings. I'm my biggest obstacle, but... I don't even know why. Why does it never click? Why can't I find the right one?

129,codecrunchie,1609352205,1,"Hello, and very berrry new year! This project matches people up based on answers to 28 questions. Basically you choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28 questions, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. For example you could say you're looking for people from **Europe**, who are **16-25**, who '**maybe/yes**' are willing to do **voice calls**, and they're also **studying**. Also quite handy, there is a filter to not match with ""*low effort*"" (based on word count) users.

What is the final result? The algorithm searches over 3000 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get around 20-40 **matches** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

The last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

For me, during this period, everyone is spending their time with their family. But my family is dysfunctional so we’re actually not close. I have depression which caused me to drift away from close friends; or whatever close friends I have left already have plans with their loved ones. So I’ll be spending New Year’s alone this year. To try to make New Year’s less crappy, I decided to book a stay at a hotel nearby for a staycation, just to get out of the house. Because I don’t really have much to do since everyone is away and because of COVID, the only productive thing I can do is some work tasks. Other than that I’m just whiling my time away on social media cos this is the best “social interaction” I can get for now. 

On New Year’s Eve, I’m going to pack a few snacks and a drink, head to the rooftop of the hotel, Netflix until midnight and watch the fireworks from the hotel rooftop.

162,noctiva-,1609324980,1,"Hei all, I'm trying to figure out how to deal with the fact that I'm isolated and alone, missing human contact. Trying to figure out what is a healthy approach, what isn't. 

So here's my question: What mechanisms have you found to manage when the loneliness hits hardest? And which coping mechanisms do you think are good/ healthy, which ones are bad (at least in the long run)?

Myself, I have a few coping mechanisms/ things that help me deal.

Healthy ones: I got myself a weighted blanket and, after a 2 week period of getting used to it, I sleep better/ wake up less/ have less nightmares. I can highly recommend that. When I feel very down, I run while listening to upbeat(-ish) music, it makes me feel better about myself (downside: you can only run so many hours in a day, and I've done days where I literally run for 6-7 hours, no joke).

Unhealthy ones: I go through periods where I overeat, and then through periods where I undereat. My sleeping rhythm is totally shot, thought I TRY to go to bed and get up at consistent times, I often times don't have the energy to stick to it. I drank in the beginning, but I gave that up by now. 

Undecided: I talk to myself, I can crack myself up for hours. I also daydream a lot, I've always done these escapism scenarios in my head since I was a kid where I imagine that I'm cared for, part of a community, that I have a goal, a place where I belong and someone who loves me. It helps in the moment, but I think long-term that is really not a good thing (indicates that I'm losing touch with reality slowly?). I listen to ASMR (... Yato, anyone?). It's nice to hear someone say that I'm wanted, that I'm cared for, asking how my day was. Also not healthy in the long-term I think, but it's my only 'human contact', if I can call it that (except for the postman and the cashier, saying 'Thank you and have a lovely day!'). 

Any recommendations? Any insights on what to try to cope better? Maybe, if we pool our knowledge, we can at least support each other that way.  

I know it sucks to be alone, but maybe we can feel less alone by knowing that we aren't alone in being alone, if that makes sense. Thanks for reading and feel hugged!",lonely,How do you deal when the loneliness hits hardest/ what coping mechanisms have you developed?,2020-12-30 21:43:00

I graduated high school,quit all hard drugs, quit drinking, quit pointless sex, quit nicotine even and got my money together kind of. I was hurting cause of some childhood trauma (suicidal mom with anger issues but she loved us and I can’t blame her plus I was the rock), then abandonment issues from that and also when my ex cheated on me with my best friend and my whole friend group left me too. I think I understand psychology and emotions pretty well and can see clearly the only reason I’m lonely is a lack of effort. I know I could have more close friends and a girlfriend if I tried. It’s not even a self esteem issue I’m just busy right now. What confuses me is every once in a while when I’m especially alone and undistracted I’ll feel into my loneliness and it hurts in a good way. It’s like remembering love is so bittersweet it hurts, but it’s so strong I’m almost addicted to it. It feels like that’s the only time I let myself really feel, and all this emotion I think I deal with every day is muffled and weak. I don’t like admitting it to myself cause I need to be strong and not give up but I’m scared that maybe im subconsciously handling it wrong. I thought I could put off love and happiness until I get my life together but I’m almost going numb. The nostalgia is warm and I physically feel it.

i also get sad thinking about the fact that we might stop talking sooner than later anyways because this is our senior year, and so obviously he’ll be going to college up north in our state so that sucks for me...

I thought that my childhood friends would stay in touch, that i would pursue hobbies and enjoyments, that i would grow out of video games and being alone, that i would progress Spiritually and feel happier, that i would be motivated to better myself, that i would love and care for my family. Instead I'm playing the role of a conversation initiator who can't seem to make any solid connections with anyone and won't accept myself for who i am, constantly arguing internally whether what I'm thinking Is my heart or my head and which is right as the clock goes around and around. I'm still young, i still got time, it's true. But what does that matter if I have the want to get better but not the motivation to do it. If I can't make the first step I won't make the last.

Every now and then I get flickers of color and senses back to me but the comfort of being disconnected comes again. I regret so much but have lost the ability to feel the guilt.

All people want is their own greedy desires, and I'm no exception. I always think of only my schedule and my problems, but my want to help others isn't enough to out weigh my discouragement. Every try to better myself has resulted in nothing or worsening, and even if I objectively get better i certainly don't feel it.

idk why im doing it, i feel like i deserve better friends, and honestly? i do. they are never there for me. i know they have shit of their own going on but so i do and i’m still there for them. 

time and again, they hurt me. i’m just so disappointed. i feel so misunderstood by everybody i know the problem lies with me too but i just need someone who would just listen to my POV without judging me. 

i have an amazing boyfriend and yet i feel so lonely. is that normal? i don’t know. i am just isolating myself and leaving everyone so that they can’t do it to me. i love them a lot but i don’t think i deserve this treatment. i understand that i’ll be left with no friends after this but i guess that’s a price that i’ll have to pay. my family is loving but have grown to be really toxic during the pandemic idk if i can blame them, this year has been hard on everyone. 

i just feel so exhausted. i feel depressed. i’m constantly trying not to self harm, it’s really difficult but i’m trying. im just tired of getting disappointed all the time. 


i wish i could be a better girlfriend. my boyfriend deserves much better than me and i try to be better but i have so many mental health issues, it drags me down. i tried to break it off but he was adamant. it just made me feel 1000x worse. i don’t deserve him. i feel like he does so much for me i feel guilty all the time. he changed so much just because he wants to be with me and i really appreciate that but i also feel so bad constantly that he had to do it. i don’t feel like i’m worthy of that effort. obviously, i would have done the same for him but i’m just trash. i struggle so much with my mental health and i feel so embarrassed telling him about it even tho he’s always listening he’s always there i just don’t know. he doesn’t struggle with mental health issues so he doesn’t completely understand what i’m going through but sometimes i feel like i project my negative emotions onto him and i just don’t know how to live with that. i feel so lost. 

i want to be alone but i also want to be with people who understand me at the same time. 

i feel like i’m whining about nothing i’m sorry. i just don’t know what to do with myself. i feel so betrayed by my friends. i didn’t open up to anyone but i did to them and yet i get this treatment. this entire year, my bestfriend ignored me or just made it about himself when i was upset. he made me feel even more terrible than i was already feeling. he always chose other people over me even when it was really obvious that i needed someone to be there for me. i know that he has issues of his own but so do i and i was still there for him. i always thought that he understood me but i guess he didn’t. i am just sad.

""What are we right now?"". Your response to that question shattered my heart. You said you were uncertain about making “us"" a thing because of the possibility of long distance relationship and of how busy you might get when school starts. Then, why did you approach me in the first place? Why did you flirt with me? Why did you tell me you liked me? Why did you tell me you want me? I have been waiting so patiently the past 9 months, hoping you would ask me to be yours one day. I did not wait and spend all this time and effort on you just to get that response you gave me last night. If you had known this wouldn't have worked out, why didn't you just stop talking to me instead of having me find out myself? I have grown to like you a lot dear, like a lot a lot. Before I met you, I was broken because of how my ex treated me but you made me believe again. I thought you wanted us. But last night made me realize I've been stupid this entire time and been too naïve. Shouldn't have believed. I hate myself for believing, for giving my first times to you when you didn't feel the same, for imagining how jealous others would be when they see how we make an amazing couple. This hurts. Man, my tears keep rushing out of the corners of my eyes as I am typing this. They won't stop. They won't listen to me... just like how my heart refuses to forget you even after I figured what you have done. I am not sure if I am ready to forget you just yet. I kind of just want to pretend that you are still here, everything is still the same, and I still get the justification to miss you. Before my heart decides to forget, I just want to say that I really miss the way your eyes look at me, the way you kiss me so passionately, the way you hold me in your arms as I listen to your heartbeat, the way I have been waiting to say I love you but never got a chance to.

Or maybe she does think about that kind of stuff but just doesn't say anything. I've gotten to know her and it feels like it's gonna end up being pointless, wasted feelings.

When we're together, it seems like he's occupied with everyday burdens and i'm occupied with angsty emotions, so we're both more into our heads rather than actually enjoying eachother's company. 

We're very open with eachother and we've talked about this. He straight up told me he's not sure if he can care for another person right now because his life is currently a mess, and he feels it's better to sort it on his own so as not to hurt anybody. 

Sometimes I feel that I have no problem with my feelings not being fully reciprocated, so I reassure him that I'm there for him and that I don't mind him fumbling with his contradicting desires of sorting his life or staying on his bullshit or keeping distance or not missing out on all the pussy.
But other times, I get bitter when he doesn't respond to my feelings and also jealous when he mentions other girls.

Usually i pester him about it playfully but sometimes bitterness, need, lust and fear get the best of me and I would get really clingy and emotional. It makes me feel guilty because I keep assuring him that I'm fine with whatever feelings his sweet but rusty heart could give at the moment, then I come back nagging and crying to him when he's already burdened enough.

I came to believe that there are no rules to sharing love and support. The world's already shitty enough and people are already numb and distant enough, so I thought even the slightest feelings and the shortest moments are worth sharing. 
Better than nothing, right?

303,LordHamingston,1609252930,1,"I am usually a very bubbly person, outgoing, friendly. I am not the center of attention at a party but I am able to socialize and I have my handful of good friends.   
This year, with 31 years, I fulfilled my dream and opened my own theater school. I always wanted it but I was too afraid of the financial risk. But then as I got older I thought ""Man, you only have one life, if you screw it up, then at least you know it didn't work. But you will never wonder what if"".   


I opened in February 2020... it started better than I ever expected. My classes filled up I also met a woman I fell for in Februrary. In March I had to close down due to covid.   
That closing down, social distancing and financial worries changed me a lot. I gained a lot of weight, became lazy but also connected more and more with that Woman and we got together.   
So this ""honeymoon-phase"" overshadowed most of my other feelings and worries. Like you can imagine.   


I started classes back up in June. I felt good. I was working and had purpose. My relationship also developed.   


I had to close down again in November (still closed)... I focused a lot on my relationship and noticed that she is drifting away. I tried to cling to her and work more to make her happy. But she left and is gone.   


Now I am sitting at home. And I notice, nope it is not only the heartbreak that hurts, it is also that I don't have a purpose. I can't work. I can't meet people. I get up, shower (if I have the energy), eat, browse reddit, chat to a few people and repeat. My savings are slowly drained. My friends are mostly social distancing and either staying with their families or their partners. Gyms, bars and everything is closed.   


I miss the guy I was one year ago. I was single and happy with it. I enjoyed being by myself. My mind was clear. Right now I feel restless. Like I want to have something to do, but the thing I love (to teach theater) is just now allowed and no one knows when it is going to be allowed again.

We instantly clicked, I was happy to be with her and she was happy to be with me. Literally no issues or complaints between us except for the one glaring issue that hasn't changed. It's been a long distance relationship. 

The issue stemmed from how I felt about it first. My relationship before this one was long distance too. I fucking hated it, but that whole relationship was fucked for more reasons than just that. But with this girl, that was the only downside.

I left her because someone who lived only a few minutes away from me took an interest with me, and I thought all I wanted was to try to see how it would go, to see if maybe I can be happy knowing that the relationship would be ""easy"" since they live so close. I tried it for 3 months before I decided to go back because I knew that if I let her go, it was going to be one of the biggest regrets of my life... And she took me back when she didn't have to.

Present day now, it's reversed. She found someone who took an interest in her who lives close and shes leaving me because she wants to see if she can find happiness without me. 

I'm telling her that I know exactly how she feels and that I deserve this for doing the same to her. But now all I'm wondering is if shell come to the same conclusion I did. 

Obviously more to it than that, but that's the gist. And far as I know, shes telling telling me the exact same feelings I had when I left her. So there's no doubt in my mind she wasn't happy to be with me. Long distance just fucking sucks.",lonely,Do you think she'll come back?,2020-12-29 21:20:29

We continued talking in the next few months and were working things out when she ghosted me in the spring. I then hooked up with my ex from before her a few times later this summer and fall. That also harshly and abruptly ended. 
They are 2 of the only 3 women I've ever even slept with. I have been trying to move on and date for basically the first time in my life, and i have no idea what I'm doing. It seems i hardly even get matches on dating apps and I'm not very good at making interesting conversation when i do. I'm basically so nervous about my inexperience dating that it takes me seemingly forever to write a simple message or reply.This has been going on most of this year. 
I don't even have friends to meet people through anymore, as they all mostly got married or moved when i was in those relationships.

333,n8zgr88,1609227638,1,"Hey this is my first time posting on here i need to vent. Im q 20 year old male. I have social anxiety, aspbergers syndrome, some depression, and possibly adhd. Perhaps my biggest issue is how I feel things. I feel everything, the slightest insults, the slightest change in tone from someone, someone leaving me on read, it all causes me pain. I don't think feeling is an issue, but why does it have to hurt so much? I grew up homeschooled and I've lived in several different states throughout my life, so that combined with the mental health problems means I don't have many friends. I also tend to attract the wrong kind of friends, the kind who like to put their emotions on people. Manipulative, selfish, toxic, users. I've cut off so many people this year since i started healing its not even funny. My mental health is getting better, im alot better off than I was last year at this time, but I'm still in pain all the time. 
I wake up depressed and sad, go to work at a warehouse for 8 hours, get home at midnight, go to bed, get up, and do the same thing again. I'm so fucking drained all the time I never have any energy. I spend most weekends stressing about stuff I need to do but don't have the energy or motivation to do, and I don't even do stuff I enjoy because I'm too busy stressing or being depressed. 
I live with parents who have narcissistic tendencies, they are also super religious and raised me and my sisters up that way, which is another reason I don't have many friends. I've always been the ""weird kid"" it seems every where I go im excluded and left out, its very rare that I can actually connect with someone.
I have a best friend who used to live next door to me. He's basically a brother to me, he struggles with his msna health too and we talk alot. But he moved down to Florida and he doesn't like to text and we barely call. 
The reason I'm sad at the moment is this other friend of mine, who ill call ""C"". I met her at church back in 2016 and we barely talked. I later found out she had a crush on me but before I could act on it she left the church. She was struggling with her mental health and was in a bad place. She is fairly similar to me, she suffers from anxiety, depression, ptsd, she's autistic, and we have similar personalities.
I started up contact with her again last year and caught feelings. It was pretty bad, id text her all the time, stalk her profile, all that type of stuff. She found out and didn't like it so she blocked me and that was that.
But then two months ago we started talking again and our relationship grew a ton. We talk about our mental health to each other all the time and have good conversations with each other. Shes really understanding and empathetic and she's been through similar stuff as me so I can talk to her about stuff.
Im sad because I really want to connect with her more and be really good friends, but she's kind of distant and emotionally unavailable at times. I've tried to get her to hang out many times and she always cancels last second or just doesn't text back. She talks to me but I feel like whenever there's a chance she has to commit to something she won't do it. Her boundaries are a mile high.
 She doesn't seem to value my time either, she'll start conversations and then just stop texting in the middle of it and not talk to me for days. I get sad as fuck every time, or angry as fuck. I understand she has mental health issues though which has something to do with her flakiness and I know she's hurting just like me.
I guess I'm just sad we don't talk more. It sounds really pathetic, but she's my favorite person to talk to at the moment and I get so happy whenever she messages me.
I know she's not trying to hurt me, I've told her how I feel and she's explained how her mental state affects her communication, like sometimes she doesn't want to talk to anyone. I get that, I just wish it wasn't that way. I know I can't be mad at her, I guess I'm just sad that things aren't how I want them to be. I need to just accept our relationship as it is and not expect too much from her. I tend to do that with people. 
Were strictly friends, by the way, she has a bf and im not interested in dating her. I don't know what I should do, I enjoy talking to her but she barely texts and when she doesn't I get sad. I hate that she affects my emotions so much but she does. 
Maybe I should take a step back to reevaluate things. That might help.
Also I want to get out and meet more people, but with covid and all and depression/anxiety its hard. 
Sorry for the long ass post, but it felt good to get that off my chest.

334,BadHabitsDieYoung,1609227413,1,"As I was sitting on my couch after another Christmas letting my food settle I realised something. I stopped envisioning my future with someone else in it. 

The thought left me somewhere along the line and I didn't notice. Often I will find myself sitting quietly just trying to get a mental picture of how I hope my life to go. Where I'm living, what I'm doing, but the thought I used to have of my perfect partner wasn't there anymore and I don't know when I stopped thinking of it. It just left and I now when I try to imagine it it feels like it shouldn't be there. Somehow I've conditioned myself to leave it out and I think it's my subconscious protecting me because I'm almost 40 and I've been single my whole life. Every attempt I've made to find someone and to try and show that person my worth has failed. 

Now I'm just blank when it comes to finding a partner and I'm not sure if I should be concerned or if I should just accept it. Tbh, I feel no emotion towards not having the thought anymore so maybe I should just let it be. 

Does anyone else feel this way or have I had some sort of break in my thought process?

My sister just got in a relationship with one of our bestfriend (male) and I see them texting each other everyday and having fun together. They also hang out at our home pretty often. Don't get me wrong, I love seeing my sister happy, but it makes me really lonely. When I'm with them it's pretty much just me being sort of a 3rd wheel, i'm in my room doing my things, but I just feel like a burden sometimes.  I think they would probably be better without me.

In my head it sounds really mean and selfish, but I kinda envy her sometimes. I just wish I could have someone who I could speak everyday with. Just tell my problems without fearing any judgment, where we could share our favorite stuff together and and just not feel like I'm bugging them. 

I go to a music school and I just learned recently  that a guy who goes to that same school is a friend of my sister's bf (aka bestfriend). I texted him , but I didn't really started a conversation and stuff. I just don't know how the heck I can start a friendship with him. I just suck at speaking with people. I just don't know how to do it. I'm just scared that he don't wanna be my friend and just making a fool out of me. I don't wanna look like I'm looking for attention as well.

 But when they do, even if they gave off romantic vibes at first, they always say something like ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" or ""I don't want to date anybody at all anymore."" and thus we drift apart. And EVERY time so far, they're in a relationship a few weeks or a couple months after saying this to me.

Do girls really just not want to date me when they find out what I'm like? They all ultimately offer to be friends but clarify there's no romantic future between us.

My brother has had a GF for a little over a year now.
Don't get me wrong I am really happy that they are happy, but he was about my only friend, he was my best friend.

I rarely see him nowadays. We both live at home still, but 90% of the time he is at her place. The only times he does come home he just comes to grab something from his room. We rarely hang out. On top of that due to quarantine I don't hang out at all with the few friends that I did have besides my brother (also almost everyone else is cuffed too). Restaurant I worked at closed because of COVID, no physical education, I basically have no real/meaningful interaction with other humans. It sucks.

On a positive note though, after realizing I have all the time in the world to work on myself now;
- I started working out and gaining weight (I was always very skinny). 
- I eat, somewhat, healthier now.
- Started learning about the stock market/investing (and started actually investing).
- Feeling more motivated to work on college assignments.
- Started learning piano (still struggling, but I see progress)
- Grew a decent beard

I still live in India and I've been working from home since Feb 2020. It's night time in India when I work and this situation along with working from home, has made my minimal social life existence to zero.

I have been successful in making friends in Reddit but they ghost me always. Its not a problem. People have lives and once their emotional need is fulfilled, they abondon me. 

I have depression and I'm in therapy. I follow Stoicism to help protect myself from my depressive thoughts. Never had a girlfriend as I am ugly (Bald in a young age) according to Indian beauty standards. Never approached women in my life as I am always deemed as an old guy because I am bald and fat. 

I signed off women from my life as I firmly know that I don't have the requirements any women seek in their potential BF/Life partner. I lack in physical requirements and financial requirements (I have a well paying job according to Indian standards but was rejected in arranged marriage setups as I did not fit the criteria). Never had a match in dating apps. 

I never thought about emotional requirements of a woman might have because I've never spoken to women properly as I was always ostracized and judged based on my looks.I know I'm a lost cause when it comes to romance but I still believe I have a lot to offer in the lines of friendships with any gender.

I never had friends because I raised myself. I grew up in a broken family, with lots of pain, physical and emotional in nature. 

My only drawback is being an Indian man. And I have been having thoughts about what it would be to be born in a different race that people like. Atleast if I were to be born in a different race, I wouldn't be subjected to negative stereotypes and blantant racism so much so my search for a friend in reddit won't go unanswered.

I simply wanted to share all the life experiences I had, all the good things I admire in nature and in the world and pose curiousity to learn more from another person. Yet I cannot break the barrier of prejudice and racism in reddit and in the general internet.

I still wish the Gods (yes I'm including the Abrahmic deity as well) to magically make my skin to a desired color or wipeout the negative stereotypes that people have against my race, just so I can connect with people from different countries..",lonely,I am not sure I can push forward.

We spent 3 years on and off and then one day she decided that she didn’t want this anymore. I accepted it because I’m an adult but after that moment I let drugs and alcohol control my moods because I couldn’t lift myself out of feeling shitty without them. 

Since the time she left for good, but still kept in contact with me, I have found no one. Her on the other hand had a constant string of partners, boyfriends etc. Me? I haven’t even talked to anyone that wanted my company. I tried dating apps to find someone but all I find is instant sex and never talk again. Yeah that sounds great but it’s not exactly what you want when you’re looking for someone to spend time with. 

I’ve kicked the drug and alcohol problem I had controlling my moods. (Not sober but definitely have the drinking under control and no longer using cocaine) But on Christmas Day I was given a job opportunity that I need to quit smoking pot for so I immediately quit no questions asked. This was probably the worst thing I could of done given the weekend that was coming up. She was getting married. My anxiety has been thru the roof since Christmas Day and I can’t control my feelings right now. All I saw on my Snapchat feed was her brother posting pics of her in a wedding dress and I’m happy for her don’t get me wrong but at the same time my blood is reaching a boil. Not because of her moving on and getting married but because I still struggle with being alone after all this time we haven’t been together and she had no problem getting S/o after s/o. 

People tell me to just keep my head up, but today I’m just deciding to accept that maybe I’m one of those people who aren’t meant to have a person who cares for them. Maybe I blew my shot at this when we broke up. I feel cursed. I’m also one of those people who grew up in a household where a father just tells their son to man up and not show emotion. I bottle all of my stress and anxiety up and explode.

Or to the very least, forget about these peoples' existence.

- There is *something* I do that causes other people to react in a negative way/turns them off. Maybe it is something in my behavior. Maybe it’s because I sometimes act aggressive. Maybe I do something other people think is weird. Maybe I say something that turns people off.

- There is something about my personality that turns people off. Maybe my personal views are a turn off. Maybe the way I interact is a turn off. Maybe my OCD behaviors are a turn off.

- I just don’t fit peoples standard. Maybe I’m not good looking enough, not cool enough, not interesting enough.

I don’t see any of my friends in person anymore and I don’t feel like anyone in my house truly knows who I am. Around them I become strangely happy and fine.

I want to huddle up in a corner and sob just so that I can feel better after. But I haven’t been able to cry for a while and I don’t know why. I hate not having my therapist who I can discuss things with. I feel like I’m going to need a therapist for life because even when I go just a week or two without one my mental health issues start to get worse rapidly. 

I can’t just go out and make friends or be with people. I can’t go to school and make connections with anybody. I can’t do anything anymore all because of a stupid fucking virus that has destroyed what should be one of the happiest times of my life.

I don’t want to remember my teen years as this time where I was depressed and lonely and isolated. I want to remember it as the time I hung out with friends and did dumb stuff while I could.

497,72ak0002,1609145529,1,"I distinctly remember talking to my parents about the fact that I was starting to feel depressed and lonely for the first time. I was just a 12-year old girl; I didn’t grow up super depressed or have to deal with a substantial amount of bullying or anything of the sort. I didn’t have many friends though, or any, really, and that fact started to haunt me as I saw my peers begin to enjoy their early teenage years when I was doing no such thing. I told both of my parents that I was lonely and depressed, and they responded by assuring me that they’d do everything they could to help me and that I would “get through this”. That never happened. I’ve basically began to view that period of time as when I began to discover who I am as a person, which is really depressing, because the reality of who I am is definitely not what I would’ve wanted. A seed was planted then in the back of my mind, a seed that took everything I had with it. It grew and grew until there was nothing else in my mind, just pure nothingness.

I don’t want to say that I have depression, because I don’t know that; I’ve never been diagnosed with it in the few visits to a therapist I’ve done, and I do feel that there is a fundamental difference between what I’ve experienced and what the clinically depressed people I’ve spoken to have told me about, so I really don’t know. What I do know is that I’ve felt like something was wrong for a long time. I can’t say I like who I am as a person very much, to say the least; I’m not sure how much of that is simply a reaction to the things I’ve done and how much is more of just a part of the way my mind works, or maybe that’s a false dichotomy, I don’t know. Whenever I reflect upon any relationship that I’ve had with a person, I tend to assume the worst of my own motivations, thinking that I’m only deluding myself and that I’m really just doing everything for my own selfish gain.

That paranoia, combined with some social anxiety that’s pretty extreme, makes me feel incapable of having any kind of meaningful interpersonal relationships. I talk to others as little as possible at both work and school; I don’t remember what it’s like to carry a conversation with a stranger for more than a minute, and any time I make an effort to go outside of my comfort zone in that regard, the result is usually really awkward, so I’ve stopped bothering.

 I have a couple of good friends that I can talk to, fortunately, but even then, I still feel a profound disconnect, like there’s a proverbial wall that will always divide us no matter what. I’ve never been romantically involved with anyone; I realized recently that the closest I’ve come to having sex is when I was sexually assaulted by another girl, and that realization fucking shattered me. Sometimes I just lay in bed and imagine having a boyfriend, someone that makes me feel loved and comfortable for once, but I know that relationships won’t automatically make you happy, so I avoid directly seeking anything like that out for the time being.

I’m not sure where I’m going with this anymore. I guess I only wanted to share some thoughts I’ve been having here since I don’t have anyone I can talk to about these kinds of feelings. Expressing my thoughts through writing is one of the few things that I always helps, so I wanted to do that.

Due to a girl and I keeping our distance (and now she’s physically far away), I’ve become very lethargic and lazy of late, perhaps even depressed. Everything reminds me of her and I just give into sadness and imagine what it would be like for her to be here. 

Well it just dawned on me: She wouldn’t want me to do that. Obviously people like to be thought of and longed for, but if that became all I was, what would happen to all the good things in me that were attractive to her?

So I need to continue doing good things and becoming better in general. That’s what she would want. 

Obviously my situation involves this girl, but I think this applies to many situations. If you don’t have friends, start living the life that you would want to share with friends, so that when do come into your life, you have something to share. If you are yearning for a romantic partner, do not just sit and yearn romantically, but be the person you want him/her to fall in love. Perhaps there is a particular person you miss: live the life thy would make them happy and I think you will be happier. 

I don’t mean to be critical with this post, but I wanted to share the insight. Certainly I’ve done my share of moping and yearning. At last I have some hope that things can get better.",lonely,Advice: Do what your friend or loved one would want you to,2020-12-28 19:38:55

I’m proud of that because I’ve never truly been alone. In 7th I rushed into a relationship and as soon as one ended, I began the next. This continued until the end of my first semester of college. Now I’m alone and I’m perfectly okay with that and although it crosses my mind sometimes how much I just want to be held by someone, I think about how in the future, everything will be okay.

We both loved each other a lot but also recognized the relationship wasn’t gonna last because we were too different and things had been rocky for some time. Fast forward to late-November and I am absolutely wrecked emotionally. She comes over to what was our apartment (now just mine) and gives me her key, the rest of her halves of the rent, and explains that she is now lesbian and is going out to California in January to see an old co-worker who is also lesbian. This coworker also happened to be our neighbor before moving back to Cali.
So, that brings me to today. I’m suffering more than I probably ever have with loneliness. I’ve made peace with my ex, her choices, and living in this apartment by myself. Well, mostly. It’s not as bad as it was but it still hurts. Anyway, this is my first Christmas in two years being single and it sucked. I had to explain to the family I did see this year that I was no longer with my ex, and I saw way more happy couples online and irl that only exasperated my feelings.
I really just want someone here to talk to. Somebody irl who I can cuddle up with and help me move on from what was. COVID obviously has made this extremely difficult so... I’m turning here. Not really sure what this’ll do for me or how people will react but I just had to get this out in a way that didn’t make me feel like I was bothering what friends I do have.",lonely,Hardest Christmas I’ve gone through so far.,2020-12-28 11:00:49

My mom decided to go smoke and didn’t come back for over an hour. I waited as long as possible and thought about texting, thought about her falling down somewhere but I just had that gut feeling she was being her usual selfish self.

I said, “yea, I put the leftovers away since you were gone a looonnggg time”. 

Her response? 

“Sorry, I got to talk with _____ and ____, the last Christmas calls I wanted to make”. She was smiling and bubbly.

I thought maybe it was because I haven't said anything in a while but I did ask her a question some time ago and she didn't respond. This time I texted her wishing her a happy holidays and she hasn't texted me back. 

My parents are the only people in my life that have cared about me, which is nice but I can't stop thinking about them getting older and how I'll have to move out eventually to be ""independent"". All I can think about is how alone I'll be because I have no friends or extended family that I can talk to or hang out with. 

And it goes without saying that it's been impossible for me to find a boyfriend or get into any kind of relationship. Even if I'm lucky enough to meet someone, I get ghosted after the first date. My mom tells me that I should try to lose weight so I can gain more confidence and I've tried on and off but the only thing that has ever made me lose weight was basically starving myself when I would be too anxious or depressed to eat. 

All I want is just one friend or someone nice to talk to but I can't even make friends online since online relationships are the most fleeting. I've learned that after trying to be friends with people for 10 years online. My longest friendship has lasted a year and he won't talk to me anymore either.

580,ChipmunkSilver8131,1609102841,1,"**What Is A Sayanim ?**  
    The Sayanim is any Jewish person, that can be called on to assist another Jew in any cause. Since birth, the Jewish people have been taught of their superiority... and need for cohesion. The Sephardic Jews are the upper level of the race, and the Ashkenazim, which constitute 95% of all Jews, are the worker parasites of the race. Since the Sephardics first converted the AshkeNAZI, they brainwashed them into the idea that the world is their enemy and their fellow Jew is a ""Quiet Guardian"".

**Who Is A Sayanim?**  
    Every Jewish person is expected to be a potential agent (spy/sayanim), in varying degrees.

**What Will They Do?**  
    If the Jewish people sense a potential threat, the Jewish Sayanim is authorized to commit anything from simple harassment to business ruin, and even multiple murders. The Columbine Massacre was a perfect example. The police knew there were seven people involved, but five students, two sets of parents, one employer and psychiatrists, provided alibis and corrupted evidence.

**Examples:**  
Your Jewish accountant will relay any private bookkeeping info to a Jewish competitor, your friendly Jewish pharmacist will assist your Jewish doctor to poison you, a clerk at VISA will supply your private credit information to anyone, the list is endless.

**Sayanim Indoctrination Starts At Childhood:**  
**Family Life:**  
Jewish children rarely are allowed to play with the gentiles. Around the house the child is constantly bombarded with the word Goy.

**Goy**  
(goyim means cattle/animals), relates to menial occupations. The family maid, nannies, gardener, plumber, etc are referred to as ""The Goy or goyim"".

**Grammar School:**  
A public Jewish school will receive grants, and the best teachers are put in the district. 6th graders at these ""Magnet schools"" are the equivalent of an 8th grader at a normal school. Jewish kid's will always be eligible for the ""Gifted Programs"". Exceptional Jewish children are turned over to the Rabbi for future guidance.

**High School:**  
In heavily Jewish communities the public schools will always have a ""Gifted program"". For those with the resources, they will attend exclusive schools.

**Colleges &amp; Universities:**  
Here is the big payoff. Entrance into the finest schools is assured. All the larger Universities have Sayanims placed in key locations from the Dean to the Admission Officers, to the loans, and the scholarship personnel. Societies, such as Hillel, will shepherd a young Jew throughout his college career.

Jewish professors will always favor the Jewish student. Jewish students make up 30% of the Ivy League, which they credit to their extraordinary IQ's, which is a myth. Law schools, such as Yale, can have an enrollment of 60% +.

**Business World:**  
In any Jewish controlled company, a Jew is given first preference in job interviews. If a Jew is a businessman, he gets preferential treatment on contracts where another Jewish person is involved. Getting a bank loan is a cinch if he is a Jew.

**Government:**  
Jews have lined all government's offices around the planet with their people. (parasitic infestations) ! Student loans get erased if they are a Jew or Jewess. A non-Jew business competitor can have a regulatory agency put on him by these parasites. The Judicial is 40% Jewish and another 35% are minorities they control.

**So What Is Expected Of A Sayanim?**  
The standard Sayanim routine is basically favoring other Jews in ordinary transactions, but the sayanim can be called on to protect any criminal enterprise. From the traffic court Judge to an Appellate Judge - fellow sayanims receive special treatment. The special Sayanim (200,000 of them worldwide but there are probably a lot more now) will be expected to cooperate in any Israeli Mossad (Israel's Secret Service) enterprise including murder, sabotage and any form of Fifth Column activity (does 9/11 ring a bell?). A division of the Mossad ( Katsas) keeps records, and stays in active contact with this group, the Mossad.

The Sayanim (sleeping cells who spy/act for Mossad in the host nation they live in, sometimes pretending to be Christians, Moslems, Israelites, etc.)

592,Chaositek,1609092069,1,"(Warning: non native speaker ahead)

As far as I remember myself I was lonely, I had a friends who found that not inviting and ignoring me is funny, I was always attached to them and to my ex. I am a type of person who loves hanging out with people and I think its annoys them.  People are strange, if you are wanting to be with them they will throw you away, but if you dont give a shit about them, you will become interesting to them.

So I came to conclusion, that I must find something else to free myself from being annoying. I'm working out at home, meditating and reading philosophical books. And I think I'm changing, I started to feel more calm. The more I grow the less I need to be with someone. 

I recon we are attached to things around us to other people to their recognition, emotion, thoughts. Things around us are impermanent we can rely on them, we should focus on whats going on inside us. We are not lonely, we just looking in a wrong direction.",lonely,Loneliness ---&gt; Solitude,2020-12-28 05:01:09
593,FakersPlague,1609091963,1,"41 days ago I deleted all social media because I couldn’t cope seeing someone I loved with someone that’s not me (toxic af I know). I think it was because she was my only chance at not feeling lonely so when she left there was nobody else, she was it. I haven’t spoken to someone that isn’t close family or a stranger on the internet since August. She was the last person I spoke too. Deep down I’m so happy for her, but I’m sad for myself. She was the only person who ever ‘got’ me and I don’t think I will ever find anyone else that does. I don’t know or understand how to connect with people, I have no idea how to make friends or reconnect with old friends. I don’t think that I will ever have anyone again whether it be a friend or a relationship. I logged on Instagram today to see the post that I was dreading, I was dreading it because it signified the end of mine and hers chapter for good, that’s it and there no coming back from it. I think I would be completely okay with it if I had other people but I don’t, I have no one.I don’t blame her, I’m not bitter or angry with her just at myself for letting it get to this point where she was my only way out of loneliness. I knew it would never happen but let myself believe it because I was so desperate for something or someone.
I haven’t had a hug in nearly two years now, I just want to be held, I just want to feel loved, I want to feel worthy of love. I want someone to love and care for me the way I do them.In the last couple of days I’ve come to accept that this will never happen and that it’s time to give up on that dream because I’m only delaying the inevitable.

Within the next few weeks I will more than likely take my own life, I can’t cope with the crushing loneliness anymore I can’t deal with the pain.

607,ventaway95,1609086558,1,"Some people want to be doctors/engineers/astronauts when they grow up, my dream is to be in a loving relationship with the right person, there's nothing more fulfilling than having that special someone by your side who understands, supports and loves you.

However, it came to a point where I realized that, after 25 years of loneliness, 3 failed relationships and watching literally all the people around me getting in and out of loving relationships, I realized that I'm simply dysfunctional when it comes to getting a girlfriend/female friends. Regardless of how much I've achieved (I have a master's degree, an excellent job, I study languages and programming in my spare time and I took up boxing as a sport), this loneliness keeps eating me up inside...

As you might guess, I'm not really that ready to give up on my lifelong dream of getting a girlfriend, it's something that I always wanted and I will never feel complete without it, but I'm CONSTANTLY obsessing about it:

\- I wake up, it's the first thing on my mind

\- I'm studying, it haunts me like crazy

\- I'm training, it's on my mind

\- I take a shower, it's still there

\- I go to bed, I take like 1.5-2 hours to fall asleep because of it. Even when I'm dreaming, I think of it

And I know that this is holding me back, I have an ENORMOUS potential for loads of stuff but my brain isn't cooperating, no matter how hard I try. I know it's time to give up because the pursuit of this dream brought me nothing but sadness and desperation, this are supposed to be the best years of my life and I feel like I'm wasting them going after a dream that I wasn't meant to fulfil.

*My crush is a work colleague who I met circa 5 years ago.* *She had a boyfriend when I first met her, whom she split with 2-3 years later.* *For the last 2.5 years she has been working in a different department and I no longer saw her daily.* *We bumped into each other from time to time and always spoke when we did.* *Despite not having asked her on a date I think she may have known that I was attracted to her as I’ve previously: offered to help her move flat; invited her hiking with friends; and invited her to social events.* *I believe that she’s shown signs of liking me as possibly more than a friend (albeit several years ago): I’ve caught her staring at me on numerous occasions; she once let me know which evenings she was free for after work socials; she laughs at all my jokes; she’s invited me to drinks with her friends and she said she’d like to sit next to me at a works meal.* *Foolishly I didn’t proactively contact her over the last 2.5 years (until now) due to being embarrassed about having put weight on, becoming scruffy in appearance and not being comfortable with myself.*

When I arrived in the park to meet her, a man was sat with her (unexpectedly as she hadn’t mentioned anyone joining us). As I approached she was sat facing me on the right hand side of a picnic blanket. The man sat facing me on grass to the left hand side of the blanket. After elbow bumping her and the guy I sat on the blanket and she said to me “it’s been a long time Dave”. She then sat up straight and said “how are you” in a heightened tone. We spent the next 2.5 hours talking as if time hadn’t passed since we last met, about old times, and laughing. I brought the guy into the conversation so as not to be rude. At the end of the 2.5 hours she suggested that we go to a coffee hut where the conversation continued in the same fashion for a further hour. At the end of the hour she said that if she was arranging any future get-togethers with her friends, she’d invite me. I left the park pleased to have seen her but feeling sad that the guy was probably her boyfriend and thinking I had missed my chance. However, due to her not having mentioned to me that she had a boyfriend (during arranging to meet), or that the guy with her was her boyfriend and them not sitting close to each other, the optimist in me thought they may just be good friends. 10 days passed and the question ‘is he her boyfriend’ played on my mind? I phoned her and told her “I’d like to ask you out for dinner but don’t know if you are in a relationship and don’t want to cause any friction:

She replied:…“You met him”…”Charlie is my boyfriend”.

I replied: “Yeah I did meet him, but it wasn’t clear to me”.

She replied:…“I introduced you”…”We got a place together before lockdown”.

I replied: “It wasn’t clear to me, perhaps confusion on my part”.

She replied: “It’s okay, forget it…Okay this is what to do, invite me to social events and Charlie and I will come. If Charlie can’t be bothered, then I’ll just come (nervous laugh by her)”.

I replied: “Okay. I’m glad you’re happy and I hope you continue to be happy. Speak soon” \[I then ended the call\].

We had lunch together and chit-chat during that time. He told me that deep down, he never really felt his friends were his real friends.

He said that deep down he was actually lonely. Some people may look like they have lots of friends and look happy together, but there may be a lot of unresolved tension between each other.

I guess if I had to come up with one thing that I want the most, I just want to feel normal again. I want to feel how I felt before I got depression. That's probably why I want to be in a relationship. It's the closest I get to feeling like that again. Sorry this was so long, and sorry that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

 I am short for a man and I know many women ( the ones I tried to date) have a problem with that. If you don't then that would be amazing!

I am 30, I am usually easy-going, down to earth or I can be a little hyped, outgoing, patience, understanding, open minded.

All my life I had friends to hang out with and have great laughs almost every single night of my life. I don’t have any of that anymore, due to me fucking up big time. It’s very much well deserved, but the transition from being a socialite to just somebody with only three friends is harrowing. I feel like a burden to them. I talk too much about random things and sometimes it feels like I’m annoying them. Everyday I imagine myself still with the rest of my friend groups, talking to them, hanging out with them. When I’m playing a game, I imagine myself in a call with them, talking about stuff until I snap out of it and I’m disappointed with myself. I want to move on and make more friends, to stop being lonely and actively change myself for the better but it’s hard too when all you can think of is your former friends. Hell, some nights I even dream about them. This night is one of those nights, but the dream was awfully too real and its just left me awake.

647,kunal_gupta777,1609054313,1,"Now, this is my philosophy. I've felt that we associate being lonely with miserable, not good enough or worthless because we are conditioned to feel that having friends, people to discuss things with is a very good thing. Advertisements, social media everything forces on socialising.
Now, humans are inherently social creatures and we should socialise but it's not the end of the world if we don't..
Most of the people are anyways self absorbed and think about themselves. And it's not a bad thing per se but I feel that people who feel lonely do so because they have higher expectations from others. More often than not, they'll put them in the situation and think, I wouldn't have done this if I was them and then we start to feel bad that maybe it's something with us that they do this to us.
My approach is to think, maybe they don't see what I see. Maybe, I have not met the correct people yet and last but not the least, it's okay to not having friends and be alone. Self discovery is also a biggg thing and when you learn to be alone, you'll see it's the best thing! No drama, no nonsense, just you! 
Self love will develop but it's gotta be you only.
And for the expectations, always keep them from yourself.",lonely,I've realised that being lonely hurts because of social conditioning,2020-12-27 18:31:53

(25m)Never dated or really been intimate with anyone, just yesterday I put my face back on those dating apps because I could not deal with the crushing loneliness I just want to find someone to flirt with who I can be myself around.

It's so emotionally draining around family, I can never be myself around them they knock my interests, character so I get proper withdrawn which ain't good for my confidence.

It's 6AM, I have been up all night. I am just getting a bit tired of being so touch starved, I am about to 26 soon and I would probably never be open to people about how socially useless I am. I am not sure people can tell I have never really had much of a social life, I grew up with an eating disorder, bad stress, fatigue, and was always terrible with alcohol so I could never just have a good time, I was always stressed out about the place I was in.


I just would like to find someone to be romantic with, i've missed out on a lot and I am tired. It sucks feeling really unattractive, partially when girls have been interested in me in my life my confidence was always like they don't want to be near me and stupid nonsense like that.

**TL;DR  Not sure if I have some kind of underlying mental issue that’s causing  me all of these problems in my life or if I truly am just lazy,  overdramatic, cynical and not working hard enough.**

Not  posting this for sympathy points, I know that my actions and problems  are down to me and I am actively working to solve them and have been  trying to for years. Just want to vent or perhaps get some insight. I'm  currently working with a PWP on social anxiety and it’s very slow  because of the huge gaps between appointments, but I do feel as if my  issues go beyond social anxiety.

I  struggle to speak about my issues during appointments because I feel as  if I’m going to cry very often, which annoyingly interferes with your  ability to speak, and also because of my extreme sensitivity to  rejection. In the moment, I suddenly think my problems are very stupid  and I’m just wasting her time like I did with my school councillor.  Therefore, I’m considering emailing her with a big long list of my  issues because, knowing myself, if she never directly asks me then it  will never get brought up.

**MY PROBLEMS:**

* I’ve  always been shit with eye contact. It feels too intense and like it  burns and I constantly have to remind myself that I should be doing it.  Sometimes I’m not too bad looking in someone’s eyes when they’re talking  but I’m never good at doing it while I’m talking.
* I  spend time every day thinking about how I hate the way that I look. I’m  always analyzing the faces of everyone I see and comparing myself  against them. I’m always looking in the mirror, and whenever I go out  I’m always checking myself in every car and shop window and browsing for  new outfits as if I think that getting the perfect clothing style will  fill the hole.
* I’m  convinced everyone hates me. If they do seem to like me, it’s only  because they don’t know me very well yet and haven’t seen through the  fake personality I crafted for them, or it’s because they pretend to  like me because they literally don’t have any other options for friends  or would feel rude ditching me. If they don’t hate me yet, they will,  and every opportunity speaking to them is an opportunity to mess things  up because they’ll find out I’m a fraud.
* I  can make new friends with strangers relatively easily because I just  make the conversation all about them, meaning conversations mostly end  up feeling like an interview where I’m asking someone questions and  listening and responding to what they have to say, but don’t offer much  myself due to an intense fear of rejection.
* I  struggle with maintaining friendships because nobody knows me because I  don’t talk about myself. I don’t talk about myself because I think I’m  boring and have nothing to talk about. I have nothing to talk about  because I have no hobbies. I have no hobbies because I waste every day  of my life scrolling through social media which makes me feel very  ashamed.
* I  struggle to finish anything that doesn’t have a deadline. This means I  rarely do anything fun because I think I’ll ‘get them done after I do my  work’. But I never start my work or only start it at 2am so I never get  a chance to do those things. My friends always talk about all these  shows they’ve watched or all these games they’ve played but I never seem  to have enough hours in a day. It really distresses me because I feel  like I’m watching my life drain away and I’ll never accomplish anything  that I’m desperate to. I’m miserable because I rarely do the things I  find enjoyable and the pandemic has made me painfully aware that the  reason I wasn’t accomplishing these things wasn’t actually because I  ‘didn’t have enough time due to school’.
* I  suck in most group conversations so I mostly prefer one-on-one  conversations but I also dread them because I feel an overwhelming  responsibility to entertain the other person the whole time.
* “I  feel like I’m working four times as hard as everyone else and getting  half the results.” I’m always frustrated by how naturally others seem to  just ‘get’ the social world and how they so rarely seem to have really  bad days. I’m never sure if I’m actually different to everyone because  I’m always told it’s just in my head, so my biggest fear is that there’s  actually nothing holding me back and I really am just not working hard  enough.
* Sometimes  I have these weird emotional ‘blow-ups’ that I really can’t explain  because I don’t even know what I’m feeling during those times where I  vent or go mute. I’m self-conscious that this often looks like  attention-seeking. They’re not, I don’t really know what they are.
* I’m jealous of anyone else’s success because I feel like I have nothing going for me. This makes me feel like an arsehole.
* Many  times I’ve been called weird and it always majorly hurt my feelings  because I’m really not sure what it is I’m doing wrong. I’m always  worried I give off a weird ‘vibe’ or something without realizing,  especially when people I’ve been making an effort to befriend for ages  and I think it’s going well with, suddenly start talking to a new person  and immediately have so much more chemistry and fluidity of  conversation than I’ve ever had with them. It’s probably because  everyone else always loves to talk about themselves but I struggle with  that or overdo it.
* I feel incompetent compared to everyone else.
* I have my own marvel cinematic universe in my head that I spend a lot of time distracting myself with each day.
* Everything  gets so much worse when I’m on my period/around the time of my period.  It took me ages to realize that my biggest mood dips occur during this  time. I spend many days of my period feeling tearful or crying, if one  tiny thing going wrong it ruins my whole day.

Sometimes  I feel like my problems aren’t that severe and I’m just behind but I’ll  catch up, or I’m not pushing myself hard enough. Then I have to remind  myself that my mental health hasn’t been good since year 7 when I  suddenly realized I had no clue how to interact with people, and while I  have slowly improved in confidence over the years I frequently lapse  back into a bit of a ‘meltdown’ after the novelty of going into a new  school year and thinking “this one will be different because I’ll  achieve the things I want to and make close friends” has worn off.

**I relate a lot to the struggles of people with**  BPD, but I’ve never self-harmed and I don’t have some whacky, abusive  childhood. I relate a lot to girls with Aspergers and listen to videos  on Youtube of them putting into words so many things I’ve struggled  with, but I don’t think I have a special interest and I don’t think I’ve  ever struggled with looking at a facial expression and knowing how  someone is feeling or being super irritated by a fabric. I relate to  female inattentive ADHD struggles but I passed every GCSE and A level  with A\* bar 2 (without much revision, mind you) and I was never a  difficult kid. I let my workspace get messy but I always inevitably  clean it because I can’t stand the clutter.

    When I was 8 my parents with 3 kids got divorced. Because of the crazy situation of abuse (emotional, physical) and abandonment I was asked to testify after my brother, sister &amp; i spoke with the judge in his privet chambers. He Hurd the stories.
    My dad innocent of hurting us didn't have a chance of getting custody in the 70s. He was working as a merchant marine and not in the state 6 months of if the year. On top of that mostly mothers got custody back then. Sidenote it was a landmark ruling and in law books.
    I was terrified to testify but I knew I had too, my brother &amp; sisters wellness depended on it. In court I was asked questions that still echo in my head. Then I answered a question that to this day tares my sole. Why do you belive custody be granted to your biological father? I spoke without a filter from the heart not knowing the weight my words would carry.  ""Mom has too many boyfriends i don't like "" . The words still scath me. 
   So for so many years I waited for my mom to pick me up on my birthday in April.  She always came in February for my younger sister then March for my brother. I was next and she knew where we lived.   She never came.  Not once for me although year after year I still sat and waited. I don't know how old I was when I stopped waiting or stopped crying over it. Truth be told I still get emotional about it. My mom never came for me. 
   No special birthday,  no cards Christmas or otherwise,  no phone calls,  no gifts,  letters or words. Maybe now I have incite along with guilt. That only age can bring. 
    After I answered that dreaded question. Mom responded to it. I suppose  sealing the judge's decision. To me at 8 the gravity of her words meant little.

""It's not you, it's me"" she said. ""The attachment I have towards you is unhealthy and it is drowning me"".

This was actually happening, my heart sank as I sat at the edge of the sofa muting the television to better focus on the text. I opened it. It was Eva. The most beautiful girl I had ever met; she was out of my league and had black curly hair, she always threatened me she would cut and beautiful skin that glowed when it was hit by the sun, and the most gorgeous smile that made winter feel like summer. Her signature fragrance suddenly filled the room, Dior J'adore with a hint of roses or perhaps I only imagined it.

""What do you mean?"" I responded

""I can't focus with you around. You make me...wonder, I am suddenly unable to think, unable to cope"".

""Doesn't that mean you love me"" I said foolishly

""I neglect myself, you suffocate me"" she responded.


I quickly realized she wasn't looking for a reason to fight anymore. A reason to stay, a reason to hold on to what we had like she always did. She had changed. She had become cold...distant. She wanted a way out.

""Don't you want to talk about this when you get back from New York?""

...

""What is there to talk about?"" Eva asked

~We should talk about us and what we have. We still have a lot to talk about, plus I have changed for you. For us.~

""Us"" 

""Us? I can no longer handle your outbursts, accusations, self-destructive behavior and disrespect to me as a person"".

~It's over. She doesn't want to have to deal with this anymore. She doesn't want me to fight. She wants me to let her go.~

I had dug my own grave, she warned me she would get tired of me. I only prolonged the inevitable. She needed time away from me, thats why she left to convince herself she didn't need me, she didn't want me, she didn't love me.

""I still love you, it burns"" her text popped

~3 more weeks before I could see her, maybe I could still convince her, help her understand I am the one for her~

""Could we work on it together when you get back? Whatever the problem is?""

A drop of tear hit the screen of my phone. I quickly smeared it off.

""Let's fight for what we have left, we can still do this"".

People don’t want to talk about it, they get awkward and uncomfortable when you talk about what you’re going through. So they change the subject so they won’t feel uncomfortable anymore, not knowing how crushing it feels to have ones issues shooed off. You try and seek help and even those who are abuse survivors can’t lend you advice. That’s how deep in shit I’m in. That even those you’d think would be supportive and encouraging won’t say a word. 

All I want is for someone to listen. All I want is someone to be by my side and be there for me. I’m not asking for them to get me out, or save me. All I’m asking is for someone to be there. Someone to listen. Someone to gather up enough sympathy to say “hey. I’m here.” I don’t understand.. ever since the abuse came back I realized how isolated this is. How I’m on the other side of the wall, and everyone else are on the opposite side. Even when I wave and call for company, they look, and keep walking. It makes me doubt anyone really cares.

The person wanted to keep chatting even more, we really hit it up.

To my surprise they confessed their feelings to me, but they misunderstood my response. I heard from them less and less, yet I tried my hardest to be supportive for them… putting aside my health and freaking out so much over my mistake. I could tell they were getting suicidal, but I felt helpless. I never expected perfection of them… but I feared they’d lose interest in me if I was anything less

It hurt to find out that multiple nights of endless pain and suicidal feelings, the whole time they were there… just avoiding me… I never expected perfection of them, I'll clarify that what upset me was that it felt like I couldn't make the same errors...

*My crush is a work colleague who I met circa 5 years ago.* *She had a boyfriend when I first met her, whom she split with 2-3 years later.* *For the last 2.5 years she has been working in a different department and I no longer saw her daily.* *We bumped into each other from time to time and always spoke when we did.* *Despite not having asked her on a date I think she may have known that I was attracted to her as I’ve previously: offered to help her move flat; invited her hiking with friends; and invited her to social events.* *I believe that she’s shown signs of liking me as possibly more than a friend (albeit several years ago): I’ve caught her staring at me on numerous occasions; she once let me know which evenings she was free for after work socials; she laughs at all my jokes; she’s invited me to drinks with her friends and she said she’d like to sit next to me at a works meal.* *Foolishly I didn’t proactively contact her over the last 2.5 years (until now) due to being embarrassed about having put weight on, becoming scruffy in appearance and not being comfortable with myself.*

When I arrived in the park to meet her, a man was sat with her (unexpectedly as she hadn’t mentioned anyone joining us). As I approached she was sat facing me on the right hand side of a picnic blanket. The man sat facing me on grass to the left hand side of the blanket. After elbow bumping her and the guy I sat on the blanket and she said to me “it’s been a long time Dave”. She then sat up straight and said “how are you” in a heightened tone. We spent the next 2.5 hours talking as if time hadn’t passed since we last met, about old times, and laughing. I brought the guy into the conversation so as not to be rude. At the end of the 2.5 hours she suggested that we go to a coffee hut where the conversation continued in the same fashion for a further hour. At the end of the hour she said that if she was arranging any future get-togethers with her friends, she’d invite me. I left the park pleased to have seen her but feeling sad that the guy was probably her boyfriend and thinking I had missed my chance. However, due to her not having mentioned to me that she had a boyfriend (during arranging to meet), or that the guy with her was her boyfriend and them not sitting close to each other, the optimist in me thought they may just be good friends. 10 days passed and the question ‘is he her boyfriend’ played on my mind? I phoned her and told her “I’d like to ask you out for dinner but don’t know if you are in a relationship and don’t want to cause any friction:

She replied:…“You met him”…”Charlie is my boyfriend”.

I replied: “Yeah I did meet him, but it wasn’t clear to me”.

She replied:…“I introduced you”…”We got a place together before lockdown”.

I replied: “It wasn’t clear to me, perhaps confusion on my part”.

She replied: “It’s okay, forget it…Okay this is what to do, invite me to social events and Charlie and I will come. If Charlie can’t be bothered, then I’ll just come (nervous laugh by her)”.

I replied: “Okay. I’m glad you’re happy and I hope you continue to be happy. Speak soon” \[I then ended the call\].

But how else am I supposed to meet someone online?

Of course, I could reply to posts that other people have made, but, honestly, at best half of those will end up replying to me (based on past expeirence) and I have a personal issue with being ignored even when I'm not feeling extremely isolated and depressed from spending months alone at home.
And before you offer me a recommendation for your favorite dating website: thank you, but no thank you. I'm done with dating websites. I've tried a few of them, hated them all, and refuse to go back.

I just don't know what to do.

The things I think about amount to the same things over and over again, which are usually just about how tough it is being single and alone or having the feeling overwhelm me to the point of an anxiety attack, except there's no attack that follows. What follows is shit like ""Well what if you broke up with your highschool sweetheart permanently?"" Things like that and it starts to spiral down a rabbit hole of emotions that end up being more trouble to deal with then just a quick one and done. Lemme explain. 

I know a lot of people know about the infinite universe theory and how it works, so you probably already know where I'm about to go with this. Where my thoughts end up is usually right here, I start to think about what could've happened (a really unhealthy coping method, I know) and then I soon realize afterwards that there are multiple different universes where I'm happy with my life, with the choices that I thought up at that moment, knowing that they exist, and I'm not in that universe. I'm in one where I'm not as happy as I want to be, I'm in one where I have no idea what's gonna happen next, when I'll be happy again, and that hurts more than being as sad as I feel. Even on the better days I have there's still that empty feeling I always feel. I want to be in one of those other universes because if I thought about it, every single tiny detail, it exists. All I really want is to be happy, be in a different scenario, have something happen out of the blue that changes everything, shit like that. But it seems childish to wish for something like that.

Hello everyone,

I thought I’d make this post before my mania passes me by in a few moments. It’s the day after Christmas, which might possibly be the saddest of the year, runner up only to Christmas itself. The gifts have been opened, the wrapping paper litters the floor, the tree is still up mocking you, the debt has settled on your credit card and your statement is now due. I’ve come to realize that not many people have it as great as I think they do. Christmas makes me idolize people with tons of friends and family, events to go to, places to be, traditions that have gone on for years etc. But the truth is if you talk to these people they will rarely glow when talking about it. They’ll complain about having to travel, spend money, or be around people they don’t really like 364 days out of the year. I know I’m rambling but I promise I have a point and it’s not why Christmas sucks. My point is, people aren’t as happy as you think or perceive them to be from there Instagram stories. People don’t have as much money as you think, people don’t have the best boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife/partner etc (they probably have a weird toe or something), people don’t look like their own photos (they took 57 and decided on one that looked good or edited it) people are not having as much sex as you think, people are in debt, people don’t like their jobs that much or hate them, people still think about their ex’s and look at their Facebook pages, people don’t always have cool hobbies, people can’t always sing, people can’t cook that damn good, people eat more fast food than they admit, people watch things on eBay they’ll never buy and people are unhappy. This may come off extremely pessimistic but it’s grounding to me. To know you’re not the only non perfect one makes you the majority and the perfect ones the weirdos. So here’s to my imperfect army of people out there not having sex, eating fast food, broke af, unemployed or hate your job, rerun watchers, paying for a gym membership but not using it, low credit score having, imperfect creatures.

757,codecrunchie,1609009485,1,"Hello, and very merrry christmas! This project matches people up based on answers to 28 questions. Basically you choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28 questions, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. For example you could say you're looking for people from **Europe**, who are **16-25**, who '**maybe/yes**' are willing to do **voice calls**, and they're also **studying**. Also quite handy, there is a filter to not match with ""*low effort*"" (based on word count) users.

What is the final result? The algorithm searches over 3000 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get 20-80 **matches** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

This is what the UI looks like for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

The last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

\----------------------------------------------------------

**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-80 matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.

I’ve tried to make friends recently to try and fill this gap in my life that just gets bigger and worse as each day goes by and no matter how I try to make it better I always seem to make myself feel more alone than ever before, it makes me want to just give up. I really don’t know what to do, I’ve tried to make friends, I’ve tried to fix things with my family, I’ve tried professional help. Yet I cannot get rid of this lonely feeling 😕. 

I spent most of this Christmas period alone and ignored by my family and most of my friends. (Except Christmas eve for a few hours which was nice), I spent Christmas Day in my room with hardly any interaction with anybody. Watching everybody around me be happy and be with the ones they love or with their friends. Whilst I was alone with a family who don’t really like me much and treat me like I’m invisible. When people mention their relationships and things to me it makes me feel depressed and even more alone because I wish I had what they have.. 

I’ve recently been feeling Depressed and experiencing Suicidal thoughts (sorry) because I really don’t want to keep feeling this way. I’m not sure how to keep going. It just all sucks.. But if it wasn’t for the internet nobody would know I even exist and that’s the loneliest feeling of all..",lonely,"27M, Feeling alone in the world.. even with online friends 😕 TW is there just in case.",2020-12-27 04:30:04

i learned to come up with topics from making online friends me and my online best friend have always talked and been friends for years but we're not friends anymore so now i came back to my old roots and dont have anyone to talk to

But there are days when you just have to tell somebody you had it rough today and nobody is there to listen. My ""friends"" don't. They only have things to say about themselves and they always make the topics I bring up about them. I guess they got used to my company as being ""that punching bag"" who'd be there to listen every time. It's very lonely. Often, I'd just let the punches hit me so I can feel less alone, but it only makes me feel sad afterwards. I wasn't raised to be a doormat to other people's problems. I have mine, too.

I'm over that, tbh I don't think it was working out. But damn I miss physical intimacy, just cuddling and holding hands. 

So started working out semi-regularly mid-year. it's been slow but I am definitely getting fitter. Never been overweight. Eat healthy and avoid sugar. Look quite young for my age, being healthy and all. Pretty damn good with the puns too. But after many months on multiple dating apps I don't think my self-esteem can take much more. 

So I figure that “getting out” would be a better way. But with anxiety, being severely introverted and the mild depression, plus being tired from work + continuous bad sleep, it's so hard. Don't even really know what to do even. Plus being social in Perth usually means something involving drinking and “banter”, which I find boring and uncomfortable.

In my venting, I simply said what I said here. No hate or anger or malice, just what happened and that it made me sad. Unfortunately, my venting turned into drama when my friend got on this girl about what she did. I didn't know my friend already had an issue with her, so I added fuel to a burning fire.

Well this girl who I thought liked me was also an acquaintance of mine who was in the same friend group. She became upset at me for talking about her and all, and now I've lost that friendship and have strained the friend group I have. 

I'm just frustrated because I feel if I wasn't so lonely and devoid of affection and all, I wouldn't have been so upset by a joke as to vent about it to someone and this would have been avoided.

It was incredibly lonely, I woke up ate breakfast, showered, and sat in my bed the rest of the day. It was the suffocating isolation of no friends, family, or anyone who cares being around me on this special day. I was so used to waking up to my family running into my room, jumping on my bed, the tamales in the morning, and running over to open up presents.

    As the day went on I got increasingly more depressed. Then I just straight up felt like crying because I missed my family and my friends so much. I decided to call everybody one by one on the phone and wish them merry Christmas. Every person I called made me a bit warmer inside. Then I realized that you never realize how much you actually care about your close ones until they are gone or aren’t around.

There are so many people in this community, but many of them are just not available right now to try to help out. I really wish I could fully express how much I wish I could help you. I have seen too many kids opening PS5s and not enough memes to distract me from being where I am now, and I know there are some people here who can agree. I really hope this finds you physically well even if you might not be in the best mental state. Maybe drink some water and go to sleep early? If you are going to be dealing with people tomorrow too, I would definitely recommend getting some sleep. Please take care of yourselves tonight. If you are feeling down right now, try to help yourself out by not letting it give you a bad start to a new year. I said this to someone earlier and I'll say it again, I'm sorry you aren't having the Merriest Christmas, but you can still make it a Happy New Year. Also try to help each other out.

No presents, friends or food                                              
There’s no jolly spirit, instead a bad mood

Why does Santa never visit? Am I not good enough?                                                                                
Maybe I lie to myself, is my good heart a bluff?

I could always try harder, I could try my very best        
Maybe Santa would fix my life that’s a mess

But Santa is a lie and my dreams won’t come true    
No matter my niceness I won’t stop feeling blue

 I don't know what's wrong with me but basically people have told me that I am boring as in too nice than actually needed lol.. but yeah I guess I am destined to be alone no matter how much love, respect and determination I put in any relationship I always end up getting used and neglected.

873,throwaway0009865,1608941423,1,"I have suffered this year, just like any of you. Maybe to a lesser degree, or to a greater, but I can understand the mutual feeling of loneliness, depression, and apathy. I have felt heartbreak, I have felt grief, I have felt disappointment, and even anger. 

Working in a hospital as support staff during this pandemic, I’ve seen the effect this pandemic has, and I have felt emotional cost. I’ve sunk time and effort for someone who I thought was a friend, but realized that she was wasn’t. 

However, during this very dark and lonely period of my life, I decided to start reaching out to people I haven’t spoken to in a long time. Years of distractions had disconnected myself from some old friends, so I’ve decided to reconnect. Through those reconnections, I’ve found out who my real friends were after all. The ones who cared, and listened. 

It was almost a cathartic feeling, knowing the ones who would listen to what I had to say, and what I’ve been going through. I’ve came to the realization that I was my own worst enemy. That I’ve let my bitterness, ego, and false sense of stoicism control my life, thinking that I could make it alone. I can’t. 

I’ve felt like I was losing myself, getting more and more angry, crying at random times, feeling hopeless. But the point I’m trying to make, is that while I was caught up with all my self loathing that I was blinded from the reality. I still have people who care, who are willing to listen. 

I know that some of you may not have that luxury, but I what I do know is that you still have the opportunity to form that connection with others. There are good people out there willing to listen, willing to help. We’re all human, and we all want to form some connections, one way or another. 


My message to all of you is this; there’s still hope. Currently, I feel like I’m in the process of rebirth. Finally trying to give myself time for reflection, and to find how much I’ve lost myself. Do not let your circumstances, your pain, your loneliness, define and destroy who you are. It’s okay to feel those powerful emotions, but it takes strength to rise above it. 

You are all stronger than you know. All of you have that inner strength to take control of your lives again. To face all of your adversities head on, and to rise above even stronger. Feel those emotions of anger, of depression, and loneliness, but then have the strength to rise above it, and not let it control you. 

When you finally overcome all of those things, believe me when I say this, you are a HERO. A hero isn’t defined by how indestructible they are, they’re defined by how they react during the harshest of times, and rise above their own pain and fears. We are all capable of that, even if you don’t believe it yourself. 

So my final message to all of you? Be kind, to yourself, to others. There’s a hero in all of you. Despite all of your pain and traumas, life is still worth living. I promise you all of that.",lonely,What this year has taught me. (There is still hope),2020-12-26 11:10:23

So I was talking to this girl for awhile, and things were great. We hung out, made out, cuddled, talked 24/7 and everything was going well. One day about 2 months ago during a time period I was really stressed out we got into an argument, because I was upset and wouldn’t tell her what was wrong. Know I went and in her words “subtweeted” her. We talked later that night me she said she didn’t know if we’d ever talk again. I told her everything like about how much I want things to work and how I’m trying to grow and I want her to be with me and grow together. we talked it out and she said everything was okay and she still liked me. 

Well after that things were never the same. I tired so show her how sorry I was and tried showing her how much I cared. Every time I asked her to hangout or FaceTime she made an excuse. She never gave me the same attention. Slowly over time this led to more problems and disagreements and she slowly started to answer me less and less. About a week ago she said she doesn’t have the same feelings anymore. 

Yes I agree I did some things I wish I didn’t but after she told me I really changed it and stopped doing it. Yes Ik some of it’s my fault.

886,-_burrito_-,1608937999,1,"Hi, I don't know if this is the right subreddit. So... I'll start with this: I'm 16yo, I have a few friends but idk if I can call them that. I know them for 10 or more years, but since 7th grade of elementary school the started changing, the wrong way. 

A little explanation: In Poland the school system looks like this pre-school, elementary school (8 grades 6yo-15yo), high school (3 or 5 grades, 15yo-18yo or 15yo-20yo, I'm going to the one with 3 grades)


Like I said it started in 7th grade (now I'm in 2nd of high school), my friends started to ""third wheeling"" me, I was always the one that was picked last to the team. Then happened this, one of my friends brought a bb gun to school and thought it would be funny to shoot me and other kids in the back, first he shot some kids, they were screaming from pain etc. Then he shot me once, twice, three times I just turned around looked him straight in the eyes and said ""If you're going to do this again I am gonna take this plastic piece of shit and shove it up your ass and dump the whole magazine"". Since then they started calling me ""Ściana"" which means wall.

After this the whole 7th grade they started to get abusive on me. They were throwing light punches on my arms, in the chest, because they thought it doesn't hurt me. It does hurt me, but I don't scream like a little bitch, I just can take the pain. I didn't let them do this ofc, I was hitting them back harder. They would just run of.

Another explanation: You may think, why I didn't tell anyone or something? Because it's better to take light punches in the arm and have friends than, get bullied for the next 5 grades, take punches in the face, get bullied and have no friends.

In 8th grade I got used to this and just let them do this (today it doesn't happen that much, but they do worse things that I will talk about later). I had many bruises on my arms. I would tell my mom that it's from playing handball on PE.

First grade of high school, only 3 friends were in the same school, two of them in the same class. Unfortunately the ones that were throwing punches at me. 

After few months they kind of stopped doing this. It would happen very rarely, but they were more aggressive to seem cool and tough in front of the new people in the new school. They started to smoke, drink, I was being ignored again, they were showing off in front of others, they started doing anything to look like the better ones at everything. They were verbally bullying other people to make them feel worse, they were talking absolute shit about people, the only solution for them was violence.

When you forget about everything that I wrote above they seem like the perfect friends and that is what everyone thinks. They want to hang out, they want to play games together etc.

Now that I'm in the half of the 2nd grade I have 1,5 years to deal with them left and I really want to end it because the only thing that I got from them is trust issues, low self-esteem, living in constant stress, anxiety and depression. But I have to wait or I'll end up being bullied and getting beat to the blood.

Twice I've got into a fight with the most abusive one. They ended with bruises on my chest, arms and legs and him getting hit with a plank in the back. One started because I sat on his seat and the second one because I jokingly hit him light in the arm (other friend had to split us if he didn't it would evolve even more and one of us would probably end up in the hospital).

So.. Reddit, I ask you for a opinion on this, sorry that it's so long but it's as short as I could get it.

I woke up to a few random merry Christmas texts but not one phone call. Basically the least amount of effort and minimal energy expended.

I'm not the type to want things for Christmas and enjoy giving gifts more than receiving but to realize that it's Christmas and nobody had gotten me anything I just feel so unseen and unwanted.

939,__daco_,1608910955,1,"In my dreams. But it felt completely real, and waking up afterwards didn't make me sad, but glad, that I've got a chance to meet her. She had her own head and thoughts, didn't like anyone to tell her what to think. She was smart and talkative, but not in a pressing way. You just knew that she doesn't snap often, but when she did, it always had some profound truth in it. She perfectly subtle showed me how she liked me. Completely non-cheesy. She had her guard up, but she knew when she could let it down. 
I've met her on her cashier's shift at a supermarket in albuquerque (don't ask me why there, the dream literally started with me standing in front of it's town sign thinking ""Why the heck am I here and how do I get back home""). I didn't have any cash but my banking card at hand and I was very thirsty. I walked in the store, grabbed a bottle of water and instantly opened it to drink it. It felt like something completely normal to do. I saw her watching me doing it in my peripheral, and when I went to the register with the empty bottle to pay for it, she smirked. I tried to pay with card but the Card-Reader didn't work so I got embarrassed. She noticed and without saying anything, pulled out her wallet, payed for it, stood up and gave me a look like I should follow her. I did, we went out of the market and walked for some while. I told her I was embarrassed for not being able to pay, that I've had no idea how I ended up here and where the nearest bank was. She wanted to show me, and after a long and exhausting walk we finally got to a demolition site, where once a bank was. She got embarrassed for having me walk for this long without being able to get me to a bank. I didn't even notice, I only had her on my mind, but I didn't tell her. I swiftly switched the topic to something else and somehow, she understood why. She noticed that I liked her and she played along, entertaining my conversation in such an intriguing witty way that her responses often left me speechless. When the topic switched back to something I was more familiar with, I got the upper hand and things turned around. It went like that for hours, walking and talking through the city without any goal. The conversation was like a dance, with careful but planned steps throughout the whole process. In the end we got closer and closer, we were about to kiss when I woke up. 

It didn't annoy me that I woke up though, it made me really happy that I had that dream. It makes me feel less lonely today, like now I know what girl I want and that she's out there somewhere!",lonely,Ive met my perfect match,2020-12-26 02:42:35

I used to have this best friend we would literally do everything together but I wasn’t content and felt like I had to hide myself so she can express herself (she didn’t in the past). I realized we weren’t made for this friendship and I stopped it. This was all around July 2020. It was very hard for me to get over it.
Today she messaged me “Merry Christmas” and I replied the same. We talk and caught up with each other and see what happened in each other’s lives. We both were keeping a distance in our messages then we started to clear things up about what happened. I told her I didn’t want to be friends but I don’t mind being classmates. I didn’t want to be close to her as before. We talked and then she asked me to do a request for her. 
“i’d like to ask of something, and i really insists of you doing it so i can move on because there won’t be a day that i will not miss so i’d rather you do it. i’d really like you to block me. it’s a better shot of me moving on”
It hurt so much reading those words but I agreed because I wanted her to move on for our friendship so she can grow. I blocked her and now I cried.

I'm 21. Few friends no GF and stuck in a student room. What has been pulling at me during quarantine is societal &amp; parental pressure. My head is constantly being filled with expectations due to my friends constantly talking girls and sex whilst my parents have reached the age where all they talk about it 'The Good Old Days', where they were my age and telling me about the wayyyy more exciting life they had.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been wanting to make something with my life, maybe to prove something (i.e. that I won't stay the loser I was in High School). The fact that I can't do anything right now, and that I don't feel comfortable about relationships and sex unlike my friends, is pulling at me and making me spiral alone...

and then when i cool down, i wanna apologize for being passive aggressive. but when i read the texts again i feel the same way as when i responded passive aggressively. it just pisses me off. is it so hard to answer? every time i talk to this person i know they might just not answer the question and switch the topic, even if it is some basic question. or they might not reply to something i said. it makes me just not want to talk to them. 

and then they bullshit that they don't know what to say, or that they didn't see it or whatever. but it only recently started happening. it never happened before. so my conclusion is that i just got boring to them with time and they don't wanna respond as much anymore. but they still text me all the time every day. i just don't fucking get it.

one thing i could do instead of being passive aggressive is just confront them about it right there when they do it, maybe that's not a bad idea. but i have social anxiety so i feel bad for ever confronting anyone, because i fear coming off like they owe me something. but to be honest, i do feel like they owe me something. since i never ever ignore them, i expect the same thing back.",lonely,i just hate being ignored,2020-12-25 14:28:40

Being alone is painful and the despair that it may never change makes life a torturous journey that's incredibly hard to endure so at times it makes sense that I would want to end  it, that I would want to escape right? Cliffs, buildings and heights of all kinds? Nope that didn't work. Electrical outlets, knives to the wrists? Again no, its like mom can smell my blood. Traffic? No, the one time you want the driver to be a dick. Pills? A coma is close but I'm still here, the trip was nice though and it was the best sleep I've had in a while.

Today I think I lost a friend, because the only reason I talked to them was because I had another friend that I would talk to about this shit. But then they got grounded. So I began to ghost everyone in my life including the friend I lost. Today I said hi to them (texting) and they seemed a little pissed. So I asked them if they were ok and they said they were just mad at me. So I asked if we can talk. They said basically that I can’t just ghost everyone and then just say hi. I’m pretty sure they hate me. I eventually opened up about my feelings for the first person besides the grounded friend. They said,”I don't care at this point, people always blame it on there feelings except for the fact that everyone else goes through those feelings and you still see  them not ghosting there friends, for example (friend) hasn't been in the greatest mood for  reason or at least the last time I called her she wasn't and d id she ghost us??

I am educated, cultured and a very liberal person. I am egalitarian and I have civic sense. Why should I be judged and swept under generalized views?

Never had any relationship save one. She was a good woman from the west, reached out to me, and gave her heart to me without any prejudice or doubts. Alas, it didn't work out.

1043,xChallen6er,1608858560,1,"This is gonna be long...

In highschool, I was never popular, never one of those kids that everyone wanted to talk to, but I was never hated. My highschool was made up of many cliques. I had a small friend group, but my ""friends"" weren't really my friends at all. They would humiliate me and constantly put me down and I never understood why. I became the person they picked on constantly. It was a really hard time for me, but i didn't have anyone else in my life so i stuck with the group I had. There were so many nights that I spent crying myself to sleep, alone, but I never lost sight of my goal. I worked hard to achieve my goals. I was never a nerd, but I knew that college was waiting for me, and I I thought just maybe, it would change my life for the better, and that's what pushed me through high school..

Fast forward to college, I got into a good school, and my first semester I joined a frat. That first year I had more friends that I could even count. Everyone liked me and I thought things were going fantastic. I was getting invited to so many things, my phone was constantly buzzing. I felt so good that I finally had friends I could count on, or so I thought.

One year later,  I moved out of my dorm, and into an apartment complex with 2 of my friends. Things went great for that year, I even got a girlfriend but thats when shit hit the fan. Our relationship was nothing short of amazing, but... in the process, I slowly stopped talking to so many of my friends, and focused completely on her. I spent all the time I could with her. I stopped going out, I stopped drinking at the bars with my friends on the weekends and instead I would be with her. Slowly my friends stopped inviting me to stuff. My phone which used to bustle with texts that I couldn't keep up with, starting silencing.

3rd year, I was so committed to the relationship, but now shit got rocky and my ex wanted more. I tried everything I could and gave her all I could, but it wasn't enough for her. She always wanted more. In the process of chasing her, I slowly stopped giving a fuck about anyone else, and that was my biggest mistake. My ""friends"" started leaving me out of everything. I stopped getting invited to trips, and no one talked to me anymore because I said no to almost everything. 

Fast forward this year. In January I was left with a total of 4 people who I talked to. One of whom got arrested, and had to leave college and I lost him. He was my best friend, and one stupid dumb mistake got him kicked out. That hit me hard, he was the one person I talked to everyday and saw everyday. We smoked weed and drank together almost everyday. And just like that he was gone. What made it even harder was that he got a job as a night shift in his family hotel. He would sleep all day, go to work at 11 pm. I no longer got to talk to him at all.

I thought I had so many people my back, but I soon found out that they were leaving me out of everything. The few people I had in my life turned to nothing. I've been an avid gamer all my life and I threw myself into that. When covid hit, that made a turn for the worse. I absorbed myself into gaming, school, and weed. I told myself things would get better, it would get better, they always get better. I had to believe that, and it kept me going. I set new goals for myself. I was thriving in school due to my lack of social life, and I was thriving in gaming, but... I was always gaming alone. All my life, I never had friends who played video games. Isn't that odd? but they never played any. At least, not at the level that I was playing at. It was always casual for them, and even online, I found it really hard to make friends as most people were never as competitive as I was, therefore we would almost always lose, and I would never have fun with them. I couldn't find anyone who wanted to improve as much as I did, so I played alone. I spent hours on hours on hours by myself, just gaming away. When I wasn't studying, I was gaming or smoking weed. 

Fast forward to this semester. August 2020. I thought I'll finally be able to go school and make friends. turns out all my classes were online, I didn't have to step foot on campus once. On top of that, I had broken up with my girlfriend and was severely depressed. I lost everyone I cared about, and anyone who would give a damn about me. I continued with my life. Had the best semester I could academically. I even managed to land an internship. I also managed to hit diamond in Apex Legends by just playing by myself. It was a huge accomplishment for me, but... I realized it didn't matter. I didn't have anyone to share that with. I tried so hard to hang with people this semester, but everyone turned me down.

Its now Christmas eve. I lost my last friend today. Turns out hes been fucking my ex this whole year. I knew about it over the summer, but he apologized so much I thought he genuinely felt bad. However, he continued this whole time, and i never knew... I've lost all my trust. Every time I trust someone with my life, they always let me down. I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. Whenever I watch tv, I feel depressed. I know they're just actors, but the friendships they have on the shows are some of which I never got to experience. I don't think I've ever had one person who truly would have my back like that. My phones been silent as ever. I never get snapchats or texts. My familys always there, and god bless them because they are wonderful people, but its different. I need people to talk to, and I just can't talk to my parents like how I talk to my friends. 

I've never been more lonely in my life. Money has never been an issue for me, and I have so much, but i truly understand that money doesn't buy happiness. I could be a millionaire, and I'll still be just as lonely as I am right now. So here I am... on reddit. Throwing my heart out... I'm never gonna give up but.. I'm just gonna hold onto my false hope that things will get better",lonely,"I've lost everyone in my life, but I'm not giving up",2020-12-25 12:09:20
1044,Basiest,1608858427,1,"Read this if you want, or don't... But I need to get my feelings out and this seems like the best place rn.

For the first time in my life, I actually forgot it was Christmas Eve. It's not that I was busy, quite the opposite. My mom left a few years back, and forced the sale of our house. Of course, we're pretty lower middle class. Not like we were on the streets, but I definitely didn't have anything like luxery growing up. For the past 3 years, we've been hoping from basement complexes and extended families houses and other such couches. I've mostly stayed with my dad, I don't want to leave him because I'm the last family member he really has left this close in his life. Our... complicated relationship is the only thing giving me any real purpose these days:

I actually dated someone when I was 16-17. Boy, what an experience. I had been diagnosed with Aspergers and ADD (among other things...) around the time I was 10, I guess for some reason I thought I'd never find anything like 'love' or 'someone to care'. Family didn't really fufill that role for me. They still don't really.

Making friends was easier as a kid. Getting into a meaningful (mostly) relationship was easier before 20. It's practically impossible for me these days to even connect with a new person. Isn't it fucked up how because of our hurt, we end up getting more hurt? I'm so scared of people leaving, I think I tend to jump to deep into friendships or relationships/ Mistake people just being nice for actual connection. The issue only gets worse with every rejection.

So I thought, I'll just make friends online. Of course, that never lasts either. Either something in real life gets hectic and I lose connection, or I just end up having no idea where to go. In maybe half of all cases, it's just people tired of me. I don't know if that last one is really true or not, but it's at least something that fuels the desperation.

People offer advice like its easy. They tell you to ""just go slow,"" ""just don't worry,"" ""people come and go,"" ""just act NORMAL,"" A combination of voices around me, my own personal choices, and continuous one week friendships that never go anywhere.

I wish I could just restart. I feel like I fucked up somewhere. Now I'm some partly insecure child in a mans body, my loneliness only acting as a shameful shroud to the real problems, that a part of me is scared of what happens if someone actually sticks around. I feel like I'll never know, so lately I've given up trying to connect with people. I want to learn to be ok with that, because if this is how life is gonna be... well... May as well get used to it, right? Maybe I'll go live in the mountains alone. At least then I can say without a doubt this isolation is entirely my choice.",lonely,I am nothing,2020-12-25 12:07:07

I know many of the woman here are going through a lot issues. It could range from being scared of being alone through the holidays, depression, you want to hurt yourself, your a nerd, a big woman or too skinny, wether you think you are beautiful or not. Well I’m here to tell all of you with those problems, YOU are beautiful, YOU are amazing, YOU are perfection in someone’s eyes &amp; YOU are strong! Don’t let NO man tell you otherwise. I’ve talked to a few woman on this site with problems with depression, marriage, or other issues and I’ve always tried to help out in someway. Everyone deserves to be loved in someway. So remember there is someone out there for YOU, patience is a virtue! So I want to say to you Beautiful smart woman out there...Mary Christmas my loves! You are amazing, beautiful and kind! I’m going to virtual hug all of you! Here’s a little quote that I hope makes you smile!

“The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The beauty of a woman is seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides. True beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It’s the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she shows &amp; the beauty of a woman only grows with passing years.” – Audrey Hepburn",lonely,To all the woman out there this is for you and Marry Christmas,2020-12-25 09:49:08
1064,voughtever,1608850069,1,"Turned 26 today. 
And no one wished me except 3 friends (in text message) and family, just like last year's birthday.
Now I'm a true introvert and a highly independent guy.
But birthdays remind me of how pathetic I am socially.

I kind of brought this upon himself.
But am I really SO bad that I don't even get about like 5-10 birthday wishes on call, from 5-10 different people?
Probably it must not be so bad even for fellow introverts. I don't know.

For the last 5 years, people have been taking me for granted. Whether I make an effort to connect with them socially or not, they simply don't respect me or acknowledge my existence. 

But I still wonder, what do normal people even do to earn the vast amount of birthday wishes they receive even from people way back in their past?
I am 26 so I most probably heard all the advices there are in order to master the social game, but I honestly don't think most normal people do even half of those things to deserve that kind of attention from others. They just get that naturally, they aren't super social and super extroverts.

I don't have a girlfriend either. I only ever had one gf who I never met, out of my introversion and she went on to cheat on me with multiple other guys.

I don't think I can ever make this better. I don't know if I want to, either.",lonely,Another unnoticed birthday.,2020-12-25 09:47:49

1067,Rawrzberry,1608848466,1,"Sorry if this is difficult to read. I often have trouble putting my thoughts into words and I'm having a lot of thoughts tonight.

I have some really good friends in my life. They've mostly moved away now, but we speak regularly over discord. We don't often speak about ""real"" stuff, but I can turn to them when I need. So in that regard I'm pretty lucky.

But over the holiday season everyone is spending time with family and I feel like I don't have that. My family is just my mom and I. Although we live together I've never felt like we've ever been really connected emotionally like other families are. But that's not the connection I feel like I'm missing at this time of year. I find myself longing for my own person to make my own family with.

I'm a pretty solitary person and I have trouble with both casual socializing (except when it's centered around a set activity) and forming connections with people. For the most part I feel like dating isn't worth the effort. I would have to spend a lot of time dealing with people I don't find interesting to find someone who I can form a connecting with which would be incredibly draining - I have an autoimmune condition and struggle with day to day life already. Even then I haven't had any kind of relationship since high school (26 now) so I'd be way inexperienced. Plus living with my mother is awkward and embarrassing but financially I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future. 

A lot of this sounds like excuses to not put myself out there and maybe it is, but I spend more time content with my situation than not so I'm unlikely to actually do anything about it. In a couple of days I'll probably go back to just carrying on with my life but I'm sad now and felt the inexplicable need to write about it where strangers on the internet who might be feeling the same way can see.",lonely,Christmas blues,2020-12-25 09:21:06

it’s christmas... a normal person should be able to at least have an uneventful and boring christmas, right?

nope, not for me and my dysfunctional family. my dad is an alcoholic and he literally ran away from home a couple of months ago. he isn’t even in the same country as me and my mom right now so tell me how can he still ruin me and my moms christmas? 
well, my mom decided to call him to wish a happy christmas because well she somehow still cares about him and it ended up with them screaming at each other at 9pm and my mom crying while everyone in my apartment complex is having their nice family christmas dinner.

i wasn’t wishing for a happy christmas eve, not at all. i’m miserable and i don’t even feel any type of happiness regarding any holiday anymore, not even my own birthday but all i wished was for at least a peaceful day where i could watch some movies alone in my room, forgetting that my life sucks at least for a short moment. is that too much to ask for? i’m pissed because it’s not like it’s just today, this happens almost everyday. every day i have to listen to my dad talk crap about me and my mom, my parents screaming at each other or him even threatening us. it’s an everyday thing.

I spent the first 30 years of my life doing what I thought would make me happy: making lots and lots of money and trying to get lots and lots of women. 

By the time I was 33 I had $1,000,000 of income and I was supporting my mother my father my girlfriend and her two teenage kids. I was PROUD that everyone around me felt provided for and happy, but when I checked deep inside my core I realized that I was still not satisfied and felt so alone. I almost felt duped because somewhere in my mind I imagined that the money, the cars, the homes, the sex, the traveling, and the popularity would get me to feel satiated and satisfied with my life. Oh was I wrong! I turned to alcohol, weed, porn, and cheating to cover up the pain and lonlieness. 

It took me a lot of pain and self-reflection and discovery to finally find my purpose in life. Since that point nothing satisfies me more than being in my purpose and watching it develop. No amount of money, no amount of women, no amount of fame makes me feel more powerful than doing what is in alignment with my purpose as a man.

1093,Tesla44289,1608837615,1,"Hi lads.

I‘m a 16 year old male and it feels like I‘m wasting my youth.

I am autistic what makes me incrediby socially awkward.

I have asthma, together with muscle hypotension. This basically means that I am unable to get better at any kind of sport. For example: I did one hour of endurance training two times a week for one year. My endurance didn’t improve the slightest bit.

I am slightly overwheight, not much, maybe 5 kilos. The problem is that all the fat is collecting at my thighs, and that gives me a very feminine body figure. That of course isn’t attractive for girls.

I sweat a lot. A LOT! Especially in the face.
Everywhere on my body I sweat as much as normal people, but my face starts sweating incredibly fast. That of course is unattractive to girls too. I get nervous when I talk to girls. When I get nervous I start to sweat in the face —&gt; the girl doesn’t want to talk to me, I look disgusting.

To make clear _how_ fast I start to sweat:
I can walk around outside at -1*C without a jacket and after about 10 minutes I start to sweat. But only in the face! Dammit!

As far as my research goes this is caused by a disease called Hyperhidrosis Facialis.

There is no cure for that disease.

It really hurts to see all my friends getting GFs while I‘m walking around alone.

I have some normal hobbies (playing the piano, playing badminton).

But I also have incredibly nerdy hobbies (fixing and collecting electronics, keeping giant snails as pets).

Most of the time I can only get into a conversation with my friends if I start the conversation. Sometimes they contact me, but that‘s very rare.

I already know that I‘ll be forever alone.

Sorry for the bad English, I‘m from Germany.

1095,demons89,1608837130,1,"Well, I wanted to share an experience I just had today, not specially nice, but anyway It made me think about many things. About 2-3 weeks ago I left a WhatsApp group I was together with some old high school classmates. Basically most of the time I shared something I was plainly ignored, but the popular people always got reactions for their messages, so I was just starting to feel like an outsider, maybe I was disturbing them. But the main reason I decided to leave, was that I work at an elderly home, and all of them know it, yet since COVID-19 started not a single one of them asked me how it was going at my job or how I was, we had positives at our centre, and myself and other employees were contagious, and we lost costumers. We had a nasty month like at most hospitals. Quietly I left the group without telling anybody in private or the group. Since then, I hadn't heard anything from any of them, so I thought that was the importance they gave me, they could not care less I left. I was just forgetting it.   
Today I discovered I was wrong, one of the members just asked me directly via WhatsApp, and from nowhere, why I left, the tone was lightly aggressive, but I answered politely, I told him I wasn't participating in the conversations much, I was feeling out of the group and bored, and the COVID-19 reason I gave above. Surprisingly he angrily told me that my attitude mas very unrespectful, and typed me some personal attacks about my personality, with very bad taste. He told me he had lost a friend because of COVID-19, and we all had personal problems, but that there wasn't any reason to share them openly. I internally thought what was the meaning of having friends if you can't talk openly about your issues, at least sometimes. He finally told me I was a depressive and a failure of a person, and that we had just finished forever. I am still surprised about this interaction, considering I haven't seen him in person in two years, and we haven't talked by phone a single time. Considering the dates we are, and everything I was kind of depressed most of the day, but I thought I would deal with it worst at first. I'm really diagnosed with anxiety and depression, so the personal attack was specially painful but whatever, we can't change what people think about ourselves.

Ahh, I can say with certainty that this is the worst year in my life by far, the year started off with my long-term girlfriend dumping me before I finished highschool, the pandemic and quarantine came, I worked my ass off with my toxic father doing insulation on houses during summer, never felt so lonely in my life, summer passes, autumn comes, things finally come into the right place and my mom, little brother and sister basically run away from the house we lived with him, were living in a small apartment still getting the hang of it, mother's got Covid, nothing serious but it means we're gonna be locked during the holidays till a day before new year, that should cover the basics,

1108,WhyAmIStillAliveF,1608827983,1,"Hi guys

So this morning something super minor happened that made me realize how lonely I actually am. 

I'm an international student living thousands of miles away from my country, where my friends, family, and dog live. 

At first when I left my country, I was very excited because I wanted to go as far as possible from my abusive family. When I think of those terrible times related to my family, I still get happy that I've managed to escape, but the thing is I think I'm not where I need to be rn and I need to escape from here too. Maybe I need to escape from life in general.

Anyways, because of the distance and time difference I didn't really manage to stay in touch with many of my friends. Realizing that people who were once so important to me are slowly becoming strangers hurts so fucking much. 

Thanks to online studying I couldn't manage to make new friends at university. The voice in my head tells me that it's not only because of online studying,  it's more because I'm an awkward idiot that nobody wants to be friends with.

I thought I made one friend, they suggested to have a call to get to know each other better but then they forgot about it. 

I feel like like it's in one of The Strokes songs:

"" I want new friends, but they don't want me
They have some fun, but then they just leave
Is it just them, or maybe all me?
Why my new friends don't seem to want me""

Anyways I spend so much time worrying about this, I just wish I didn't give a fuck about not having friends and being lonely.

Thanks for listening :' )

Happy holidays!",lonely,I don't want to care about being lonely,2020-12-25 03:39:43

Really low. Realizing that people have friends, and family, they get to share their day with just made me feel the worst I have felt this whole season. I wish I had friends to share the day with.

Until a few months ago I never thought I’d end up in this subreddit as I consider myself an optimistic person but the pandemic has affected my mental health severely. Mixed with my loneliness from previous years, things have gotten much much worse.

As a way to cope, I recently started to write stuff in a journal. I know it’s pretty basic but it works (atleast for me). I don’t even like writing but I often wait to get back home to write about how I’m feeling. I see it as a way to escape - a place where no one can judge you cause no one can see what you’re doing/thinking.

You don’t have to limit yourself in the way you express your feelings. Draw/paint/write music/ anything that comes to mind.

(One important thing is to avoid self pity as it just reinforces something negative rather than acting as a way of venting out)

Also, if you guys have any other recommendations that help you cope, you can mention them down below so that it benefits all of us.

Much love to everyone :)",lonely,How I’ve started to cope with loneliness and how it might help you as well? // open to new suggestions,2020-12-24 19:08:03

1182,Emotional_Car_3727,1608788162,1,"I know there's something wrong.... I just don't know what and I don't know what to do about it now...

This is long and basically encompasses the last 9 years of my life and explains how it leads to me now being all alone...

I had a terrible terrible high school experience. I was lucky enough to be dating a cute girl who had friends and they were kinda my friends? But apart from that I walked to lunch alone, didn't have people to invite to a birthday party so didn't celebrate, had literally everyone (including those friends) talk shit about me even when I was around, and literally had no students sign my year book.

Anywho then comes college where I decided I'd be better about having a social life and social circle. And you know what, I did it. I had a group of friends, got very close to one of them so yaay I had good friends. Now I was still dating the same girl from high school, but long distance (and a crazy time difference where we were essentially 12 hours apart). This ""best friend"" of mine back stabs me (you'll see a trend here) and my entire social circle thinks I did something crazy (I still don't know what) and I lose all of them as friends. Now at the same time my girlfriend isn't happy about how close I am to this ""best friend"" and plus the long distance and she dumps me. So within a week I go from a huge friend circle and a girlfriend to literally no friends. So yeah basically college was a total fuck show. My mental health went to shit and I lost all my self confidence and self esteem. Tried dating and making friends but I was shit at it. So spent the next 2+ years of college almost all alone. I somehow made a great friend in Junior year who was really good to me and got me. So I had a friend yaay. But she clearly cared less about me than I cared about her, but big deal. I had a friend, and she called me her best friend so even more yaay? But in general my college experience was disgusting. Never went to a party, never kissed a girl, never did anything I could look back at and laugh.

So then I graduate and move to a different state. Of course now I can make friends right? Hell no cuz I'm still a nervous wreck and have social anxiety and my mental health is down in the dumps. So I first spend a few months settling into a new place and then decide that I'll start figuring out how to make friends. Oh wait, covid hits so now I'm all alone, with literally everything being closed. Then my ""best friend"" from college (the one who cared about me less than I did about her?) starts getting distant. Starts off with her ignoring a text I sent asking for her to be there cuz I was having a rough time. She ignores it for 5 days all while constantly posting on all her social media and then replies with a ""sorry I haven't touched my phone in a week."" So yeah this continues getting worse. Luckily a couple of folks from college who were acquaintances, start talking to me and we become friends so I do have some friends right. Well a lot of shit happens in the next few months (I don't want to talk about it individually) and now these 2 friends are mad at me cuz I have too much shit going on and it turns out I'm selfishly using them as therapists. I mean they're not wrong that I've been throwing a lot of stuff at them, but it's just a reminder that there's clearly something wrong with me.

People constantly leave me. When I tried online dating it was literally a joke cuz 0 matches in 3 years? If I start an anonymous conversation and it leads to swapping pics I'm ghosted or blocked as soon as I send my picture. So clearly there's something wrong with the way I look too. So idk what to do because I cannot afford plastic surgery for sure. And even if I could idk how to change everything about me cuz there's clearly nothing good here?

I'm so tired of crying myself to sleep every night? If I hadn't managed to get a dog a fw months back I'd probably be in a worse place right now. At least now I have a reason to get out of bed every morning. But honestly, what is wrong with me :/

PS: Sorry I didn't use the flair, I honestly don't know what this is. Maybe a vent, maybe me asking for advice, maybe me hoping someone out there gets me, maybe it's a plea/cry for help.

1183,Foxus67,1608787824,1,"It happened weeks ago but I still feel like it happened today.

I will try to be as brief as possible, I(M22) met this friend (F21), 2 years ago through Tinder, basically we talked every day, and little by little I became fond of her, she made me happy to talk to her, we sent each other photos of anything we did, from our faces smiling or doing anything stupid, it was cool to talk to her and we basically knew everything about each other, we literally talked everyday.

She was studying about 2 blocks from my university in another university (like 10 minutes walking).

About the year we spoke on WhatsApp, I started to like her and I said why don't I ask her out? well I did and she told me that she couldn't,I said no problems there will always be another chance in the future.

In short I invited her to my birthday (in the 2 years), to go out when I was alone at lunch in the university, or going to the park or see a movie, anything really.

After she rejected me for the fifth time in a year I asked her what was happening, she told me that she was ashamed to meet in person, I understood her but I told her that I was in the same conditions than her,I had fear that maybe I was too ugly to her, basically she promised me that we would see each other at the end of the year.

I invited her to hang out in new year and then the same thing happened, I was angry at the time but I was afraid of losing her and not having anyone to talk to in the day, so the one who ended up apologizing was me.

And then another year passed, we still talking in Whatssapp and I started to think, how sad that the person you considered your best friend might even start having affection like love, to be just a WhatsApp chat that you may never meet in person?.

Basically one day I started to think, was it worth it to continue being rejected over and over again and lower my self-esteem or just finish things?.

I basically did the second, I told her that I had a lot of patience with her but everything has a limit, I said to her she was a terrible friend and she broke her promise and from that day we stopped talking.

Honestly, on one hand I regret what I did because she was the only person I spoke to in the day but at the same time I can't forgive her because I really tried to do things right but seeing how she almost made me beg to finally meet her made me feeling like 
I was nothing.

I really thought she would give a bit of a fight, try to fix things and look for a happy ending but no, we haven't talked for about a month and I feel like things really are over, maybe I lost my first true friend and almost everyday I feel that void that she left in me.

I just can’t deal with this loneliness right now, everyone is busy at the moment and it reminds me of my trauma I had experienced back in 2013. (please don’t ask about it, if I’m comfortable with you; I will talk about it) I need this loneliness to vanish even if it’s atleast for a small limited amount of minutes, I just don’t need to be in that mental state again of vulnerability.

I’ve always looked at my life at how fortunate I was. Even though I have a good amount of flaws, I’ve always been great full to have the people around me, who love me. I’m a pretty damn passionate person. If I’m dating someone, I 100% commit to them. If I can’t do that then there’s no point in the relationship anymore. I REALLY liked this girl. I thought I was the luckiest person to find someone that meant that much to me so early in my life. When she left my world crashed around me, even though things are pretty much the same. I think that when I saw the shitty things in my life I would just say, “well I have her and I’ll be fine.” Now those things are toppling over each other while I’m stumbling all over the place trying to fix them. But at this same time, there’s this growing loneliness. I don’t get it because I have plenty of friends. I literally own a Minecraft server with 20 people on it. And I have my family, my family all love me, and are great people. I love everyone in my life so much, but there’s just an empty hole in my heart that she left and it just sits there aching and waiting to be filled again...

1201,ShakiraIsBae,1608779363,1,"I began watching Mindhunter today. I’m trying to sleep now, wondering about why I’ve never had a girlfriend.

I’m not a psychopath, I’ve met others guys and girls older and younger than me who have never had a girlfriend.
I feel like there is something wrong with me. I’m 19, I have this feeling I’m not normal.
These people and I must have something wrong with us. I want someone to comment and explain to me why I’m feeling like this. Girls must’ve just seen something bad about me in high school.
I wasn’t a band kid, football player or outgoing. I was normal, if I was so normal why have I never had an important person in my life?
I must have something in common with these people who have never had a GF/BF. I saw a comment on Reddit about this guy who couldn’t communicate with his girlfriend because he would rather make small talk than have deep meaningful conversation. I related to that guy, I can talk about random shit with people, music cars, or the city. 
Seeing how everyone in high school dated and I still haven’t dated. I’m a whiner, I always look at the past or future, I don’t live in the moment. There were two different girls in high school who liked me during my senior year. I rejected both of them, because I was scared and thought “if they like me, there must be something wrong with them”. For the first time in my life, a girl liked me and I didn’t chase after her. I’ve always chased after girls who didn’t want me. 
I thought there was something wrong with them because they liked me. I’m scared of the future, if I can’t get a girlfriend now I will be lonely until someone pities me. I have these misogynistic thoughts sometimes.
I try to ease the pain by telling myself the following things:
“A girlfriend will just waste your money”
“She will dump you eventually”
“Why date when your heart will be broken anyway”
“Why waste time on her when I can spend it working out”
“She will only see me as a wallet”
“She will destroy my mental health”
“She will judge me”
“She will manipulate me”
“She will change my personality and my friends, coworkers, and family will hate her and me”

Guys, I need attention please. Give me attention. If you’re reading this tell me there’s something wrong with me. Tell me I’m a menace to society. I’m a monster, I’m a weirdo, I’m a loser.
Or tell me I’m overthinking, the devil is inside, these thoughts are because Ive stopped working out, I’m awesome, charismatic, a good son, brother, friend.

Who am I? Why haven’t I found love when even the weird, lonely men have girlfriends?

I never meet the right person, I can’t talk to girls. It usually ends up being forced. A stupid conversation about my major, family, career, funny videos, music. 
The conversation doesn’t last two weeks, then I hear women say “the talking stage should last 1-2 months”
Like are you stupid, I don’t even talk to my friends everyday. With guys it’s so easy, we talk about music, cars, women, games.
I’m just gonna jerk off, sleep and wake up to another 9-5 bullshit. Come home, eat 200 calories, jack off, play a video games, nap, eat, sleep and do it over again. 
My friends are not my friends, I don’t have real friends, I get attached to easily to everyone.
I have an addictive personality, if I like something I have to keep doing it. 
I like pushups, I have to do like 200 a day.
I like food, I have to keep eating the same food
I like games, I have to keep playing them
Bars, keep doing em
Weed, keep smoking it
Vape, keep hitting it
Talk to girls, keep doing it
Hangout with friends, want to do it everyday
Work, want to do it everyday
Laugh, I want to keep doing it
Can’t leave the shower
Can’t get out of bed
Can’t stop tapping
Can’t stop eating out
Can’t clean my room, if I clean it I have to clean it completely in one go
Binge Netflix
I hate this life, I have good things going for me
I have time when I feel amazing, motivated.
That shit doesn’t last more than two weeks.
If I read something, I have to keep reading it
If I had a girlfriend, I would ruin my life
I would forget all my goals, and be needy.
I’m jealous, insecure, controlling. Well I’m actually none of those things, I’ve never done anyone of those things, how can I call myself bad things when I’ve never done them.
I had this friend who used to say “I’ll stop doing drugs when I get a girlfriend”
I used to believe him.
I realize now, his drugs use will never end. My motivation and lack of discipline will not go away when I get a girlfriend. It will only become worse!
She will mentally drain me, waste my time and I won’t be able to achieve my goals. So what’s the solution?

I know I’ve posted here before but I can’t stop posting at places like this because I can’t stop thinking about this. It just revolves in the back of my mind all the time. It’s every day from morning to night, it’s a gnawing desire which consumes me. Would I be satisfied if I could actually attain a relationship? Possibly not but this longing to find a way to get into one, to experience true love and affection and intimacy, and a great life, has turned into an obsession for me. It is driving me to tears at this point it’s so frustrating. I know other people are going through the same thing, I know I’m in a sub full of them. I understand that, I’m sympathetic to you all. I want the best for you all. This is a desire though which I can’t ignore. It aches and makes me restless.

I’m sick of seeing gatherings of my friends I wasn’t invited to, trying to talk to them about it, and then NOTHING changes. 

I’m sick of family members, people I talk too, therapists, saying ‘it will get better’, ‘Everyone goes through this’ and trying to offer advise and solutions. Fuck off, no you don’t, all of you had a friend group and best friends in high school. No shit, I know my problems, I know how to fix them, stop fucking saying that shit. And will it really get better? I’ve been plugging away for quite a while now, and at this point I don’t think I ever will. 

I’m sick of being so emotionally and physically needy, which is kind of a result of withdrawing a piece of myself from I think every interaction I have all the time? And now I’m finally seeing someone who might be able to help with that, and I’m scared my neediness will fuck it up. Not to mention ALL the insecure thoughts of insecurity.

I’m tired of dealing with the guilt that my problems don’t matter. Tired of dealing with the guilt that there are people who are starving, people who are alone, people who are attacked for existing, and people who have no one, whose problems are worse than mine ever will be. And so you suck it up and deal with it, because at the of the day, you have way more than 90%+ people in the world right now.

Look, at the end of the day, I’ll keep putting myself out there, texting first, all that jazz. At the end of the day it’s the only thing that gets you anywhere in this shithole world. But I’m so so tired of all the pain and effort it takes to do that shit.

Earlier today I had the urge to buy a woman flowers and go on a coffee date. Like I was literally running through every aspect of that scenario in my mind. From the type of flowers I would purchase, to bringing them to her, to seeing her reaction. Anyone else?

I am single so I just ended up going to Starbucks by myself lol.

I have never been in a serious relationship. When I was younger there or a couple people I had talked to but, I quickly realized I was not interested in them and therefore no serious relationships took place. Because of that I just decided to focus on college and career.

1230,Raphelm,1608772282,1,"It blows my mind when I see couples who have no secrets for each other, they feel completely at ease with each other, freely express how they feel, do everything together, etc. 

Meanwhile, I don’t allow anyone to get to truly know me. I never talk about my problems, no matter how serious they are. I deal with everything on my own. I’ve been very close from ending myself several times but nobody around me, not even my closest childhood friends or family members, have any idea I’ve ever felt particularly down at all. 

I’m not at ease with intimacy whether it’s moral or physical. I don’t even want to be looked at. Every time I’ve been physical with someone, I felt uncomfortable for them because I feel like everyone is out of my league. The little experience I have is due to girls making the first moves but still, I just can’t perceive myself as someone anyone could actually want. 

Anything related to romance stresses me out. I hate first dates with all my being, every time I had to get ready for one, I was almost praying for the girls to cancel.
I hate flirting, I turn everything into jokes instead and friendzone even if I’m interested. I’m a master in the art of sabotaging potential relationships. I just don’t allow myself to be loved. It’s crazy. 
Whenever the attention is on me, I take any opportunity to get out of it, like make the conversation about someone else, for example start talking about how great someone I know who’s also here is.

I’m 26, I’ve never had anyone in my life (romantically) and it’s like I’m too used to being alone and I don’t know how to share things. I feel like I’m too independant and didn’t learn how to rely on others, and I don’t like the thought of it. Mostly because I feel like a ticking time bomb in the sense I spent my life keeping everything to myself and I know I don’t need much to cry and would burst into tears when asked something as simple as “What’s wrong?”. I went to see a therapist once and cried maybe 30 seconds into the session.
I hate knowing something is wrong with me, I don’t want people to have pity for me. I’m trying too hard to show I’m fine, that I don’t have problems. I can’t imagine myself admitting I’m the exact opposite out loud to people.
I don’t forgive myself anything, I try to reach perfection when it comes to everything I do, except that I can’t always live up to my expectations and it makes me feel defeated.

1235,spiderpig123v,1608769725,1,"I feel so alone all the time

All my friends never want anything to do with me
Like they don't see me or don't care.
Like even friend 1 who was my best friend doesn't even see me or want anything to do with me.

Like I can ask someone to hang out with me and they come out, but they'll never ask me to hang out with them no matter who it is, like my friendship f group do stuff but won't ask me to come out with them unless it's conditional or I'm a last person to ask, sometimes not even that.

Like today friend 1 asked friend 2 to go on a walk with him, its usually me and friend 1 who go on walks together, but he didn't ask me, and friend 2 didn't go, and he still didn't ask me if I wanted to go on a walk.

none of them ever ask me to join the group calls with them, friend 3  and 2 have been so shitty to me recently, I've been ignoring it but it builds up and I can't even get myself to go in the call anymore because I just feel they'll start shitting on me again. 

I just want someone to ask me to do something with them thats from their own thought and want instead of it being conditional or for a specific reason where they need to ask me to, I just wanna be able to speak to one of them from them asking me if I'm okay but I know that won't happen.

And with my girlfriend too, like she likes her own space, she doesn't like messaging much and so she naturally doesn't like messaging me, and it sucks because I just want to have somebody close who wants to talk to me, but instead it's opposite with her, I feel like she just messages me when she needs to or when she feels bad, it rarely feels like she wants to message me or call me.

It feels so shit and I feel so alone, nobody to talk to, nobody who wants to talk to me, nobody who wants my company.

It's like with the whole Christmas thing and seeing my gf, i really wanted to see her on Christmas  more than anything but she don't feel the same, I'm pretty sure the only reason shes asked me to come over in the end is because she feels bad after speaking about it with her parents and them wanting me over or them maybe telling her that she should want me over.

I fucking hate this feeling of not being wanted, yeah she loves me Definitely I can tell, but I don't think she wants me in her company much because I know she likes her space, even when it comes to get friends which I can fully understand. it just feels a bit crap, I just feel so lonely, like even the person I love and loves me back doesn't want me there on christmas because SHE wants me there for herself.

Or my friends don't want me to be with them in call or in person because they want me there.

I never get the feeling of being wanted and I feel I have nobody to talk to about my feelings without them getting mad at me for not telling them before, or because they won't agree with my feelings or think I'm being unreasonable. 

It feels horrible having nobody to talk to.

I have to put everything in my notes as a way to get it all out of my system to feel like I can talk about it to someone, or now it's just talk about it to something.

1261,NekoLuvr85,1608755402,1,"TW: For negative self-talk.

I recently caught a 30-day ban on Facebook. I know, I know - that's a dumb thing to be upset about. Except, for me, Facebook accounts for approximately 90% of my social interaction that happens outside of work. Oh, but I'm working from home, so now that doesn't even happen. My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting by being upset at all. He thinks social media is overrated, and says that I post too much anyway. He said this, but then got upset when I told him he'll be ""happy to know"" about my ban. 

Facebook is the main way that I keep in touch and interact with friends and family. This might be easier on me if it wasn't so close to the holidays. I normally post pictures of my kids opening presents and of us making cookies and things like that, and now I can't. 

On top of that, it's now been a week since my ban started, and not one person has reached out to check on me. I went from posting multiple times a day everyday to now basically blackout, and no one seems to think that's odd, or felt like checking on me for it. I've thought many times about quitting Facebook on my own, but I stay because without it I'm faced with the reality.... that I'm alone. No one actually cares about me. Aside from my parents and my bf, if I passed away tomorrow, no one would care, or even know about it. I wouldn't be missed. I'm not missed now. 

Someone on a different post in this sub mentioned ""pretty privilege"" allowing you to make friends more easily. I think that I have that (I would disagree, but I feel like other people would say that) but being ""pretty"" only takes you so far. Between being introverted in person, and just weird and awkward in general, I can't make new friends. 

I don't think it's narcissistic to want someone to give a damn about me other than people I'm dating or that just want to fuck me.

Add to this, in recent years, a few people I used to consider my best friends abandoned me. Not that we had an argument, they just lashed out and then blocked me. In each situation I'm still confused as to why. So my ""best friends"" think I'm garbage and the other friends I have either don't view me as important or are just as introverted as me so we never talk. I can't make new friends, because that's just new people that will abandon me. Even my cousins don't really talk to me. 

I feel alone and lonely and like there's no one I can talk to that would actually understand what I'm feeling without minimizing it as, ""It's just social media."" I get that in the grand scheme of things, this really isn't a big deal, but all I've been able to think about for days is that no one cares that I'm gone or is even looking for me.

Even though I'm an introvert, I like being around people I enjoy and that enjoy my company as well. I've tried making events where I invite people, but in the end most, if not all, of them bail. Last year, my bf noticed my depression getting the better of me. He surprised me by making an event and inviting a bunch of my friends. About 15 people said they'd come, but within 2 hours before the event, all except 2 people canceled. Not saying they didn't have valid reasons - that's not for me to decide - but regardless of their reasoning, it still hurts when you expect to see people and they bail. This is not a new occurrence for me. It's been this way since I was a kid. I hardly had anyone show up to my birthday parties either (even when they said they would come.) 

It doesn't matter how ""pretty"" other people think I am, if they can't get something from me, then I'm not worth talking to. I'm either ""too pretty"" so people think I'm intimidating, or ""not pretty enough"" and so I stand out in the wrong ways. (Usually, this is because after 2 kids I'm not skinny anymore.) I keep gutting told to ""find your people"" and ""the right people will find you."" But where dey at though? I'm 35 and I still don't know how to make lasting friendships. I can't teach my kids how to love themselves or how to make friends when I don't even know how to myself. 

I'm stupid. I'm worthless. I'm boring. I'm useless. Too quiet. Or too loud. Or too slow. Or too much of anything to be able to find people that really love all of me. Literally, there's not even one.

The only people that will remember me when I am gone are family and as they go I will fade completely with them.  So I try to remind my self I need to live in the present.  The mistakes I made, people I have wronged, I need to learn from my mishaps.  The people in my life now I need to positively impact.  If I will be remembered, I don't want it to be out of anger or pain.  

I want to say I am lonely but I think that word is inaccurate. I think disconnected is the truest term.  Disconnected with the flow of time and the people moving in it..  as if I was a plastic bag whipping around on a highway full of speeding cars. Not moving forward with the rest but going somewhere, I would hope.  

I have had a bitter hermit mentality since I could remember.  I hate what our society has become and how apart we have pushed ourselves from one another. I observe the world and the people in it but as bitter as I am, I am also jealous of the life of others younger than me.  Why? I have done good for myself and at their age I was living life how I wanted.  Maybe I envy that the amount of time they have on this earth is longer than mine. That must be it...

I need to keep a clear head.  These negative thoughts and lowly pondering is only confirmation that I have to live right now, this exact moment.  I need to enjoy what I have and keep it dear to me.  I don't want my life to pass me by but it will do so much faster if I try living in the past or preparing for the future.

I don't usually post on Reddit, I just came across this sub. I hope you don't mind me venting.

My husband and I moved to a another country a little over a year and a half ago, right after we got married, six months later the pandemic happened right when I was getting ready to visit my family. I haven't  seen them since aug 2019 and it's starting to make me feel lonely but also anxious.

I'm mostly working from home, I haven't made any friends in my city and the only person I interact with IRL is my husband.

My family is in another continent,but my husband's family lives in the neighboring country so we do visit or they visit from time to time but lately I have been comparing and getting a little jealous. I hate the fact that I'm jealous of him for seeing his parents but it's there ,it's an ugly feeling and I wish I could crush.

What's worrying me is that I'm noticing how attached I became to my husband. Because of the pandemic we haven't developed any real friendships (new city, new jobs, working exclusively from home) doesn't help. So i find myself more and more home and anxious about going somewhere by myself.

I used to travel alone,tour Europe by myself and now it all has changed.

I don't know if there are more people noticing similar changes because of pandemic ?

And if there's anything that they are trying to get themselves out of this?

1312,chocolatebarz,1608729480,1,"Ending 2020 stuck in a limbo

First, I thank anyone who is actually going to be reading all of this as I feel like I need an outlet to explain my thoughts during these past couple weeks. 

2020 started off great for me initially and I was starting to feel things were looking up for me again during this past month after a shitshow of the rest of the year since the pandemic hit. However, these past couple weeks, my seasonal depression started kicking in more with other challenges that started to hit me again. I had my heartbroken three times this year by the same person. I’ve started to finally move on and get back into the dating scene during late November. at first, it felt great and my confidence was back. I also started getting opportunities in my career. I often told myself throughout the year that pursuing my passion was all that matters. All of my problems in the past don’t exist when doing so. Finally, all my hard work seemed to be paying off. I was starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Going on these dates helped me meet new people but i could tell it caused me to have a slight wall. It’s probably my defense mechanism to avoid getting hurt badly again. This didn’t mean that I was an ass, but I guess I just took things really surface level at first and left with a “whatever feeling” if they ghosted me or aren’t interested. It’s no hard feelings. Usually I’m the type who tries a bit more, I think I’ve grown tired and seeing the way these other partners communicate, I lose interest quickly too. It helps that I’ve had a busy couple months, but I know it’s because I’m still not truly over my ex/ex friend. The attention is nice for awhile but it’s not the intimacy I’m truly seeking. I match with these other people and it’s fun to see they’re attracted to you too but after the little flirting phase, sex or first date, it usually leaves me so unsatisfied and unfulfilled (I know what did I expect). I’m starting to realize what I truly prefer from dating is a genuine connection, not casual anymore. 

During this time, I also noticed myself getting super wrapped up in my ego that I seemed to only focus on myself. This is out of character for me but I think it’s also bc I’m just emotionally and mentally drained. I needed all of these distractions and it disguised it as excitement and happiness for me. I’ve always been the one to listen and care for others, so it was such a refreshing change for me at the time since I had so much going on. 

Flash forward to now, and like the title says, I’m currently in limbo. I’m grounded back to reality and I know I should pause on dating until I figure myself out again. The opportunities in my career are in a waiting period rn, especially since it all got overwhelming to me. I’m trying to take it one day at a time. I’m also trying to be in the loop of my friends and family’s lives but I’ve been more in isolation since I’m still so mentally and emotionally drained. I’ve been spending this past week oversleeping and staying up too late. It’s weird. At the start of this year, I fell in love with my own company but now I’m currently lonely. I’m an introvert but this is a different type of lonely. Maybe I’m just waiting to know what’s gonna happen next. 

Thanks for reading this if you did. Hopefully someone can relate to this. I hope I’m not alone &lt;3

Where do I even begin? Maybe the beginning? I guess I can start by saying I've never posted anything like this before.

There's going to be a lot but it'll all come together in the end. 

I was diagnosed with depression several years ago after seeing a therapist about suicidal ideation, I had lost control and tried to cut my wrists but was able to stop myself. Didn't realize I had been dealing with depression most of my life until a doctor pointed out the patterns and that's when it clicked. Anyway, Ive been handling it better since then but I recently broke up with what I thought was the love of my life. 

The relationship didn't start off perfectly, we did some things together that I'm actually ashamed of but we decided to be freinds because she was going to be leaving the area, going to the other side of the country actually. Anyway we were best friends for two years, until October of 2019 when we decided to try a long distance relationship. This girl.. she was amazing, I loved her and she loved me. We'd play video games together, watch movies together by syncing them on our tvs every Friday night, we talked all the time. We're things perfect? No, we still had our disagreements, but we always got over them and figured things out. I was going to work til the end of 2021 and save money to move to oklahoma and she was going to move too, so we could be together, we had even talked about marriage, but we wanted to wait til we were together. 

Last month I took a trip out to see her, this was actually my second trip, I had taken one in July. The first time I took a plane and rented a car when I got there, this time I drove the full thirty hours straight, no sleep, no food (well some snacks). Things were going great at first but then she saw me watch a tik tok of some girl shaking her hips and that was it. She said it felt like I cheated on her, and that I broke her heart, and called me a liar.. among other things. I stayed for four more days trying to fix things but she refused to be reasoned with, she became so cold, so I left. Looking back now I realize that I was blinded by my love for her, I see that she was gaslighting me for almost the entire relationship, hiding things from me, starting fights over nothing, and she had me convinced I was the bad one. I never hid anything, never lied any more than your typical white lies, never gaslighted. I just wanted an honest, real relationship. I'm also fairly certain she cheated on me, she hid from me the fact that she had been hanging out with another guy, and when I found out she became very defensive and said over and over that I was being insecure and he was just a friend. Well they got together a week after we broke up. 

It's been over a month since then and I miss her more than ever, not because I want to be with her, but because she was my best friend, I still love her more than anything. The reason I mentioned the depression earlier is because I've been feeling it coming back, I can feel it gnawing on the edges of my mind. Ive had suicidal thoughts, I'll admit, but it's nothing I'm not used to, nothing I can't control. It still scares me though. I just don't understand how you can go from loving someone to refusing to speak to them over something so small. It almost feels like the girl I fell in love with never even existed.. but I know she's still in there somewhere, and I refuse to give up on her. These last several weeks have been soul crushing. I don't even care if she cheated, I'm not a hateful person and I can forgive. I just want my best friend back. She says she needs time but she wants me to feel bad for what I did (the tik tok vid) bit she doesn't seem to actually want to mend things

I feel like I just poured my heart out, and I obviously left out a lot of details but I don't really have anyone else to talk to, I have family and co-workers, but Its hard for me to talk to them about this kind of stuff.

TLDR;

Broke up with my dream girl/best friend, was possibly cheated on. Can feel my depression coming back and and have been very lonely for the last several weeks, ex gf/bff says she wants me to feel bad, but I still miss her for some reason.

1332,geordan_O-o,1608709100,1,"I'm a junior in high school, and I've been struggling with this feeling of loneliness and having no place for a lot of my life. When I was younger, in elementary school, I had many friends and never spent a day bored and alone. I was always outside playing with someone, and found it very easy to talk to people.

And then middle school came around. I had a friend group in 6th grade, me and two other girls, but they often chose each other over me which made me feel like shit. So I dropped them and never looked back. In 7th grade, I had found those friends that I knew I was going to have forever (I still do have them). We went everywhere together, did everything together. We hardly fought, and all we did with each other was laugh. We didn't even need to talk to have fun; we could sit in silence for hours and still feel content.

But just as I had found this amazing group of people, I moved ten hours away to fucking NORTHERN FLORIDA of all the places. Luckily at the time, I had just started learning about fanbases and things like that, so I made a bunch of internet friends that I would talk to all the time. So even though I had no friends face-to-face, I never felt alone. I always had an internet friend to text or facetime. Which I was completely fine with. Some people might think it's sad, but I didn't care. These friends understood me in a way no one else had before.

But in 9th grade, things started to change. Obviously, I began to grow out of my fangirl phase, as did all of my internet friends. Most of them were quicker to grow out of it than me, though, so I felt like I was kind of left behind. I had people to talk to in school, but very rarely did I ever hang out with anyone outside of school. I started to develop anxiety really bad. I overanalyzed everything I did and kept myself from pretty much talking to anyone who didn't speak to me first because I was so afraid of fucking up everything.

10th grade rolled around and I felt like it was going to be the year of breaking boundaries. And for a while, it was. I had forced myself to become closer with one friend in particular, and she invited me to do things with her and her friend group. We went to football games, did late night drives, and even went to homecoming together. But then they started to ghost me. We hung out one last time and I felt as though they were annoyed with me the entire time, even though I was finally starting to let my guard down and felt like I could be myself around them. I was spiraling into depression. The one friend that I trusted so much that I felt like I could come out to her had ghosted me and even stood me up at one point. I started to wonder if it was just me that was the problem.

And then, of course, the pandemic hit and all other doors to friendship kind of shut. Pretty quickly, I realized that I didn't mean much to anyone else. Nobody really texted me or cared to reach out. I reached out to some people who I thought I could be close friends with, but nothing ever really happened. I was trapped in my house for days on end, and sometimes it wasn't even because of quarantine; it was simply because there was nothing else for me to do anyway. I couldn't start college classes over the summer like I had planned to in the beginning of the year because all ACT/SAT dates were cancelled and I couldn't test into Dual Enrollment, which meant I had nothing to do for 5+ months but wallow in loneliness and sorrow.

Then the new school year came around. I got my license, got myself a job, was able to start college classes. All of a sudden, these new freedoms were opening up to me, but it felt like none of them mattered. I had no one to share my accomplishments with; no one who actually cared, anyway. I still had no friends outside of school, and always felt like I was getting pushed to the side. I went on my first ever date with a guy, but he basically told me straight up that he wanted it to just be a sexual thing, which didn't make me feel any better about my personality haha. I tried to become closer friends with another person, but I didn't realize that she didn't need friends as much as I did regardless of how quiet and shy she seemed. She already had a friend group that she was satisfied with. And then I started to realize that even most of the quiet kids who sit by themselves at school have fucking friends. They just don't blab about it to the world because it's not really any of our business. They're alone at school, but they're not lonely. They're content with being that way until they get to hang out with people who aren't pieces of shit. 

There are a few other people who I have tried to reach out to, but they don't want to hang out with me. And I'm sick of being the only person to reach out, it just becomes embarrassing after a while. I still have no one. Even my family makes life miserable for me at this point. My mom and I are really starting to grow apart. It feels like she hates me sometimes. I was never close with my sister, and I don't see that changing any time soon. Me and younger brother have always been close, but he's starting to blossom with popularity and friendship among his 8th grade class, which makes me feel like shit because I'm much older than him yet he's able to do so much better than me. My dad and I haven't been very close for a while now. I have an older brother that I'm also very close with, as well as his wife, but he lives far away from me. 

So I just feel trapped. I feel like I'm always going to be alone. I don't understand why I have to have this horrible anxiety and bad luck with finding people who are interested in getting to know me beyond what I show to the world. I just want to feel something with someone. I hope someone can relate to me, because even with my problems I feel alone.",lonely,Life is Pretty Shit,2020-12-23 18:38:20

Lately tho(probably due to covid), I have had these 'depressed episodes'. These 'episodes' consist of me lying in bed or just sitting, thinking about how I don't feel like I am needed or 'loved' by anyone. It almost physically pains when I do this.

I have also been feeling this void that I've been trying to fill with as many things as possible. I've tried partying, watching movies, gaming and talking with friends but it doesn't work. It's all temporary. As soon as I stop for a moment with distracting myself, I feel alone and depressed, like I have no one.

Distracting myself is making my sleep schedule go all whacky , to the point where I fall asleep at 5 am because I am either watching YouTube looking for distraction or thinking lonely thoughts.

All my life I’ve been a spender. I’m not proud of it, but I’m not ashamed of it either. When I look at my ins and outs history I do wince because of using savings to bail me out towards my car loan and my debt.

Most of it on credit is cleared now except for minor overdraft and I can clear that too. But I know I’m just gonna tumble again.

How to I commit to the craft of saving and making money? 

How do I create that mindset of appreciating my money more.

I visualised when I was in my late teens all the materials I wanted. I literally now have them all at 22 through loans and paying them off or paying back my mum.

Now I have no money saved to get me out of a shit job; especially during a pandemic; I refuse to use more savings, obviously and I can’t bring myself to curb habits and budget. 

I have almost paid off my phone. The use of contact lenses have become my life so they’re on pricey monthly instalments because I am now too anxious to go back to glasses unless I’m stuck in my room and i can never go back because of the confidence and new lease of life not having glasses gave me. As a child in school it made me feel like a lesser person. Now I can’t go back. I was one of the only kids in my school who needed glasses; in my younger years so it felt like a rare occurrence. And don’t give me shit about the gym membership either. All those things change my life so I ask for respect for making those decisions to take them out financially. They are a life investment in my eyes. I also pay my mum, car, and car insurance which aren’t cheap and just end up with nothing at the end of the month, which I guess is the same for most of the general public in my defence.",lonely,How to stop spending money because I’m lonely?,2020-12-23 13:20:10

I am alone, bored and empty.

All I do is play games on my pc or watch something on my phone, I play with my ""friends"", but that is all they call me for, I don't go out of my house. I know it is Covid and its December, but it has been like this for the past 3 years and even before that I was the one calling people to go out, my friend made fun of me for being fat and just bullied me with many other things, I have lost my self confidence since then, I felt like I was his punching bag, but a mental one. 

People never really wanted to be my true friends, even when I was 5 I got rejected.

Later on in middle school I was being left out of everything, on the ""big breaks"" (we call them like that in Serbia) I just walked around alone, outside, eating my food. 

I started calling people out in the first year of highschool, it was 2 people, the guy that bullied me and another person that was neutral. They used to talk while I just walked with them.

And since then 3 years have passed and I have went out maybe 4-5 times with friends I game with today and I have been invited to 2 parties (just because everyone was) where nobody talked to me, even though I knew everyone, and I just drank. 

I rarely speak in school because I have nothing interesting to say, I just listen. Sometimes people talk to me, but its about school or they need something. One guy has noticed I was sad, but I told them everything was fine. 

I rarely talk to girls and even when I do have nothing to say. 

I was walking home with this girl I liked and started talking to her for the first time (before we only said Hey to each other) I was really nervous and it was noticeable, but I kept talking to her, she asked me about my Instagram and I gave it to her, a few days later she dms me and we talk, she never dms me after that day and we are again on just ""Hey"".

We graduated and scattered across the country. I made some friends in college but never as cohesive a group, which was okay. 

In grad school I ""found my people"" but, much like high school, we scattered all over after graduation. 

I moved away from the continental US for three years, which let most of my friendships atrophy, just through the attrition that happens with distance. Not every friendship translates well to distance, so I learned not to take it personally. 

I moved back to the continental US. I've been settled in one place for three years. But I have no close friends even slightly close by. The dating pool is very small if you're gay. 

I've actually realized I've acclimated to so much time on my own. I... sorta forgot how to do community. Doesn't help I don't especially feel like I have a fit anywhere. 

In theory moving to a city might help. But I feel like if I do I'm only going to be scrambling to survive, rather than actually getting to live.

So for context I'm a European TCK who grew up in Asia my whole life, and am currently in uni in the UK. I also am considered clinically vulnerable to covid. So growing up I never really belonged anywhere? Not in my home country where I couldn't speak the language, nor anywhere in Asia as I was always an expat. Even though I'm part british I don't feel it either, and have an american accent so I don't fit in in any way here.

My partner of two years (we went to the same high school in Asia so we have a shared experience there) left the UK to spend Christmas back in Asia, and just got news that due to passport reasons, might be delayed for a few months coming back.

I've made no friends here because I had to take care of myself and everyone's been reckless corona wise, and now the only person I could safely spend time with indoors with is gone for an indeterminate period of time (last time with lockdown we didn't see each other for 7 months).

There's nothing I can do about any of this, I've been in contact with lots of friends online n shit but it's not the same as physical contact or intimacy.

The worst thing are the nights, as my partner and I used to call and talk asleep to each other pretty much every night, and now I'm just in an empty bed, where it's just too quiet.

Sorry if I'm rambling or if things don't make a load of sense, I don't really expect anyone to read this and I took all identifying info out.

That’s why people who tend to be very popular have some of the things I mentioned above. Almost every really popular person has something of value that attracts people.

In a way it's all my fault I don't leave the house, I don't socialise mainly because I get extremely nervous and uncomfortable, on top of that I suffer from extreme depression and suicidal tendencies, I don't think a girl wants to deal with that, but to be honest I do get upset, today I went to the mall to get a haircut and all I saw was couples, holding hands, kissing and christmas shopping made me feel alone and pathetic. I haven't spoken to my friends since my last day at high school (2018) and everybody who was single now has a SO, but me. I often ask myself wants wrong with me, I'm I that repulsive or do people just look at me and decide ""yup, he's weird"". I remember last year my grandfather's sister had a birthday party, I don't see that side of the family often and strangely I was wearing the same colour shirt as the staff, as I walked passed any female they actually looked at me like I was going to drug and rape them, they would actually cover their food and drinks or just walked away when I sat down, I know I'm not handsome but I do have feelings, a woman's husband actually came up to me and asked ""Hey, is there a problem here?, your making my wife and daughter uncomfortable please just fuck off"".  I was so hurt, I felt like crying, they don't know me, they don't know that I was actually family, I sat alone in the corner no one came up to talk to me, I didn't even get a plate of food. My grandfather's sister than hugged me and introduced me to people, the look of shock on their faces. My main goal in life was to get married and have a couple kids by 25, have a big house on a farm, to have a total of 12 kids ( I know :)), a bunch of dogs and other animals everywhere, to have/make enough money to afford everything and maybe some luxuries and to have a beautiful wife that loves me unconditionally , and when the kids are all grown up and have their own families they bring the grandkids over to stay the weekend. Maybe I'll find her soon or I'll find her when I'm in my 40's or never at all. I hope I have the strength to wake up everyday.

 I actually went to 3 psychics and they all said the same thing about my future wife which was actually scary ( if you want to know want they said just let me know).

What was once a very comedic and lighthearted film for me as a child turned into a crying fit as I realized the utter helplessness of the Phil in his situation. 2020 hurt me (all of us) a lot. Occasionally I would have the urge to want to go to the library or try maybe finding a club to join only to be halted by this virus.

Adapting was somewhat possible, but talking to people face to face is not replicable. Phil Conners was very closed off and bitter toward other people and suffered from a cynical attitude of others. He was forced to change his perspective and he had to get comfortable with the day by day repeated dialogue of the people around him.

What really got me was how he eventually found peace in his new life and was nice and genuine to others under the assumption that this curse would continue for all eternity. My situation by no means lines up with the plot of the movie but it got me thinking again about how afraid I have always been to reach out and talk to people and how hard it is for me to explain what's going through my head...like what I say wouldn't matter.

I took her across the US and traveled from California to Maine. When her anxiety was through the roof I told her I would take care of us and I worked 12-13 hour shifts at my job to provide for us. I told her she was beautiful and that I loved her everyday. We literally just signed a 14 month lease on an apartment together in October when I found out.

Not everything was perfect, sometimes I was too hard on her. I pushed her to do the things she wanted/needed to do. But I didn’t know that our entire relationship was a complete joke to her that she literally started cheat the same day we got together.

Except I'm still here, trying to continue piecing myself together of what he nearly destroyed of me. Yet I found out he got married right after he left me (we almost got married too). How can he be so happy and married after he destroyed me with his abuse? And I am still here, unable to love again and sitting in solitude, wondering if maybe he was right. That no one will love me.

That's only a small part of me however. Something that recently resurfaced when I found out that news. I just have to keep reminding myself that I learned something that many don't get the opportunity to do. I learned to love and respect myself. I created my own backbone. I cut off toxic friends and yes, that made me more lonely. But I have a few genuine friends. Real friends. I love myself over anything else and that has been driving me to achieve what I have achieved.

It's hard to shake that feeling of solitude out of my mind. Will I really be single forever? I know I choose too. I love my solitude. It's quiet, and peaceful, but deep down, I can feel that the love I have wants to burst out and be given to someone. But my heart is afraid of being torn to pieces again. So I choose to remain alone, in my apartment, with my cat. I grew up with no real family aside from my grandparents. My real parents are dead and were never a part of my life. Even so, I went through a lot of trauma with my grandmother which made me an easy target for him.

Five years of naivety. Five wasted years if gaslighting, conditioning, and so much more. This pandemic doesn't help. I was planning on having dungeons and dragons game nights this year--something I've never done, and the pandemic ruined it. I would have been able to bring and select friends for my social circle. That's out the window.

1475,No_Drive_1939,1608626949,1,"i’ve been best friends with my friend since 6th grade, but it was one of those friendships where we would have fall outs every now and then. she’s had a LOT friends that have come and gone in the past. and i mean a lot. when these friends came around, she often chose them a lot of the time over me. which was fine i wasn’t gonna be like “you can’t have any friends” because i have my own too. but i’ve always been the backup friend. i’d be dropped in a second but whenever i’d confront her, she’d never apologize or listen and would just ghost me. it often ended in me apologizing after a while and becoming friends again. she never really apologizes like ever and usually just makes excuses. i wish i was exaggerating. but, you know, she’s my best friend and i would always be there for her. and her family is like my 2nd family to the point where i have the key to her house. she made friends with another girl from work and her sister and they’re really sweet and funny. 

then i got a boyfriend around a year and a half ago. he’s the best. he’s kind and polite and treats me really well. he’s kind of like a boy version of me. but he loves me and takes the time to show me that he appreciates me. anyway enough of the lovey dovey stuff. he’s got a really nice jeep and comes from a wealthy family which i did not know prior. he’s got a lot of things that many of us are not lucky enough to have. 

my best friend approves of my boyfriend and we all hang out together sometimes (my best friend, her work friend, her work friend’s sister, my bf and i). but it’s not always just “hanging out” like i said, he has a jeep. a really nice one. usually, my best friend asks to hang out if my boyfriend can drive us somewhere far with his jeep or if i can help her with her homework or if she needs something. never if we actually want to hang out which sucks because it’s the same problem again. the thing is— when my friend hangs out with her friends, my boyfriend and i are left in the dark and i feel stupid if i say anything about it because that is how it is every time. for example, we all went out to see the lights and my best friend and her friends were all in the back barely speaking to my boyfriend and i. i just thought that, since he took the time to take everyone and set everything up nicely, someone would at least talk to him or include him in the conversation. after that, the girls went inside and my boyfriend and i talked. he was upset feeling left out by all of us and that he felt used, to the point where he cried. i never wanted him to feel like that again. 

we’re supposed to drive up to the city for her birthday and my boyfriend is supposed to drive in the jeep again. i asked her today if she could include him this time and just not leave him in the dark like he’s an uber. i said i didn’t want him to just trail behind us girls, i want him to feel included too and not just used. what’s the point of him being there if nobody talks to him? you invite someone to your birthday because they’re your friend. she said that her friends do not know him that well and that they are still too shy to get close to people since they just moved here a year ago. am i crazy or is that too much to ask? i wasn’t asking them to do rocket science, i was asking them if they could just include him. i said then can you just not leave him out? she said she cannot guarantee anything because she cannot control them. she said she could just drive there with her car. was it really so much to ask? 

i’m so baffled it’s so hard to put into words. she can ask my boyfriend to chauffeur us 30 minutes away for an entire day and expect him to drive us back in time so she can do other errands, but she can’t ask her friends to be nice and get to know everybody? i get if her friends are uncomfortable but he’s been here driving everyone around and hanging out with everyone at the house for months and months now. i don’t get it. i hate to put him in this position again.",lonely,left out,2020-12-22 19:49:09

So you ask how they’re doing on a different form of media and they’re active as hell on there—but you still get no response. It kinda hurts. Maybe it’s childish to say this but it hurts a person’s feelings. Yes everyone has lives and sometimes a person doesn’t want to talk. I get that. It only takes a bit to say “I’m not feeling well enough to talk right now, I’ll get back to you when I’m more able”. I dislike it when people say they’ll stay but then they leave without a reason. And then people wonder why trust and abandonment issues exist among other things. I’m probably going to give up making friends on here. It feels more like talking to ghosts.

1482,SDWAN,1608619982,1,"It sort of conditions you mentally towards not getting attached to others. It's strange because even do I have the numbers of old friends from high school, I just can't call them and I mean that I just can't mentally do it. I'm not doing this on purpose, it's just... I was never really attached to the people I knew in my high school years since I was always the quiet person. The type of person who wouldn't speak unless directly spoken to first and I never really made an effort in keeping any close since I have a history of not having lasting relationships with people close to me as my family moved around a lot.

 I like to blame my anxiety with a majority of my social problems since it became a much bigger issue over time. I joined sports like Track and Football (of which my track coach recommended I join) to counteract this. Sure I was part of the time, but even then I was still one of the quietest members in both teams. Only 2 to 3 people actually spoke to me during my time in both and once again I wasn't really that close. Wouldn't matter anyway since I had a completely different persona that people liked more than the real me.

I just never really knew how much it'd affect me once the lockdowns started happening and I was stuck at home with no one to talk to whenever I had free time which was a lot. I don't speak to my family much either. I just keep myself isolated in my room 90% of the time. Of course I blame myself for this sort of problem, but like I said previously, even though I have the numbers of a couple people, I just didn't know them enough to actually call them and just talk about ""anything"". The only person I've ever held a text conversation with was my photography teacher after I graduated, but I somehow regret talking to her despite the fact. I just can't do that on a regular basis. I have to mentally make a plan to initiate any sort of conversation even when it's all casual. Makes me a bit anxious. It's somehow easier on things like Discord where no one knows my irl background.

I've only begun to concern myself over this recently since I tend to have these discussions with my conscious on a daily basis when I have no motivation to do anything and just rest on my bed for several hours. I've never really made any sort of connections in my life. Everything was temporary since I didn't want to experience that feeling of loss again after moving away from old friends during my childhood. It was easier to just not concern myself with others which is ironic since nowadays I've been envying those with actual close friendships. That sort of natural ""bond"" with others that I just can't achieve without throwing that chance away. 

Looking back, I wasn't much of a good friend either. I just wasn't aware of it at the time and I regret not being as socially active since all I've been doing since then hasn't changed a thing and I just don't know how to break out of it. Unfortunately, All this loneliness gets to your head eventually no matter how much you are used to it and you eventually just start questioning things. All the media in the world mostly involves people in some sort of relationship. From movies, to shows and cartoons, games even. Those characters always got someone by their side whenever they need them. I've just always envied this sort of thing, sadly.

Apologies for the essay. I've just had no one to really talk to about this feeling, not even my parents and im just very ""stuck"" speaking to me, myself, and I.",lonely,Ever been alone for so long that you slowly realize you've gotten too used to it?,2020-12-22 17:53:02

I'm struggling a lot lately with mental health stuff, probably because of the weather and the quarantine. But I've just been down more lately and have lack of motivation to do anything about it and I have no one to comfort me or to talk to to lift my spirits. I do have ""friends"" but I don't feel important enough to them. I feel like I'm that forgotten friend, or the person whose never on someone's mind.

I've tried making friends but it's constantly the same result. I put effort, they don't. They're dry and don't reply back/ghost me. I don't know what's wrong with me that people just find so distasteful. I've given up trying to go to people for comfort because I always get the same replies of ""I'm sorry."" Or ""I feel you."" I don't trust people anymore. I don't think I ever really did.

I just want that one friend, who puts in effort as much as I do, who thinks about me, who likes talking with me. Why is that so hard to find? I always hear and see people with these great and amazing friendships but I'm here just stuck in this void.

I don't think I'll ever really get the life I dream of because I don't have faith in myself to get to that point. Part of me wants to sit here and just, I don't know, disappear? And the other part wants to do something but I just can't.

I live in the same city as my sister and I'm so grateful for that because without her there would be literally no human interaction in my life. Pretty small town, a tourist town.  
  
Great job, lots of room for growth. No coworkers near my age.  
  
Everyone says to meet friends just pursue your hobbies and they'll naturally come. I've tried looking into things like Meetup, they just aren't very active in my town. So then I tried doing some volunteering. I did some volunteering with kids and I did kind of enjoy it, but that didn't help me meet anyone really. I recently tried volunteering at an animal shelter and said less than 10 words my entire time there. I literally spent over 8 hours just cleaning litter boxes.  
  
So I'm back to square one. My only hobby is gaming and I can't find any local groups for that or anything.  I exercise five days a week and have never said a single word to anybody at the gym for the past three years.   
  
People always say ""oh you're 25, you're young, plenty of time left. "" But 1) we don't know how long we have left, 2) is there really that much time left? I want kids. I want to share my youth with friends that I love. I don't want to have this feeling that every day is the same. I just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel right now.

Two: I live in a small town so there just aren't a lot of opportunities to meet new people as there are in bigger cities. But I at least had a snowball's chance in hell of meeting someone on occasion. Now, in this pandemic work-from-home quarantine, that snowball has gone down to nothing. The only option for meeting people seems to be online.

And I hate meeting people online. I can't put it any plainer. I can't stomach writing a profile or bio talking about myself, my hobbies, my interests, all my best qualities, a laundry list of traits I'm looking for in a potential partner. It all just feels so surface and gimmicky. I like meeting people in person. I'm great at small talk and getting to know someone face-to-face. But this online thing always feels so... impersonal. THAT'S the word I'm looking for. It feel impersonal. And I can't start a relationship in such an impersonal way.

I've tried dating sites. I've even made posts on some subreddits like r4r and foreveralonedating. But my profiles and posts never last long. The connections I make, if you can call them that, just feel so petty and surface-level.

I don't know if it's something I'll ever learn to become okay with.

30+years old and have never even been kissed. Have never really had friends. And it's all tied to my childhood trauma (trust issues, being discouraged from having friends and trusting others by parents, being bullied and isolated).
I'm afraid I'll go on to be completely alone in life and dying alone is terrifying to me. 
I feel I have so much love to give, but no one to give it to. All I've ever wanted is to be loved. I wouldn't think it's so much to ask for, but it apparently is.

Craving affection

everyone feels lonely every once in a while, it’s normal.. but the level of loneliness i’ve reached lately is on another level. i can’t even explain it, but i feel like i’m going a bit insane without human affection.

i can’t blame anyone but myself though! 

at first i was fine being alone, because no one could understand how i felt anyway and i didn’t wanna be a burden on anyone’s life or be pitied but now... it’s getting harder everyday. 

i feel like if a stranger hugged me right now for no reason i would’ve simply break down and cry for hours. that’s touch deprived i am. 

it’s not my fault for being depressed but maybe i should’ve tried harder to keep the small bonds i had before because now i’m really all alone.

i just wish i had someone that could hold me and tell me everything is gonna be okay. i feel like will be alone forever. 

anyway, if you all have someone in your lives who cares about you please cherish them and don’t let them go.

I'm not mature enough to have a relationship

Today I realized that my intentions and motivation to find a boyfriend are rather shallow and superficial. I want to find someone cute to watch movies with, to cuddle, to have a reciprocated crush on, to cook and eat dinners together, etc. But I feel like relationships should be based on something deeper. And I'm not yet sure what. 

I asked myself a question: would I sacrifice my relationship for my career? Hell yes. I feel like everyone can have a boyfriend yet not everyone can have a successful career. So, my career (albeit I'm not a workaholic) will probably always take precedence. Because it's nice to have a good job. 

I choose a career over my love-life and this is what I get in return?

1610,RedDecember94,1608546934,1,"Ok so some context, I (26M) have long realised that what's missing in my life is a partner, I have a good relationship with my family and have an ""ok"" circle of friends and work colleagues which I know makes me more fortunate than many here but I still feel that void in my life, I'm still painful lonely, I want that person to talk to about ""anything"" that other person about the house when I come home from work, that person to watch TV with and go on walks with and cook with, someone to love and be loved by

So yeah what's the big deal we all want that don't we? But I'm possibly in the slightly unique situation of considering a same sex relationship in order to fulfil that need. This isnt quite as bad as it sounds, for a long time I'd considered myself bisexual but I've very recently realised that while I can be sexually attracted to ""some"" men I'm more bi curious than totally bi and truth be told I don't see myself ever ""loving"" another man that way which is what I want, I honestly feel like I can live without the physical stuff its the emotional bond I want and sadly I know I'm not gonna get that with a man, I just dont see them that way.

Yet I've tried, I really have tried the dating scene and while I have some solid success with men I get absolutely nowhere with women and I dont know why. Tinder has has been my latest gambit, I've had it for a month and in that time over 100 men have liked me yet only 1 woman has (and that went nowhere) 

I feel like such a horrible person cos right now I'm talking to a couple of guys and I'm feeding off the attention but I know in my heart their not what I want/need and yet at this point I'm so lonely I'm considering lying to myself and everybody around me about my sexuality just so I can be ""normal"" and have that someone in my life

1613,Overcomplicating69,1608545349,1,"People who have never been in this situation are incapable of understanding. They just cannot get it; it doesn't make sense to them. 

Why stay in a bad relationship? I mean, it should take, what, a few weeks, maybe a month until you're on to the next thing, right? Well, no, not even close. It took me 6 months of intense searching to end up in my first relationship, and that's just because I got somewhat lucky. If I picked up the search again it would July at the VERY LEAST before I might even come close to anything resembling a relationship. It might even take years.

Am I really doing better for myself since I cut it off with my ex? ""She would have made you feel worthless and alone!"" Oh, wow, that's so unlike how I feel now, and that's what people just don't get. Spending large periods of time by yourself is every bit as damaging as it is to be in a dysfunctional relationship. There is no winning here.

Another thing people don't get is that I didn't just end up with a girl like my ex by chance. It wasn't some freak accident. I didn't just talk to a handful of girls and cling to the first one who was mildly interested. Me and my ex ended up together because are both incredibly dysfunctional, damaged people. I've known and talked to a lot of the normal, well-adjusted type of girls everyone thinks I need to be with. They are simply not interested in me. We have nothing in common; it's just not going to happen. This idea that I'm going to hold out and find some white picket fence relationship is a pipe dream. My next relationship (assuming there ever is one) will be exactly like my last one, and the next, and the next, because that is simply the only type of people who are interested in me.

1631,thownawaylife,1608530089,1,"I turned 27 on the 15th, so not quite 30 yet, but with how fast these 7 years have flown by I know I'll be there soon. I haven't had any real friends in about 15 years and I've never even kissed a girl. I get along with people fine, no one really ever dislikes me. Hell, I even get praised for how well I can read and empathize with people. But despite that, I am completely unable to form any deep connection with anybody. Due to circumstance, and then later anxiety, I was pretty much completely socially isolated between the ages of 13 and 23. Because of this, I missed out on a lot of formative experiences, and this makes it almost impossible for me to relate to those around me. I often feel like I'm not really a person, like I'm some kind of anomalous entity that appeared from nothing with no past behind me and seemingly no future ahead. That 10-year gap is just a blur to me, I honestly can't pick out a single event. The only I got from it is weird interests and tastes in media that I have a lot of trouble opening up about, making it even harder to connect to people. And from the other direction, when people try to open up to me, I'm never able to relate to their interests. I'm just too far removed from the modern zeitgeist.

The thing is, I thought I was doing better. But now it all feels like it's falling apart. I started a new job about two years ago and, unlike my last job, I made a lot of casual work friends but I still couldn't form any real relationships. Whenever I suggested we do something outside work there would be some reason it couldn't happen. And the few times anyone did agree something would always come up, or they would conveniently ""forget"" despite me confirming the plans the day before. I would get ""vibed"" out of group conversations for my inability to relate, usually by suggesting I go work on something while everyone else continued to chat. But the real wake up call came on my birthday. I was falling into a bad depression and I turned to the person I thought I was the closest to only for them to get angry at me for slacking and putting all the work on them. And this after I had covered for them more times than I can count without them ever doing the same in return. They then told me that they would listen to my problems ""as long as it would get me to work harder"". This was on my birthday by the way, and the only thing I got was a store-bought cupcake from my manager, despite me having gotten several of my coworkers birthday gifts in the past. I felt so betrayed at first, but after giving it some thought I came to the realization that none of these people were actually my friends. They were in my life out of work obligation, not choice. So desperate I am for human connection that I was inflating these casual acquaintances into personal friends. And it was this overbearing desperation that was getting me shunned more than anything else. I'm so mortified by this realization that I have since become completely withdrawn. I am now in the worst depression of my life. It's hard to get out of bed, let alone make it through a workday. And I've completely lost my ability to work on any of my personal goals or hobbies.

The thing is, I honestly couldn't care less about what my coworkers think of me. I just want someone to talk to, that I can share things with. And I want a girlfriend, someone I can hold and love. I want to be able to be there for people and know that they're there for me. I want to be wanted, and I want to belong. And I have no idea how to help myself. I don't know where to go or what to do, especially with the world on fire like it is. And now on top of everything else, I don't know if I can even form normal relationships being as desperate as I am.

Today was my day off, I spent the whole thing dreading tomorrow. I have no idea how I'm going to muster the strength to make it through another workday.

She confessed that she suffered from very bad depression, the kind that makes you not want to get out of bed or do anything. So I gave her the benefit of the doubt and was understanding.

Tonight I met her while she was on her break at work(at her request), my goal was to make her laugh because she had been having a rough few days, she even agreed to go on a real date with me. By the time I got home she had me blocked on everything. Not going to lie this one hurt. I was into her and the feeling was mutual, or so she said at least. Every time I like someone it never works.

There were plans for us to hang out on new years eve, and my cousins just canceled on me. I don't have any friends here. I feel like they probably would have gone through with it if I wasn't there, or maybe they're still going to go through with it without me and just pretended to cancel.

My bestfrind got into a relationship lately, and the girl he's dating is not a good one, she's so childish and playing with his feelings, when I try to make him see this he ignores and defend her despite the fact that he's depressed about the way she treats him too, and he started to spend his time with her so that i'm more lonely...

The past 5 years since I moved here were the most awkward years of my life, I struggled a lot with communicating and connecting to other people, something I've always found to be difficult even in my motherland ever since I was 6 (24 now), but now with this additional language barrier in the way it seems impossible to me.

I do have 2 university friends, both are from my motherland, but honestly I don't think my relationship with them will last, we aren't that attached to each other and if a problem occurs and we decide not to be friends anymore (which has almost happened once) I'd spend the rest of my years in the university completely alone.

She could use the attention more than me, I'm pretty good at taking care of myself, plus as a natural introvert sometimes being independent is honestly therapeutic in itself- to a point of course.

I couldn’t make out all of it but I did hear “alright hurry this up he’ll be back soon.”

Back on the 25th of october at around 6 30 pm. I overdosed on antidepressant. Thinking back on it, I still dont know why I did it but I guess it was my way of crying for help and attention. As you can tell I unfortunately survived the incident and spent about 3 weeks in the hospital. The psychologist believes that I may have bpd which makes sense but at the same time I refuse to believe it until they diagnose me. So after getting discharged I went out with 2 of my ""best friends"" or so I believed at the time at least. The first time we went out I got mad and I a lashed at them. Which is my fault and I accept it and I apologized. But the second time when I was feeling down. I didnt expect my friends to comfort me or even be there for me. So i decided to leave and I apologised to them for leaving early aswell. I thought I needed more time to get myself back together and let them get some rest from my bullshit I suppose. So I told them I wont message them about how im feeling and stuff like that for about a week and now a week past and all my messages are just getting blue ticked. I guess at the end of the day we only got each other.

It's coming up to like 2 years now of feeling incredibly lonely, i live with my family but I'm somewhat of a disappointment to them so conversation is avoided.

This inevitably leads to multiple days, even weeks, where I don't talk to anybody. 

It's weird knowing there's a whole world inside my head, but I'm the only one who cares for its turmoil. 

I feel like I'm starting to become so numb to what loneliness even is. I don't care about spending Christmas alone because it's just another day, I don't care for online dating because I can't even remember what it was like to be touched or held or even legitimately cared for - I can't motivate myself to strive for something if I can't remember what made that thing so worthwhile. 

I've made plans to completely uproot my life and start again somewhere new, but has this ever been a solution for anyone else? Maybe I'll just be the same in a new place?

Honestly even as I'm writing this I'm wondering what's the point, I'm pretty convinced even if I move away things won't change - but we're always told that cliché line that we won't know unless we try. What if I do try? And it does fail? Does that mean that I just stay in this eternal hell of depression? I really can't be fucked anymore",lonely,Long term loneliness,2020-12-21 02:13:26

1721,salt-fiend,1608473663,1,"I’m a 20 year old female, and I feel completely undesirable all the time, and I’m so confused as to why. I used to think I had a lot going for me: I thought I was sort of pretty, I’m pretty smart, I’m somewhat talented when it comes to the arts, and ultimately and most importantly I feel like I’m just a kind person. Yet recently, its been so hard to continue to view myself that way because I am 20 years old and have not only never been in a relationship, but no guy has ever even kissed me. Only 4 have ever expressed the desire to do so, but it all ended extremely poorly and left me feeling completely undesirable and hopeless that I’ll ever find someone who will love me.

Now, I look at myself as the ugly friend. Whenever my friends and I go out and hang out with groups of guys, all of them get hit on, and no guy ever really gives me the time of day. It’s not that I want guys catcalling me or giving me unwanted attention, but the fact that I literally never get hit on messes with me. I honestly get the vibe that I repulse people, and once again I don’t understand what it is about me that is so unattractive. Not only do I not get hit on, but sometimes I get flat out ignored and left out of any and all conversation. 

What exacerbates the problem is my mental health is declining, and I’m starting to struggle with symptoms of anxiety and depression. It’s hard for me to open up about this issue to a counselor or to loved ones because I’m just so humiliated to be a 20 year old who can’t even find a guy that wants to kiss her. I’ve had so many traumatic incidents with guys despite never being kissed. They always either lose interest immediately or objectify me and make me feel uncomfortable and it usually ends with them making me cry. So I guess in a way I’m afraid of opening up to guys too. I also really hate hookup culture, and I refuse to just make out with someone who doesn’t care about me as a person, but that’s all guys my age seem to want nowadays. And even though I wouldn’t make out with a stranger, it’s not like strangers are chasing after me anyway, so even if I did want to, I wouldn’t have the choice.

This is really starting to weigh on me because I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and my biggest goal in life has always been to have a family, and now I’m getting so concerned that I’m not attractive enough (not just physically but in every aspect) to have anyone want to take on that endeavor with me. Is anyone else in the same boat?

Like i shit you not this makes me so angry when I'm at a point where I have nobody to spend time with ever. I spend all my time alone, day and night, for over 3 years now. I have two people who i sometimes text to and try to limit my messages because i can tell they don't want as much spam as i'm sending them. Sometimes these two take months when they don't send me a message. I stopped asking people to spend time with me when they always said no or I could tell that they rather not. It's also exhausting always being the one holding up a onesided friendship.

 The last time I spend a few hours with people I know from school was a year ago. I have very little family and they live in another city. I sometimes don't see them for months and even then, we don't talk much. Just sit around or go for a walk.

At the time, I had people I spent time with who would regularly belittle me and steal from me, and just did not think of me as a human being. Around that time, I stopped spending time with them.

Right now, there are a few people whose contact information I have, but I know that when I send them a message, once they respond and start a conversation, it's only a matter of minutes until they say something really rude.

We chat a lot, but there is an ocean between us and will never meet. Of course I'm such a lonely, idiot woman, I can't stop nursing this fantasy of the two of us. I doubt he even feels remotely the same way.

I tried to make new friends but I felt used and gave up on that.
To be honest, even when my old friends were around I have felt lonely often, especially after graduating from school. But now it seems like literally no one is there and it's another level of loneliness. 
I was coping with it for the most part for a good part of this year but 2 days ago the feeling was so overwhelming that I had to resort to listening to an ""asmr girlfriend"" video to go to sleep. (Nothing sexual, it was mostly words of affirmation like "" You are doing the best you can"", ""I am right here"" etc). This asmr stuff is something I had seen people listen to and thought it was pathetic but now I listen to it just to sleep. I don't know what to do anymore.

1751,Reditex22,1608454042,1,"First time posting..... A mixture of stories and points and venting... Part venting and part discussion. Wish they'd let us give more than one flair....

Anyway, felt like doing this after watching a Christmas movie. Fucking ey, huh? Prepare for a wall of venting.

Welp, where to start..... In the beginning, there was darkness... Lol jk...

Okay, sorry. These past two years have been filled with lonely pits in my life. Some of it because of my actions, others because of circumstance.

After high school, I had made multiple friends. You'd think you'd be able to hang out with your friends like in those teenager movies, but not when you are a town over. I managed to make up for lost time whenever I went back into town to drop my sister off at the same school.... But once she left, we had no reason to go back into town. And then I lost their numbers, so once that happened, I lost all contact with them. The only time I saw them were chance meetings, and life soon got in the way. Drugs addiction, homelessness.... Yeah, real life shit.

So, life isn't a teenager movie. Sucks ass.

Then a couple of years ago, I moved away from my family and lived with my best friend and her family. She had moved into the mountains years before this moment, and up until now I didn't even know the town she lived in existed. In the mountains.... I thought it would be fun, living with my best friend, but with her going to college, her boyfriend going to work and the general location of the environment we were living in, I was stuck babysitting her kid.

I tried to rough it out, but soon various stressors piled on: the wildlife that infiltrated the walls {ants (2 species to be more specific), spiders, rats, mice, mosquito hawks, and other crawlies}, dealing with the rambunctious child and everything that comes with caring for a child, my friend and her boyfriend with their constant arguing... Then the homesickness swooped in..... I quickly found out that doing what I liked was difficult to do with little time for myself... I found myself trying desperately to escape it all, and that was getting in the way of my responsibilities. I got depressed, wishing that I could go home.

Then whenever they had sex, the disgust and loneliness hit me like a truck. All the feelings of wishing for a boyfriend really swarmed me, alongside me wishing that the walls weren't so fucking thin. Like, fucking really? I'm trying to sleep here!

I always saw kids kissing each other like they would never see each other back in middle school, and it made me so jealous of them. But my damaged self-esteem and shyness shuts down actively searching, so I tell myself I don't need a boyfriend... I've gotten so used to it that I subconsciously deflect anything that sounds like a guy trying to get with me.... But sadly, anything of the sort have been older men trying to get with me like I'm a trick on the street.

I guess it's just the intimacy. I constantly daydream about being with someone; snuggling, kissing each other on the cheek, watching TV together, playing video games.... Just me loving them and then loving me back. But I constantly fear that I'd become too clingy and needy with this desire to show this love for my partner.... I don't want to be that person, so I figure it's best to not try to get with anyone at all. 

Then this past Christmas, I finally contact my long lost crush of just over 10 years. I met him in middle school after moving to live with my father. It was the first guy friend I had, and I liked his brooding and down to earth dialogue. Before I knew it, I had a hard crush on him. Haaard. The other friends of mine noticed and kept teasing me, but I ignored them (or tried to) and voiced our simple friendship. The crush intensified when we went to high school together. We had some of the same classes, we shared lunch together... I shared my food with him.

But after I left the city and moved back with my mother again, we tried talking on email. I lasted for a few months, until he stopped responding. I was devastated for years, thinking I did something wrong. I tried finding him on social media, but, just like me, connections on the typical sites were little to nothing. Just a FB account that was dead for 5+ years.

But it turned out that my mother had his number the entire time. Some ten years later. Excited, I called his family on Christmas, and got his number for my own phone. I texted him, trying to catch up on lost time. It felt like a dream come true. And on this past Valentine's Day, I finally gathered the courage to confess my deep crush on him. It was now or never. After some conversation, I geared up to tell him. But right as I was going to say it, he stated that he was gay. He'd even had a couple of crushes on his own over the years. With boys that I even knew briefly.

Ain't that some shit? That's some romance movie bullshit. I just broke down after that. In that moment, I realized that I was subconsciously saving myself for my crush. Like some sad part of me was just hoping and praying that he'd like me as much as I did him, and when he'd find out we'd finally be together. I dreamed of us multiple times. So I rejected any other possible male attention for the anticipation of fulfilling my fantasies. Pathetic, I don't even have a boyfriend for my dreams.

Several months later, my birthday came around. Still recovering from the news, but still wishing to make friends, I told him of my short stories and offered to show him. He accepted. I gave him the link and asked for his feedback....

And he hadn't responded. Again. That was in the middle of the year. So.... My ex-crush has stopped talking to me again. Just like before, I figured it was his sporadic responses. After a week, my hope began to waver. After a month, I gave up. Haven't texted him since. It's frustrating and sad when one still hopes to have some sort of relationship with a person who doesn't respond to them. Did he forget me? Did life take over? I don't want to text him to find out. Well, a part of me does, but then, the past just comes crashing down, and I don't want yet another repeat.

And now I'm going through some heart problems. I bring it up because I fear that masturbating will trigger an episode. I do it to replace the absence of sex, and it was fun for a while... I mean, it still is. But then the crushing loneliness came in whenever I watched some romance or Christmas (which is basically a freaking romance movie set in Winter) movie... It drains you. So I do it to also escape the loneliness.

But with these heart episodes, I can't even do it without the fear of hurting myself. Anticipating your body doing all these foreign things due to your heart malfunctioning is terrifying. My family loves me, and without them I'd just drown in fear, depression and an even more acute feeling of loneliness.... I still deal with all of it, just at a smaller scale; but I'm just taking it one day at a time.

So yeah, there's that. A lot has happened this year. A lot of moments that made me cry and feel sorry for myself.",lonely,I hate the feeling.,2020-12-20 19:47:22

Anyway, I know this is a common problem, but for me it hits especially hard because I struggle a lot with how I look. I’m 18, and everyone I know is currently in a relationship, has been in one, has had sex, gets hit on, etc. It isn’t necessarily that I even want to be in a relationship or have sex, it’s just the fact that no one seems to *want* to be in one with me hurts. I know how that sounds, and believe me when I say I’m not going to start seeking relationships and using people purely for validation, but I can’t help but feel I’m so far behind my peers because there’s something fundamentally wrong with me. To make matters worse, I recently found out this guy I’ve been crushing on is already in a relationship. I feel like I’m one of those ugly people that people flirt with when they’re bored until someone better comes around. To be fair, I don’t get out a lot (especially recently, for obvious reasons), and I’m pretty reclusive when it comes to people so I haven’t been actively trying to “find” someone. Even just a friend would be nice. But then, every attractive person I know seems to do it just fine without even trying. I don’t even really have friends — I have people I talk to, sometimes, but no one I really hang out with or can vent to (I used to but cut them off after they proved to be very toxic). I have trouble initiating due to a fear of rejection. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I get nauseous, and I feel such a viscerally heartbreaking disgust when I look at the photos that have been taken for graduation. I can’t stomach posting photos of myself. I’ve been complimented on my looks a few times by strangers before, and I’ve been approached by guys a few times, but I do feel like they’re either trying to make me feel better or are using me somehow. And to me the fact that I THINK I’m so ugly has to mean that it must be true. Like I can’t think of anyone very attractive I know who DOESN’T post photos of themselves on social media. I think my personality is pretty okay, but god, whenever I look in the mirror I feel like nothing. It makes me want to just hide under my bed so I don’t have to look at myself or have others look at me anymore.

I don't want to ask because I'm in an emotional state where I would just cry and make things worse. So I looked up a subreddit to vent and I guess I'm here. 

It just brings back so many times where people would be mean to me because I was ""too much"". I need more support than other people, and my emotions are a lot. I've made a lot of progress since those times in caring for myself and having healthier relationships, but God if it doesn't still hurt when the person I care about most doesn't text me or ask to see me and I feel they have no reason to even want to. 

It's so lonely. 

I talk too much. I have a lot of energy. And people like me in small doses, but I'm too much sometimes. 

I like my energy. I just wish I had more friends so I wouldn't overwhelm the few I have. I'm so worried all the time that my girlfriend will break up with me. It feels childish but I keep track of how many times I text her versus how much she texts me and she used to talk to me more but now it's only ever me talking. She used to send me cute selfies, or good night texts. Now it's barely anything. I have so much love to give and I want to text her but I feel I can't because something must be wrong, and I feel stuck because I don't want to be clingy or asking for reassurance if she already doesn't have the energy for me. 

I'm just tired of trying to navigate friendships and relationships and I end up being so lonely no matter what. Like something fundamentally inside me is missing, and I can't fill the void it has left. It's devastating, honestly. I feel like some little kid who is forgotten and left behind while everyone else goes on in their lives, and I try to build my own life but it's like a sandcastle that falls apart over and over the more I try. 

I so badly want to be cared about, and actually shown that I'm cared about. I can care about myself but it is not the same as feeling like somebody actually thinks of me. I feel forgotten. I wish my girlfriend would text me. I don't want to lose her.

So recently I've been thinking about this once instance of social interaction I had years ago. I haven't thought about it heavily, but for some reason it's in my head.

One time a friend and me were at a club, this random dude starts mock strip dancing at the podium. A small crowd was gathered around him, we were cheering him on. I told my friend I was gonna give him a dollar because the dude was so audacious, but he was kind of far from where we were. A cute girl apparently overheard us and offered to give him my dollar. I agreed, gave her the dollar and off she went. She came back, told me she couldn't reach him because the dude stopped strip dancing, and gave me back my dollar. I said thanks.

My friend and me continued randomly dancing because that's what you do, but I can feel the girl grinding me as we danced. There was no verbal communication, we were grinding. When dancing at the club, even though people are packed tight, you can tell the difference between an intimate sweet spot and a more stranger distance. This was the former. I didn't really think much of it, just acknowledging in my head what she was doing. 

I've forgotten what happens next, but I know I don't talk to the girl after that. She was with friends, and I was with mine. I think we went our separate ways.

Now I'm thinking what could of been. Was she into me? Was it a dare? What if I asked for her name? Friend for life or forgotten encounter? Oh well.

She was cute.",lonely,Anyone else think back to some one off social interactions they had?,2020-12-20 15:16:03

I told her she was the prettiest girl that I know.  She told me it makes her uncomfortable to say that as she sees it as blurring a line in our relationship which she views to be a friendship and nothing more.

I realize that I can be sad and upset but that this is not her fault by an means.  She is entitled to her feelings and life just the same as I am.

I guess I see the key as I can feel these things as long as I don't take these feelings out on her.  Also, she is a very mature woman and is pretty independence but everyone learns lessons from those they interact with and I believe she may have had issues with expressing the need for boundaries in the past with other relationships etc.  I want to show her that there are people in this world that will respect her boundaries completely, that it is important to express them and that she can feel safe expressing them - I am thinking in light of toxic masculinity etc.

I'm staying in my college town for the holidays in an empty apartment and I came to the realization today that I have absolutely no one to talk to about things. Over the last year I was in a LDR where we spoke every day, often for hours at a time. I loved her so much and still do, but we broke up due to circumstances and I likely won't see her again unless I end up in her country which isn't likely. In the months since the breakup, I definitely overburdened people with my emotions and I'm actively trying not to do any more of that. I lost two reasonably close friendships this year, but I feel oddly numb about both. I keep reaching out to my ex which doesn't help anything since the feelings are still so raw, but she's been my only real comfort for so long I barely know how to comfort myself. I hang onto every message from her and panic when she's taking too long to respond, picturing her moving on with someone else and still seeking comfort with me.

Corona is a tough time for us all and many people are feeling lonely since they can't really socialize with other people. That can damage their mental health, especially in the winter season. So if you want someone to talk with, here I am :) 

About me: I'm 22yrs old, live in Germany and work as a bartender. I'm a lot into lifting and fitness, cooking, gaming, reading, motorcycles and found myself a new hobby in rebuilding/upcycling old Ipod classics. But I'm always open about new stuff. 

So if it sounds good to come to my chat, get a drink and talk about anything you want. No matter if it's your problems, your interests, that crush you're having or how your day was. I have an open ear for everybody :) 

And maybe, just maybe, it can become more than just a little chat

1827,ProcessNervous,1608420450,1,"I've been now social-media free (except for Reddit of course!) for about two weeks. I used to be very active on Facebook and Instagram. But I realized how toxic it all was. I mostly spent my time there arguing about stupid things, fearing that I'd miss something important and getting jealous because other's lives looked so good and my own quite miserable. So, I decided to quit. 

Social media made me feel very lonely. I compared myself to others constantly. When somebody posted something about their social lives, I began to feel alone since I don't have partner or a large group of friends. 

But nobody lives the life they show on social media. It's all fake. Pics are carefully chosen, often heavily photoshopped and people smile just because it's expected. People with good-looking lives might be suicidal. Everybody is just trying to show that they're living the good life. But the catch is that that life doesn't exist. No matter what you do, you'll never get the life you see on profiles of influencers. Even if you'd have the nice cars, yachts, girl/boyfriends, houses, money, drugs, expensive clothes and followers, you'd never be satisfied. You might think you do but there is always another level to reach. If you have 1000 followers, you want 10000. 

So, social media makes us chase a dream imagined by corporations that sell the products. It isn't a wonder that pics on social media often look very similar to those you see on ads. It's always some smiling people in a party or a couple on beach. People are just repeating the images of ads and fake celebrities. There is deep feeling on inferiority involved in it; you need to copy things because you feel that you and your life isn't good enough. But in reality what is really broken is the dream that is sold to us. 

And social media is trying to make us feel more lonely and miserable. That's how they make us put more pictures on Instagram and posting on Facebook. Social media companies count on that we try to prove ourselves to others. The more you show your life on social media, the more money the business gets. And the desire to show off what you got comes from low self-esteem and fear of being a ""nobody"" without any friends. People trying to get famous are very fearful that they might lose everything. It's a miserable lifestyle. 

I don't no longer feel as lonely as I did before. I understand myself better. And I've also understood that what I really want is just few good friends and a romantic partner. Having a 1000 or 10000 followers just doesn't matter to me anymore. I feel bad for those who are still hooked on that dream.",lonely,Social media makes everything worse,2020-12-20 10:27:30

This will be the 3rd new year's eve I am spending in my room. How it all began ?



I started hating winter holidays back in 2017. I was in depression from November 2017 to January 2018 due to break up. I was in a friends group of guys with whom I didn't get along very well, but I needed in those rough times. So I welcomed 2018 with them. Later that year, I cut contact with them for good.



I still have friends, but none of them were from my city, they are students here and they go home during holidays. So I had no one to spend a new year's eve with since then.



During last two years, I was practicing a lot of hobbies and outdoor activities as a way to self actualise myself (started rock climbing, travelled, learned a new language all alone etc) . Part of me wanted to do all of these stuff but another part saw it as escapism from my loneliness.




This year in particular is the worst. It's covid, and though the beginning of it wasn't as hard, it is now.




I'm on a gap year at uni currently. Therefore, I have a lot of free time (online lectured 4hrs a week this semester) that I decided to dedicate to work. I work a non physically demanding blue collar job. I don't like my job, but it's flexible and stable in these times. For first six weeks I was only aimed to earn as much as I can (It's a wage job) and caught myself living a routine life (home-job).



Until I met her last month and she spinned me right round round



Got a tinder notification that someone liked me, I swiped a bit a matched with her. The flow of conversation was great a we met the next day. To me, she was 10/10. Had a great conversation over few beers and were making up afterwards. I felt chemistry, and saw she was enjoying it as well. She even hinted she wants something serious, which I wanted as well and it made me very happy.



Long story short, on the next date, she, non verbally but very clearly, emmited a message that she doesn't want to continue it. I was dissapointed of course, but it was done in a good manner, without ghosting and other nonsense, so it wasn't that hard to accept it.



But it made me aware of my loneliness. It was the final straw which lead to my despair. Loneliness, stupid job, no partner. Two days after I woke up for work and started crying and had to take a free day as I was having a breakdown. Since then, I started working less since I realised my mental health will deteriorate at such pace (8hrs for 6days/week).



At this point I am almost glad the girl ""dumped"" me since I would become so clingy.



And here we are today. Another new year that I will welcome in my bed.



I still have hope though. I am moving out from my parents home in end of january. I just want spring so that restrictions can ease and I can seek to widen my social circle then. Hope to travel as well when summer hits up.

1867,CantaloupeEither3347,1608397247,1,"20 years old now, 2020 has been a very unique year for me not including everything in the world right now. I've just been going through a transition of sorts and I'm adjusting. Like I'm trans literally..

People can say whatever and assume things, but nobody can tell anymore. As far as anyone in the real world is concerned, I'm just seen as a normal girl now. Which is great and everything, I'm really happy with who I've become! It helped with my Dysphoria, but hormones sort of change your personality a bit. And I am really not the same person mentally as before, I have estrogen flowing through my body and everything mentally and physically that comes with it. 

It's more so the isolation I feel from my former friends. When I was young I forced myself to make friends with guys because people were mean to me about being around only other girls, so I did. Now my guy friends are all either weirdly flirty/have feelings for me, or we just don't have common interests anymore. 

The guys I turned down all ditched me and the guys I don't have things in common with drifted away. So now its just me, alone in this stupid house during this stupid pandemic in this stupid country...

Adjusting to life as a woman has been interesting, eye opening. Catcalls, getting groped in public, it really makes me on edge. I'm not used to being treated and disrespected like that so frequently.

I can't go to school and make friends because my college is only online and I just can't learn like that, I'm waiting for this pandemic to be over. 

So I have nobody worth talking to, I guess I just came here to speak into the void.

1873,codecrunchie,1608394753,1,"How does it work? Basically it's project with one main form that matches people up based on answers to 28 questions. For most of the questions, you choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28 questions, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. For example you could say you're looking for people from **Europe**, who are **16-25**, who '**maybe/yes**' are willing to do **voice calls**, and they're also **studying**. Also quite handy, there is a filter to not match with ""*low effort*"" (based on word count) users.

What is the final result? The algorithm searches over 3000 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get 20-80 **matches** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-80 matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* [/u/finder\_of\_the\_humans](https://www.reddit.com/u/finder_of_the_humans/)/  runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them, they've been working on this for more than 6 months now. :)

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)  


The last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.",lonely,"Find friends quicker using 28 questions via the findafriend project.

My father was a executive at a large company and my mom didn’t have to work. For the first 10 years of my life, I was basically raised by nannies. All of my neighbors were either retired with grown up kids or middle age workaholics with no kids. I had no neighbors I could play with so after school for my entire childhood, I sat inside with my nannies. I had hard times making friends since I attended school due to the fact people treat you differently when they find out your rich. In middle school, I was labeled the rich girl even though I am a humble person and hate it when people talk about my parents wealth. Even today, I am now in highschool, people treat me so differently when they find out my families income bracket. When I complain about being lonely, lots of people I consider my friends tell me my life can’t be that bad when you are me because I am ‘a cute rich white girl who always seems happy and with nice rich parents’. The people who are saying this are the same people who have huge families who they hang out with every day and are close with. Because of all this, am so lonely, especially during COVID. My parents are in bed by 9, and then for the next 5 hours I am alone in my house with my dogs and my phone and when I am not FaceTiming my friends. All my friends this holiday are hanging out with there huge families, and I’m sitting in my tv room writing this and feeling the most lonely I have in a very long time. I understand I am extremely blessed but I can’t stop myself from feeling lonely 90% of the time, and all this nice stuff I have like a infinity pool is pointless when you have no one to share it with. I have started copping by talking rly long showers way too often and day dreaming lots. I am so jealous of people who have siblings or close families, and am so tired of being labeled the rich girl when I am more than that. I am at a new highschool now far away from my home and am extremely scared of being alone there because of my experiences when I was younger. I am so afraid I won’t make any friend, and no matter how many times people tell me I will make so many friends, I find it hard to believe them because all I can think about is how I grew up so lonely with no friends. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this loneliness especially during COVID and is my fear irrational?

It's pretty annoying if I do say so myself. I have the urge to just lay down and cuddle with someone. To just have someone to be with in the same room as me. Someone I can have hour long convos with. A person I can see as family. I wanna go star gazing and watch the sunrise. I wanna go for a midnight walk around the park. I wanna stay up all night and just talk. I wanna cuddle and watch tv. 

One thing I loved doing with my ex was spontaneously jumping out of bed and turning on old 60s music and getting her to dance around the room with me. Probably my favorite thing we ever did, besides our first date. That was a damn good date. Idk, I don't necessarily miss her... I just miss the caring for someone deeply and them care for me deeply back. Someone I can bond with and laugh with and feel comfortable with. Like I can be 100% myself around them.

We used to eat dinner with her mom. We'd just sit at the dinner table and laugh and make jokes and tell stories. It was nice, I loved it more than anything, I loved her more than anything. I haven't been with anyone else since her. I've been on a few dates but it never became a relationship with any of them. She was my first kiss, first girl i went on a date with, girl I lost my virginity to. I have a friend who's open to being a friends with benefits kinda friend and I liked the idea until we were about to do it and then... I just wasn't ready I guess. 

Idk, but I miss the feeling. And what sucks is, I have no friends and my family isn't really too fond of me for my religious views (me being an atheist) and my sexuality (me being a bisexual) as well as my politics (me leaning more left than right). I can't tell you how many times I've been called a communist by them. Or a ""rat bastard"" for that matter. I'm just alone, which kinda makes this feeling lonely shit harder to deal with believe it or not.

     2020 has been a weird year. Probably one of the most bizarre and hurtful ones for many people in their lifetime. Maybe for others it wasn’t as bad. Either way I think everyone deserves some joy in their life, and most people get that dose on Christmas, hence the nature of this post. 

     Let me get to the point. It has occurred to me that for various reasons many people might end up spending Christmas all on their own this year, whether that be a good thing or a bad one. Anyway, today an idea sprung to my head, why don’t we organize a livestream and spend it together? Maybe you’re far from home and can’t see your family (of course you could call them but maybe that possibility is out of your reach for some reason). Heck, maybe you hate everyone you know irl and just want to spend some time with random strangers online. Or, even if you aren’t lonely, you’re more than welcome to join with whoever you’re spending the day with. Point is to bring joys to those who might not have a very Merry Christmas otherwise.

     Btw, I’m no streamer or anything so I’m not sure if this’ll turn out well. I’m not even sure if I’ll be able to go through with it, but I’ll do my best.

     Also, I think it’s more than obvious by the nature of this post, but I’ll clarify just in case: this is not going to be a monetized stream or anything, just people trying to make eachother happy lmao",lonely,Are You Spending Christmas Alone?,2020-12-19 08:36:53

I cried everyday (R.I.P Mo). In 2016 a family friend gave me another puppy and I love him he slept with me in my bed and he made me happy. A year later we sold our house and move to an apartment so I couldn't bring him ( he's a boerboel) so my grandparents took him in until we found a new house. That was 3 years ago, we bought a new house but my dad won't have him back ""I want to build an enclosure for him first"" he said, BULLSHIT. For last couple years I've had no one, I've never had a girlfriend so I can't even hold the only living creature that gives me endless love.

2015,Roy_14903,1608312331,15,"This happened way back in July. I don't exactly remember the date but lies somewhere in the end of July. So it started with me forwading memes to a girl on Instagram...This girl blocked me then. 

Alright. If you have come so far reading this, I'd love to let you know the backstory of the whole scenario. 
So it happened way back in the month of February of this year when Corona stuff was at its rise in many parts of the world. Well, it started with me trying to get in touch with one of my former classmates who used to study with me for 3 years back in high school. I remember back in the school days, I had a huge crush on her and how I tried to always make her laugh or even smile. It wasn't pleasant to make an approach to text her but I did...I did because I wanted her to know that once upon a time she meant something to me and as time went by, we both shifted routes and lost touch (we never really talked, she was just any normal classmate to me but for me she was one of the most important people to shape my school days). Later I soon started to talk to her and she sounded pleased. She often said sorry for replying late, which I always didn't like because I knew that she was a studious individual prioritizing her academics and couldn't make the time to chat with me. 

We talked for days, months until Covid-19 hit the jackpot in March and the whole world was under extreme quarantine. This is where things changed for me. I talked to her almost on a daily basis, I loved to spend time talking to her, talking about books and history. I always hated it when she left, I felt incomplete but nonetheless, she would always return which made me feel excited. By the time it was April, I started to grow my honesty with her and I told her somethings about my personal life. I did it because I trusted her. 

It all went good until July of this particular date. She told me she is taking a break out of Instagram and would soon return. Much to my surprise, I didn't see her for months :)
Until I checked her chat way back in the month of September. Her chat showed in my DM section, her profile pic changed but I couldn't access her Instagram profile. I wasn't allowed to follow her and the followers and followings or the amount of posts of the account didn't display. 

Honestly. I might act all manly and brute and like an absolute badass but this time I lost my ability to hold it in. I cried. I cried uncontrollably. I couldn't cry loudly but I still did. I pushed my face across my pillow and it soaked all my tears up whilst I was holding myself from crying loudly so that my family wouldn't notice.  It was one of the most painful experiences. To lose someone you trusted, to lose a friend and to know that the person who meant so much to you, doesn't even flinch while blocking you. 

This was the end of it. Never heard from her since then. I am never gonna. I am alright. I am not even crying anymore but I felt like I needed to tell people how painful it was for me to experience something like this. I wanted to share my sorrow with some people of this community in order to let people relate to my experiences. 

Thank you for investing your time into reading this :)
Have a nice day ahead :)

My carers lost it because several weeks before my girlfriend, who swore she would lovenme forever, always be by my side etc etc upped and left, taking our dog. The reason she left is I relied on her too much and didn't pull my own weight after spiralling into a deep depression when my mum died. She promised mum the same as she promised me. I met her by chance after my ex wife walked out on me. I lost my house, car and job before that when my pancreas digested itself causing a number of chronic illnesses to appear.

2035,AuntBen,1608301155,2,"As a kid, I () was always the smart one in school. The one who always knew the answer. The clever nerd. That was my role, and I loved it. However, maintaining this role demanded sacrifices. I had the choice of living life as a normal kid, or living life as a clever nerd. I chose the later.

During my school years, the Instagram- and Snapchat boom hit. Of course, I wasn't gonna be like everyone else. And so, I refused to join any social media at the time. ""How clever of me!"", I thought. ""I'm not like one of these brainless attention-slaves that desire constant recognition."" How wrong I was. 

The others, they knew people. They had no troubles changing schools or making new friends. They knew people, and were never alone. I, on the other hand, was no one. Nobody knew who I was and I knew nobody. It was fine to begin with. I thought to myself; ""Perhaps I should let go of this role that I'm playing. It's not very relevant anymore."" Did I let go? No. Stubborn and anxious Me had decided that it would be best to continue living outside the social epicentre, like the clever nerd I was. 

Fast forward a couple of years and I regret everything. I'm currently in a state of extreme social anxiety. I have no friends. Some people I know will have a casual conversation with me from time to time, but nothing else. I want nothing more than to ask them to hang out, to become my friend, to become my partner. The problem? I don't dare.

It might seem a bit far-fetched blaming my current state of mind on some stupid decision I took as a child because I wanted to be different. I do, though. I believe that this rot is a product of continuous loneliness over multiple years. I'm not sure I can get out. I'm not even sure I want to get out. Some things you just have to accept.

I've been lonely all my life and now suddenly it feels like I have a SO just without the romantic stuff. And that completely fucks my brain. Because this is SO close to what I always imagined it would be to have a partner and I really just want to cuddle with her and kiss her but that's not possible because she already told me she is interested in someone else, who happens to be my best friend.

2054,WrongAgainKiddo,1608276625,8,"My(21f) ex (24m) broke up with me because I became disabled (broken pelvis) after giving birth (not his kid, but for months he did everything for her like he was her dad). I've been single for the last year since. I was single nearly a year before. Haven't even been on 1 date. I know, a year isn't a long time, but being a disabled single mom of a baby/toddler, it's a long friggin time.

On top of just being single, I have no one else to talk to. My friends all went separate ways after high school, and none of them really talk anymore. I have one friend that stays in contact, but we have like 1 conversation every couple months, and even that is just like 3 or 4 texts long. I lost my job when I was pregnant bc pregnancy had a lot complications, and all my friends from there stopped talking to me the minute I left. Making friends since covid has been nearly impossible, and finding a date is even harder.

I just wish I could make a true connection with someone. I wish I had someone to help make my and my daughter's christmas magical this year, playing christmas games, decorating the house, drinking cocoa together, watching Elf, building gingerbread houses.. I just want a hallmark Christmas. I'm doing the best I can for my daughter, but no one's doing the best they can for me and it's just hard. 

My broken pelvis hardly bothers me while doing normal daily stuff (except stairs.. those cursed stairs..), but I have no one to share this milestone with. I couldn't stand or walk for months, but now I can walk nearly a mile almost pain free! I can pick up my daughter and carry her to bed by myself! I can get in and out of a vehicle without someone having to lift my legs for me (bc they couldn't move at all for a while)! I wish I had someone to celebrate this with, other than my daughter, who can only say ""quack quack"" or ""baba"". I love my daughter, but I miss adult conversations.",lonely,Just tired of being alone,2020-12-18 18:30:25

To make it worse (for me), I had that night off, but a girl I work with, who was invited, didn't, so she asked if I could cover her shift without telling me what it was for. I'll almost always cover someone's shift if asked so I didn't make much of it at first, but when I saw everyone enjoying themselves and having a good time, I felt betrayed, almost.
I already feel like an outsider trying to fit in with everyone I work with, and the thought of them either going out of their way to not invite me or not even thinking of me when they were planning their invitations pretty much confirmed all my insecurities.

When I was young my stepfather would beat me,  I used to fantasize that my real father (wherever he was) would rescue me. It never happened.

When I was older I used to day dream about my soul mate, that they would one day appear and happily slide in beside me in my life. Instead I saw a mirage and fell into this dark hole.

I moved out at 20 ..Enlisting in the Military as a Main Battle Tank crewman next 2 years would see great success in my career and 2-3 partners who wouldnt ammount to little more than eventual cheating or abandonment without explanation (from them)

My 3rd year went by relatively quiet i met a new partner who i parted ways with at the start of the year dispite our best efforts we both agreed it was for the best and then covid struck... ive spent the past year pretty much on my own like alot of people working through the covid period

I have another friend from work who quit last year that I text with that length but that's the extent of our relationship. I am extremely extroverted and although I don't like most people I do crave company and companionship and I have no idea how to satisfy those needs.

It took me reading through the messages between my ex and I to realize one thing.

In the beginning the relationship was 50/50. We both put in equal effort to ensure we stayed as a couple.

2 months in, it goes down.

Then in November, I'm putting in the same amount of effort as she did. The last half of November was the last time she told me ""I love you"". I told her every day after that. 

And a few hours after I wrapped my mind around everything two of her friends basically attacked me. I know neither of them personally, just from Facebook.

One asked ""Who cares and why should they?"" And kept flexing the fact that they're married.

The other said ""Oh well. Find someone who cares.""

None of my friends who showed support for our relationship when it was real has showed any support to me. But they show it for her.

To be honest, i'm not sure why im writing this - maybe my mind needs to release something. I've always been up and down with my mood, highest of highs and lowest of lows. Today seems to be one of those low days.

I feel like im living a double life. Background about me: I'm 22 years old, graduated recently, working a decent grad job as an accountant, loving family. So today is when I feel like something's hit me recently. The company policy due to covid is to take 5 days off in the december to january period to spend with family or friends. At work, im a conversationalist, I know how to engage with people, I try to get through my day making it easy for others putting in effort and ensuring the stuff gets done. After work im a mess, my only escape is the one-two hours I spend in the gym. After that the loneliness really does hit me.

I sometimes just lay in bed, blocking my thoughts out with music or reading or anything to try distract me from the fact im so alone. I have a few friends but they have other friends with who they go out with, i'm just the gym buddy lol. I wouldnt bare bring up my loneliness to them - i feel like i mentioned my mental health a while back and was told to 'keep strong, i've got everything going for me, dont worry youll be feeling up soon'. In actual matter of fact, I haven't felt true happiness in such a long time, i dont know if i even know what happiness really is anymore. 

The title of this post is a song by one of my favourite artists, Juice wrld. He has a song called 'life's a dungeon' and I feel like I really agree with him. I feel stagnant, alone just existing without meaning. No idea if anyone will read this, or feels the same as me or why I wrote this. I guess just something I wanted to get off my chest.

This past year I've been dealing with an extraordinary amount of despair over my loneliness and not really having a social circle. I tend to stay away from topics, people, content creators, and pretty much any type of conversation in which there is a decent possibility of a certain kind of shaming language being used. I'm talking about how men are shamed for not getting laid or having girlfriends. I try to stay away from conversations that have that or use that as a weapon against anyone in the conversation. As a result I find myself staying away from seemingly HUGE chunks of the internet. It's really affected my social um health for lack of a better word.   


This year though I've seen a very high increase in that type of talk and so I have found myself VERY isolated. There are times when I have some type of good news or have achieved a goal of mine and I don't have anyone to share it with. I'm hesitant to explore new groups irl and online because I'm just so sick and tired of hearing shaming that strikes at my mental health. Loneliness SUCKS lol. I really is a terrible thing to deal with.  The other day I woke up in the middle of the night and I wanted to scream. I feel despair thinking about the future and I don't know what to do.

2163,Key_Calligrapher_914,1608199656,1,"This is not only my first post on this subreddit, but my first post on Reddit, period. I apologize for any explicit language... I tend to get a bit heated when venting about my life.

I'm sure I don't have to mention what a crazy year it has been, but this year has been beyond that for me. I've never felt more alone in my entire life.

It all started back in March. I just got hired at a new job, I started working for some pretty notable public figures and even met a girl that I was into for quite a while. Back then, I was happy and I honestly miss is. During spring break, my school announced they would not be reopening for in-person instruction until further notice due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. That just made me happier! So for the last few months of the school year, I would go to work, stay late and then do my schoolwork at 1am. It was actually going quite smoothly, given the circumstances.

That girl I mentioned — let's call her Emily — was absolutey amazing. I had honestly fallen in love with her within those first two months of the pandemic. However, I made thr erroneous decision to tell her how I felt and I ruined it. We remained friends after that, which wasn't terrible, but I had definitely made things a bit awkward from that point on. She happened to be talking to someone else and her exact words were, ""sorry, I just can't have feelings for someone else if I'm already talking to someone if that makes sense."" Of course, me being a gentleman, I respected her wishes and left it alone... that is, for the time being.

In May, my boss pulled me aside and asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I told him about my goal to serve people throughout my career in any way I could and I was leaning towards government and politics. He was rightfully taken aback because you don't come across many people who say they WANT to do that sort of thing, especially given our broken political system (but I digress). He told me that in the three months of me working there, he said I was his best guy. I was only 16, working the most hours, working the hardest (his words, not mine; I'm not known to be narcissistic) and he said he was certain I could run the store all on my own if I had to. He told me he was looking to promote me to a manager. I was more shocked to hear that than he was about me saying my thing about my career. For context, this is a major fast food chain — not some family-run shop or something. Anyway, I was excited and my life was still trending upwards.

In June, nothing notable happened, really, however, one thing in particular is sort of important to my story. Emily told me, just out of the blue, that she was no longer talking to that other guy. Me, being a hopeless romantic, assumed that she was giving me some sort of ""hint"" that she was looking for someone else, if that makes any sense. So, of course, I told her I wanted something more. Again, she turned me down. Cool, I told myself ""that was it"" (cough, cough... no, it was not).

In July, things really took a turn for the worst, and this is where my current affliction originated. Remember that promotion I was going to get? Well, it came up July 2. We got a new guy who had two years of experience in another state and he was doing pretty good at our store. Two weeks in, my boss pulled him (we'll call him Mike) and my other coworker (we'll call her Darla) aside and started showing them things that only managers would need to know... you can see where I'm going with this. My boss broke the news to me that I would not be receiving a promotion ""this time."" He assured me I was ""next in line"" and sent me on my way. My mistake was believing this, but we'll get to that later. That same day, I did the usual. I was at work at 11am and left around 10pm. I bought food to take home where I was typically alone, save for my dogs, and turned on some TV and ate my food. Only, this time, something was not right. My food tasted bland. In fact, I couldn't taste it at all, I thought I was going crazy... I couldn't smell either. I said, out loud, ""shit, shit, shit, this can't be real."" If you don't know why I was freaking out, loss of taste and smell is a common symptom of COVID-19; the disease we have all been freaking out about for nearly an entire year. I went and got tested and I did, in fact, test positive for COVID-19 in early July.

The next month of my life, I would watch helplessly as my family got torn apart, my promotion get taken from me, my friendships dwindle, and my livelihood get thrown out the window entirely. I had to quarantine for the standard 14 days as per CDC guidelines. At first, it was okay; I wasn't that sick. But my health and condition progressively worsened. The worst part about it is, when you think you are getting better, you get worse in the next 24 hours. One day I couldn't eat, the next I was fine. Then one day, I couldn't walk, then I was fine. Then one day, I couldn't move or leave my bed, the next day I couldn't breathe and I genuinely thought this was the end, but it was just pandemic paranoia, I guess you could say. I hadn't seen my family in so long, at least not face to face or up close. They'd come by every day and leave groceries at the door of my camper (oh yes, I live in a camper) and wave at me through the window. The last three days of my quarantine, I heard that my mother, her boyfriend and my little sister all tested positive thanks to me (LOL) and that they all had to enter a two-week quarantine as well.

I was struggling to find a reason to try and improve my health. I didn't want the vitamins or the medication because it didn't seem worth it. My family called CPS on my mother because she ""wasn't taking care of me"" which was complete BS and nobody EVER asked me how I felt. They just spoke over me and took matters into their own hands. Of course, I called CPS and told them how ridiculous and absurd the accusation was and the case was dropped within the week. So now, my family was divided heavily. My older sister moved out and into the home of one of those family members responsible. She is still there to this day. I rarely see her anymore and we used to be really close. Anyway, I was struggling with that and the fact that I just got my promotion basically stolen from me and all I was doing was laying in bed for a month afterwards because I was sick. Like, how does one come back from that? I made a promise to myself to return to work and fight like hell to get my name back on that list.

In August, I finally returned. I told them that I could handle being back in full force but they didn't believe me. They gave me three days, each with 7-hour shifts. After a MONTH of quarantine, me and my family were out hundreds, if not thousands of dollars from not receiving our paychecks from our respective occupations. I received EPSLA money for having to miss work for COVID but that was only $500 (not complaining, but it is not enough for me to support anything). Anyway, I told them I would come in on my days off and one of the managers said that was fine. Well, when I came in, I clocked in and the store's phone immediately started ringing. The operator asked who approved my shift and why I was there. I took the phone and told him that I spoke to someone and made an oral agreement prior to my presence. They all assured me it was ""okay,"" but they don't want people just showing up uninvited. This was a blatant lie because someone else showed up 3 SECONDS before me and had to get a manager to approve their shift and they didn't say a damn word.

Nobody wanted me back. I left with people standing by my side for me losing my promotion to two people arguably not qualified. Now, nobody wanted me around because I had COVID-19. The depression officially kicked in around this time in August. Not to mention, Emily, yeah it has been awhile since she has been mentioned, I left with her telling me she still wasn't interested in any sort of relationship and that she probably didn't want one until college. Well, when I returned, she told me she was with somebody. All of my emotions, piled up from past instances similar to this one and of all of the crap that had happened to me prior in July all mixed together and formed this numbing drug that coursed through my veins. After that, I was completely indifferent. I didn't speak to anybody unless I had to. I didn't feel anything at all. I wasn't sad, angry or anything. I was just there. Nobodt seemed to notice or to even care for that matter. I felt utterly invisible. I began to get back on track with hours and money and I couldn't even be happy about it. I just shrugged my shoulders. Also, a week into being back at work, I had to quarantine AGAIN after being in contact with someone.

In September, school had already been in session and I was attending in person instruction for the first quarter. It wasn't too bad. September was close to that of June. Nothing too interesting happened, I was mostly just cutting myself off from the rest of society. I went to school silent then went home, got dressed and went to work. It was hard to see Emily happy knowing damn well that I wasn't even remotely.

In October, things started to get worse again. I started sensing a pattern like when I was infected. Things would feel fine then get worse. My job hired a new manager with zero experience whatsoever. I mean I HAD to teach him how to do stuff around the store. This upset me because I explicitly remember being told I was next on the list to be a manager. I was flabbergasted. This did work out in my favor, however, because people started talking to me again. It was just like July. Everyone ran to my side and told me they wished it was me (again, their words, I apologize if it comes off as narcissistic). Then, similar to July, I got a phone call at work. It was my mother. She told me the school called her to inform us that I was exposed for an ""abundance of time"" to an individual who had COVID-19. Me being me, I found out who it was in five minutes because I'm THAT nosy and don't mind spending some time to do some digging. I sent an email to the principal, the teacher whose class I was exposed in and two students who were absent that Friday before I was informed. Needless to say, I had to quarantine... AGAIN. This is round 2. I didn't get COVID-19, again, nor have I thus far (as of Dec. 2020).

I returned to work once more and was actually greeted with respect and love. I was still battling depression because that stuff just doesn't go away but I started feeling like I mattered again. My boss sat down with me and addressed the elephant in the room and told me I was next in line for a management position and they only hired (we'll call him) Steve because he wants to run his own store. Of course, ME. BEING. ME. I understood. I didn't let it bother me too much. Emily came to work one day, visibly upset. I asked what was up and she told me her and her boyfriend broke up. On the outside, I was kind and pitied her. But, naturally, on the inside, I was jumping up and down like a 4-year-old at a waterpark. I told her I was there if she needed anything. However, ""anything"" did not constitute a relationship of any kind. Needless to say, I got rejected for a fourth time. Never in my life have I ever wanted someone so badly. My romantic feelings had consumed me and she was all I thought about other than my failure.

In November, I turned 17 and took it as a good thing, you know? As if I had turned a new leaf. This was false. Me and Emily had a huge falling out where I almost ensued in a legal battle. I didn't, we worked it out but it got pretty toxic there for a second. My boss sat me down and said my character was not in question but the toxicity of the drama needed to subside. He told me (WORD FOR WORD), ""we appreciate everything you do here. You are doing better than you were even before and still somehow work the most hours even with school. You are at the top of the list for a promotion and it's right around the corner."" If you haven't sensed the pattern up to this point, you will momentarily. I found a list in our (empty) dining room. Said list read (in order from top to bottom), ""[My Name], Audrey, Lisa, Emma, [and] Amanda."" For privacy reasons, these are all fake names. My initial reaction was ""holy shit, I am LITERALLY at the top of this list."" I examined it closely and came to a final conclusion and referenced one of my bosses that I was close with (Mike from earlier) and he confirmed that my interpretation was 100% accurate. I was at the top of some list to be promoted.

BUT, of course I'm not next — I'm not that lucky, nor do I think they really want to promote me. They skipped me and promoted Audrey. They haven't even told me about it and it has been three weeks. Nobody has spoken to me, mentioned any promotions, hell, I have to consult MIKE of all people to know ANYTHING that's going on anymore. I've considered quitting my job but I have nowhere else to go, nor do I want to be anywhere else. That place is my home. I spent 6 hours there on my day off playing piano for my coworkers today.

The reason this promotion thing stings so bad and continues to cut deep is because I wasn't even thinking about it when I first got this job. I only got it as an after school thing. But when they told me that I was up for a promotion, the game changed drastically. I never thought I would equate to someone that would be a manager at a high-end fast food joint. I never would've guessed I'd be considered. And then, to see everyone stand beside me upset... to see that I had such an impact on everyone... it made me realize how much this actually meant not only to myself but for everyone. It would have been different if my boss simply said, ""one day we will promote you but we don't know when."" But he never said that. He said I was next 4 times but hasn't followed through with my promotion. And I do SO MUCH for that place. I know I make more money than everyone else because of my hours so I began to buy things for everyone. Every paycheck, I buy someone (at random) one of the expensive company jackets. I make runs to Starbucks for everyone and give away money like candy. I make sacrifices when people don't want to be in a certain position, I step up and take the position despite my utter hatred. I'm a leader. It's what I was built to do, but I've been obstructed for 9 months.

This relationship thing stings so bad because I've been single for two years now. I haven't found anybody interested in me for this duration. Not a single person. I've had feelings for people but they've turned me down without exception. It's almost completely uniform for this to happen. So when I fell in love with Emily, whom I still have strong feelings for, I thought it would be different. A change of pace. I've never been this stuck on someone before and I don't know why. Maybe it's the love, maybe I'm just crazy, hell, I'd almost bet on the latter. I thought I felt an actual connection with almost everyone I've caught feelings for. And I know other people saw it because other people encouraged me to go after them. This time, it was personal discretion to go after Emily. Perhaps that's why I assumed it would be different but it was stupid to make such an assumption.

This is where my story ends, for now. It's basically a fucking novel so I do apologize for it's length but I haven't mentioned this in its entirety to anyone. Plus, with strangers, I'm better off pouring my feelings out to people who will actually listen and try to help. Thank you for reading if you stuck around for this long. It means a lot. Until next time.

I said no, but I always wondered if I would feel as alone as I still do. Basically almost friendless and constantly isolated, if I hadn’t said no to considering it.

I figured that since I was autistic (So I have a lot of hard things to deal with and work on assuming they can be) and deal with a plethora of mental issues among many other things that it’d just be worthless. Still very much do.

So I usually find people online, on Reddit or Instagram. Usually, I find them through liking the same interests or doing the same things, and over time I love getting closer to them. 

But over time, I always find it hard when the excitement of texting often or even every day starts to fade, and your new best friend tells you how busy they are and how they're calling their friends, getting work done, etc. And slowly you realize they are responding less and less, and you keep trying to get their attention but realize after a while that you can't be the only one initiating everything. 

It can be so painful when these wonderful people in your life slip away, especially when you really have nobody else to turn to or talk to.

I'm scared I might be going through this again, and I don't really know what to do.

\-Teeth falling/pulling out

\-Jumping off high-rise buildings and falling

\-Being lost in large labyrinths sometimes with other random wanders who I don't know

\-Being hunted 

\-Driving on rural roads

\-Climbing odd mountains

\-Feeling foreign to close to family/friends OR Not being seen or heard

2189,Over_Cartographer_77,1608188782,1,"It seems like everything about my life is designed to give me the vague illusion of hope but preventing me ever of realizing my ambitions, like all the cards were stacked against me at birth. And the problem is, it's hard for me to consistently realize the extent to which everything about my life is wrong and in need of repair and constant action. My memory is complete shit and my motivation/ability to feel anything consistently is shit, like, to the point where the inspiration I had for writing this very paragraph is dissipating. I feel like I've done nothing at all my whole life, that I'm a dull person, a walking cliche much of an individual identity. I feel blank and lost a lot of the times, and only feel like my authentic self when alone and reading/using the internet, when things are easier to process &amp; interpret. But the problem is, I want to I feel like I'm always several steps behind everyone else, and that when I'm pressured to even just say something (in my characteristic sloppy manner) I get misconstrued and gaslighted. I've never been able to break the barrier of my family -- partly because of the reasons I've listed, and also because of how insular &amp; almost afraid they've always been to outsiders, how unsympathetic/hypocritically self-righteous they can be, and how rigidly hierarchical/entitled/protective/ coddling their parenting style is.  I almost think I've developed independently of them (at least in terms of values like responsibility, self-discipline, empathy, etc. as well as general personality traits/tastes), yet they don't realize this and I get the sense they view me as some sort of pet that is supposed to follow their commands, isn't capable of critical thinking, just acts ""weird"" and at the end of the day needs to be put in his place when he acts uppity occasionally.

Ultimately, I feel completely hopeless, stuck, destined to repeat the same mistakes and live the same uninteresting life year after year for the foreseeable future. I don't want 2021 to be a repeat of the ups and downs I experienced in 2020. The internet (youtube, wikipedia, social media, movies, music) has allowed me to see a world with a much richer history, perspectives, and cultures that if I were my age just 10 years ago I would not have been able to learn from. In a sense, along with the other things which give me purpose in life (film, music, math, computer science, literature, the potential of learning from and being a friend to others) its one of the main things that has provided me with hope for a future of change, of self-actualization, of what I could be if I were just to resolve a few things in the present. Someone's friend. But I have almost no clue how to realize any of these things: I want to have a career as perhaps a software engineer or in math but my memory/cognitive issues, combined with the increased difficulty and self-reliance of distance learning have resulted me in just barely passing any of my classes. I feel like at this point my only recourse is to try to get diagnosed &amp; medicated for ADHD and get a job and start taking matters in my life into my own hands &amp; be free to succeed or more likely fail, but again I don't know if I have the will or sustained courage to do these things without stopping at the first signs of adversity and fucking myself over, by disturbing the uneasy peace I have now with everyone in my life without realizing it. In a way I feel like this whole confession is meaningless and a waste of time: after spending 30 minutes writing this I'm still in the same idle condition I was when I began. But I guess if someone were willing to read through this, offer some recognition of what I'm going through, &amp; maybe even give advice, then that would in some fateful way be the thing that saves me.",lonely,"I feel completely hopeless, bound to always be lonely and misunderstood",2020-12-17 18:06:22

I want to give them my love and my energy. Back massages when they're stressed, pillow fights while we just act like fools and kids (because really, no matter how old we get, we're still like kids), hug them from behind, listen to them when they're complaining, calm them down when they're panicking, ground them when they're shaky. Take care of them when they're sick, get them little gifts when I go out.

And have that all reciprocated.

But I think I'll always be too scared to do it. I'm glad to have a loving family and good friends so I know I'm not in the worst situation. Plenty of people give me love and I have so many chances to love people. But there's a difference between platonic and romantic love. I can feel something missing in my life and I don't want to pass by if someone good comes along because I'm too scared to reach out. 

At this point though, I don't even care to think longterm. All I want is a guy who lives near me, is near my age, isn't a creep, has good hygiene and I think looks okay. I just want to find that guy and just sleep in his arms without expecting anything else, then get up and go home.

I listed off a few names of people I’ve hung out with occasionally before, but I’ve left the house like twice in the past two weeks. He was like, “how can you have no friends? What happened to all of them?” And all that shit. It’s not like I’m unproductive and lazy. I do shit tons of homework and I work out each night. I’m unemployed, and friendless, and my parents are noticing how little I actually leave the house when I have no job.

I have friends, or I did, not too long ago. I was out all the time, every other day, biking or driving around or partying. Then all of the sudden no one wanted to hang out with me, which is fine, honestly, I don’t mind being alone. But I definitely don’t want to spend the rest of my teenage years like a lonely sack of shit. I just wish my dad wasn’t so judgmental. I don’t know what he wants me to do. If he wants me to get a job, I’ll get a job, I plan on talking to a recruiter soon anyways. But there’s nothing I can do about my friend situation. I don’t go to school, I don’t go to work, I can’t eat out, can’t go to any after school activities, where the fuck am I supposed to meet people that actually want to be my friend.

Finding someone new to only become ‘trapped’ in a relationship with a narcissist. A narcissist who managed to drive my only friends away from me by manipulating me (an ultimatum between him and them) and telling my friends that they’re “bad people” to their faces. So I lost my friendship group of 6 years. I have a old friend who I hadn’t seen for a while who reached out to me to meet up. After sitting me down and asking how I felt I gained the confidence to walk away from my narcissistic partner. Since then I have been developing feels for my old friend who helped me and we have been ‘friends with benefits’ since. Best friends, who cuddle, kiss, hang out and fuck. I like him, a lot. However he is moving away. Half way across the globe. With him and my only other friend going to university in September I feel more isolated than ever before. A pandemic only exaggerates this. I’ve never attempted to take my life but I’ve really considered it sometimes. I know this isn’t the answer however I don’t see things getting better as I’ve lost so many people and it would seem that I’m about to lose everybody else. (I also have borderline personality disorder, so the whole abandonment issues aren’t really doing me any favours).

But she significantly reduced that for me while we were together. Anyway I have no desire to do what used to make me happy before. I feel like I lost who I was and I can't loosen up about it. It seems impossible to accept her leaving me. I barely eat anything or even sleep well, because I'm so stuck in my head and overthink shit. I told her that too and she just said she wishes me luck.

Not only am I very single, I’m also a virgin and I’ve never even been kissed before. Seeing so many happy couples makes my heart sink, especially when said couple is around my age. I absolutely hate seeing or hearing about healthy relationships. For anyone wondering, I’ve only ever been asked out once. I unfortunately didn’t find myself physically or emotionally attracted to the guy and this makes me feel terrible because I’m worried that no one will ever ask me out again, and I also just feel super guilty about rejecting him because lord knows how well I handle rejection. I see a lot of posts on here from men that have been single their entire lives, but I rarely see any from women. This makes me feel even lonelier because it makes me wonder if there’s something wrong with me. So many of the women in my life are in and have been in relationships, I feel like such a weird fuck. Two of the reasons why I might be single is my shitty personality paired with my bad mental health, along with being raised by Catholic parents (my mother being the most religious, it also doesn’t help that she has problems with her mental health and refuses treatment).

Now I can barely do that, I'm so fucking sad, and I have really bad days sometimes where I just cry thinking of all i'm missing. All the support and structure his family gave me that I never had. I even met someone else this year (a gaming buddy) who is now my bf, though he lives about 1000km away and also has a bit of a broken family.

For some reason the past few months in particular I’ve been dying for some kind of affection, sexual attention, romance, flirting, companionship. Most of my life I kind of ignore these feelings, took a lot of opportunity/people for granted. It was just never what I was focused on, and maybe my sex drive was always low growing up and even through my 20s. 

Start about 6 months ago, I have been dying to be around a woman, or many. I want relationships with a lot girls and I want to make them feel good and vise versa. I feel like part of it stems from regret and thinking about all the opportunities I’ve missed out on. I did a lot to seclude myself growing up, didn’t go to college, never really went out much. And now I’m just thinking of everything I missed, all the time and fun experiences I won’t get to have.

I feel pretty good about myself, but still feel like I’m dying to feel the confidence of someone wanting to be around me and share love and affection. it really feels like it’s been a couple of years since I was show any kind of attention or desire from a girl. I can’t say I’ve tried much until lately to find it, but it seems like a void. I’m dying to be made feel like a man. 


With that said I’m not trying to take what I do have for granted and realize some people have much it much harder than me. But right now it just seems like no one else is seeing me. And affection feels so out of sight. I feel like I deserve it, but maybe I don’t? 
I’m not sure but the last week has been really hard, I’m in a rut I can’t seem to escape. Have had some really dark thoughts about myself. Hoping that putting this out there maybe helps or I gain some bit of perspective.

TLDR: craving female attention, feel invisible. But realize it’s mostly selfish desires.",lonely,Desire affection (m27),2020-12-17 04:33:02

Yesterday was my birthday, but only 3 of my closest friends remembered. This is the third? year in a row that this has happened, and I can't help but feel hurt. Everyone knows I love celebrating other people's birthdays! Because I grew up shy and introverted, as a barely functioning adult I think that it's a great time to give letters and celebrate their life together. I guess I have an innate knack for remembering birthdays, I've never missed a close friend/current colleague's birthday. I'm usually the one who remembers and get people together to plan something, or else I'll get them a gift by myself. For especially close friends, I give more personalised gifts and cards.

I know I shouldn't be giving people things and expecting something in return, especially as an adult... But I can't help but feel happy everytime someone thinks about me. I rarely had friends growing up, so it warms my heart. But now I'm starting to realise that most of my friends are too busy with their lives to spare a thought about me, besides these 3 friends. My best friend, someone I've known for more than 10 years and gone through shit together with, completely forgot my birthday again. I think she was spending it with her boyfriend watching movies. She even mentioned that she was going out to celebrate another friend's birthday a few days ago.

My colleagues whom I've been working side by side closely together for the past 2 years, whom I went out of my way to get them each something they liked for their birthdays - saw that it was my birthday and I guess, glossed over it? Last year when they realised in the middle of the workday, they tried to get me a muffin last minute but ended up not buying anything because it was inconvenient. One of them actually got into an argument with me over work and said really hurtful things last week.

Another close friend who loves birthdays as much as I do, has remembered my birthday wrongly for the past 4 years of knowing and correcting him, but remembered all of our mutual friends' birthdays correctly.

Is it wrong of me to want to be selfish for once? To want the people I care about to just acknowledge me on the one day of the year I treasure? I'm used to being in the background, but it sure hits differently when you actually realise your place in their lives.

Sorry for the super petty silly rant, I know how irrational it is and how I shouldn't take it to heart. But it kinda hurts to know I'm not a 'friend' worth a thought sometimes y'know? At least now I know who my real friends are, and I have my family who will always be there for me. On a happier note, since I spent literally 24 hours of my birthday rushing urgent work and crying on the inside, tomorrow I shall be enjoying my *unbirthday* with a trip to the movies and sushi! :)",lonely,"most of my close friends forgot my birthday, again",2020-12-17 04:26:30

For the longest time, I thought it was just because I was depressed and avoided people, until I actually tried to start dating several years ago.

I have no clue how to approach someone in public, so I decided that online dating would work best.  It's not that I don't have confidence, I just feel awkward asking out a random person who for all I know could be happily taken.

I tried to meet people online using several different websites and apps, but after months of trying, I only had a few matches, and none of them lasted longer than a few days.

I thought a big part of my problem was me.  I was afraid to really commit because I felt I had nothing to offer.  I was broke, my appearance was shit, I was overweight, I was still depressed and I'm a bit small below the belt.

So I've spent the last 2 years working to improve what I can.  I managed to start saving money.  I worked to improve my appearance, and people that know me have definitely noticed.  I started working out and losing weight, and even overcame my depression.

I still have work to do, but I've come a long way, so I decided it was time to try again.  I've spent the last few months trying, and it seems like nothing has changed.  Now I'm starting to wonder if there is just something inherently wrong with me.

Some people are so privileged in their own way, to have food on their table, to have a steady education, to be part of a community that cares for them.

2291,cassie_to_heart,1608125253,1,"Truth be told, I'm conflicted if making this post seems well ...worth it, my mind seems to be on auto-pilot but the truth of the matter is that for much of my life *(12 years specifically)*, I've always felt a lingering sense of loneliness, isolation and the feeling of being misunderstood. From my strangely developed interests to the values I seek in life, it seems the people to share it along with are of a rarity but most importantly, the feeling I face with resignation that many will go on with their lives, to grow.... to evolve, to turn the page into the next chapter. Meanwhile, I remain stagnant, not out of choice, but borne out of circumstances and I feel slowly being backed into a corner with nowhere to go.

Emotionally, I feel a great sense of wanting to confide in someone, mutually understand any shared unspoken experiences *(shared misery including)*, knowing that any platitudes which are mostly thrown around don't apply to everyone.

There is a perpetual battle that often plays out in my head, if I have a purpose in life. Trying to unlock the answer of so, and the answer is I am driven to a large extent by people, or shall we say, a person. To have that person be receptive of me and appreciate the things that I can provide within my limits, that is good enough to keep going. At the crux of it, I am a purpose driven individual, I rely on some measure of justified hope to plow through, even if it isn't easy.

Such feelings to confide in someone would make me feel less invincible, and that I matter and to you, you matter. This may not be of an appealing sentiment to hear, but I really don't matter to a lot of people, at least, here in the civilian world. I've come to accept that conclusion and as per the intention of the post, looking for AD/vets primarily to share correspondence, ideally, long-term. Less walls I have to build up compared to connecting with most people.

My only close, male friend... just so happens to be in the USMC, infantry all things considering... and to put it in a rather cheesily positive spin, he's the rough-around-the-edges, gruff crayon eating jarhead, wearing a shemagh and proudly considers his M240 of a puppy his beloved. In a moment during the course of our established friendship, I felt a sense of momentary peace, a feeling of belonging.... and amusing how it ends up in a way being acquainted with someone whose profession is to shoot holes in people, training other enlisted marines in lethality, just as himself. As for myself, I had a job then to plug those holes after my brief time as a student RN... which ultimately didn't work out.

I often tackle feelings of being different, unsure where I fit in, in that when it came to the advisement of his career once the 4 year contract would expire and the active consideration of getting out of the MC, it'd be me suggesting he take private contracting!

Career wise, I had for a while wanted to work in close collaboration with the military even in my short ambitious path of nursing *(then ambition to pursue military flight nursing or work as a RAAF or DoD civilian nurse)* and after an reassessment of my life to consider pursuing a Masters in International Relations, to hopefully specialize in the field of national security/private sector work to get some more meat on the bones in terms of experiences.

So I guess feeling detached and isolated would be apt terms of what I'm feeling right now. 

As far as interests/hobbies goes, I guess watching YT videos on the niche side of things counts? But then people find a way to criticize alas!

2303,ExactCalligrapher795,1608109740,1,"I made a friend off of one of these type of subreddits a while back. Things were going pretty well and then he ghosted me. 

I already have pretty bad trust issues relating to friendships due to my past. I was definitely hurt by his actions even though I tried not to take it personally. I’ve tried really really hard to still be open to people and making friends because I know not everyone wants to hurt me. Right? Right?

I’m 19 and I already feel super jaded and bitter. A lot of the time I wish my mindset was different, more open and loving like I was as a child. But I feel as if my current mindset protects me from people hurting me. But when I try to change, when I open up to people and they abandon me, it crushes my entire being. 

I know I sound dramatic as hell, but this is a vent post after all. Does anyone else struggle with the mindset of “don’t hurt me, and don’t come close to me. But if you do, don’t leave me”?? Sometimes I feel like I’m the only immature 19 year old like me and everyone else is so mature and just doesn’t care what happens between them and other people. 

My real question is: what am I doing wrong? I try hard not to be hurt, but I’m hurt anyway. I’m honest with people about myself and my intentions, and they go and do the exact opposite of what they know I can accept as behavior. It kind of feels like God/the universe just wants me to be alone at this point. And I’d be ok with that. 

I guess part of life is accepting that humans will hurt you. Especially if you’re close to them. But I am having the hardest of times accepting that. 

Any advice? Especially from someone who’s been through a similar situation, would be much appreciated &lt;3",lonely,Confused,2020-12-16 20:09:00

I also get in my head about my loneliness when my boyfriend spends nearly every night online playing with friends and is telling me about his time. I'm very glad he has the groups that he does and he has invited me before to join in, but with my room being on the main floor I get anxious about roommates hearing me talking since everything is very audible both inside and out of my room (I've always been super volume cautious with myself in general as a result of how I grew up). I've explained so to him when I first moved when he would invite me so he doesn't anymore, but having connections and talking to people with an actual voice daily is something I miss so much.

When I was very young, I was apparently a somewhat popular kid in school, this was so long ago I don't even remember it. I mention this because honestly, for as long as I can remember I've never really felt like I fit in. I don't know what happened, if anything, but for many years I simply don't feel like I belong. In high school, I was the nerdy kid who took all the art classes, played video games and was in the background most of the time. However it didn't matter if I was with my small group of friends, in class or simply by myself I always felt like the odd one out. Even within my own family I feel the same way. It's not a feeling of being unwanted, in most cases people will make me feel welcome. While I appreciate it I simply don't feel like I am a part of the group. It has been something frustrating to deal with even though I am pretty sure it's just the way I am. Could I probably try and change? Well yes, but most of the time it doesn't feel like that big of a deal. That is until I spend too much time alone with nothing to do and all the thoughts come back. I try and stay busy so I don't have to think about life, stress, depression or any of that stuff that tends to ruin peoples days. While I know I got sidetracked, even to this day I still feel the same. I thought maybe if I went to art school I would feel a bit more welcome, but I don't feel any different. If anything its exactly the same. I've tried joining various clubs, but nothing. I am also a work study here, and thanks to my work ethic I have managed to be in the highest position I can within only my first year here. No matter what I do, who I'm with, or where I'm at, I just feel like I'm out of place. I'm sure someone out there knows what I'm talking about. If not then lucky me I guess. Main reason why I am creating this post is just to express what I'm thinking. I don't usually think about this stuff but I guess tonight is just one of those nights unfortunately.

I also noticed it went from iMessages to texts after I woke up. The first night was all iMessages, but when I wake up and hit send it would try to send as iMessage initially...wait a few seconds...and then it would send as a text message instead. Although, even when it sent as a text message she still  couldn’t see it for some reason. I have screenshots of the text where you can see “gn” in blue and the next message in green, I promise this isn’t some weird fantasy I made up and I don’t care about karma. I  googled what the issue was, tried their solutions, still no response. I lost hope and gave up a while ago. I even tried calling and leaving a voicemail cause I was just desperate at that point but still no. I find it hard to believe she would block my number considering she was asking me to respond. It’s like some random friend I made on the internet just got ripped from me with no explanation and I knew her for one fucking day. I don’t even know how to reach out anymore, all I have is a first name and a phone number that can’t hear me anymore. If anyone for some reason understands why exactly this would happen please message me. If not then thanks for at least reading I guess.

2345,Hanahikaa,1608090375,1,"A lot of the time when I talk to people who grew up in one house, with the same friends their whole life, they act like they can grasp what it’s like to not have that but they really don’t. 
I moved schools every two years growing up until I graduated high school so it was a cycle of moving, shoving my way into friend groups where I was the least liked, and then breaking off and never seeing those people again. 
And even now, I haven’t known anyone long enough for them to consider me a closer friend than any of their other ones. And it makes sense, y’know why would you hold a new friend dearer than one you’ve known all your life? But... it is lonely to know that I will never be that friend. 
Every friend I make has friends they’re closer to, and no matter how hard I try to shoehorn myself in, I never integrate. I feel like I’m floating in between and nobody gets it because nobody else was a mover like I was. It doesn’t matter how pretty I am or how talented I am or how much I hone talents that can impress others.. all I get is “wow you’re good!” And that’s pretty much all I’m worth. 
I wish for once I could have a group of friends that look up to me. Or a friend who texts me first and invites me to hang out or calls me and isn’t asking for help with homework. I must just be that vague. 
I can’t bring this up to my friends of course because they’ll think I’m condemning them or trying to guilt them or start something. 
I just wish I could’ve stayed in one place long enough to have a friend who is obligated.. no, someone who wants to be my friend, and actually cares if I leave.",lonely,Moved around a lot as a kid. People don’t get that,2020-12-16 14:46:15

Dear favorite professor and academic advisor,

I’m finally letting go. For good. I’m giving you up. You don’t have to worry about me bothering you ever again. I promise to stay away as much as possible. 

I’m sorry if I have made your life worse these past four years. I’m sorry if I have uncomfortable, if I have annoyed you, bored you, scared you. It seems like that’s all I do these days. You are always polite and good to me but, lately, whenever I speak with you I feel like you can’t wait to get away from me. Do you dread talking to me? Yesterday it seemed like it. I hadn’t spoken to you in person in over a year, and you are my advisor. I try hard to always give you an “out,” to be respectful of your time, to look for cues that you are bored. 

There was a time when I thought you really liked talking to me. You even told me once “I like talking to you.” You always pointed out all the ways we were similar and others could see it too. You said you saw your younger self in me, you counseled and comforted me. You teased me in class and smiled wide when you saw me in the halls, and I did the same back to you. We talked about music and philosophy. You encouraged me to submit my papers to prize committees. 

You told me it was nice to have me in class, because I was the only one who would talk sometimes and you hated silences. I always laughed at your jokes even when the others didn’t, and you always tended to look right at me when you lectured, probably because I was listening so attentively. 

I always did all the readings, and asked questions about them after class. I worked so hard on my papers. I got into a program at Oxford (the same one you went to) because of your recommendation, but then lost my spot because I failed my classes (were you disappointed, think less of me, after everything you did for me? I bet.)  You suggested books for me to read and I read them and we discussed them. You seemed to like doing this. You seemed to be grateful and happy. You initiated full blown conversations with me when you saw me outside of class (now you seem uncomfortable and eager to get away from me before I start talking). 

You were the best thing that has ever happened to me. I’ve never admired or liked being around anyone more than you. You understood me it seemed in a way no one else did, despite being 30 years older than me. You said I couldn’t ever shock or scare you, when I apologized for confiding in you about my bipolar disorder. You said you had many bipolar friends throughout the years. You said “sometimes very smart people have very hard times.” 

A year later, I took another class with you and when I stopped turning in work you got concerned and contacted the Dean. I was doing badly, having flashbacks to my childhood sexual abuse at the time. I didn’t want to use it as an excuse but I wanted you to know. I should never have told you but I confided in you about my my sexual abuse. It felt so good. I had t told anyone at that point. But then it felt bad. I think I went to far. I didn’t ask for any extensions or any special assistance or comfort but I should never have told you. You didn’t need to know. I’m sorry. Maybe that’s when things really started to change. 

I did poorly in your class and other classes. I struggled and acted weird around you I think. I tried to avoid you for a few months. I became suicidal. I stopped going to classes. I was hospitalized in a psych ward for nine days during the middle of the semester. You found out. Everyone in found out. I tried to get things back to normal. I tried to get your attention back. 

Now you seem to try and avoid me. It’s subtle but I can tell. You are nice and polite to me still but your voice is flat and dry. Your laugh is fake. You literally check your email when I am talking to you. Your answers are short. I know I shouldn’t expect so much from you and I don’t expect it. Still, I desire it. Why do I try so hard to get it back when it’s clearly gone? Im very sorry. 

I really try hard to not be a bother. I really thought you genuinely enjoyed me, a bit, and wanted to talk but I need to let it go. My enthusiasm, my excitement about the subject, about literature no longer makes you want to share with me. It seems to irritate you. I will give up. It’s a losing battle. I’m a pathetic puppy dog. You probably think I want to end your marriage or something. I swear I don’t. If anything I want you to invite me to your house for a board game or something. I’m so lonely without a family. But that’s not your problem. Obviously. 

Anyway, I need to give up trying to get back the mentor mentee relationship we had. It was the most amazing and intense and beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced in 24 years and I’m sad it ended and I’m extremely angry with myself for ruining it. At least I hope I ruined it. The alternative is that it was never there to begin with. I’ll stick with the story that I ruined it. And I know things used to be different. I know something changed. I think I creeped you out. Showed too much interest. Hell, at one point I even told you I was worried I was getting “too attached” and needed to stop taking classes with you. Now I ruined everything. You probably think I’m a stalker. Not too mention I became dumber and less interesting. I’m grasping at straws now, trying to be smarter, more interesting, more appealing, more stylish (you always cared about fashion and aesthetics) just to get your attention back. I need to give up. You clearly dislike me and don’t want to talk to me. Im sure you wish you didn’t have to advise me. I’m so sorry. 

I asked your colleague, your good friend (a female), if I was crossing any boundaries or annoying you in any way and they said I was fine and that you only ever had good things to say about me and that they would let me know if I overstepped any boundaries. I told her I sometimes was bad at understanding etiquette and picking up on cues and boundaries, and she said she thought I was actually especially sensitive and attuned to those things, and in fact worried almost too much about bothering others. 

I hope she’s right but either way it’s clear you do not like being around me and I unsettle or irritate you and that is totally fair. You are still nice to me but I can tell you are forcing yourself to be. It’s not fair of me to put you in that position anymore. I’m ready to accept that I have crossed a boundary or two and there is no going back now. You have your own life, a wife, children. You need to take care of them and yourself. Im completely insane and not entitled to anything more from you than a grade and academic support. 

You told me once when I confessed my attachment to you “In general it’s not a good idea to get attached to your professors.” Why I didn’t completely stop then and there is beyond me. If that wasn’t a clear enough sign I don’t know what is.

2416,Guybo092,1608044531,1,"Hey all, I'm really stuck at the moment. 

I work for an engineering firm in Britain, I oversee a small team of people on a big infrastructure project. During the covid lockdown I was classed as a key-worker, which meant I was working from home but was also going into work on a rotating basis as the workshop element was still open. 

This time last year I had a co-worker come and live with me, it was a good situation at the time. She was going through a divorce and I had 2 empty rooms in my house - meaning I'd get some cash to help with bills / mortgage etc. She's usually kept herself to herself, she's been using the two bedrooms and the main bathroom. (I've got an en-suite). Only seeing each other in kitchen. 

However, when lockdown hit in March we started hanging out a bit more to overcome the loneliness and boredom of it all. At first it was just chilling, playing games, watching TV etc but after a few weekends on the booze it eventually started to turn into a bit more. Much to the extent where we just started having fun whenever the mood took us. 
(Even in the office - the joys of knowing that the director didn't have CCTV in his office and it locks from the inside with no windows). The sex was great, and given me having testicular cancer, the chance of kids is nill! (I take any positives from it when I can!)

Things were going great, having regular heated passionate sex with her, I was getting help with the bills and she had a place to call home.

However, in the past 3 weeks my work have announced that they are shutting our factory and office facility and making all but 3 staff redundant out of 38 of us. I am one of the 3 who is being kept on, but being transferred to a different division. They will all be paid full salaries until the end of Feb 2021. 

Upon hearing this news, she has gone absolutely batshit crazy saying that I've used her and it was my plan all along. I did find out before the announcement was made, but only by about 2 hours (whilst I was in the office and she was at home). 

I really don't know what to do, I've told her that she can stay with me as long as she wants and not to worry about any rent etc until she's got a new job and that our bit of fun was just that - non-committal fun with no expectations. Since that conversation she's admitted that she really likes me and considers me her boyfriend - but wouldn't want to share a bed full time or tell parent, friends, families etc. Just keep it a secret. 

She's also signed up for dating sites saying she needs full commitment from someone to feel give her commitment?!

Guess I'll start here, this year I reconnected with someone in my life whom I had a close personal and romantic relationship,  arguably the person who knows how my brain works and gets me and can see through me like glass. Over the past few months we had been rebuilding and just texting each other and having a great time.

This is where my troubles began. To cut it short last night after general conversation and the general flirting that comes with it.  she made it clear that nothing in any way will ever happen between is which I was fine with. I didn't come back to this hoping some rekindling of romance just to be with someone who understood me.



Just like I guess I fucked up you know? Like I let myself get close to somebody and fed myself a lie that like I knew was fake but let myself believe something could've happened you know?
And this itself has me seeing an immense amount of shame and loneliness because I feel like I had let myself down by breaking every rule I laid down for myself here.

It hurts to see them dealing with their situation, and know that I tried to be supportive but they kind of just shut me out once the abusive person discarded me.

It hurts. It’s hurt for a while. And I’m just really sad, and confused, and I feel like nothing I said or did to try to help made any difference. Can anyone else relate?

I was more attractive and ever since I screwed up that relationship I have lost myself .. it was mostly my fault because I didn’t know  what I wanted and just led her on untill I just had an episode where I didn’t care and told her you don’t deserve me .. maybe we should break up yada yada and after that whole scenario the following weeks I kept losing myself more and more so I stopped going to school , stayed home and such .. and played more video games then I should all while neglecting my health and becoming lazy and fat .. I hate it and I hate myself for not knowing better and I don’t know how at this point if I’m going to survive 2021 .. I might just end it all yk ..  I haven’t really put myself out there anymore or at all and a big motivation for me that made me happy was me being fit asf .. I had a really nice body that gave me confidence but when I lost that I lost a big portion of myself I believe.. but yea man I’m basically lonely asf in this life .. I would like to know how the warm sensation of a hug from someone that cares about you feels .. preferably a lover but I don’t think I’ll ever feel something as wonderful again .. I have a lot of relatable things I could talk about and go on about but I’ll end this here .. sorry if it was confusing.. my mental ISNT so good and is deteriorated from years of having these illnesses but I’m yea .. thanks for reading {^_^}",lonely,Hi [^~^],2020-12-15 22:28:45

I became numb at this point.. I still feel terrible because my life has been nothing but me being destroyed by people despite always just being a kind.. good.. genuine person. (Before you get the idea of “Always the victim person” no I have done bad to the best of people do bad it’s inevitable and does not have to be intentional, for me none of it was intentional I just fucked up at times) but primarily it’s just been my weakness and difference to the majority of society.

Now I’m just an empty shell.. I keep imagining being held by someone that unconditionally loves me.. holds me.. keeps me warm.. loves me.. smiles at me.. that we love each other the same and so much we can’t put words to it.. someone like me who I’ve now learned doesn’t truly exist no matter how similar I may find a person to be to me, they mustn’t be like me even if we think that we’ve just fooled ourselves..

How I’ve been cold for so long

Devoid of any touch for too long 

Wanting something so simple 

Something seemingly small 

But would be the world to me 

Wanting at least a few seconds 

Of a warm embrace 

That has never been given to me 

Compressing me In warmth 

That I’ve never felt 

Steadily, reassuring me 

Whispering Sweetness in my ear 

That I’ve never heard 

Wanting a touch 

That would make the world melt away

Also, this is a difficult time of year for a lot of people. We'll get through it though! I wish I could hug each and every one of you.

One more thing: the name of your subreddit got this lovely song into my head. ""Lonely People"" by America. 70s folk rock group, for those who weren't around then. Well, I wasn't either. 80s baby here, but I heard a lot of this kind of music growing up. This is one of those songs that my parents would sing together and my dad played guitar with it.

It's a lovely memory amidst a lot of not so lovely ones. So thanks for reminding me. :)

2440,galactibabe,1608020123,1,"I broke up with my first serious boyfriend in February 2018. I met a guy through tinder and tried to make a relationship out of it, but he only led me on for a year. I had been single and alone for a while until December 2019, when I met someone on here. We seemed to hit it off really well and then, 2 days after my birthday in May of this year, he completely went radio silent on me. Blocked me everywhere. Deleted his Reddit account. Turns out he was married the whole time and was just using me. I guess his wife must’ve found out and he was trying to cover his ass. I mean, she must’ve noticed him sending me money frequently so I could buy things he wanted to get for me, right? 

I’m just laying in bed at 3am right now really processing that I’ve only ever been used. Nobody has ever truly loved me. I have never heard the words “I love you” directed at me, and had them mean anything. I haven’t been in any physical contact with another person in nearly 3 years. Everything hurts. I feel like I’ll never find anyone that could ever make me open up and trust again. I get so jealous now seeing my friends who are in long term, loving relationships. They have something I don’t: someone to love them. It’s so agonizing seeing people holding hands, hugging, kissing, snuggling on the couch, experiencing real and genuine love. It hurts when I’m the only one at parties (safely, of course, we’re all clean and still abide by distancing) that is sitting by themselves. It wears me down hearing people talk about their SO and how they know they’ll be marrying them. It hurts going to bed and waking up alone in a cold bed. Nobody is there to tell me I look nice when I actually get ready for the day. Nobody is there to rub my back when I feel sick because I ate too much too late at night. Nobody is there to hold me during thunder storms because they scare me. Everything hurts and all I do is sleep now.",lonely,Just a Thing About my Brain at the Moment,2020-12-15 19:15:23

Do they shop for you when you don't know what you want?

Do they send soup to your door when you are sick and they're out of town?

Do they let you be the one in charge of music in the car, even though your taste in music sucks?

Do they drop what they’re doing and drive two hours in the rain to see you when your down?

Do they let you fuck other women even though it hurts because they just want you to be happy?

Do they complement your singing even when you’re flat?

2446,brightflame40,1608015774,1," People tend to like me. I have a job, hobbies and did a lot of volunteer work in the past. I don’t really complain alot about things (except in this post maybe haha). Everywhere I go I get along with people and I’ve been told I’m friendly and fun to be around. I’ve been told that both to my face and overheard it in conversation when people thought I wasn’t in the room.

And yet I have not had any friends for the past five years. I had a great deal of friends when I was a kid and in high school I had a tight knit circle and got along fine with most people that weren’t in that group. Those friendships sort of faded away once we all left for college, as they do. College was fine, I got along well with my classmates and always had people to sit with in class or have a conversation with on campus, but I wouldn’t consider them my friends. Don’t get me wrong they were nice people, but they all had their own friend groups and I sort of fell between those. When class ended for the day I just went home and spent my evening alone in front of the tv or browsing the internet. I tried though, did my share of extracurricular activities and even went on an exchange to another country. Always the same problem, friendliness and high fives all around, but no real connections. 

Graduated college, got my dream job, but still the same problem. I talk to my colleagues about work related stuff and general office banter, but other than that I only talk to my parents and an ex girlfriend who I kept in touch with, although the latter is only a monthly thing.

I don’t mean to sound ungrateful. I think my life is great and in most regards I’m exactly where I want to be. Its just that when I get home it all ends. Suddenly I’m alone with my own thoughts and my phone hasn’t even buzzed once in the past 10 nights or so. I have hobbies to keep me occupied. I do woodworking and scale modeling and I’m involved in online communities relating to those. I enjoy my hobbies alot, but sometimes its not enough to drown out the silence. 

I really wish I had some friends to do things with, or to talk with about things that aren’t just trivial conversation. I just want something real, please.

2465,startledbyallofthis,1608009318,1,"Just started college at the beginning of November. All of our classes are arranged by who's on our floor, so with existing in the same space and being in classes for dozens of hours a week, the 10 of us became close quickly.

It was pretty evident almost immediately that I was the least social one, as I would choose to walk to classes alone most of the time, rarely came out of my room, the works. Despite this, when I did socialize it seemed like I sort of had a place in the group and everyone was nice to me.

NOW, when it's gotten shitty: I haven't been able to make it to classes super consistently. I wouldn't rule out the possibility that my behavior is sometimes concerning to someone paying attention. A specific person in our group (this person has the room directly next to mine) is often able to hear when I have a negative episode in my room (throwing things around, being generally loud) and will text me asking if I'm okay. I felt like they and I got closer than I did with anyone else in the group, and quickly. But this past week or so has been especially hard for me, and for some reason this person keeps getting singled out. Our floormates will ask them about me, teachers have more than once told them to pass things on to me. Because of this, I thought it would be good of me to reach out to them and talk about this, apologize for them getting singled out because of me, and explain what I'm going through a bit better.

But when they came to talk and I started to open up, I shut down, HARD. Ended up wasting about 10 minutes of their time stuttering and saying ""nevermind,"" at the end of every sentence. They were being kind and patient, but I ended up telling them something along the lines of ""stop caring about me"" (I honestly don't remember the conversation clearly at all, I was very overwhelmed during it).

The next night, I could hear that they were very upset in their room (there was someone else with them, their closest friend of the group), and after some angry commotion, they texted me saying that I can't tell them not to care, saying that it was bullshit that I asked that of them, and telling me to give them a genuine reason why they should stop.

And in my constant fuck-upery, instead of explaining the situation and what I meant, I told them that their caring made me uncomfortable. Which wasn't a total lie; but that was all that I said. I meant that it made me uncomfortable because no one had ever cared about me enough to frequently check in with me or to talk to me when I was up at 2AM on a school night, and I didn't know how to deal with someone who seemed to be genuinely nice to me. The conversation ended with them clearly frustrated with my shitty response of ""because it makes me uncomfortable,"" them telling me to shut up, and me apologizing.

The last time we spoke was my ""I'm sorry,"" text at 3AM a few days ago. They've completely ignored me, seemingly actively since then. When I poke my head out to say something while people are chatting in the hallway they never look at me. Or when I step past people to go out the same thing happens. I'm pretty sure they've even closed their door when I'm walking by only to open it again once I'm gone.


I don't know if it's related, but no one has really spoken to me at all since the incident. No one has knocked on my door when I'm sleeping through class. Not a single text to ask if I'm planning on coming in late.

I understand why they wouldn't want to talk to me anymore, and this isn't the first time I've pushed someone away, but this one really, really hurts. I finally met someone who might have actually cared about me, but I kept saying the wrong things until they hated me like everyone else. Now I'm 1,500 miles away from home and I'm alone again. I got the ""fresh start"" everyone's desperate for and fucked everything up again.

TL;DR: I met someone really nice and we were getting along well but my own stupid choices and complete inability to open up made them hate me.",lonely,Tried and Failed to Open Up to Someone New,2020-12-15 16:15:18

We moved to another state away from friends and family a year ago and I had something traumatic happen to me in Jan 2020 a week before my 30th bday 🥲 and that was icing on my preverbal cake for my depression. So it’s been a very draining year for me emotionally, mentally, and physically. I’m coming out of it finally the last few months as I found medication that’s helped, but it’s also opened my eyes to things that I guess I never saw.

I go to a very elite college and they all go to umm high acceptance in-state schools. They often make pokes at my expensive education and have an overall jealous attitude. I don’t think I want to hang out with them much anymore.

I wanted to write some stuff out that helps my bouts of feeling alone and anxious. I recently started journaling and its been a great tool to give me perspective. I write about my thoughts of the day, my fears, my insecurities and about things I love too. Since the pandemic it’s a rare occurrence to be in social situations so I’ll write about small occurrences in my day to day with strangers from a store. Or strangers I walk by in the park. Being cooped up in the house all day it’s easy to forget that everyone around you has their own lives too. Sometimes In my loneliness, I’ll find I feel sorry for myself. When I put it down on paper it puts things more into perspective. I see my own pity and I see the things I can work on and the things I can’t control. There’s one quote ,” if you can’t change your situation you can at least change your perspective.” On top of journaling it’s nice to listen to happy music too. Coldplay’s a great one to listen to.

I don’t know what works for men, but if you’re a woman, I want to share a couple of ways I try to keep the gloom of loneliness at bay. I still crave intimacy, but I also like my lonely life in a way. 

-	get a cat. 
-	get a kindle unlimited subscription and delve into cheesy cliché chick-lit as you sip your hot chocolate with the cat on your lap purring gently. 
-	learn the guitar - just a few basic chords so when you’re sad you can sing sad songs to yourself. It helps. 
-	adult coloring books are a lifesaver. I have the Pigment app on the iPad and whenever I have trouble sleeping I use it and it helps me fall back asleep again. 
-	books - paperbacks not kindle. There’s something amazing about holding a book in your hand and flipping the pages. 
-	video games - if you’re a woman who has always dismissed video games as silly boyish hobby, you’re in for a surprise! There are games for every type of person. You’re bound to enjoy something. Not all games are all about wildly shooting guns all the time (though that can sometimes be therapeutic too)
-	hope - life is a mystery. You have no idea what lies ahead. You have no control either. So as tempting as it may seem to indulge yourself in thoughts about dying alone, it’s worth reminding yourself that good things can happen too. There’s no age limit to falling in love.

2487,CircusLeavesTown89,1607999263,1,"Before you read this, please know that I am aware it's ""only"" online friends but this has broken my heart.

I  haven't had any new online friends for many years now. But recently I  posted something on reddit and a couple of people reached out to me in  DMs because they said that my post touched them and shortly after, both  of them were saying they wanted to be my friend. Both of them said they  really wanted to help me feel better. I went from feeling genuinely  suicidal to.. actually smiling. They were helping me already!

In  the beginning they were both so amazing. One in particular, I had never  experienced anyone care so much about what I had to say. I was  absolutely overwhelmed by how much she cared.. and how much she wanted  to talk to me :( she was sending long messages and I was sending her  long messages back. She wanted to talk constantly and I happily obliged.  After one message I said ""take care"" just out of politeness and she  asked where I was going... she didn't want me to go. It was so  unbelievably sweet. I can't even tell you. She was kindness personified.  My post was about a very personal matter and I was able to talk about  it with her so comfortably. She had this really awesome idea she wanted  to do together every day to help us feel positive. Writing positive  thoughts into a mason jar every day then reading them when you're down.  She said she always wanted to do it but never did so she said doing it  with me would be a good idea and I thought so too. She said she wanted  to help me build my confidence.How did I get so lucky? She's literally  the reason I downloaded the reddit app, she didn't ask me to, but before  her I never had a reason for it.

Unfortunately  that feels like a long time ago now, even though it was only about  three days ago :(  she later  asked me to add her on WhatsApp. I  thought, great! And it went really well on there for little while. Just  like how we were talking on reddit, but she wanted to send me pictures  of her cats as well. She was in some of the pictures too so I thought  it's only fair if I show her my picture too. I can pinpoint that exact  moment in our chat history as to when she completely lost all interest  in talking to me. Since I sent that picture she's suddenly always too  busy to talk to me. Before she knew what I looked like she literally  read my messages instantly, now it takes her hours, if she reads them at  all

I'm absolutely devastated. It  went from paragraphs, hours of talking, to a few words once or twice a  day if I'm lucky. She's still vaguely feigning interest but it hasn't  been the same since I sent her that picture. I thought I had found s  genuine long term friend, we both wanted to help eachother, she said she  really wanted to help me with my confidence. There's no confidence left  to even shatter but I somehow feel worse than I did before I even made  the post that she reached out to me for in the first place.

The  second one, similar story, equally nice and amazing person with a lot  in common. Again it was them who asked for my number, again we both had  nice ideas to help each other long term, and again they get sick of me  after a few days. This person didn't even see my picture, it didn't get  to that, but they just stopped messaging me out of nowhere.

I  don't know which one hurt more. I valued them both so much and couldn't  believe my luck I had found two great friends just from making a post

I'm really struggling and I just need someone to talk to.

This year is supposed to be full of lasts, and the final chance too have fun with friends before college. I missed my entire track season last year, didn’t see my friends for about 6 months until school started again only too be separated from them again. 

I don’t know how it was for you guys but I’m on the cross country and track team. Because of how similar the two sorts are it’s essentially the same people on both. We spend a majority of the year together, going on runs, suffering through workouts, going too meets and what not together. Simply put as a whole we become pretty damn close, so having to be separated from them for months, finally get too see them again only to be separated again kind of sucks. 

There is a girl on the team that I have known since we were freshman. We were always pretty close, and although we never officially dated we had gone to football games, homecoming, festivals, out too lunch and all sorts of stuff. She’s the one who kept me sane through the first lockdown, but even after looking forward too it for months I never got too ask her out too homecoming. She was sad about it because she really wanted us too go together, but it just didn’t work so she went too hang out with some friends instead. Well, about a month ago she met some dude through one of her friends. She started responding too me really slowly, and eventually just stopped talking to me entirely. I don’t even know if she would have said yes, but I never got too officially ask her out, and now I never will. 

I’ve mostly gotten over her by now, and I’m glad that she seems too be happy, but now I just depressed and lonely. I haven’t seen my friends in a month, I feel heart broken, and of the people  that still talk too me only one of them doesn’t do it just too keep up streaks. Also of the colleges that I applied too the two that I actually care about have yet too message me back, and I think I should have gotten something by now.

2502,passerbyer12,1607990521,1,"I feel like now more than ever people are emphasizing that you should be comfortable with being alone and spending time with yourself and being able to find fulfillment within just yourself. While I understand that mentality and have adopted it myself a lot of the time, I feel as though it's getting too over-emphasized and that it's just overrated. I'm not necessarily the type of person that needs to be in a relationship all the time to be happy, and maybe I'm just going through a specific phase in my life, but right now doing things for \*just\* me seems empty and futile. 

And a lot of the time, I feel like when people say ""you need to be okay with being on your own"", it's usually under the assumption that you won't be alone forever. 

I know I could do more to put myself out there and meet more people. And actually, I think subconsciously I don't put myself out there a lot of the time and I do play things safe because being deeply connected with people around you is scary and vulnerable. But I also know the risk would be so worth it in the end. I just feel like I need to feel deep connections to other human beings around me in order to feel fulfilled, and that I can't just find all of that fulfillment solely within myself. 

It's just frustrating because I'm craving intimacy without really knowing how long I'll have to wait to get it. I know a lot of it is in my control, but I guess that means I have to get my subconscious on board with opening myself up more in order to increase my chances of forming deeper connections.",lonely,Being Alone is Overrated,2020-12-15 11:02:01

&amp;#x200B;

**I saw her over the hill, waving at me. Clad in white silk, a smile so free. She looked at me, and opened her arms. I waded through the bloody lake, with the fires of Heaven on each side of me. As I approached her, her smile began to fade, and I saw the reflection of my internal pain.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I grabbed her by the arms, I looked her in the eyes, I saw a tear fall down, eternal demise. I told the girl ""You can't save me from myself."" She pulled me in anyway, and it was quite strange. For the first time in years I think I felt something. But I pushed her back, and said to her ""You're better off without me."" She shouted ""Don't leave!"" I replied ""You don't understand. My misery is dangerous."" The girl didn't listen, and the dormant Hell that lived inside of me came alive and consumed her.**",lonely,(probably cringeworthy) free verse poem I wrote,2020-12-15 09:36:17

2514,Adam_Zapple,1607984070,1,"Lately, I’ve been so lonely that I actually talk to pictures as if I were talking to a real person.  People from magazines, books, web sites. People I don’t even know. I find a person who looks nice and just...talk to them. I tell them about myself, my family, my life, what I did that day, etc. They don’t talk back, of course, but sometimes I will invent “their side of the conversation” in my head. Truth be told, I’ve actually been doing this for as long as I can remember. When I was a child, I used to take my clothes, like pants, sweatshirts, coats and stuff them with things. Then I would assemble them and prop them up like real people and just hang out with them, talking and playing. I would make “brothers”, “sisters” and “friends”, and often made a “mother”. I’d sit on the lap of this stuffed pile of clothes and put it’s arms around me and talk to it as if it were real. I would have it tell me that it loved me, that I was good and that there was nothing to be afraid of. At some point, it became too weird to blame on weird kid stuff and I switched to pictures. It has sort of consumed my life, although I’m very good at hiding it and keeping one foot in each of the two worlds. When I’m feeling particularly bad, I prop pillows up and make a “pillow person”. I lay my head on it’s “shoulder”, tell it my troubles and just cry. A blanket around my shoulder simulates a hug. I feel like I’m crazy because normal people don’t do this. I know it’s pathetic, but I don’t know what else to do. I’m just so....lonely. 😔",lonely,Am I crazy or just pathetic?,2020-12-15 09:14:30

2540,NamasteBoogaloo,1607969939,1,"I'm your typical male redditor: shy, awkward, and lonely, and with little dating experience at the age of 27. I worked hard on myself, lost some weight, bought some new clothes, and even started seeing a therapist last year to work on my anxiety. Turns out I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and now I'm on medication and that's helping, that's nice. After about a year of self-improvement, I felt ready to try dating. COVID is mostly under control here, sorry to my U.S. friends, so I felt safe for in-person dating as long as we're outside and six feet apart.

Dating apps have never really gone well for me, but I figured with all the improvements I've made, getting in shape, dressing better, taking nice pictures, and not being super anxious all the time... maybe I'd have better luck. At first it was the same as usual, lots of swiping and no matches, but then I matched with a girl. She's super cute, we both love music, and we talked about having a jam session at some point, but first I had to ask her out for coffee.

We met up at the coffee shop and somehow she's even cuter in person! I couldn't believe it, and I was nervous, of course, but I remembered my therapist telling me to breathe, and if I get really nervous, say ""I get nervous on first dates"" so it's not about her. I didn't need to use that line because she was so easy to talk to. And really funny! She made some great jokes, and I made her laugh a couple of times and that felt really good. She could only stay for an hour and I told her that was fine, we planned another date on the spot.

We met up for dinner two weeks ago, and it was so fun. She's so easy to hang out with, and she's teasing me, and I'm teasing her, and it just feels natural. I've never had date go this well! Then we planned a third date, and it's a picnic in the park with our guitars. It was the best date I've ever been on. We played music, talked for two hours, and she liked my cooking, haha. We talked about COVID and safety and decided we were both being careful enough that we could get more involved, and I kissed her. It wasn't my first kiss, but it had been so long that it felt like it was. It was so nice. She said she liked it, and we planned another date. 

Our fourth date there was a movie showing in a public place, projected like a drive in theater but with seats spread out for everyone. We went to that and sat next to each other, she was leaning on my shoulder a lot of the time, and we kissed a couple times during the movie. After, we made out and talked about plans to see each other again. 

We text after then, until a few days ago when she just stopped responding totally. We used to text pretty regularly during the day, but I asked her a question and she didn't respond. I waited all day, because I know I can be anxious and don't want to annoy her by asking why she didn't reply. I keep telling myself she's just busy, but I'm very worried. I know her job is stressing her out a lot so the next day I text her and say ""I hope your work isn't being too difficult this week, I'm here if you ever want to chat about it"" but no response. This was on Tuesday. I waited two more days with no answer and then sent a last text, just saying ""If you're still interested in another date let me know, but if it's not working out I understand and I hope you find what you're looking for."" Then I deleted her number so I'm not tempted to send any more messages.

I regret getting excited, I regret having hope. Everyone says ""it's better to try"" or ""at least you had something"" but now everything hurts worse than before.

2555,DontDoTheUsername,1607961042,1,"So i have this one friend who in my assumption, is struggling with depression (or something else? I dont really know). I have his contact in my phone. In Whatsapp, i know he might be going through a hard time right now based on posts he make.

And today i see him posting how he cut his sleeve (i can see much blood). Maybe a way to cope with his problems. Even before he blatantly show that, i know that he's cutting by seeing the scars on his arm. It's sad, you know. The lockdown hits him very hard perhaps.

What i want to ask is, **how can i encounter and help him with this?** I feel very useless to not helping him. I dont even text him yet, cause i dont know how to start. Im afraid that what i'll say will worsen his condition. I care about him the most among my friends but cant figure out a way to show it.

2557,HelpMe19992,1607960640,1,"I'm a gay man and have a thing for older men.

I've been seeing a guy who's 19 years my senior, it's a lot of fun and we get on great. We've been together for about 18 months.

Before lockdown hit, we decided to live together so I got footed it to his place asap. We had a great time together, lots of time to explore new stuff and try stuff out. 

Part of the attraction is the fetish side of stuff, we are in a dom / sub style relationship - me being the sub. This usually involves me being restrained and pleasuring him in some way. (Always consensual with boundaries respected) 

However, a few weeks into lockdown his brother moved in with us due to mitigation circumstances. His brother knew our living arrangements and said he'd be cool with us doing it. We used to garage outside as we had insulated and soundproof it for this use.

His brother is a nice guy, but not my type physically. 

However one night me and my partner had been having a few drinks, been fooling around and I was restrained when he decided to nip off to the shop to grab some more beer leaving me tied up as part of a power play (again, this was consensual). Would usually be about 60 minutes due to him walking and playing a powertrip on me

When he disappeared out of the house, his brother appeared in garage stating he was bored and wanted to chat. Due to the compromising position I was in I kindly asked him to go. But he just stayed and we got chatting anyway, a couple of minutes in he told me he was actually bisexual and said I was very attractive. I told him he was a bit ugly for my liking but he would make someone happy, but I could see the bulge in his pant. I asked him to drop them which revealed the biggest penis I've ever seen which I openly told him. After a few more minutes talking I told him to start playing with my whole as he was making me horny, to which he just replied by entering me fully causing me to say ""let's stop messing around and fuck me like your wh*re"". Which he unduly did before letting me swallow the contents of what was on offer. Before smiling at me and leaving the room before my partner came home. 

About a week after this encounter, he repeated it again when my partner had to nip out for a while. Only this time I did about more such a rim him, play with his feet and let him film us doing it. Something I've never done with my partner. He's even brought one of his mates around to join in

I'm now put myself in a situation where I don't know what to do, as I love my partner but his brother keeps threatening to leak the videos of us if I don't keep playing with him

Do I just come clean and admit it all, or just keep playing to his demands for sex?

I hate how I'm struggling with diagnosed anxiety and depression. I hate how I'm trying to keep this special person in my life but its not enough n prob I just suck

I made some mistakes like fighting with them about issues when we could have talked it out first. I've eventually learnt to apologise and try to say what I could have done better or what i disagree on and tell them how I feel and listening to what my therapist said abt lashing out and how it will affect those around me. Its come to a point I just try not to even say anything or even allow myself to be angry even if I disagree with smth becos I'm scared of scaring THEM away. It doesnt help that they r also going thru a depressive episode in their life and Im here like always debating with them when they say smth... i just have high expectations and never expected them to be so narrow-minded and tbh sometimes mean behaviour but we will work things out eventually

Then all that effort and me reassuring them to still be here for each other, they just never reply back after a few months when they told me they met some other people and idk it kinda hurts becos I feel at fault for going thru this and making them feel tired of me. Tbh I cant blame them for leaving. We've helped each other a lot and I would choose them every single day even if we go thru some rough patches becos I wanna work things out. Now its their birthday soon and I was thinking of buying them something but now I feel bad and selfish for not wanting to follow thru just becos they arent around as much and that no matter how much space and checking in Im doing to make sure they okay, they dont ever check in or do the same or talk anymore. And all they do is say they are fine and never speak to me again. And I've really felt like I cared for them than just a friend.

I feel like Im at a low point becos Im scared to ever be myself becos they might leave me like what this person is doing if they know me even tho Im trying to better myself but its so hard when I keep losing them and I'm just a horrible person n the cycle repeats

2594,gibsunn,1607927516,1,"This stings.
So I’ve got this friend, for the sake of privacy I’ll just call them Sam.
They’re my best friend, I’ve known them for a few years and they’re the best dude I have around. I feel like I can tell them anything. They’ve got the best personality, they’re so funny without ANY effort needed, and so easy to talk to. But I’ve started to notice some things that I wouldn’t really deem to be ‘normal’. 

Note; I’ve never had that many friends. Sam is the first ever “best friend” I’ve ever had. So I don’t always know the red flags of friendships.

But basically, I just get this feeling that, they just don’t want me around, or, rather, they don’t want anyone to know they hang out with me. They’re relatively popular, super well liked by everyone, really easy for them to make friends, you get the idea. So I guess you could say they have a big image. And I guess it just wouldn’t look good with me being in it. 

I know people have questioned them for being friends with me before, and I thought they just ignored it. But the more we hang out (which is almost never), the more I feel like less of a friend, more of an...assistant.

When they wanna take pictures, I’m never invited in the picture. I’m the one who holds the camera. When they post fun stuff on their social media when we hang out, they always seem to “accidentally” leave me out of it.

One time I tried to slyly mention to Sam that we’ve never had a post together, and they offered to make one of those TikToks with me. I know, it sounds like a silly idea, and immature, but hey, I had a ton of fun and was actually pretty stoked about it. I don’t have TikTok, but I downloaded it just to see the video we made, but when I looked at their account,, it was gone. Either they never posted it thinking I wouldn’t know, or they did post it and deleted it once she deemed the coast was clear. And I know that’s something so small, but man, that stung. 

Not to mention, I constantly hear other friends make references to this apparent group chat they all have, and when I ask about what chat this is, they awkwardly ask something like, “Oh..you’re not in it?” 
It’s humiliating. 

Or, the countless excuses as to why we can’t ever hang out. As I mentioned before, we almost never do. 

I’ll try to ask them if they want to hang out this weekend, and I’m always met with, “I’ll see if I have room for plans.” And never a follow up. If I ask again, they usually brush it off and never follow up again. It’s incredibly difficult to make plans with them, I’d say near impossible. Yet, almost twice a week she’s posting nonstop with her other friends, etc. 

I know it sounds selfish, but jeez man, this sucks. 

I remember a couple weeks ago I asked them if they wanted to hang out, they told me theyd been grounded. Which I didn’t question. But once Saturday rolled around, I saw all these posts with them and their other friend going to a coffee shop together, and going to the mall together, and I just thought “Jesus man, am I really that bad?”

It’s just so embarrassing, feeling like you cause your best friend to feel ashamed of you being around. 
When we talk over text, or FaceTime, it’s so natural and you’d think nothing weird ever went down at all. But man, they get so awkward and shit whenever I mention actually doing something together. This is somewhat recent as well, only started a few months ago. I’ve been thinking about it so much, like, “what did I do wrong?” But i just don’t know. I’ve tried asking them about it, and they always brush it off in a somewhat awkward way. 

Sorry for the huge complaining. I know it probably seems like nothing, and like I’m overreacting. Maybe I am. I don’t know, I just know that shit is really starting to burn.",lonely,I think my friends are embarrassed of me.,2020-12-14 17:31:56

Then, I'm left alone again to my thoughts and sad lyrics sung by the ghosts of yesteryear wishing me a merry little Christmas.

The ice machine drops its fresh batch of cubes and startles me out of my thoughts. I bundle up for a silent drag outside and stare at the ground where the new snow fills in the tire tracks the customer made in the old snow, until there's no sign that they were ever here. I head back in to the empty store and "".. a blue Christmas without you"" welcomes me back in. No one, but a dying cactus, is waiting for me at home.

I have good friends that i wouldn't trade the world for and a family that loves me, but recently I can't get over the fact that I lack companionship...
Some month's ago i lost someone I thought of as a good friend. We did basically everything together and told each other everything going on in our lives but when i found out he wasn't truthful with me and hid things from me i had specifically asked about to 'protect' me, but he ended up hurting me even more and i just kinda said so, left and we haven't talked since.
I spend a lot of time playing games online with my other friends since we can't meet due to Covid-19 and then when they are busy i play alone since I can't land a job in the current situation where I live. 
Just now I realized that out of everyone in my friend group I am the only one not in a romantic relationship and to be honest it doesn't feel nice (never thought I'd be in such a cliché situation).
But I don't think that's bothering me too much right now, it's just that recently (of course people are busy and lead their own lives) no one has thought of sending well... anything and when I try contacting them it's either 'busy' or they ignore the message.
It's unusual for them to ignore messages from me so I'm quite confused why that would happen now.

I honestly don’t know what it is about my body or mind that doesn’t allow me to cry when I’m feeling really sad. I want to get it out of me bc I don’t want it to fester inside. But it’s almost impossible for that to happen. 

Until 20 minutes ago.

This weekend has been extremely tough. I’ve felt sick all weekend and I’ve had some mild symptoms that freaked me out and made me worry that I’ve been infected by COVID-19. I called my doctor yesterday to try and schedule a Covid test. Luckily though, I’m starting to feel better today and my worries have largely subsided. I’m still planning to take the test to be sure I’m not a carrier. But, still, the anxiety of possibly having it, the concern about who I might’ve gotten to from or who I could pass it to, and just the general feeling of feeling physically ill has been way too much for one weekend already.

On top of that, being that I self-quarantined myself out of fear that I did have COVID-19, I was stuck in my bed all day yesterday. As I’ve mentioned in other Reddit posts I’ve written, I live in a converted garage, now in-law unit attached to my aunt’s house. She lives with her two daughters and her niece lives here as well. Even though we don’t converse really at all, there have been quite a bit of challenges for me living here. So I just tend to stay in my spot and not mingle with them. Well, yesterday was not a good day at all to be cooped up. My aunt had people come over to work on her living room floor all day, so the noise from all the work was not great when I’m trying to rest and get better. Throw in that I could here her niece have sex in her room upstairs (which is right above my bed) with her bf for like the 85th time this week and it’s even further of a nuisance. And then later, after the workers had left, they had people come into the house for like 2 hours just to laugh, be loud, and more than likely drink. Luckily I was watching a football game to distract myself with the latter, but it screwed up the bandwidth (I’ve gone completely cordless with TV services) and I couldn’t watch the end of the game. So my agitation for the day was peaking. 

I couldn’t sleep either bc I have a stuffy nose and it’s cold here where I live, but sleep issues have been way too common throughout my life. Especially recently. I just tend to lay in bed ruminating in how lonely and just feeling unnecessary. Kinda reached the point where, if I did have Covid, maybe it’s a good thing that I could just stay away from everyone. Possibly even permanently. 

This all culminated after I ate my breakfast this morning. I tend to watch predominantly YouTube videos to pass along my days. One of the channel subscriptions I have is a wonderful psychiatric channel called Psych2Go. They have amazing and very succinct videos on a variety of psychologic topics. But it hit way too close to home when I clicked on the most recent video, titles “7 reasons why you don’t feel good enough”. It felt like I had just been stripped naked and seen. It felt like I was being called out by a channel that has zero personal connection to me. And yet, it started to begin making me think of all the heartbreak I’ve experienced this year. All the times I’ve stretched out giving myself to people without accepting that it might not ever be reciprocated or even appreciated. But most of all, it registered to me just how often and desperate people are when they come to me whenever they need something. Comfort, favors, money, you name it. And I instantly say yes to it. But, whenever they don’t need me for anything, I’m a shadow. And then I wonder what it is that I did wrong.

I must point out that I’ve also been extremely blessed to have a truly loving mother and some incredible friends that actually do care about me and that selflessly demonstrate this to me time and time again. But since I can’t see them due to the pandemic, text and IM can only do so much. That said, without them, I don’t know where I’d be. Actually I know. Not here. Or anywhere :/

But seeing that video crystallized to me that “being not good enough” is a battle in my head that I must beat one day. But, trying to be a hero or trying to be someone else’s light without concern as to whether I’m being used by this person (or even if my own expectations are way too unrealistic) has to stop. Otherwise, I’ll stretch myself emotionally thin. I love too hard. I care too much. As intelligent as I am, I tend to have blinders on when I let me heart take control. Which isn’t a bad thing. I’m also not immune to being completely aloof, so I’m definitely to blame for not seeing the picture clearly. But, I’m emotionally tired. I’m just tired of giving so much. I’m tired of expecting too much from people I care about. And I just don’t want to feel like I’m being taken advantage of anymore.

So I just broke down crying. Harder than I have in a really long time.

I am always just an option and once people get to actually know me, they don’t like me - or they just truly don’t care about me. There is something about me that repulses others and I just feel desperate at this point. At times I feel used and I know I deserve better, but I am frustrated and so deprived that I take whatever amount of affection I can get.

I had been always like this, i even picked one specific person in elementary school and made that person my one and only close friend. I didn't really give much attention to my friendships with others. Back then it wasn't a problem but as i got older it became a big big problem. Even in high school it was okay because I was best friend of my best friend. We just spent all of our time together and i didn't do much stuff with others. I didn't realize how emotionally independent i was because my friends didn't really made me think of it. Now I'm 20 and since +2 years i am emotionally dependent for a friend of mine.

At the beginnings he also didn't realize how emotionally dependent i was but since he wanted to take little breaks, spend more time with his other friends, things got worse for me. And yesterday he told me that I'm clingy, this is the time I realized I really am clingy. 

How can I change it? I really wanna change it, I've been struggling about this in last 2 years a lot. In the adult life, noone really wants anyone to be emotionally dependent to them. I was feeling that deep down me so I didn't even try to be close with anyone since i turned 17-18. But that one person that i picked also let me down.

I didn’t want to, because there was going to be football players there. (i’m gay and that would make me feel very uncomfortable because I live in South Mississippi where everyone’s homophobic and racist) so I told the girls that I didn’t want to go and I asked if we could just stay at the house. They said no, we’re just gonna go you can just drive home. I did drive home and I was sobbing, I called my mom and told her to wait for me in the living room and I cried to her. It hurt me so bad that those friends would leave to go to a party when we were already hanging out at the house. it hurt me so much and I haven’t talk to them in like two months. A lot of bad things happened to me when i wasn’t talking to them. i had a psychotic break and had to go to a mental hospital. The other day I called my friend and asked her about that night and she said that it wasn’t that big of a deal to anyone besides me. And so I just pushed it aside and thought to myself maybe it wasn’t a big deal, maybe I am just overreacting. I hung out with them the other day and it just felt so wrong. Tonight I’m feeling so lonely because not one of them is answering me and I feel like I’m living through that night again. i’m so sad and lonely and I have nobody should I still be friends with them?

2752,Covenic,1607840914,1,"Been a relatively long-term member of an online friendgroup (~4 years), decided to take a sabbatical as I was feeling generally ignored in the discourse; not a single message or 'What's up?' received, only to find that somebody else who left literally the same day had 4 separate people reach out to them specifically.

I know you shouldn't exactly compare your own social situation to others lest you inadvertently cultivate a disdain that will shadow your outlook indefinitely, and I know you shouldn't really expect a social outpouring in response to something that could be considered a melodramatic act, but it still stings. I didn't make a song or dance about it, I just left and went to bed.

This is just a bit of context for the wider issue though, the reason I left in the first place was because I noticed a long-running trend of me posting something I found neat, or looked to converse about something that interests me, only to be ignored/overshadowed by others. I'm by no means the kind of individual that talks a person's head off without their consent, and it's not like I'm swamping anybody with shit they don't care about through private avenues. I think I just realized that I don't share much in common with these people outside of vague same-generation generalities regarding the internet, video games, whatever.

The social expectations placed on me that aren't reflected in kind in these sort of situations really do make me want to dip though, I've happily talked about stuff with many of these people for hours, day after day, even if it's not anything I care about in particular, but the moment I want to talk about my stuff, the channel will sit there dead for 4 hours before somebody necros it with whatever. I don't know how much of this is on me for being the guy that's made a fool of for not learning their lesson to begin with, or how much is genuinely on them for being inconsiderate.

But now I sit here with no real social interaction for days on end, and it makes me feel like the same way I did in my teens, up at 4AM night after night aimlessly browsing forums and wishing for a connection, but the bitter realization that the connection I thought I HAD kindled these past few years was in actuality a cheap facade makes it just that much worse.

I guess it's just an unfortunate reality that you're not gonna' get along with any random person you run into, and that there's no guarantee that superficial intersts and traits will be indicative of a prolonged relationship once you get into the weeds of things, so I can't hold it against anybody in particular, but god, I fucking hate people right about now, dude.

But for some reason, whenever we talked about going out once the quaranteen was over, I would get extremely anxious, to the point where I was wishing we stop stalking so I don't have to leave my house and go meet someone, and every stressful thing about going on a date was overflowing me with bad thoughts and suffocating me. 

In the end, I explained the situation to her, and now that I'm alone again, I feel much better. Maybe all these years alone made me develop a serious social phobia and I rather be on my own and not have to face social interactions. Wich makes me feel a little bad.

2763,PassiveLlama720,1607837857,1,"Don’t know how to start this or why I’m posting to be honest. But I feel just putting this out their to strangers even if no one sees this is therapeutic. I’m a 24 year old male and I should be living up while I’m young. However, I feel I’m just floating here alone and no one gives a fuck about me. I know it’s my fault but I don’t know how to get back to happy place.

Way back in high school I had tons of friends, played sports, went out every weekend.. I was just a normal kid. Looking back though I really only had a true connection with a couple of my close friends. Not that the other friendships were meaningless. Not every friendship has to be deep and sometimes having people to hang with and fun with is important too. I realize that now and oh man what I give to have people like that in life again now.

College hit and everything was great for the first two years. Then I started using drugs heavily. I was always a big drinker/smoker and dabbled in other stuff. But man for some reason I just went crazy at this point and treated my body like I was lab rat. Looking back it was probably my break up with my girlfriend from high school that caused the spiral. Not making any excuses the blame is on me. Just stating this was likely the catalyst. We were in a long distance relationship due to being at different schools. When we broke up even though I knew it was coming for a while and the right thing... I just lost control. 

I don’t need to go into all the details but safe to say I was abusing a lot of drugs I shouldn’t have been. Enter Xanax into my life and the 7 month addiction that would ruin me. Started flunking classes doing everything I could just not to fail out. Ended up failing out of school half way through my junior year. At this point I quit cold turkey... drinking and smoking included. I have a very addictive personality and my friends at school where still doing all the same shit I wanted to get away from. My friends back home we’re still smoking and drinking heavy too.

This is where I made the biggest mistake of my life. I cut everyone off... every trace of something/someone who could make me relapse. It wasn’t even their fault it was because I couldn’t trust myself. I knew I had to clean my act up. Even being around something innocent like drinking or smoking weed I couldn’t trust myself to say no. So I cut everyone off... good friends, shitty friends, literally everyone. 

Ended up enrolling in a non degree program at my school and worked my way back in. I graduated only one semester late and I’m so proud of myself for that. One of my old closest friends from back home reached out to me on a whim. Ignored him twice cause that was the state I was in. But for some reason I finally answered. Now he’s my best friend for life again.

Flash forward two years after graduating and he just left for the military. He was literally my only friend. I don’t know how to meet people and re-establish a social life. I’ve tried so many times reaching out to old friends. They either don’t answer or want nothing to do with me. I feel so fucking alone. I waited too long and I was the one who cut everyone off.

I don’t have social media... insta, fb, snap, twitter, etc... I deleted it all during my downfall. Even when I get a chance to meet people it gets so awkward. Not because I’m an awkward person but because everyone has friends to talk about. I have nothing.. they wanna connect on social media and I have to explain why I don’t use it. I could be the most normal person going but I feel so awkward having no other friends. I feel it’s a red flag to people that I’m a problem. 

I have a stable job and good income which I’m blessed for. But I’m so fucking scared of being alone the rest of my life. I want to meet a girl and have a family. But I wouldn’t even have friends to invite my wedding at this point. I feel so pathetic. I know there’s a way out but I’m trying everything I can and I still sit home alone every night. I know there’s bigger problems in this world than being lonely but fuck I wouldn’t wish this upon anyone.

I wear my heart on my sleeve I am who I am. I know there’s a way out but I don’t know what else to do. What I would give for a group of friends just to bullshit with. Or better yet a girl I can share everything with. Man I’m so fucking scared this is my life from here on out. At the time I did what I felt was right to clean my act up by cutting everyone off. But at this point I don’t think it was worth it.

(New account, I am not comfortable to use my regular account.. I'm sorry! :/)

I.. I'm female, 35. I've been alone 15 months now. I have seen no one of the people I've known before Sept 2019. And I haven't met anyone new since then. So yes, I've been alone, except for 2 days I was in the hospital 2 weeks ago and 3 days I was at work this year, if you can call it work, seeing as I a. don't have a working contract and b. don't get paid. Doing my PhD. Should write, but don't, because it takes every single braincell to make it through the current moment to not go insane. I listen to ASMR where people talk, and I talk back to them. They ask questions, they tell stories, that's my human contact, and it drives me insane. I don't know how to meet anyone, what to do. I tried the Tinder thing, did the online dating profile, there was minimal chatting, and then quiet, so I've given up on that at the beginning of the year. I order shit online because the postman usually says hi, saying I order too much.

I.. I don't know what else to try anymore,  so I thought.. I'd try here, see if someone could advise me. I do want to have a life, I do want to contribute to society, to others wellbeing, I want to find a place I belong, but I don't know how. I am at a place where I'm stuck, and I can't see how to go forwards into a better future from here. I'm not a very social person, but I'm a good person, I think, I try at least. I am a good partner, or so I've been told. Honest, loyal, loving, caring, HSP, empath. Never cheated, always tried my hardest, always was left because .. 'you're too good for me'. I don't get it, I mean, what does that even mean? I'm lost. I don't get it, I don't get humans, and the funny thing is, I got a minor in psychology because I always tried to somehow get others and connect because I truly want to belong and build a future with someone, but... I don't understand how, I try to be good, but I'm too good to be with but that at the same time says I'm not good enough to stay with. Nothing makes sense.

Deep down, I know that it's because I have the sensation that no one really knows me, or at least all of me, and that no one ever will. Part of it is due to the barriers I put up due to a history of trauma, but another part feels like it is because when I have tried to let people in, they get scared or don't want to go any further. People only like the funny, goofy side of me - no one actually wants to see me at my worst, at my lowest.

Hey all! I just made this post cause I’m fucking bored and lonely on the 58394757th Saturday night in a row and I have nothing to do. I’m from California and a Virgo (if that matters) ;D

I love to laugh, hike, travel and try out new food. I’m almost vegan (getting there) and I think nutrition is really important. I’m currently studying to be a front end engineer. I barely drink, don’t smoke or do any drugs. 

I speak Japanese and conversational Russian as well as Tagalog. Love to travel also! 

I reference sponge bob a lot and I love dark humor, make a lot of double entendre jokes and like shows like Simpsons and MadTV.

2794,__daco_,1607821125,1,"Im 21, male, and terrible in articulating my own problems. Also english isnt my native language so forgive me if some formulations seem a bit weird, german grammar certainly is. Please forgive me if this developes into rambling, it just feels important to me to write this down for once. Im thankful for everyone who makes it to the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Im always scared to post what i think about myself because i really dont want to sound arrogant, because im not. I dont want to show off, i just want to tell what i think my problem is...for once.

&amp;#x200B;

Im smart and witty. I grew up in a group of easy and simple friends. We never had problems. We also never thought much about ourselves, but to be honest, we werent the dumbest either. We had long and deep discussions about topics that wouldn't normally interest one in that age. But we were also very self-aware about the stupid sides of ourselves, and reminded us regularly that even the smartest 15 y/o is still be pretty stupid, which we certainly were at times. During that friendship, we all developed a character trait i could only describe as ""overdrawn self-irony"", which im still 'living'.

&amp;#x200B;

After a three year on/off relationship with my ex, a time i could only describe as ""emotional abuse"", my best friend moving away and loosing touch, i did some really stupid things that almost destroyed my life. Ive cancelled college (Abitur) some years ago and now im basically doing shitty jobs for an even worse pay, but i simply need the money.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to what i actually want to say. Ive noticed that everyone who ive been around with in my youth is now able to deal with their emotions in a mature and healthy way, i however, am absolutely not. Im smart, have good critical thinking, make logical connections lots of people oversee or dont care about, and i can tell whats a smart way to deal with emotions and what isnt. This makes me have this 'can-do' attitude, like im good at everything i lay my hands on, knowing very well that when i'm getting cocky about it, im basically relying on confirmation bias. The times i fail outweigh the times i actually succeed, but im allways making sure noone really notices. Im not actively hiding my failures, when having to speak about them, im just wrapping them in this self-irony like im used to do. I wasnt fired because i didnt met my quota, i was fired because ""The quota didnt met my working rythm."" Im making it obvious that its a joke, yet, im having a very hard time speaking it out loud. People usually find this way of talking about my own failures appealing. Its basically showing weakness while not making a big deal about it. Ive chatted with a girl some months ago and she too thought it was attractive, now about what the problem with that is.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people i talk to think ive got everything set up and going for me. I talk about my weaknesses with some self-irony which would indicate that i have a mature and sorted-out emotional life. But i absolutely have not. I get so carried away by my emotions, its crazy. Not during talks, but afterwards, and about anything. When i rarely open up and speak out to someone about what bothers me, they usually dont understand what my problem actually is, because they expect me to not care about such ""nonsense"". I feel so alone. Im a pretty anxious person, i always have this intense feeling that i need to proove myself to the world and i feel like ive just gotten too good at hiding it in conversations when i fail with that. So people who are anxious too and whom i feel sympathetic towards think im defenitely not one of them while stable and confident people think i am one of them, until i open up and show what BS draws me down. I feel like im completly between worlds, in a spot where i find noone like me, and noone likes me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just desperate for someone who understands. Who asks me what happened, who then i can tell some stupid joke about what happened with the slightest hint of why and what botheres me about it, without actually speaking it out loud, but who still understands what im trying to say. I deeply envy everyone who can just say and write down what it is, i'd give my whole freaking intellect for just being able to deal with my own insecurities. This self-irony is all i got against not breaking down in tears every couple of days. At least im not in denial, im fully aware of how shitty i am in dealing with life.",lonely,I feel so lonely being myself.,2020-12-13 11:58:45

2824,Acar4,1607814063,1,"So ive always been an introvert. I used to love staying home all day watching tv and reading comics as a kid. I had some friends and did go out, but i was one of those ppl that made plans and regretted it later.

In my early twenties i finally came out of my shell (and the closet). I had a boyfriend, lots of friends, a great social life. Summer of 2012 was probably the best time of my life. I just remember having fun every single day. I just graduated college and was in my first real relationship.

Over the years obviously things have slowed down, but they were still good here and there. 2019/2020 everything came crashing down. I separated from my husband(my first bf) after an extremely toxic/tumultuous 8 year relationship(we parted amicably and the first two months were rough, but i think im finally ok), i ditched some toxic friends and now im left with 1 or 2 close friends.

I turn 30 in a week and i just feel stuck. All i do is work and come home. Everyone is always busy or paranoid about covid(which i completely understand). My one good friend whos always been there for me seems to be drifting away. We used to talk on the phone every day and now i feel like im bothering him. He'll tell me he doesn't want to do much because of covid, but then he invites his other friends over. Im tired of asking him to hangout and looking desperate. 

So tldr: im at a point in my life where i pretty much have no friends, no social life and newly single. Im excited about turning 30, but i feel alone. I want this new decade to be new and exciting.

i can’t blame anyone but myself though. ever since i was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago, i isolated myself and lost all my friends, my ex boyfriend, anyone who i had any connection with, besides my parents. the thing is, i don’t even have a good relationship with my parents. i don’t have siblings. i don’t have close family. i’m all alone. it’s scary. 

at first i was fine being alone, because no one could understand how i felt anyway and i didn’t wanna be a burden on anyone’s life or be pitied but now... it’s getting harder everyday. 

i feel like if a stranger hugged me right now for no reason i would’ve simply break down and cry for hours. that’s touch deprived i am. 

it’s not my fault for being depressed but maybe i should’ve tried harder to keep the small bonds i had before because now i’m really all alone.

I have never had any luck with relationships, to the point where I’ve never been in one. I am quite introverted and would really like a relationship but I’m finding this easier said than done. 

Bit about me;
I am 22, 6ft 3”, brown hair, hazel green eyes etc. I have considered my self some what desirable on a basic sense but am very self conscious about my body and find social interaction difficult, more so when it comes to making conversation. I am also a MASSIVE nerd, i play pc games, read books, like DIY &amp; enjoy a good party and alcohol. 


Main point;
I recently saw a post talking about bumble on here so i figured it was perhaps worth a go, at least considering i  don’t want to lower myself to tinder standards where all my friends achieved were casual hookups. 
 
But I’m finding almost every girl on bumble is after someone who can make them laugh, which is both very generic and is heavily dependant on that persons sense of humour. I don’t consider myself humorous, except on the one, very rare occasion a month where i say something so incredibly witty everyone I’m with burst out in flames. And to top it off my sense of humour is incredibly dry. 

Perhaps I’m doing something wrong? Or simply just too ugly? I dont know the answer I’m just finding this whole relationship searching doesn’t work for someone like me. I have tried traditional methods through friends of friends also, but the closest i have got is a girl who said the timing was bad and didn’t go any further.

I consider myself exceptionally loyal, I’m not the kind of twat to cheat on a girl. And i’m chilled. The kind of guy who likes to have an idea or plan for the day and not this spontaneous bullshit.

God it sucks... especially now the lockdown here in the uk isn’t making meeting up any easier. People always say, that the right person will come along when you least expect it but it never seems to happen.",lonely,Is there something wrong with me?,2020-12-13 08:29:16

To ramble a bit for summary, I don’t have any irl friends. There are a few people I chat with online through various apps who call themselves my ‘friends’ but tbh I do not know if they actually are or not. I don’t know them irl just in online spaces. The dilemma is that I’ve been wanting to delete my accounts on those apps (and by extension, not interact with those people anymore) but the only thing stopping me from doing so is my chronic loneliness. I have been a very lonely guy for years so this is not unfamiliar for me—at the same time the thought of being entirely alone kind of scares me so I persist. But tbh being entirely alone might be for the best rather than mislead myself that superficial online ‘friendships’ are adding fulfillment to my life when all they do is make me feel even more alone.

The thing is, these online ‘friends’ only want to discuss problems or drama situations with me. I’ve casually chatted with them for a few years via online messages, and it used to be messaging on an everyday basis since I was going through some very tough times back then. They always seemed keen to talk to me whenever something miserable was happening, whether it be on my end or theirs. It was like they were disaster-tourists or something. Let me explain this more in depth— genuinely, the only times they would chat with me would be when times were rough or they wanted to complain. The conversations (both with myself and with them) were filled with nonstop venting, emotional dumping, complaining, and rehashing dark events. I was really going through the wringer so I did a lot of this in exchange with them because I thought it might help. In the midst of these misery-based convos I began to drown in depressive episodes. Looking back on this, I realize these cycles of misery kept me from processing rough events in a healthy manner and even healing somewhat. I began to suspect that I had some sort of trauma bond going on with these online ‘friends’ and that was the main reason we even interacted in the first place.

When I started to work on myself and try to heal as well as feel better, I also tried to stop complaining and venting with these online ‘friends’. Whenever I tried to talk about something non-problem and non-drama related the other person would try to circle back to it or bring up a new complaint. It was truly a challenge trying to continue taking to them while trying to work on feeling better. I then grew extremely anxious whenever a message from them popped up in my notifications because I wanted to chat (because I’m lonely) but I didn’t want to spend hours listening to them complain or constantly try to talk about drama. I answer to remain civil, not indulge them or let them dump, because I was realizing the toll it was all taking on me.

After a few months of me no longer complaining or venting with these ‘friends’ (but still chatting with them) they stopped messaging me back. Misery loves company, I suppose. I didn’t think too much about it, until over a month passed with no replies.

Part of me was saying “great, now you can move on, it wasn’t healthy interactions” and the other part of me, the loneliness, was saying “hold on, maybe they’ll reply back eventually, you don’t want to be completely alone, do you?”

I might be overthinking this, but my loneliness is truly preventing me from moving on from these ‘friends’. I might have to take a leap of faith with this and do it anyway. But I’m scared, I suppose I need encouragement or advice, I am not sure. Thank you to those reading to the end if you did.",lonely,Loneliness dilemma,2020-12-13 07:00:03

2855,codecrunchie,1607796952,1,"How does it work? Basically it's project with one main form that matches people up based on answers to 28 questions. For most of the questions, you choose **your answer** and also **answers from people you would want to talk to**.

Thanks to these 28 questions, it makes it much quicker to find people that 'match' what your preference is. For example you could say you're looking for people from **Europe**, who are **16-25**, who '**maybe**' are willing to do **voice calls**, and they're also they are **studying**. Also quite handy, there is a filter to not match with ""*low effort*"" (based on word count) users.

What is the final result? The algorithm searches over 3000 people (everyone is mostly from reddit), to find you compatible matches. The final result is you usually get 20-80 **matches** \- people that meet the criteria. Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship, you eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-80 matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.

The last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.",lonely,"Find friends quicker and more efficiently with 28 questions via the findafriend project.

2858,basketghostdaddy,1607793959,1,"Before we jump in, I'll admit I wasn't (and I'm still not) a perfect person. I've done some really toxic ish, acted like a victim/martyr, expressed my emotions inappropriately (mostly overblown), sulked on everyone around, did the infamous INFJ door slam one too many times, made things all about myself. Now I jumped off the rock bottom and can see my faults and the damage I've done. However, I don't really think it's something beyond fixable. At least I tried to be a decent, kind human, maybe not sufficiently but I'm no mind reader and can't tell what kinds of dynamics occurred. No matter how bad I've been emotionally, everything seemed at least okay. 

Now I feel a great improvement in myself as a person. Can't say I'm already great - I still have a plethora of things to work on but I'm much closer to the ""acceptable"" spectrum than, say, 3 months ago. 

Whatever I do though, I fail painfully. I tried just about every approach, from emotionally taxing to completely effortless, from dead serious to goofy, from a wholesome bean to a playfully cruel roaster. Yet I can't find the answer why they just reject me. They never text me first unless I must act as a vessel for intellectual labour. They exclude me from all their plans. They basically act like I don't exist, or that I'm not worthy of respect and recognition as what I am - a human.

I don't want to say they're a shitty bunch of people - if it wasn't for them, I'd suffer from overdose alone. But then, that very night they completely ignored me and that ish triggered (triggered, not caused) my parasuicidal gesture. But even then, I feel emotionally unsatisfied. I don't expect them to be all available and lovey dovey 24/7. I just want to be treated like an equal, not a second class citizen. 

Am I asking for too much? Is something wrong with me or with them? I'm horribly bewildered and anxious.",lonely,Why does everyone reject and exclude me?,2020-12-13 04:25:59

Sitting on the bus per se, a cool chick sitting across from me, I'll imagine we're walking home after our third date talkin about stuff. Yeah it's sad but it's a coping method so, whatever works eh.

Idk what's wrong with me,(sorry for saying idk so much) sometimes I think I don't deserve anyone and wouldn't be able to be enough for them.

Like everyone around me loves me for what I can do for them whether it's joyous laughter or monetary solutions. I'm a failure unto myself in my abilities in that I'm smart, but lack determination to do anything other than communicate using layman's terms or apply myself. I'm pretty sure I sabotage myself. The only time I feel good is when others around me seem to feel good about themselves and (strangers even comment on this) I sacrifice my well being for the betterment of those around me.


I give everything to those who show even the slightest interest in me and don't care what it cost me. I mean literally thousands of dollars and losing things I can't currently describe because I'm drunk. and my last few serious relationships have been awful. Don't know how to describe them other than being cheated on, being told they never loved me, ghosted(doesn't sound, bad but for me it is), and made into a villain under pretences that I know aren't true but can't be disputed.


The only people who show me affection sexually are married (or engaged, divorced) women who are no longer satisfied with their husbands, want the thrill of cheating, or just want to get their rocks off sexually.


Women/gals who I met through friends or at the bar do not show any interest in me romantically. And the last one who did told me that she didn't want to be with me (pretty sure she just wanted somewhere to stay at night and slept with me because she felt obligated to.)


I've lost all my friends repeatedly to where my closest friend is my aunt whom I communicate rarely (not even my own parents  feel like family) and I question my own morals because I feel fake when I try to make new friends. Feel like I am lying to myself without knowing what I'm lying about or what I really am enough to start the building blocks of a character I can identify myself as.


I seriously don't feel like I know myself and haven't for a while. I feel as though I have turned to alcohol, isolation, and cocaine as a means of coping with my bad feelings. I know this isn't a good thing, but the people I'm supposed to rely on have a tendency to make things worse; with guilt and unreasonable comparisons.

 I'm a 24 year old female within a poly relationship. My current live in partner and I will be going for 5 years strong this February. My other partner, who resides well over seas, is 10 months in with us. They aren't romantically involved with one another but uphold me mutually. I couldn't have asked for two kinder souls.

One works full time with plenty of overtime lately while the other found their own part time job and often plays games separately with their own friends, which I support. Yet, there's only so much appeal to my hobbies and other friends when they are gone. 
 Often times I dwell on the state of the world and try to convince myself that my needs are trite in comparison. Seldom do I reach out for attention. The worst habit developed lately is invalidating my own feelings and isolating, leaving both of them concerned for me along with other friends. 
  Even when my days are full of conversation with friends and distractions from it all, lately I just keep crumbling. I understand communication is key but sometimes just can't understand why I cry and cry to myself. It frustrates me nearly to the point of old habits like self harm.
  Therapy isn't available for me again until the 5th of January due to high volumes and it's understandable. Whoever takes the time to read this, thank you. Please hang in there.",lonely,"Poly, In Love and Still Lonely",2020-12-12 20:56:46
2896,mutima1,1607765526,1,"Ever since moving to Canada, I've always struggled to find friends, and when I do, it's always been a struggle to keep them. I know I have my flaws, and I know that I can be a terrible drunk or a terrible stoner until recently, but my intentions of building a good friendship(s) have always been genuine. I want friends and a solid group that I can see on a daily or if not frequent basis. 

Anyway, my most recent attempt at forming a good friendship was with a group of people from my ex-work. Things were going quite well up until I got high and got distracted texting on my phone. I do that at times, but I've been trying hard at fixing this. They had a chat about it with me, and we resolved it, and I thought things were great. The next weekend rolls by, and I understand one of my friends is going through some issues, but he doesn't tell me much about it. Now before this, he usually tells me most things about what he is going through.  We set up things to do, and we hang out with the super chill, and I enjoy hanging out with him.

However, we have been distant, and I go to this store to buy some weed, and I bump into them like I just caught them doing something wrong, the situation just felt so awkward, so I just said I'm going on a date to meet a girl to break the tension. Anyway, I'm in the line, and we say bye, and I walk into the store. That feeling just broke me. I've never felt so hurt before and so vulnerable. I wanted to cry so much because again, I've lost another group of friend(s). I know that things like this happen, and it's always best to move things along and keep things moving. Still, it's so difficult to not think about people you meet that have the same vibe as you but have no interest in being your friend. I deleted Instagram, left the group chat that we are in, and washed my hands to make things more comfortable. The pain inside is all too unbearable, and I know I need to speak to a counselor about this or a psychologist, but I also want to cry, smoke weed, pass out, and hope there would be better days ahead. 

Anyway, I know life isn't supposed to be easy, and I know we all need to deal with whatever is thrown at us, but it's still hard nonetheless.

I suck at speaking to other people and making conversation so I just keep to myself, and I know that’s just making it even worse but at this point I give up on trying. Every day I go into school with a fake smile and a fake happy expression, and every night I cry myself to sleep.

2931,GoofyUmbrella,1607740976,1," 

I haven’t had a solid group of friends since 8th grade. I’m a nice, caring, loving individual. I see past people’s flaws. I’m very easy to talk to and I have a very social, outgoing, fun personality. I smile a lot. I have a very good sense of humor too. I’m just a very nice and pleasant person to be around.

But socially, I’ve done awful. I was 0/3 on friend groups in high school. All the friend groups had formed by junior year and I was swept under the rug. The cards just... didn’t play out in my favor. Never got invited anywhere. High school sucked.

I came to college and didn’t want a repeat of high school. So I joined a political scholars group. Met a cool group of guys and thought we would be friends... until we all roomed together and had a falling out (although, they never wanted to go out drinking, so maybe I was in the wrong crowd).

I also rushed a fraternity. I got a bid. I went to socials, brotherhood events, and dinners. I put myself out there.

But because I’m small and I look young for a 20 year old, a lot of those guys picked on me and made me feel really bad about myself. If you want a sneak peek into how I get treated, take a look at my previous post on [/r/amitheasshole](https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole). I will be dropping at the end of the semester, I am just so unhappy being a member of this organization.

So here we are: nearing Christmas break sophomore year and I will most likely be with random roommates for junior year. Most friend groups have their rooms set up for August, they do that shit early!

Going on 7 years now and I’m 0/5 on friend groups.

I’m really tired of putting myself out there and coming up short. I feel like I’ve done everything right and the results haven’t been there. It’s so disheartening to see all my siblings and people from my high school do so well socially and end up all over social media while I am once again stuck without friends. I don’t deserve this.

Before I knew, I just thought of myself as an intense person. I loved people and things with reckless abandon, never feared risks. I opened up and pursued things because I was always lost in passion. Throughout college and after I flickered through intense, serious relationships.
My last one was a mistake. I opened up to the wrong person, too much, and gave of myself too freely. My intensity terrified her, which she made clear to me. For two years I tried to fit myself into the role that would make her most comfortable. It wasn't until six months after I left that I started to see the manipulation and the abuse - and the new person I had become as a result.
From this relationship, I lost my friends, my belongings, my housing, my family, all of my savings, my chance at chasing my career, my acceptance to NYFA, and more.
I was starting from a sort of rock bottom I'd never experienced before, but this time, I had no one.
Numerous traits make me a bad friend. I never associated them with traits that many ADHD folks struggle with until very recently. I have poor memory, and have trouble remembering things like birthdays, plans, or tasks I've promised to complete. I have executive dysfunction that makes me unreliable in things like attending social gatherings (back before Covid), getting or wrapping presents, or similar tasks. I have hyperfocus - which some of my exes had come to refer to as my ""tunnelvision"". She would either feel like she was the only person in my world, or she would feel like she didn't exist to me.
These are just small examples of the many ways that I struggle with maintaining relationships with people in way that doesn't tax them. That was fine. Up until she turned them against me, and those taxed, straining relationships all cut ties, one by one.
I don't blame them - I can't. I'm wildly emotional, over intense, and emotionally taxing. I understand that better than anyone.
Now, dealing with the emotional baggage on top of this intense person I am, I'm having trouble finding or creating those sorts of authentic, real, intimate connections.
It's been almost two years now since I freed myself from her, but despite gaining many things back - securing housing, a job, finding a new path to my career future, education - I feel so stuck. I feel unloved - and sometimes, unlovable.
I don't know if I even know how to go about finding a new circle of people - or even if I would be able to integrate with one.",lonely,"I'm a hard friend to have, so I lost all my support when I needed it the most - 26 y/o",2020-12-12 12:38:28

I’ve never posted before and created a new account for anonymity. 

I have been fighting a mild porn and phone addiction and the other day when I asked myself why it is I always come back to these vices I realized it’s because I’ve never felt this touch starved before. 

I am a recent college graduate who moved back in with my parents despite landing a decent paying job in my field of study because the cost of housing where I am from is one of the highest in the US. Everyone tells me I should be proud of myself because from the outside I have no reason to feel this way. I workout everyday, I make good money, and I have a family that loves me which I am grateful for but it pains me when I am surrounded by couples especially. I go home feeling worse because I haven’t been touched affectionately by anyone in so long and I can’t afford to comfortably move out. 

I fill that emptiness with porn and little pixels in the soul sucking box I always have in my pocket. I have no one to talk to about my loneliness or how I feed the sinking feeling in my chest with porn only making the feeling sink further. It’s not even about the sex, but my thirst for the passionate touch of someone I care about. The fact I have to pretend like I have the greatest fucking life and I’m that I’m soooo lucky to be where I am at only makes it worse as I parade down the street while hiding the envy for all the couples I pass by. Then I beat myself up more for feeling jealousy because I know it’s not right. 

Long story short, I am fighting the uphill battles of porn/phone addictions which are exacerbated by my deep longing for human touch and I have no one in my life to talk to about how I struggle everyday.

I ended up matching with a nice guy and we had a lot of things in common. He also opened up to me a lot about hardships in his life and I always tried being empathetic and really listen. I really was just looking for a solid person to talk to and he did provide me this for a solid 2 months. (Keep in mind we never ended up meeting in person). He ended up asking for my Snapchat and our conversations seemed to flow at the same pace. I will admit I did initiate most of our conversations but he seemed really enthusiastic to answer for the most part. Well... he decided to ghost me the week of thanksgiving lol. I did sort of confront him about it but I was mostly just checking in to see if there was something wrong or if I did anything to offend him but he just left my message on open.

2952,Mikrocorgy,1607730626,1,"Recently a person came back into my life, someone I consider a good friend.

I haven't had friends for 3 years now because I decided to remove myself from emotional relationships and I've only planted physical relationships. 

I did this because things got out of hand, I was an emotional mess and I got very clingy with ex husband and a few friends I had back then, plus my depression was really bad, I couldn't look at myself in the mirror anymore or get out of bed. Looking at the way things were back then now, I realize I probably have been a terrible friend because I only spoke about my depression and other problems I had in my daily life. They always said that it was okay, but I always knew they were starting to get tired of my shit because they started to talk to me less and less. But I was also very clingy and jealous of their new friends and that slowly made it worse and worse to get through the days without crying for hours... So I decided it is for the better to remain alone so that I don't have to feel jealous and depressed because of my friends anymore. I obviously was too depressed and unhappy in my life to have proper friends.

I admit, being alone wasn't the best thing ever, but it did make me less worried about myself and my life since I wouldn't have to share with anyone how miserable I am. I have a very low self-esteem, I'm very well aware of this. But if I don't care about making friends or what others think about me, it makes a depressing life a bit easier, yeah?

I was very hesitant and didn't want to talk to anyone because I was so scared things will become worse again... But after a while I gathered the strength to try and talk to this one person that I've always been very interested in and wanted to be friends with, we had a lot in common and I knew we could easily be friends again. 

We've been talking to each other for a while now and we've exchanged a lot of personal stuff and was able to talk to them about my problems a bit, not too much, but enough to feel good after a small rant... I'm really, really happy to have made a friend again after such a long time. I look forward to waking up and enjoying the day talking to them.

However recently as I learned more about them, I started to feel this jealousy again and became almost dependent on them. Every time they talk about their life, other friends and partner gives me this awful feeling in my chest, the same thing that happened with my other 2 friends 3 years ago.

I don't want this.

I've been starting to cry a lot again this weekend and I'm aware it will only get worse from now on. I feel like complete shit when they're not online or stop talking to me for more than 2 hours. I've become so clingy again even though I don't want to. My chest feels heavy and I can't eat anymore. Why does this happen again? Please stop. I hate this feeling, this jealousy. I don't want to start being very depressed tell them about it... But I don't want to burden anyone with this, I don't want to ruin their days, especially if they have their own share of problems, we all do after all.

I'm scared. I don't want to lose a good friend again.

... Sigh.

But I probably have to stop talking to them and live a life without friends again, it's for the better. For me and for them.

I hate myself so much. I'm pathetic.

Why? Why am I such a terrible, selfish person?

Why can't I control my emotions?

Why do I always want someone to only like me and me alone?

If I'm like this with friends, how the hell will I behave with someone I want to have a relationship with?

I probably shouldn't even think about that.

You probably read this and think ""Wow, what a crazy person. Hope they aren't talking about me.""

I wouldn't blame you if you did. I'm so sorry.

And I can't bring myself to watch the next season because it makes me feel so depressed and lonely not to have someone to watch it with.

I used to watch the old series when I was a kid so this new series, in addition to just being AWESOME, is very nostalgic for me and it just makes me feel lonesome not to have anyone to share it with. I don't know how else to explain it. I got happy and excited watching this show, then sad when I realized I was by myself and had no one to share that happiness and excitement with. This is a show I could easily see myself watching while cuddled next to someone on a Saturday morning.

Not that I had someone to cuddle with before the pandemic, but it's not as if covid-19 is making it any *easier* to find someone to cuddle with...

I’ve followed all guidelines since March, I have seen my family once since then, seen my girlfriend twice, lost most my friends who just don’t care, and are still going out.

Then I took a sabatic year in which I worked and read a lot of stuff. Suddenly took the blue pill, and quit watching my friends profiles, their Instagram,  their number,  tiktok, etc. Suddenly my doomer late-teens lifestyle changed. 
But then covid came. I haven't seen my few, very few friends I still maintain for all 2020. Feel so alienated, so alone... 
I miss laughing, talking, making jokes. I have maintained of course my friends with chats, but is not the same. I don't even know if I'm alone in this world for my bad luck, of not having friends, not knowing my mates from the uni, and being 24/7 in my house. I always get entertenainted in something to feel in balance, (taking care or my dog, cleaning, studying, reading, training, drawing, etc) BUT,,,, sometimes, at midnight, I miss those times where I always laughed and joking about everything.

I want blankets I like more than others because the memories of her, I want to be annoyed at my jackets being taken, I want to look into her eyes, and see her look back. I want someone who knows how I feel, and who is happy with me. I want to go out and do things with her, I want to experience new things and places together, I want to listen to music and dance together, I want to be happy in someone’s embrace, and I want her to be happy in mine. I want to support someone and help them achieve their dreams, but most importantly I want to be a part of those dreams. I don’t need some model or some celebrity, i just want a partner in life. I may be alone, but maybe we can be alone together and eventually I hope we find that we are no longer so lonely. I want to talk and laugh and tease, and most importantly, love her.

Life is a big self-gaslight between me thinking ""You're using ADHD as an excuse to show up late and be a shitty employee/student/friend"" and ""I'm 31, I've been in and out of therapy my whole adult life (when I can afford it), I take Adderall, used to read self help religiously, do CBT if I remember, what more can I do?"" (note the second and first person voices. Recent realization).

Growing up in a dysfunctional household with parents who stayed together but fought every single night resulted in me being in relationships that were very similar to my parents'. I always date people who are from dysfunctional families as well, and as the saying goes, ""hurt people hurt people."" 

So yeah, I choose to live alone with my cat so I can frenetically work on my little projects. Only I'm always on the line of just barely paying the bills, and the price of everything is going up, and I'm really stressed about it. 

It gets lonely and thankfully I have a group chat with my old friends, and some other friends to chat with here and there, but most of them have partners or are married so sometimes it's radio silence and all that I can do is convince myself that these waves of loneliness are much more bearable than the awful barrage of negative emotions that goes with dating someone. Even if I was playing the field , the attraction that I have to someone is rarely reciprocal. I'm a straight guy but I'm tiny, broke, and have no game.

The pandemic undoubtably made people feel lonely but what I have goes way beyond this. I spent over 3 years not talking to anyone, I went to college (off and one due to mental health) and didn’t speak to anyone. I sat alone and avoided eye contact. If I was chosen to speak by a tutor I’d quickly say I didn’t know and have a panic attack. 

I still struggle to leave the house and have had a long and varied history of trauma that has left me unable to do these normal things and I fear I’ll never truly be independent despite having dreams that I’m slowly working towards. During those 3 years I lived with with my mum and occasionally my sister would visiting (not often)

Growing up my childhood wasn’t healthy to say the least (a lot of different types of abuse, toxic people, traumatic events and things that shouldn’t happen being normalized). Most my summers were spent indoors while I could hear other kids playing. In fact one form of abuse I suffered at my primary school was being made to stay indoors while the other kids were on break. I was also bullied and never had any intervention by any of the schools I attended. 

My friendships have been flaky at best and I can’t hold down a friendship or relationship and people genuinely avoid me. I’ve been told I’m either inappropriate, weird or too much and I genuinely don’t know how to interact with other people.

And yeah I know depression/anxiety sucks but I’m sick of people who have somewhat manageable variants saying it’s the same as what I’m going through. Especially if they have friends or a partner. I spend months, often years at a time not socializing and left unable to and the yeah the pandemic has been tough but it’s not the same thing.

The pain of being ugly in their 30's hurts.  In your 20's, people can say ...your a poor broke student.  You don't have your stuff together.  

But being rejected constantly even after you got the house, the high paying job, the ability to purchase finer things, afford that gym membership and afford the healthy meals and STILL get constantly rejected is a hurt I wish upon nobody.  

To numb the pain, everytime I get rejected...I donate to children charities.

I want to not need human connection, I want to be alone. Yet I don’t, I don’t want to be alone. I know what it is is hurt.. I’m hurt. All I get from others is rejection and god I’ve been strong for so long. Going through my entire life without even one friend. No matter how many times people have called me weird or chose to ignore me outright, I had hope. I just thought “okay.. I haven’t found *my* people yet.”

When will I ever find *my* people? I’m 19 now. I’ve been waiting and searching all this time, yet again.. rejection. I tried making friends recently after taking a two month break due to some really bad interactions with others. I had hope with one person! We got along great.. but now he’s been really mean and insensitive. He has his reasons, but still it *really* hurts. I put up posts putting myself out there, showing my authentic self because I know it’s not worth faking it just to have someone there. I don’t just want someone, I want a genuine connection. For once in my life god I want a genuine connection.

I tried posting again today. On the needafriend subreddit. Putting myself out there, being honest about what I’m looking for. I mention I am an introvert and, I do appreciate a small number of friends who I have genuine connections with. 

I mentioned my dog, my hobbies, my likes, I ask questions to those reading. I ask my sibling if it looks alright. He told me it’s very expressive and friendly, and that I describe myself well. He also told me what to fix and I did. I posted it, and I got comments like “what the fuck” and “okay but do you like hentai” and “you talk like you’re 5”  I got embarrassed and deleted the post. It made me so upset. Why is it so hard for me to make friends? Is it something wrong with me? In grade school kids would talk to me, but only when they wanted advice or their friends weren’t around. So it’s not like I’m completely off putting, right? I’ve had people say that I was too excited and I came off as annoying. I guess having no friends will do that to you.

Skip to the other day. I work at a gas station and I was working on my register and things were slow so I was just looking around the store to see what needed to be done when a couple customers walked in, no biggie till I noticed one who looked familiar. I thought my blue just walked through the door, I was absolutely dumbstruck there was no way it wasn't her.

But at the end of the day, they seem to prove to me that I don’t understand love. I don’t get relationships. I don’t have the right feelings to make it all work, and the reason nobody really talks to me is because I can’t relate to others.

I’ve tried to get through life by giving myself to others. To fill other people’s needs and hope they’d fill my own. I’ve never had a strong attraction or infatuation with anyone, just attachment due to a sense that if I kept giving to someone, maybe eventually they’d give back. 

It’s a horrible way to live. It lets others walk all over you. And it means you’ll never figure out what’s really wrong. Even these few people I talk to online, they are just conversations. I don’t really know how to interact with them. It’s so stiff and mechanical, as if it’s unnatural. All I hope for is a connection that I can understand, and for others to understand me. But hell... that’s difficult it seems.

3161,throwaway0823001,1607579756,1,"I haven't truly connected with a new human being in six years.

I had plenty of friends when I attended a certain school district. In 2013, my father divorced my mother after she succumbed to alcoholism. In 2014, he started dating a woman who was a single mother with two girls. When he married her in 2015, we moved to her house because the school district was much better. Let me be clear: I do not regret moving; the new school district *was* significantly better, and was actually able to accommodate my ADD. The only sacrifice I had to make was my friends, who I slowly drifted apart from now that they all lived several hours away. The switch happened during the middle of 7th Grade, long after kids had already formed their groups and cliques. Long after the point where it wasn't weird to just walk up to a kid and say, ""Hey, you wanna be friends?"" or just sit at a random lunch table. Despite that, I managed to make a few friends, but never got quite as close with them as I was with my old friends. We never got close enough for me to visit any of them at home, or vice versa.

Then, in high school, year after year, I was placed into classes with kids I didn't know. I never even ended up in the same lunch period as my friends. So, again, we slowly drifted apart. By senior year, I couldn't wait to go to college; finally, the slate would be clean. Nobody would know each other, so the social playing field would be level. This was my chance! Then Covid happened. Now I attend college through a fucking computer screen.

*Well*, I thought to myself, *If I can't get a friend, maybe I can get a girlfriend*. I hadn't considered asking a girl out throughout most of high school. I wanted a real relationship, and I knew that if I hooked up with someone in high school, there was a guaranteed expiration date when we graduated; what were the odds we'd end up going to the same college? And I was well aware of the poor success rate of long distance relationships. Despite that, in early March 2020, I figured I might as well give it a shot anyway. There was a girl in my robotics class I had a crush on, so one day I worked up the courage and casually asked if she wanted to grab lunch sometime. She said no. I had prepared for that, so I wasn't hurt; I just said ""Okay"" and walked away. No big deal. I was still proud of myself that I had at least finally asked a girl out. *A good practice run for later*, I thought. Plus, in-person classes got cancelled less than two weeks later, so I guess it ended up being good that she said no.

With Covid cancelling in-person classes at college, I resorted to Tinder in October. I didn't need to go on any actual dates so long as quarantining was necessary; I would've just been satisfied with texting. So far, I've matched with about a dozen girls. Most of them never responded to me and later unmatched. Others initially responded but stopped after a little while. Two responded consistently. Of those two, one turned out to be a scam trying to steal my credit card info. The other girl was nice -- we clicked on just about everything; we texted for hours the night we matched. We made plans to meet in person the next week, since the warm weather was about to end and we obviously needed to meet outside. The date went well. I was happy. She seemed happy.

I've texted her since then. She hasn't responded. It's been weeks. I guess that's it.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know why I'm failing. I'm not being creepy. I'm not opening every conversation by sending dick pics (I'm not comfortable with that anyway, even with someone who consents). I don't have major insecurities about my body; I'm not a 10/10, but I don't think I'm ugly either. Some people obviously agree with me if I'm matching with people, so what's going on?

Other than my family, who I love very much, I don't really have anyone in my life. I have exactly one solid friend: my best friend from my original school district. We text every day, play video games when we get the chance, meet in person when we can. That's it.

I just want someone to give me a chance. Just one fucking chance. I feel suffocated. I don't fantasize about fucking ultra hot supermodels. I fantasize about sitting on the couch, watching tv, with a cute girl's head on my shoulder or in my lap, or mine in hers. I can't stop thinking about it. I feel exhausted and pathetic, and at the same time like I'm not appreciating what I already have; I have a good education and a large family that loves me and a great friend. Shouldn't I feel satisfied? I don't know.

I couldn’t afford it and I had a small business that I was making decent money off of so I didn’t feel the need to go just to go. Problem 2 I lean towards the more geek and artistic side of the spectrum.... and I live in the middle of country hick town. Nothing against country people, I love most of the people here. I just don’t like the obnoxious “YoU AiN’t a reAl maN iF yOu DOnt DriVe a TrUcK” kind of country. And unfortunately most people my age lean heavily towards the obnoxious.

3191,HistoricalGiraffe503,1607565553,1,"Hey Reddit,

First time posting here...getting this off my chest because there’s no one to really talk to about this. I’ve been trying to stay on a positive wave, but keep feeling disappointed...my birthday is coming up next week and I have no one to celebrate it with. I live alone and far away from my parents/family/one lifelong friend. 

I was hoping to celebrate with a friend (Friend #1) in the city where I live. We had discussed it, but she just told me she’s now going out of town on the evening of my birthday with another friend for the weekend. She suggested that we hang out during the day, but I have to work on my birthday, so we can’t really do much during the day. Since she’s going out of town that evening (after her other friend gets off work) that doesn’t leave much time - so in short we won’t be able to do anything together. With covid restrictions there really isn’t much to do and aren’t very many places to go in the city where I live. It still would’ve been nice to hang out with a friend somehow. I don’t have very many friends (as I’m sure you can tell from this post lol). 

I had also considered going back to my home state to celebrate my birthday, but one of my longtime friends there (Friend #2) didn’t seem too enthusiastic about celebrating - she said she has to work on my birthday (I get it because I do, too) into the evening and didn’t want to hold me up on my birthday. I had suggested doing a staycation somewhere nearby, maybe exploring some parks/areas that are open over the weekend and eventually going to dinner someplace that’s open (outdoor and some indoor dining is open in my home state’s main city). It seemed like my friend was dancing around saying that she wouldn’t be in the mood to celebrate. My birthday is on a Friday this year. I understand she’s been stressed out and tired from her job, but it would’ve been amazing if she, idk, acted like she actually wanted to celebrate 😂. I definitely understand being tired and not wanting to do something after work, but at the same time if it’s Friday wouldn’t that make you want to celebrate your friend even more?!

Anywho, friend #2 and I talked about getting drinks somewhere in our hometown as a quick thing to do on my birthday evening. But even with that, I felt like I had to keep suggesting things and asking before my friend agreed. I’m not a pushy person, so I don’t like to keep asking people to do something - especially if I feel like I’m asking them to do it *for me* lol. But I figured she’s my friend and it’ll be my birthday so why not. At the same time, I understand everyone may be dealing with things that we don’t know about. Knowing this, I try to be gentle with folks. But I can’t help but feel like maybe I need more friends or friends that are a little more eager to socialize with me? I’ve always been a quality over quantity type of person. Now I’m feeling like the few friends that I thought I could count on are leaving my by myself. Sometimes you just wish you had that fun friend who was down for the ride, you know? Or is that mainstream media instilling that concept in my head...🤔?

For full disclosure I should say I’ve also been bummed out after the break up of a long term relationship early this year, and the breakup of a shorter term relationship (I guess you can call it that) too. Those are both long stories but won’t get into them on this post lol. 

I have a new job and actually need to stay in the city where I live for longer than I initially thought. So it looks like I’ll be here for my birthday anyway which rules out the possibility of seeing Friend #2 on my birthday anyway. 

I don’t have a question necessarily, but just looking for any advice on making this a fun, positive, birthday this year even if I’m just sitting in my apartment alone. I’m already planning to map out some movies and shows I want to watch. I’ll probably exercise as well after work. Just feeling lonely and wondering if anyone has had a similar situation happen on their birthday.

3197,pxmik,1607561670,1,"I(20M) found out my girlfriend of 3 years had been cheating on me for the last month of us being together. We were LDR at the time so I’m thankful I wasn’t around to catch an STD or something but it still stings.

We were dating for 3 years and she was my best friend. I have a tight friend group outside of my ex but ever since I cut ties with her I feel like I have nobody. 

It feels like I go days with only 1-2 texts or a snapchat for me, not even to talk to me, just to ask me something real quick or for one of my friends to say something random. My friend group isn’t the type to share our emotions with each other(all guys). We hang out and laugh a ton but ya boy isn’t really in the mindset for that kind of thing all the time. Sometimes I’ll make a post like this and even rarer times I’ll have someone message me about it or message someone else who might need a friend, both situations I get ghosted. I don’t say anything explicit or out of line imo, maybe we just don’t vibe or they for some reason lose interest in me. I tried joining some discords to make friends cause obviously COVID and they’re all just not my speed. I tried tinder(bad idea) with no luck, bumble for friends with no luck. Tried making plans to hang out with co workers or they text me to hang out and then I get left on delivered for about a week. I just don’t know what to do right now. 

I don’t know if I should keep trying to make friends, all that really does is bum me out and disappoint me when they stop answering. I get that not everyone is built for everyone so I don’t blame them for doing it, I just want to find a friend that I can make a connection with and I don’t know where to find them with the current social climate we’re in. I even tried joining groups on facebook and none accepted my request to join(exercising/cardio groups).

At times I feel like this is just the universe telling me to be selfish and ignore the world to focus on me, but there’s not much I enjoy by myself. I’m in a trade school right now but its all online and no interaction between others in the same trade as I am. Its like everything is trying to force me to be alone when I don’t want to be. 

I have 1 friend I can talk to about my emotions but I know at this point I’m exhausting her from me constantly complaining or feeling sorry for myself. Acting this way is so out of character for me, I’m usually super optimistic and I’m the one in my friend group that gets everyone together to hang out and go do stuff but I’m just not ready for that. 

The day before yesterday I was putting my laundry away and I just started crying. I realized no one really thinks about me or checks in on me which I deserve. I don’t check in on others that often either, I should start doing that but I’d just be doing that right now to get their attention. The point is, is that I feel the loneliest I’ve ever felt and everything I try to do to fix it makes it worse. 

I don’t know if its okay mentally to just shut out the world and be selfish or if I should keep trying even when it hurts me. Any advice on this would be really appreciated.

3210,datingishardcomedy,1607555529,1,"I think the thing that has been making me feel most lonely in the world lately has been the lack of variety in my days. Before quarantine, I would go out basically every night, see new people, and at least have the opportunity of talking to new people or someone who I hadn't seen in a very long time. I am a comedian, so my nights were filled with seeing friends telling jokes, hearing something new, discussing how a joke could work better, etc. 

Since quarantine happened, I just am not having that sense of kinship and community. Comedy is on hold for the time being (I'm in LA, with some of the more strict lockdowns in the country), so I don't really have that creative outlet anymore, and I also don't have the community outlet. 

But what I think is the most gutting for the last few months is just the lack of surprise in my days. Every day I wake up and I pretty much know exactly how my day is going to go and that I will not be seeing anyone. I think that's why I'm having a hard time keeping track of what day it is and how long this has all been going on. One day blends into the other. Nothing new. No changes. Just alone in my apartment. Working from home (Thank goodness I still get to have a job). Maybe lifting weights (Thank goodness I purchased some of those before the quarantine). Finishing the day watching TV.

This is the life I've worked so hard to avoid. I used to write for websites and my coworkers hated the idea of working from home because, ""If I work from home, I'll never see anyone."" I never had that problem before. I'd go out and do open mics, go to a show, or have a show myself. I'm now forced into that nightmare life that I never wanted. I like variety. I like seeing new people. I like having the opportunity to maybe meet someone new. But that's not here right now and I've been having a rough time trying to reconcile that. 

Even once I got an office job, there were some days where I'd look back to my time as a waiter and romanticize it. You never knew who would come in the restaurant, who you'd be talking to, who was working that day. In office life, it's generally the same people every day. Day in, day out. But in order to be a ""success"" and make a decent living, this is the reality you have to face.

I just want variety in my days again. The lack of surprise in my days is what has me feeling the most lonely lately. No one new in my life and no opportunity for it to happen either. With no end in sight.",lonely,The Lack of Surprise,2020-12-10 10:12:09

So she's been online for school since March. As a 14 yr old of course that's so bad for social interactions but on top of that she didn't have a good time at school before either. 

Apparently a lot of her friends were quite rich and snobbish (she goes to an international school) and she felt left out. Don't get me wrong my parents aren't poor or anything but we're not that well off and they also want to teach her the value of money. Apparently these 'friends' would laugh at her when she couldn't buy everything they did and eventually she stopped going out with them at all. I think, even though she doesn't tell us, they just weren't being good friends to her in a lot of ways. As well as this, she's always had issues with weight. She's been losing some but I know it makes her self confidence worse and she has an even harder time making friends.

I stated college (university) from home with video lessons and I didn't know anyone there. Obviously, I still don't, as there is no way of interacting with the others except for a WhatsApp group of 100+ people.

I got through the first lockdown pretty easily: I was used to stay home, there was a great sense of union, and I had friends that I made during the five years of superior school going through the same stuff as me, so occasionally on the class wa group somebody wrote something and we discussed a bit, and I didn't feel alone more than before.

Now it's all crazy. I fail to follow a lesson for more than 30 minutes, my brain goes into weird places thinking about stuff that has nothing to do with what I'm doing and in general I can't focus. Maybe I chose the wrong university, or maybe it's just this whole situation that is crazy.

The only thing that makes me smile is watching the Mandalorian each friday with a friend, which is one of the few (two in total lol) people that I can really call friends. Due to this, I started digging way too much in the Star Wars world to the point that I spend hours everyday watching videos on YouTube and stuff and I hate it, I feel like I do it to escape reality and I really don't wanna be like that. 

I've always been willing to fix things but now I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and it all just ends up with me laying on the bed scrolling Reddit and being depressed. I'm afraid of what will become of me once we get out of this situation, I don't know if I'll ever be the same.

I hope this is an appropriate place fo this post. I'd like to share a recent a experience that may be helpful to others on here. Like many people on here, I felt really alone and lonely because I felt like I don't have many good offline friends and relationships. I recently reconnected with an online friend. By online friend, I mean to say, we met online and we have only ever talked online and on the phone. My friendship with this person has always been pretty good, in that we both enjoyed talking to each other, although we would sometimes go months without talking for no particular reason. So this was an instance of reconnecting after not speaking for a while.   


Speaking with this friend, it feels as if we never stopped speaking. I opened myself up to them, and I received no judgement, just understanding.  This rekindled friendship is for me just what the doctor ordered, and I'm doing much better. Even though, I've never met this person irl, I can say they are the realest friend I feel I have at the moment. I was prompted to write this post because I just received a Christmas card from them in the post. Which is perhaps one of the nicest things someone has done for me lately :').

So what'd I like to say to everyone is, if you are lonely and alone in your ""real life"". It is worth trying to create friendships with people you meet online. And even though those relationships only take place online, they are just real as offline relationships, so don't discount them! So I encourage you if you're feeling lonely, to participate in the online chats on here or other platforms!

Someone who wants to talk to me and tell me about their day. I need someone to be there to listen to me when i need to vent about something. Someone who doesn't judge me for not caring about superficialities.

There is nothing i want to do on my own. I enjoy things in life but the overbearing issue is that i am not happy doing any of it alone.

I have made friends before in life, but at 31 years old i can count them on 4 fingers. 1 i lost touch with. 1 i had a falling out with. 1 passed away in april this year. And the last i feel as though i'm losing and can't figure out how to hold on, no matter what i do.

I was friends with her for about 2 years before falling in love with her. I felt like she and i could really rely on eachother. Now i'm just over attached and trying not to rely on her too much but that makes me feel even more lost. I can't talk with her like i used to because she and i don't share the same feelings. If i talk with her like i used to, then i become more attached and get hurt when she isn't there to listen. Of course she won't always be there, she has her own life that doesn't involve me.

I just feel so lost. It's so difficult to make friends. Then i just lose them. I'm open to making friends, but ultimately I don't want more friends. I want a partner. Friends come and go. A partner i can rely on.

This all makes it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain motivation in anything with a learning curve. I can't even maintain an exercise routine. I always find myself thinking ""what am i doing this for?...It's just more pain for my loneliness"". As difficult, relentless, and futile as it all is, i do everything i'm supposed to do to stay alive and healthy. I work, clean, eat relatively healthy, force myself to exercise as much as i can. But besides all that, i have nothing to speak for.

I try and go out to do things, but at the end of the day i'm alone and unfulfilled anyways. All the effort of going out and talking to people makes it so much worse to feel the way i do. At least when i'm truly alone i'm not finding myself hoping that the person i'm talking to might feel for me someday the way i feel for them.

We’re having an online Christmas party at work, and as new hires, we had to do a talent show. My group chose to do a tiktok video. We had to send 2 video clips about 8 seconds each and it was just freestyle. So we didn’t have any steps to follow, we could literally do anything in our own clip. So I can’t dance and I’m not creative either so I can’t do those funny video clips as opposed to a dance clip. But I did my best and I felt like I really stepped out of my comfort zone by sending in a pretty awkward but ok dance clip. It was just like a total of 3 basic dance steps so it was boring.

Honestly, I was even proud at the start but when I watched the others’ videos, damn, mine was just extremely lame. But I just couldn’t do anything else and we had a deadline so I accepted it.

We broke up due to circumstances out of both of our controls...

In the first place, I never really opened up to people. And I still have a really hard time opening up to people in real life. But I wanted to tell my story. My story about who I am and how I got here... I didn't have the time to get to tell her everything, but she's the one right now who knows me the best...

I imagined being able to do everything with her... And now I can't really do anything with her... or at least, it'll never be enough for me...

I'm needy and broken, but it's not my friends' jobs to fix me, so I only open up to them when I'm having an emotional emergency...

I just... it just felt like I had finally found what I've been looking for this whole time... But my life has just been one cruel joke after the other...

Everything reminds me of her... and I have to learn to forget these feelings for her so that we can both move on with peace of mind...

I just got 25 years old this month and started thinking about life. (once again) 

Almost my whole life i got shunned by everyone no matter if its family,  ""friends"" or random people i just wanted to connect somehow. 

As a child until my early teens i was very shy which was a found fodder for bullys in school and the situation at home wasnt better either,  i have a father who was/is an narcissistic Asshole who always used me and my brother only for his benefits. 
My mother said already early in my teens that she doesnt love me like a mother should. 
My brother is a mix between an arrogant asshole and a nice guy (depending on the situation) 

Only after the 4 year long divorce of my parents i changed my personality to be extremely confident in myself and started even my first relationships. 

Friends? 
Oh well i had many of them, wrong friends to be exactly.  Those who use your goodwill against you.
If i have to be honest i think i only had 3 ""real"" friends in my life. 
I see the rest of the people i have contact with only as associates and nothing more because i know they will also be fake friends if i ever tried to do more with them. 

Surely some of you may think ""Oh Anon but you had relationships and also had real friends so your are not so alone how you think""
Well i HAD all those things thats right. 

Since about 2 years i only live only for myself and i,m sick of it.

He's a year older than me, and originally met me through my brother, who was friends with him, but the more he came over, the more I began to recognize that he was spending more time with me than my brother. Even though I was quite sad then, he was always there for me. He's super kind, which is the main thing I like about him. He was always happy to let me vent to him about my current problems. Even when I was suicidal, when I was cutting, he still hung out with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, he hasn't talked to me in a long time. I don't know why. The last time I talked to him was about two to three months ago, when I confessed my romantic love towards him. He didn't feel the same way, but I didn't think it was a big deal, as 1. I had been attracted to him before, even when he wasn't attracted to me and 2. He stayed for a few more hours after that and it wasn't awkward at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, he hasn't talked to me once. I'm gonna text him tomorrow, even though I've sent multiple the first few weeks we stopped talking. It's not even like I don't have friends, I have many.

3281,Secret_for_Sanity,1607498293,1,"Have you ever felt like you were just an extension of someone else? Like your self didn’t matter as much as your partner. It’s lonely, feeling like your needs are never prioritized, and even sometimes made to seem invalid.

When you’re trapped in a relationship with a controlling person, you might not have the means to escape, or the mental strength. It’s possible you don’t have any friends left because you weren’t allowed to see them. It’s possible you don’t have access to any money to leave because they take all of your money. You end up staying out of fear because you aren’t equipped to survive on your own. You may have been told many times that you couldn’t. Because you’re just an extension of somebody else. Your wants, desires, emotions, and dreams aren’t important if they don’t benefit who you belong to. 

So what do you do?

How do you escape from this living hell?

Where do you go?

How do you keep yourself from falling back into their grasp?

I’ve been told to just walk out the door. Turn the knob, open the door, and close it behind me. But when the entire world is a few steps in front of you, one you haven’t been a part of for such a long time, what do you do? Where do you go? 

Why do you feel guilty?

You take a few steps, but it’s cold outside. The house is a lot warmer, maybe it’s not so bad there? Maybe you’re just overreacting to something. Maybe this is as good as it gets.

3318,painfullyreal1234,1607482213,1,"
Around a year ago I was in a really rough place. I felt very alone, and I also felt like a failure and a hypocrite. Despite these feeling I had a fairly ok social life. I would go out and spend time with friends but I always felt a disconnect from them. I would hangout with them but we never felt ""close"". I talked to a few people I had met online from posting on reddit and that was nice but I still felt very alone. 

Then I met ""L"". I really didn't even expect a friendship to happen, we were both pretty awkward but we were real with each other so we ended up continuing to talk. Our conversations were about things we cared about or even just random musings. We would share memes, watch tv shows together, and stay up late into the night just hanging out with each other. 

For the first time in a long time I could really bear my soul with someone. I have a lot of bottled up issues. Self esteem issues, confidence issues, loneliness, mild mental health issues (Mild depression/anxiety/adhd). We talked about these things as she had some similar issues. Neither of us had to hide who we were from each other and it was really nice. We could share our faults with each other and not feel judged, we could be honest about our loneliness without being judged, and we could comfort each other. Despite only knowing each other online we got to know each other quite well through skype calls. 

As time went on an attraction grew, we started to flirt some and I'm not going to go into details but there were a few moments of online passion. What was amazing about that is we could still be ourselves. I wanted to please her, and she wanted to please me, and we were both open about it. If one of us needed comfort the other wanted to give it. It was a deeply refreshing experience to not only have someone who wanted to comfort me when I was feeling sad but also who wanted me to comfort them when they were sad. 

Eventually though we started to drift apart, we had different goals in life and our short 5-8 month romance had more or less run its course. It wasn't all perfect, she was a good 6 years younger than me (i'm 27) and that created a strain at times because I thought she had a lot of co-dependence with her parents who I also think abused her (not physically but emotionally). She could also be quite naive at times. I wasn't always the most understanding, I wanted her to act like someone my age when she frankly wasn't, and I only am who I am now cause I was immature as a 21 year old as well. 

So It ended, and now for months and months Ive had this empty hole in me because I miss it. I miss her but I understand why it ended and why it needed to but I miss having someone I could be that vulnerable with.",lonely,I had a friendship with someone I met online and since it ended earlier this year Ive had a hole in me,2020-12-09 13:50:13

3327,scarsouvenir,1607479527,1,"So, the other day, I ordered from a pizza place, and one of the employees texted me to ask if I wanted to choose a different topping, because they were out of something... And I can't bring myself to delete that stupid text, because at least someone fucking texted me for once. In fact, I have text conversations on my phone going back months or even **years**, which is so pathetic and depressing, but it'd depress me even more to be forced to face the reality that no one actually cares to talk to me. 

A couple weeks ago, I finally went through and deleted something like 500 Facebook friends who I either never knew or haven't talked to in years. It just started to feel really wrong to me for some reason. But I couldn't go any further than that, even though I only interact with 2-3 people on Facebook, for the same reason I can't delete those texts... 

I work in a restaurant in a customer service position. I talk to so many customers and coworkers every single day. And yet I'm still starved for any *meaningful* interaction.

I reconnected with an old friend of mine a few months back. I'd missed him so badly and was so grateful to have him back in my life. ""Maybe that's what's missing,"" I spent years telling myself... 

But the conversations I have with him now are not enjoyable at all. They're just draining. He's awful at small talk, but it's been so long that we don't have anything else left. Honestly, I dread talking to him. I know I should probably find a nice way to tell him that so he's not continually putting all this effort into a relationship that will never go any further, but I keep up the conversation, just because I can't stand the quiet. And I feel so evil for asking for a friend, yet being unable to connect with the one person who's deeply invested in me. Just further confirmation that I'm a selfish/unlovable person, I guess... 

Anyway, sorry for my rambling. I'm always fucking rambling when I post on this sub.

We did everything together, Hung out most weekends and it was the first group of people that I felt I somewhat fit in with. I was overall happy and thought they would be lifelong friends. The Last last couple years things got rocky at times but we always made up. After I graduated we all ended up living pretty far apart (closest one was 45min drive away). 

I had a argument with my best friend/old roommate. And the whole group pretty much fell apart after that. I tried on a couple occasions to fix it but it was no going back. Ive always been pretty shy so it’s hard to make new friends but they all made friends easily.

3354,SallyFace617,1607463760,1,"So I have this awesome best friend who we'll call E. So me and E have been friends for a long time, since 4th grade i believe. We met at some counseling social group thing for autistic kids and had a few things in common, like that we both liked The Amazing World of Gumball and stuff, but we mostly liked to draw, so we became friends pretty quickly. A few years later we're still friends and still like drawing, and we have new things in common and everything is all well and good, but recently I've been noticing some other stuff. Stuff like that when i don't text her for a while, like at least 2 days or so, she gets worried or something and leaves me messages like ""Oh, your'e ignoring me again. Fine, i don't want to be your friend either!"", and when i see them i have to leave this message like ""I was grounded!"" or something, and she'd apologize and everything was normal, but this happened a lot. Maybe she has trust or abandonment issues or something, and i respect that, but there are other things too, like she talks A LOT about the things she likes but doesn't listen or care when i try to chime in with something i like, but I let her, so that might be a little my fault. She also doesn't take criticism well and has a quick temper, which is a problem because she likes to make art and things and post them on the internet, and there your'e bound to receive criticism, for example, she wrote this fanfiction or something and posted it (and to be fair it wasn't that great and had a few elements that could have even been considered problematic) and when she received a bit of polite criticism, she lashed out at the person giving it, and when she got more she deleted the story altogether and announced that she would be disabling comments on all future posts so she wouldn't have to deal with any more ""jerks"". I tried to tell her that constructive criticism was necessary for improvement, but she lashed out at me and said that she knew, ""but no one likes having their imperfections pointed out like that!"" and that ""I should KNOW that."", so i just dropped the subject because i didn't want to make her any more mad. More and more instances like this where she gets mad at something, i point out that she ought not to be mad because the problem was actually something she needed to know or was for the best, but maybe in a ruder way then i should have said it (like when i told her that since her OCs were minors and so was she, she couldn't draw nsfw of them without at least aging them up), she lashes out, and i drop the subject. It went on like this for a while, and i was both worried that i was being spineless and keeping her from things she needed to know, and that i was being rude and a bad friend. Honestly, im worried i'm being a bad friend for both reasons and i don't know what to do. A few weeks or so ago, i was talking to E and having a nice time, but she just stopped texting me and didn't text me for the rest of the day. This happened a lot, and i got worried and ended up texting her a TON, probably more than i should have been, and yeah, that was a dumb move, but tbh, i was really lonely and kind of going insane due to COVID, and none of my other friends were really talking to me. This made her understandably mad, and told me that ""i shouldn't text her so much"". I kept screwing up and now she hasn't talked to me in days, maybe weeks.

I do not mention a specific religious sect in this post (but the message is Christian in general). This is just a positive message for those out there that need to hear it. If this post still violates any rules I'm sorry and you may remove this post. 

If you don't believe in God, please do not argue with others in the comments. Once again, this is meant to be a message of positivity and love to those who need to hear it. But whether you are religious or not, I hope there is something in here for you.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want everyone reading this to know that God loves you very much. He knows you and loves you better than you know or love yourself. He is aware of you.

It doesn't matter if your LGBTQ+. I know that those of you who are LGBTQ+ may have had bad experiences with religion and/or have been told nasty things. I want you all to know that my heart goes out to you. I may not know your story, but I know that your life likely hasn't been easy. Hold on. You are a child of God and you have a divine purpose and destiny.

It doesn't matter if you feel like you've screwed up when it comes to anything in your life. God loves you with the perfect love of a loving parent. He wants the best for you. You are not beyond his love or his mercy. You can change if that is what you are trying to do. It may not be easy, but he will help you in his own way. You are a child of God and you have a divine purpose and destiny. You can do it.

If you feel alone and that no one understands you. I testify that Christ understands you because he has felt your pains and afflictions when he atoned for you. If you feel you have nowhere else to turn, you can always turn to Christ and pray. You are never not worthy enough to pray. Even if you don't believe in God, if you put in the small amount of faith required to ask if He is there, you will feel His love for you. If you don't know how to pray, just talk (or think inside your heart if you can't talk out loud where you are at) to God as if he were another person, and ask if he is there, ask for help, ask for forgiveness (if that is what you are looking for). I can't guarantee an immediate answer. He will answer your prayer in His own time and in His own way.

I feel like a loner. I have no friends, no one to talk to just about daily life or to hang out with. I’m closest to my partner but I started to realize I was codependent on him for companionship and I’m trying to break away from that because it’s not healthy for our relationship. I just really struggle to find and keep great friends and it’s even harder because I’m an introvert with social anxiety but I’m pretty good at faking being an extrovert when I meet new people. 

I feel like even though I make an effort to be kind and reach out to people for friendship, no one reciprocates that back. I was just scrolling through Instagram, which I don’t do often, and I came across a profile from my old college friend and there were a bunch of pictures of a group of friends who I was really close with hanging out for Halloween and having so much fun. I no longer hang out with them because 1) I moved out of my home city, and 2) we just aren’t that close anymore. I feel like everyone just has this bond and I’m the only outlier. Anyway I hate for this to sound like a sob story, I’m not looking for pity, but just seeing that on social media sort of triggered suicidal thoughts and feelings of worthlessness that I’ll never make friends, etc.

I try to be so positive and keep working through social anxiety to get out of my comfort zone so that I can actually make connections but some days it’s just hard and sometimes I don’t have the energy to put 110% into making friends especially when it leads no where.",lonely,I’ll never make friends...,2020-12-09 07:28:40

3373,Viciously_calm,1607449913,1,"I am a very lonely guy. I have been for my whole life pretty much. I just turned 25 in october. 

I broke up with her last year. Well, she broke up with me. On my birthday, after I found out she cheated. I was with her for 7 years. I loved her more than I loved myself, my parents, anyone. She weaponized that against me and broke me down over the years. I felt like my soul was being choked out. I hated my life with her, even tho I loved my life with her, because I was with her and I loved her. If that even makes sense. 

When she kicked me out our apartment on my birthday, that was one of the lowest points of my life. Cant really describe it. 

Moved home and my parents really helped save my brain from self destructing. I got a new job and for the first time in my life, actual friends. For the first time in my life, i had people inviting my to parties, bars, their house just to hang out, walks, it was awesome. Even dated new people. I remember crying and thanking god for it. I was so grateful. 

The covid happened. They shut down my office. All of my friends got fired, and I have slowly fell apart from all of them. To the point where I feel like a nuisance just trying to coordinate a hang out. My dating life dissapeared. I moved out my parents place to my own place for the first time. It's been lonelier than ever. 

I got put on a blind date last night by a female friend. The girl she hooked me up with was gorgeous and smart. I felt awkward the whole night. Why would a girl like that ever want a guy like me. Im a lonely person. Who wants to date a lonely person. Who wants to date someone with no life. Why would I waste this girls time. 

I miss my ex still. It was better than feeling alone. I miss having someone to lay next to. I miss having someone to lie to me and tell me they love me. I miss the dates and vacations together. I miss the moment I proposed and she cried in my arms. 

Wherever you are, I hope you're happy now. I miss you so much. You were adorable. You were my bestfriend. You were my girl. I hate that you said goodbye. I love you. Always will.",lonely,Oh well,2020-12-09 04:51:53

I do talk to other people and time away from them feels so much more enjoyable

Which brings me to the reason I'm writing this post: almost every week my ""friends"" comment how I must find someone and would never be truly happy alone. I must. 

I just don't get it. Theres no place in my life for anybody else, I don't see myself wanting to get into a relationship, I don't see myself willingly spending my precious time on someone else. I love my lifestyle. I love myself. I don't need anything else.

But. People always talk about it with such sincere and kind expressions I feel like such a bad person for wanting to disagree. So I thank them and even recieve ""help"" they throw at me. I can't break out of it.

What can I say other than I wanted to say something? I'm tired. 

I'm not going to say I'm a nice guy but I'm not a bad person and I try do nice things for people.

Believe I messed up by playing by the rules. I never stood out much as a kid. Even when I tried to be part of 'the gang' I wasn't. I had a few I thought I could call good friends. But as soon as I stop messaging they were gone. 

It's hard to feel you have worth when you're constantly being rejected from job applications. Positions I've had and assisted training others in. Because of this my confidence is shocked. 

But the worst is being lonely. Many of you probably know this. I found friends online but it isn't the same. I want to really talk to someone and actually hear myself. Want to get away from screens and make actual memories. Because I feel I missed out on some of that. 

And while I'm typing about wants, I want to find someone. It's hard putting that into words. You know yourselves.

The problem is, I've been so conditioned to being alone that when someone messages me I panic and don't know what to say and I don't really even wanna talk to them. It's like a loneliness that people can't fill. Even when I had friends, the loneliness and emptiness was there. Nothing fills it it's like I'm longing for something and I don't know what.

3416,Thr0wwAway0,1607416673,1,"I feel like I'm really struggling right now and I need to get this out but don't have anyone to tell this to.

I am really close to someone I met online. Someone I talk to everyday and someone I sometimes talk to about my mental health. Today was really rough with getting my mental health out to my parents, so I was already a mess when my friend said they needed to talk to me about something serious. 

We have a pretty big age gap and I never paid it much mind because it never effected the way we treated each other. It never made our relationship any different, or so I thought. While we ourselves have no issue with it, turns out some of their friends do. 

They told me they were getting harassed and being called certain names for hanging out with me. Also that people thought of them differently now because of me. I didn't know about this because I also hang out with their friends too and I would never expect any harassment from their friends, but no one else besides them would know about us. Now I'm re-thinking my opinion of all of their friends who I once thought were nice.

I feel terrible that someone I care for so much is going through this because of me. But the thing I'm upset about the most is that we are getting broken apart by people around us. People who don't know details or anything between us. My friend has been nothing but sweet and kind to me, yet gets insulted for BEING KIND AND SPENDING TIME WITH ME. I get its frowned upon because most age gap relationships are toxic and munipulative but anyone who has seen our relationship can tell its no different from a non-age gap relationship.

They told me I need to prepare for the day when we stop contact and that message really hurt me. To go from talking to each other everyday for hours to telling me one day, I won't be able to reach out to them anymore. Also, this is probably the closest person I have and we always had a health relationship.

I don't want to make their life any harder but I also want to keep them in my life because I know I love them so much. But because I love them, I'm conflicted. I regret telling my age to my friend and their group because if I just kept my mouth shut, no one would question our relationship.

I guess I'm not looking for an answer, but to just get this out. Thanks to anyone who read this far.

Each one of us went to a different college and they’re still friends and I’m still alone, I made some friends in college but not really and you know with covid and all i only actually attended college for one semester and now I’m in my second year with no actual good friend. I feel so alone all the time. I see everyone from my generation going out making friends, living their life and i feel like I’m standing still. I don’t really know what’s wrong with me . I’m not super social but I’m really friendly. I try to always be kind, accepting and helpful. I love people, I love to make friendships and show people how much i care but I never get that in return. I don’t really know what’s wrong with me. But this loneliness is eating me alive. I’m thankful for my family, they’re very caring and very loving but I still feel this emptiness all the time. I don’t wish to get that friendship back, I’m still thankful that I got out of it because it ruined me in so many ways, I just wish that I’d find that friend that everybody else seems to find.

But I don’t control it. 

I don’t control my longing for affection or my feelings of self hate and doubt. 

It doesn’t help that I have body image issues and truly feel like no one would date me because I’m a mess of face fat and poor bone structure. I recently got good tongue posture after years of having bad posture but at times it feels like the damage has been done. I hate my weak jawline. 

I hate my nose that curves downward. 

I hate my crooked teeth that I won’t be able to fix for a while. 

I hate my “prey eyes”. 

I can’t even make up for it by being tall because my moms short whereas my dad is tall. It fucking hurts knowing I won’t be able to fix any of this for a while because from what I’ve heard cosmetic surgery can cause growth issues and most doctors wouldn’t do it anyway. I hate feeling like a disease amongst healthy people. 

And it’s not just for dating. 

Physical attraction plays a large role in social prosperity. Attractive people are on average happier, more confident, get jobs easier, get treated better, and are more successful. And I don’t feel socially prosperous. I hate the fact that even though I’m slim I have a lot of face fat for no other reason then my genetics. I hate not being able to talk about any of this with anybody because it just bottles up and let’s itself out here.

3528,northern_shores,1607367585,1,"Willem,
When I met you, you looked like Billie Joe Armstrong and were good at parallel parking.

The moment I saw you walking up that hill at peavey park, I felt intensely nostalgic. I felt like I remembered you, remembered a whole life times of memories about you, I just couldn't put my finger on it.

I thought it was because I liked Green Day as a kid, even when you came over to the park to hang with us for no reason, even when we ended up in a car together trying to parallel park in front of that bulldozer. Even when you let me bum a smoke.

I thought it was a coincidence, even when I'd think about you months later, when I was on the east coast at college.

But then I saw you again, on a whim I flew back home to take advantage of cheap plane tickets. I was walking down the street to get some falafel, and out of the coroner of my eye I saw you in that meth house, through the window.

You looked like shit, but I recognized you.

I didn't hesitate when the junkie with the lip ring  opened the front door for a smoke.

""Yo, is that Willem in there?""

At this point, it couldn't be a coincidence right? That I would spot a person I met once three months ago, through the window of a meth house, on my way to get falafel, and a junkie with a lip ring that lived inside would tell me ""fuck yeah it is, ya can just go inside if you want""

The second time I met you, it broke my heart.
You were skinny as fuck, your arms were covered in scars. Bags under your eyes. But I couldn't say how worried I was, so I said

""You cut your hair""

I don't know if you remembered me, but you got up right away and gave me a hug.

You asked what the fuck I was doing here and I don't remember exactly what I said, it all came out in a rush, you were going to give me a tour of the meth house, show me which on the uncovered mattress on the floor was yours, but for some reason I only saw the kitchen.

I don't remember why, but I left far too quickly, all I remember was looking at your eyes and feeling like I was looking at something really special.

""Hey, if you need anything, a place to crash, a ride, a pack of smokes, whatever, please let me know""

You hugged me again, and it made me wanna cry, I wondered how you felt, were you scared? Did it frighten you to see your body in the mirror every morning? Did the high still comfort you, or was it the magic wearing off?

You hugged me again, I whished for the power to heal through my skin, so I could squeeze you tighter and the pain would go away. 

Maybe I'm just seeing what I wanted to see, but it felt like the bits of you hanging on were reaching out comfort.

Willem, I think about you often, you seemed like such a cool cat, you seemed like you were fucking smart, you seemed like you were really special. 

I don't know your number, I don't know how to find you. All I know is that your out west. Portland? Seattle? Maybe you moved back to Cali with your family. 

Look, I really feel for you. I want you to be okay. If you are fine, fuck it, ignore this bullshit. 
But if you need anything, hit me up. I can't help but feel like I remembered you from the future.",lonely,If your name is Willem,2020-12-08 05:59:45

Now that I am in my late 20s, I feel lonely and have no one to talk too. I talk to my fiancé gamer friends but they are her friends not mine. My fiancé has social media and 2 sisters she can always talk to and friends she texts. But I have no one.

3605,SimpleConversation11,1607323054,1,"I'm 27, ive never had a great social life (though I have a few friends and its honestly the best its ever been in that regards). Despite that I have a lot of loneliness, most of my friends are in a very different life stage then I am, and we have few if any similarities outside a shared hobby. We are supportive and all that but I'm still not getting the connections needed for a healthy life.

I realized this recently when I met someone online. We were talking and we started talking on voice chat and we talked for over 7 hours straight.

7 damn hours. thats insane, 7 hours of doing nothing but talking. in the few weeks we have kept in touch we have talked for 4+ hours multiple times. Frequently staying up so late that I was running on 3 or 4 hours of sleep the next day.

think about that, how starved for connection do you have to be in order to choose an engaging conversation over SLEEP. I mean the conversations are great, but thats just it. Why am I having to go online to find an interesting conversation?

I think its cause I can't be myself around people. I can't let my guard down, or rather I can let my guard down but other people arn't interested in knowing the real me. They want an easy friend to hangout with, not someone who has a shit ton of problems and is dealing with a lot of emotional stuff. So I can bottle that all up throughout my day but in the end I never get the connections I need. Its like I'm dying of starvation and being fed a slice of breed a day as if it was enough to keep me going. Its not.

I don't know how to get to the deeper relationships with people in person. I don't know how to slowly open up and get them to open up. I mean I'm quite sociable, people seem to really enjoy talking with me.

I'm asking this for my girlfriend, since she's been suffering from her existential loneliness since her birth. I am 20 and she's 18. She came from an awful background where nothing around her seems to be right. I questioned if it is existential loneliness, and she confirmed it since she's been feeling it way before all her past, and they only keep intensifying such feelings.

She got physical and mental abuse from her family with no one else in the house can stand out against this. She hardly receives any understandings and respect from any people in her school, classmates or teachers; secret little circles without her will be formed, and slut-shaming. As a result, she often challenge herself that she's the only weirdo, and she's all wrong, as scolded by her family as well. She would still be so upset with the wrongdoings around her.

Things only get better since we met each other. However, she's frustrated to accept love sometimes, and she worries a lot from it eventually pushing me away, just like the feeling of a treasure found but she cannot hold it by her hands. I told her to try to accept the fact that the feeling of loneliness would still pop up from time to time, together, and see what else can be done.

I had always fantasize about the idea of disappearing; just leave everything and everybody behind. 

This feeling of loneliness is overpowering; especially when you see everybody around begin loved. 
It’s so sad that I have to keep inviting strangers in my bed just to feel warm for a couple hours until they leave and all there’s left for me is to repeat the same exact routine. 
I’m spending Christmas by myself and its kinda depressing just to think about it, not because I can’t be with myself 
But because I’ve been with myself alone for so long that it feels agonizing. I don’t have anybody that I can speak about this things or anything really. 
I feel like I just want to be loved and taken care of, I’m tired of begin abuse and used my whole life and i don’t think I want to spend my whole life living like this.

Feeling I was stuck here and that life couldn't go on

I planted a garden on the floor of the abyss with what I had

Quite frankly I got to a point where I don't mind it anymore

I put myself out there again. I thought it wouldn't hurt

But it still did. Being rejected so many times is just eating at my soul

But with the garden I planted in what I once knew as the abyss is looking actually really nice

Regardless of being hurt, I no longer place the entirety of my self value in the hands of those I barely know

It was easy to constantly forget that I have a family. Pets. Friends. And humans who care about my wellbeing

The truth is, no matter how confident someone is, rejection will always hurt a little

But depending on where you place your values

The emotional hangover that comes with it can be significantly shorter

For some reason I seem to stop existing as soon as I am out of sight, because they would leave in a group without me if I didn't make effort to get there before they leave. Only one person even tries to talk to me anymore, who is basically the boss. People going to get food in groups etc I get left out unless this one guy tells me because I told him I feel left out.

3656,shyoneundersun,1607300128,1,"Hi everyone. I hope you're having an ok day. I'm 25 (M) years old and originally from Brooklyn New York. I had a rough child hood (adoption, bullying, etc) and to make a long story short, ended up moving from the east coast the the west. I landed in washington state and have been having an ok time. 

It's really grey here but it's 420 friendly (something I value highly lol) and I'm trying my best to enjoy life with my two partners. I'm poly and have been living with my partner for about a year now. 

Been with my first partner for over 10 years, spanning all the way back to high school. We went to college together and have been moving around together ever since. I met my other partner a while before the pandemic. We worked together and fell in love. I'd had been in a poly relationship before in college, but it didn't end well. This has been a great change of pace really.

So um, I'm a bit stand off ish in person. I have alot of anxiety, and tbh, growing up in brooklyn kindda give you a stone faced approach to everything. People can be mean sometimes. I had a small friend group, but it fell apart as we grew up. I went through some bad times after college ended and really distanced myself from friends and family. Like....move across the country kindda distance lol. 

I had always wanted to live on the west coast. I just imagined it with more friends and meaningful connections. It's hard to do that with covid going on. I guess I'll wrap it up here. Inbox me if you'd like to chat?",lonely,"Bi-coastal and sad, so here's an about me...",2020-12-07 11:15:28
3657,StruttingSwan,1607300041,1,"I've given up on this Subreddit for a few reasons. Here's why you probably should do.

- People complain that they're lonely and miserable, most of the time if you send them a message they take literal days to respond or never do.
- You can suck at texting but that's very different from putting no effort into conversations. For the few who do respond it usually always ends up as an interrogation session. I ask a question and I get one word responses and they show zero interest in anything I have to say. Literally NO ONE wants to talk to force conversation with anyone. It's cringey and it's like pulling teeth.
-Nobody cares about your feelings if you're a guy. I've seen chicks literally just post ""im bored"" as a title with little to no post and it's flocked with simps. A guy can write an actual post that took effort but no one cares because you simps are desperate for crumbs of internet pussy. 

In the end I say you deserve to be lonely because if you are one of those people who post then never respond or expect the other person to be interested in you for being a bland nobody then it's frankly your fault that you're miserable. Relationships are a give and take relationship. If you try and still are lonely then it sucks but you are trying so I cannot fault you. It's almost impossible to actually meet anyone here. It's a cesspool of negatively and a pity party. Work for relationships or continue to cry.",lonely,The truth is most of you deserve to be lonely.,2020-12-07 11:14:01

I keep telling myself that there's just no point thinking about her but every now and then I think of her.

It’s 23:13 and here I am sat up typing to you all, strangers expressing how I feel. 

Let me give you some context -

I’m 28, Male, Single, Work (But currently at home due to Covid) 

I’m just so lonely, I feel that anyone I try to engage with is just replying to me out of pity, I work in sport and live with my team mates but they have all gone home home due to covid. I’ve been alone here for weeks. The team do contact me but like other friend outside of that small circle don’t really seem to be interested. 

It saddens me, I’m on pretty much every dating app, I just want to meet for coffee and walk along the river, just have someone’s attention, and give them mine. 

I feel like I have a lot of fake friends, you know the type who only contact you when they want something or reply because they have to. 

This has been a hard time for me, 

I’ve found myself taking up running something I never used todo, sometimes I just want to run as fast as I can and scream and punch the air. 

I then come back to my small room, sit on the PC and watch YouTube till I find myself watching videos of things I didn’t even know existed. 

The phone never rings 

Family is having some problems, all very negative stuff I don’t want to be involved in as it will pull me down. 

I’m detached from them all due to my work, where I live compared to them. 

I don’t even know what else to say, I just wanted to type how I feel and maybe, just maybe someone has felt like this before and knows a way to help.",lonely,The phone just never rings,2020-12-07 10:23:30

I don't like to bring attention to myself so I don't ever tell anyone that it's my birthday unless if they specifically ask (which no one does). December is a particularly hard month for me in general since I have to get through both Christmas AND my birthday.

So I treated myself to a fancy dinner. Made a reservation online just a couple days prior for just me. When the option came up to select how many people the reservation was for, the lowest option was ""2 people"". I had to write a note detailing that the reservation was specifically for me, nobody else.

I took an Uber there, lied to the driver and said that I was going to visit a friend at a restaurant since I hate the response people normally give me when I do things alone. Dinner was rough, I was surrounded by couples, groups of friends, and was constantly reminded of how I was the only person at the restaurant who was there alone, celebrating my own fucking birthday. But I got through it, I spent an hour there gorging myself, ordering enough food for 2 people, trying not to think about what other people would think if they saw me sitting by myself at a fancy ""date night"" restaurant. 

Yesterday was painful, and I subjected myself to torture, surrounding myself with people who were NOT alone, talking and laughing with others. I'm proud of myself though, because I knew the alternative was to stay in my room the entire day on my birthday (again) which would stir up my depression symptoms even more.

I live alone in a city where I have no friends or boyfriend, and I'm proud of myself for surviving another birthday. Now I just have to get through Christmas.",lonely,"I celebrated my birthday alone (again) yesterday, and I'm proud of myself",2020-12-07 10:21:44

When I was in the sixth grade, I had my parents and my brothers when I came home, but there was almost no mutual person at my school. Now my mom had to take up a job, my dad works night shifts almost the moment I get home from school and my brothers are on the other side of the country for college (I'm not blaming them, they work so incredibly hard and I love them and am so proud). 

Once in class, our entire grade had to say something nice about someone else in the grade. Out of 102, no one said a thing about me. 

The thing is though, when I was younger I was so used to it. I would play with my toys and my imagination had no limits to whoever I was playing with because it was just me. 

I found a diary from the seventh grade and almost every day someone said something to me that made me cry. 

Quarantine was a walk in the park at first. Any texts I received through spring or through summer and now fall are about copying my homework. 

In the hyprid learning and even last year, there are a handful of people that I see in school and talk to but every time I try to get close to them or try to open up they have absolutely no interest.

I miss the sound of your laugh,

the smell of your shampoo,

the way your eyes light up when you’re excited.

I miss talking to you.

I miss the long winding paths our conversations would take,

starting on one topic and moving through countless others while we sipped our tea and the hours flew by.

I miss hearing our children play together,

the sound of their imaginations at work while they created new worlds.

I’ve learned to avoid letting my mind linger on all the memories they’ve missed making together.

I miss hugging you.

ME of all people, who’s gone through life not particularly drawn to physical touch, find myself now desperate for the comfort of a friend’s embrace.

I wish a phone call was the same, 

that a video chat would suffice,

that any of our modern modes of communication would fill the emptiness,

but they won’t.

They can’t.

So I fill the hours and days with books, and shows, and mindless activity, and try not to think about how lonely I am.

And how much I miss you.

3711,BlackRose0605,1607275616,1,"So lately I have been seeing a therapist about my self confidence, and honestly I am extremely blessed and thankful that I have been able to love my traits/personality more. However, my biggest flaw I guess is that I am ALWAYS wanting to have a relationship with someone, I don’t expect perfect, and I don’t want a fairytale, just something raw and vulnerable. My therapist tells me to stop chasing, I will for like 2 weeks and find myself feeling that same emptiness.

That being said as a 20 yr old male, I have found a lot of women my age generally tend to avoid me, even though I do try to strike casual cool conversation, and I am totally willing to be myself. I really do feel it is because of my looks though. I dont think I am really the best looking guy, I dress well and I go to the gym and have an okayish fitness routine, but I am super insecure about my face and thinning hair. 

It has been a hard pill to swallow, I just always feel like I am not good enough regardless of how well I try to have things put together. I have good friends fortunately and they have been supportive, but I still sit here and try to fill this empty void. 

I know a lot of people have it worse, and if any of you ever need encouragement or someone to chat with, I am willing.

I am socially inept too due to being abused my whole life and being from a bad home.

I worry that this guy will find me a loser. He says I’m not and he knows most of my life story so I think he understands why I am like this, but it’s so hard to not think that he thinks that I’m a loser. It just hurts. He makes friends so easily and he’s very well liked. The type of guy that likes going to raves.... we obviously connect because of his other geekier interests.

Something about failing always takes a big toll on me. I take it very personally, and it does affect my mental health. I think for me, failing is just regressing but also letting your friends and family down. In some ways, my failures have become a gateway for my family to belittle my accomplishments and attack my own character, and sometimes it just gets too much to handle.

I'm always afraid to reach out to my friends. I think I still cling on to the past too much, where I'm reminded of the many times I've brought about drama or been a burden to them or have been straight-up annoying. But, there's also this part of me where I want to fight my thoughts and show that I am resilient, but I often end up pushing people away more in the process. And then I feel lonely.

I'm in the process of transferring universities, and that makes me feel even worse. So many people just... dropped me, because I guess it's too inconvenient to stay in contact (even though everyone lives on their phones anyway). I'd be lying if I said I wasn't bitter.

And making new friends right now? It's so, so much harder without living on campus and covid still going on. Relationships are practically impossible. How the hell am I supposed to convince other people to like me? I can't stand myself.

I just want someone to love me. Someone to let me play with their hair and lay in bed with me all day. Hugs, forehead kisses, that kind of thing. I want that so bad and it seems hopelessly unattainable.

3784,m-xt4pe,1607245522,2,"I’ve lived on my own (with my dog) for most of the last 5 years, since I was 17. It’s always been a mixed bag seeing as I greatly value the alone time and personal space, but also desperately crave the company of another human being. That’s just the interpersonal side of things. Financially, living alone and not being able to rent an apartment (I had to move into a rental home because of my dog &amp; weight/breed restrictions) has never been easy. In fact, it’s damn near impossible to afford it given the current economy.

Before the pandemic, I was lucky enough to have in-person classes for school that allowed me to have at least some interaction with others. Occasionally I would see a friend here and there, but after beginning to work from home in October of 2019, seeing other people wasn’t very common to begin with. That was 14 months ago now and I can genuinely say I have never felt lonelier. If the loneliness were the only issue, maybe I wouldn’t feel like I’m about to collapse in on myself. 

Before the pandemic, I started my new job working for a small start-up business which offered me an incredible pay rate and much needed flexibility in schedule by allowing me to work from home. However, the business is now falling apart due to stressors from the pandemic and we’re essentially out of money for payroll. I’ve already fallen behind on rent due to unforeseen expenses a few months ago, do not qualify for unemployment or government assistance, and have maxed out my credit. At this point, I am only a few missed paychecks from homeless and the only jobs available within 45 minutes of me do not pay enough to cover my basic living expenses (literally just rent/utilities, car/gas, and food + toiletries, which somehow comes out to nearly $2000/month). 

I am completely overwhelmed, and while I know I am not alone in feeling this way or dealing with this kind of hardship, I sure as hell feel pretty alone in the world. Sometimes it’s hard not to wish that there were someone who I could call to take my mind off of things, or who could just come sit with me. Sometimes loneliness can be dehumanizing, and I am struggling to see any humanity left in the world anymore. I am disheartened and angry, frustrated and anxious, and honestly just flat out fucking depressed. My trash brain (psych) meds only work well enough now to keep me from being completely incapacitated because cognitively, I am in shambles. 

Part of me just needed to get some of this off of my chest, but also as a reminder: please check in on your friends and family who live alone, especially those that are single. Given the current state of the world, doing things alone is more difficult than ever and having someone to listen can make an invaluable difference.",lonely,Living alone was difficult before everything fell apart,2020-12-06 20:05:22

anyways its starting to hit me. ive never really had a mutual or *real* friendship. before highschool, ive always had friends and even considered some best friends. but now that i think back on it, i realized that it was never really mutual and i was that one always willing to give. wether it was emotional support or just a favor. but that was rarely the case in return. there have always been times where i feel used but i just ignored it because it felt like a one off thing.  

the more i think about it, there has never been anyone who truly cares about me other than my only and older sibling. i know that it should be enough for now since im 18 and still living at home but that's not enough.  i feel like that should be a given since they are family.  

there have only been a few instances where ""friends"" have asked me if im ok but it has always been asked by someone ive been upset with and have a history of being selfish and rude.  

i know that there is probably someone out there who will genuinely care about me, but most things and people seem fake to me to a certain extent. ill admit that im partly to blans because im blunt, dismissive, introverted, apathetic, etc. but ive honestly had enough with worrying about others feelings. i obviously do care about what others think of me too but i just find it extremely hard to be ""nice"" like i used to be. i still do it anyways because its a habit, but im constantly fighting myself over why i decided to help someone when i know they wouldn't for me. 

i just want to be seen, heard, and honestly held by someone. i know ill probably get comments that say ""i see you"" but that just isn't enough for me anymore... online friends telling me they care for me and appreciate me just isn't tangable. sorry if i started sounding like a dick towards the end. im starting to see myself become a shittier person anyways.",lonely,i feel so unwanted more than ever (long),2020-12-06 17:51:35

Every once in awhile the loneliness will really kick in so I’ll try and seek validation from strangers on the internet. It is pretty nice when someone out there makes you feel like you’re worthwhile or you did something well.

Basically I started doing some writing stuff and I was really proud of it so I wanted to post it. Then I get caught up in comparing myself to others and it all gets to me. I don’t know why, I just can’t seem to turn it off. I will admit I get jealous of the people who get a ton of attention for their work. You see people praising them for their amazing talents, but despite the effort you put in it never seems to match up to theirs. Then there are people who could literally make a shit post as an “experiment” to see how many upvotes they get, and of course their low effort post is praised and upvoted like crazy for no discernible reason.

Why am I like this? All I do is ruin things that I like because I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone. I let my jealousy get the better of me and I feel like shit afterwards for denying someone else’s effort.

I’m in my intern year of residency, in a new city. Even though I work at the hospital most of my hours I can’t help but feel this deep sense of loneliness. It hits hard on my days off which I should be enjoying. I’ve made some friends who are co-residents but everyone has their own schedule or not interested in doing something on a day off. I try to pass my time studying medicine and focusing on whatever I can do to become an effective doctor. But it’s hard.

I would like to get some stuff off my chest. I am a smart person in school. The only thing I am not great at is communicating that well. I sometimes don’t know what to say to someone. People see me as a calm and chill person, but I am more than that. I just do not know how to express myself. It is difficult for me!
Another thing is that when someone messages me, I like to think that they want to hang out with me, but they just ask me for homework. I feel used by my classmates that I want to hang out with. This really puts me down.

I'm married and my wife has been dealing with rather severe depression that comes and goes. To help manage her depression and to give her time to work on writing (her new obsession) I am working as the sole income earner. I frequently end up working all day then cooking dinner and watching the kids when I get home, usually so my wife can write, because it genuinely makes her happier. 

She doesn't want to work right now, which I am perfectly fine with, but she also simultaneously feels terrible about not contributing financially, which often exacerbates her depressive feelings. Because of this I can't really talk about finances, or how tiring it can sometimes be to remain positive, or about being burnt out recently from work, unless I want to risk a depressive spiral. I can't even really complain to friends because we share a group of friends. 

And recently all my friends/wife have had a lot to to talk about because of shared media and projects- things I haven't had time for. Whereas for myself, between feeling tired and always working, I don't  have much to say. I just miss human connection.

Through my depression I've pretty much lost all of my former friends, except for one who kind of suffers from depression too, without really aknowledgeing it. He likes to spend most of his time alone, like I do, so it works that we only speak with each other every couple of days or even weeks.

I'm his only real friend, it's the same the other way around.

We have similar characteristics, but I feel like in key parts we differ greatly. I try to talk about my feeling genuinely, trying to say it as it is, while he always sugarcoats until one gets diabetes. For example I often can't sleep because my mind is processing insecurities while he can't sleep because he's ""insecure about how to handle others without *making them* insecure"". 

I've got my guard up, and rarely and with high effort let people get close to me. He has his guard up, aswell as a 10 feet wall with turrets and barbed wires. He never talks about his problems. Neither publicly at work (we once worked together), nor privately with me. He's talkative and can hide his feeling very well behind jokes and rethorical means (dunno how to describe it properly, I'm no english native), and we have that in common. The difference is that I take an effort to open up and be honest about it when it matters while he absolutely can't, under no circumstances.

He had a more troubled childhood than me so I get why it's like that, I just wish he could learn to open up and show weakness once in a while. He's talkative and therefore doesn't get why lots of people still don't feel much sympathy with him, I think it's because people feel sympathetic for someone who can show and handle his weakness, which he can't.

I don't know, I thought about talking with him about that personally but I also don't want to sound like a dick or overcomplicate our somewhat simple friendship. But to be completely honest, it just pisses me off. I open up, tell him about what bothers me and what he does is using the situation to manifest his greatness, like nothing can shake him. Out of his own insecurities, I'm sure, but it doesn't really matter as long as he can't tell me that in person.

Does anyone understand or was in a similar situation? I prolly just gonna have to follow through and talk about it with him. He pisses me off with this scheme a lot but I also don't wanna lose my only friend who accepts my ""depressed lifestyle"".",lonely,I don't like my only friend,2020-12-06 07:06:03

3904,TooMuchAffect,1607177479,1,"So, I’ll preface this with I know I’m being a little petty and should just let it go. My workplace has a “birthday committee”, our entire team chips in $10 a person and we send the person flowers, coffee, and a gift card for their bday. I started this job about a week before quarantine, so I only really know a few of my teammates. I’ve still chipped in for everyone else’s birthday because I had hoped and been told they would do the same for me. Well my birthday came and went and nothing. Like I said, I’m new so I knew it may slip their mind. I had hoped they may at least acknowledge they forgot about it, that would’ve been enough because it did kind of hurt my feelings. We’re in the middle of a pandemic and asking people for donations shouldn’t be taken so lightly, especially when the goal is to make someone feel noticed and cared for. My family has forgotten my bday my whole life, one of my best friends still hasn’t realized she forgot my bday this year, but I thought my new little work family would be a fun place where I could feel a tiny bit celebrated. 

Then to rub salt in it, I got an email Friday asking for donations for someone’s bday that’s on Monday. They mentioned they’re excited to have celebrated everyone’s birthdays this year during quarantine and they’re glad to have been a part of everyone’s special days. I feel so petty even being bothered by this, but I feel like if you’re going to go above and beyond for everyone’s birthdays, you should do your due diligence and make sure everyone is included. It’s not even so much that they forgot my birthday, I just don’t feel like I’m included in our team at all and that really sucked. /endrant",lonely,My Job Celebrated Everyone’s Bday but Mine,2020-12-06 01:11:19

The small touches, and spontaneous hugs have dissipated. Is being with me not what you thought, have I been a let down? Is it the weather? I feel lost &amp; alone. I feel shut out. We used to talk for hours and hold actual conversations. One worded responses are all I receive most days, detail lacking. Im confused. Are you just so comfortable with me that you dont feel the need to make effort anymore? 

Im sorry, I just can't shake the feeling that I've messed up somehow and that there's something I dont know. My needs dont feel met. Something feels lost or missing. Im feeling empty, lonely.

3916,Friggins_,1607165001,1,"I certainly used to feel more connected with people in my environment, but sincd like 6 years I always felt a gap in the background. You know, the feeling that something is missing, like an emptiness. After high school you lose  a lot of friends, and after college the adult life really begins. I got a job in a call center for a limited timespan to just sit and wait for the coronapandemic to be over. I have figured out that deep inside I'm actually terribly insecure and the insecurity combined with the feeling of pressure or social stress is making me less able to enjoy social situations. I'm working on that, but at the same time I feel an urge for companionship. I used to have a female friend and well, I became limerent or obsessed with her. I think because she was very kind and supportive, so she filled the hole I had in my heart. Sadly, I had to break contact for my own good. The girl I mentioned made me feel like someone actually cared for me, and somewhere I forgot she also is a human with flaws. So yeah, that didn't work out.  She used to like me, but I used to be too afraid to make a move and I forever regret thst. I'm still ok with what happened, shit happens. It's just that I wanted to you know, have meaningful (friendly) relationships. I used to put a lot of pressure on myself regarding everything, my expectations etc. I just wish that I had someone to share my life with, but at the same time I know thst I can't sustain a relationship with the way I currently am. I just miss the affection. I do have friends, but the relationship with them is superficial. I know I have to improve. Sadly, I always felt like I had bad luck regarding friends or relationships. I should start caring less about things and more about myself, but it's like a voice that tells you something is wrong. It's like you're hungry, that kind of feeling. So, I'd better listen to myself and stop bullshitting. Sadly, like I said, I just wish that someone saw what's behind everything and not just the superficial shit, I always felt misunderstood. The girl I menrioned earlier wasn't that special, but she gave me the feeling that I actually mattered, that I was not alone in this world and wirh my struggles. I mean,, we all do feel lonely at times. I have my family and friends, but tbey can't fix what's inside of me. I just wished that there was more support. That I did not had to do this alone, that someone carried this burden for me. That might not be the solution, but it would make everything more bear able. And then, I'm laying in bed asking myself why I became so 'desperate'. I don't act on it, but man, I have repressed myself continuesly and stopped expressing myself for quite a while. I jusf want a hug, you know. I mean, just because I am a man does not make me any different, I have feelings and desires too. The coronacrisis exacerbated everything. I hope wherever you guys are that you are doing okay. Loneliness is an awful experience, but it's also part of our existance ofcourse.  I never gave myself the space to actually think about what I want, what things are important tl me. Now, I am left with this ongoing unfulfillment or disstatisfaction and I know I am the only person who can fix this. I just wanted to share my feelings, because no one else seems to bother.",lonely,Loneliness.,2020-12-05 21:43:21

I'm going to break this down best I can. I finished up college right around the time that covid started getting bad and I'm staying with family until a vaccine is out. We are lucky in that we had the savings to do this but I won't pretend its a very fun existence. I'm mainly looking for people I can hangout and chat with, watch tv with, play video games with, whatever!

Important stuff:

I'm looking for people who are at least in their 20's, no disrspect to anyone younger but I'm 27 and I just don't feel like we have much in common.

Bit about me:

I like to try different hobbies out. I'm currently trying to make my own hard cider, I enjoy video games, board games, and I LOVE music. I mostly listen to metal but I listen to a little of everything (and really mean that...billy joel is the bomb).

I like deeper conversations, I like to ask questions, and want to really get to know the other person!

I'm also a big fan of voice chat or even video chat after having gotten to know someone for a while.

The only thing I am not great at is communicating that well. I sometimes don’t know what to say to someone. People see me as a calm and chill person, but I am more than that. I just do not know how to express myself. It is difficult for me!
Another thing is that when someone messages me, I like to think that they want to hang out with me, but they just ask me for homework. I feel used, but I like saying no because I don’t want to seem disrespectful, but then again, that is counterintuitive to how I feel. My father told me, “there are no victims, only volunteers in situations like these.” I want to express myself more and hang out with people but I feel left out. 
I was also rejected by a girl that I thought liked me and that really put me down.

Now she's talking to a guy, even stayed over at his house and slept in his bed and she still keeps going on crying about it and loses all hope when he doesn't text in an hour. But of course I'm supposed to shut up and man up, because we all know guys can't be more lonely am I right? They always try to be as miserable as you, but forget that they had plenty of relationships while I never even kissed a girl. Or this other friend (18 male), when I talk to him about this lonely stuff, he always says stuff like ""yeah, same"" and ""yeah no one ever liked me too"" even tho he had like over 10 relationships and fkd up one of them himself cause he had the need to make out with another girl even tho I told him not to do stuff like this.

No reply, didn't even read the text. At 12.20 I got irritated, so I texted her saying ""thanks a lot for wasting my time."" and went home. I felt like a moron. ""what do the others think? I just came here, sat for 20 minutes and left."" I tought to myself. The next day I wanted to see if she finally came back online on Messenger, but instead of saying anything, she straight up blocked me. Same goes for Discord.

I have given up trying to find a partner, as when I try, something like that happens. I would prefer if she just rejected my offer to hang out instead of ghosting me. That honestly hurt. Mentally I felt terrible sone time before encountering her, but it feels like she added oil to the fire.

Although I was raised Baptist, I've separated myself from organized religion and am very much the black sheep of my conservative, religious family.
My relationship with my toddler's father is strained to say the least and with the pandemic going I'm feeling more isolated and depressed than ever.
Because of my mental health and lack of interest in what most my peers were into I've struggled a lot to make friends in the past. Now that I have a kid I've found it nearly impossible. I think there's something wrong with me, that I'm a bad mom, bad person, stupid, etc. My heart hurts for my kid because I'm not able to establish relationships with other moms and set up future playdates (after the pandemic, which is a whole other issue here. Most of the surrounding community think it's all a hoax, including my parents.)
Today I went to a store and the cashier was nice to me and asked what I was making with my purchases. After I got in my car I cried because it was just so nice that someone was interested in my life and spoke kindly to me.
I'm 30, basically laid off, can't afford a therapist, and now I think I may be spiraling into a depression.

It reminds me of how lonely I am, when my family invite me places and that’s it. A have one friend but she’s at university with friends who are more outgoing like her, friends who aren’t like me.

I have nobody to call, nobody to hang out with other than family. I could meet my friend but I can’t due to coronavirus and even then we don’t have much in common. I hold onto our friendship, I know that we will one day stop being friends due to the fact that school friends rarely stay friends. But, if I don’t call her a friend I’ll have to admit that I don’t really have any.

I just want someone to call so I can ask them about their day. I want to ask someone to hang out and later on in the evening we do, because we like each other’s company. I just want someone. I can’t deal with being around my family everyday, I’m so lonely and I know that it won’t always be like this but it feels like it’s been a lifetime.

It’s nice to speak to people online, but when I get used to talking to people they drift away. Then, I feel more lonely as I have to get used to talking to no one again.  

Whether it’s a relationship or a friendship, I just want someone. I want to make someone else happy, see them smile. Yes, I don’t want to be lonely anymore but I want a friend in a selfless way as well.

This 6 years have been full of depression (for different reasons) episodes that I have taken care of with 2 partial hospitalizations (2014, 2017) and 1 full hospitalization (2018) in a psych ward.

As of this moment of my life, I completed a B.A. in Public Relations and Advertising(2018) and I'm currently in my second year at Law School (2022 hopefully). I feel like this 6 years have passed by so fast and my best days are left behind. I really didn't make any friends in undergrad (just some acquaintances) because I was battling with depression episodes and Law School has been the same. No parties, no memories NOTHING. I've been working to be a productive/responsible professional. I get good grades, pay for my school and I've never been in any sort of legal/drug problem.

4024,HeyHeyHaster,1607103744,1,"I just discovered this subreddit and this will be my first post. It’s gonna be a long bumpy ride so buckle in.

I want to make this post to hopefully help those who are lonely, become no longer alone. I want to make this for those of you to compare my story to yours and see if you can learn from it and try to meet the type of people you want to interact with and learn yourself.

I have social anxiety and my vocabulary is not that good. I couldn’t talk properly till the 3rd grade.  (M) and I have been learning myself in the past great year of 2020. 

So let’s back track to when I first entered high school (In my junior year now). I had very little friends. Majority of the kids in my school I was not a fan of (still the same way to this day). Most my classes I never talked unless the teacher called on me. I was put in classes with the most annoying and immature kids I have ever met. I never hung out with anyone because they weren’t my type of people and they were all very rude. All I ever wanted to do was get through my high school years and move on in life. With all the negativity kids had and always tried to make each other mad or get in trouble by vaping in the bathrooms, it effected me and made me very negative and question the ones I was actually some what close to. The very little friends I had were very nice and welcoming and always helpful for each other. I always love to help friends/family with anything and just being kind to each other.

During my sophomore year and hearing and being told very terrible things, it made it hard for me to trust my friends that they won’t break my back when I have theirs. I never really took the things other people took seriously but it made me think that my high school friends would become the same way and I was wasting my time. It made me think I should just forget about them and wait till I start working and meet people (which I believe would be better than high school because people are more mature by then and don’t care to seem better or just dumb things high schoolers think). I had many opportunities to contact with my friends outside of school but I declined, thinking it would be the best option for myself and my future. Months later covid hits (hey covid, how are you? What you plan on doing for 2021 eh?) 

In a weird way I think covid is what made me realize what I should look for and what I have missed out on.

In April of this year I should have taken my permit test but was delayed due to covid. During the beginning of lockdown, I was so excited because number 1, I hated school (still do, they don’t teach me how to grow up and be an adult and do adult things, just geometry, chemistry, and world war 1 and 2 for the one hundredth time!) and 2, I don’t have to be with negative, annoying high schoolers. While that part is amazing still to this day, later on around June and July I started thinking about something missing but thought I was being dumb. Later on in about Sept. and Oct. I realized, I missed my good friends and I was alone.

Here is the thing, I am lucky enough to not be completely alone as I have my family, my parents (who are divorced but happy so I am happy for them), younger siblings, (I am the oldest child) and I have gotten to meet my mothers boyfriend and his kids and my fathers girlfriend.

Now you may be thinking number 1, why are you posting here if you are not alone, I will get to that in a moment. Number 2, just why? Because I want to help those who are alone and see from my mistakes, which will allow you to see what you did and what you can do to fix it and start a new.

I am not exactly alone but I feel lonely. Why? I feel lonely because I have no one to interact with who are my age. I have met people and are friends with people younger and older, whatever race and gender and believes and everything else (as long as your a nice and caring person, you are cool with me) but, when you don’t have someone to talk to close to your age and has experienced the same things as you and are going through the same things as you, then it can get lonely. I have been thinking that I missed my opportunity with great friends but got rid of them from my life from my younger believes and my negative self from all the toxicity from high school.

It has been a long few months but now I am getting excited. Why? Well in January, I can take my drivers test. After I take and pass my test wether with many fails or not, I can then get my drivers license which then allows me to travel, which allows me to work. Why do I want to work? I want to learn how to do things, who I am, interact with people, (even though I am not good with my vocabulary and very very very shy,) just learn basic things humans do, both as in financially and interacting with others. I am hoping to meet some people my age to talk to outside of work or where ever we meet.

Now that you have read my story I want you to think why you are lonely and what you can do to prevent being alone forever and meet the ones you are meant to be with, whether friends or dating wise. It is not easy but sometimes you just have to put yourself out there to find what you are looking for or even to find out what you want to look for. I understand everyone has there own problems and with covid it’s even harder now. 

Here are some suggestions to meet people:

Get a job somewhere where people are always getting hired. Go somewhere you enjoy and share the same interest has others like: fishing, a park, the beach, many places to meet people.

It may not always be easy and it can be very stressful sometimes (stresses me out) but honestly if you just say hello and work the conversation from there, no matter how worried you are and how much you are struggling to talk, at least you will get experience and learn how to chat with people and learn how to make friends and what makes you stand out.

I am saying all this and I have not even done these things myself but I am gonna change that very soon. 

Find the type of people you enjoy and learn from past conversations. The worst that will happen is that person doesn’t want to talk to you and leaves, they just missed out on a good friend.

If you think about it there are lots and lots of lonely people out there so just talk to them. Even on this subreddit. We all share the same thing together, loneliness. Try to find posts on this subreddit and reach out to other users. It may be different since it’s online but you can still make great connections (pun not intended, i am so funny right? No) with people and learn from them to meet others until you are finally happy with the people you are with and the amount of people you are with.

I really hope this helped. Sorry it was a long post for those that read it all (clap it out for yourself, you should get a medal) I just wanted to help you guys out with what I experienced and you can look back on yourself and learn who you are and what you want and how you are gonna get what you want. Just stay positive and know lots of people are looking for people to be with, both as in friends and dating wise.

Please comment if this helped. Comment if I could improve on in the writing (I know there are probably a lot but I just wanted to put this out there quickly.) if you need help, message me or talk to other users on this subreddit. Interacting with each other could help all of us be more positive and excited to meet people outside of our home.

Back when I went to church, I would often find myself getting sick. I would feel lightheaded, my nose would get clogged, and I would find myself sneezing. At the end of service my symptoms, similar to the words of the pastor, would disappear and become forgotten. Maybe it was a sign that I was unwanted. 

I had this friend, her name was Samantha, and she was my best friend. We were friends for nearly 5 years and she was the only person who I would hangout with outside of school. However, during our sophomore year of high school, we both became busy and eventually started drifting apart. 

Growing up, I always had a difficult time making friends. I wanted to make friends, but I was very focused on school and back then, I actually believed I was going to amount to something and makes my parents satisfied with me. When our friendship ended, I wasn't aware of it at first. At the time we went to different schools, and I was so stressed out and lonely there I didn't know what to do with myself, but get good grades and count down the time I had left. But over time although I don't entirely miss her, truthfully I've forgotten most of our friendship, I miss having someone to joke around with. 

She was someone I envy as well, because she was a social butterfly and a bit of a narc who thought the world was going to cave in on top of her. Whenever we had plans to hangout and we had to cancel because of the weather, it would upset me knowing she was going to hangout with someone later that day or the day after. I wasn't upset that she was hanging out with other people, but more so I didn't have her ability to make friends the way she could. Having multiple options sounds fun.

My mind and thoughts are just everywhere right now. I feel lonely. I have a problem of letting my feelings manifest themselves too much into my life and performance. I used to feel so smart too, but now I cry at every problem that reaches my feet.

The moments I do get to talk it’s just a quick conversation with a clerk at the grocery store or the post office. I went to the dentist yesterday after not seeing anyone for 9 days, my throat literally hurt to speak.

I wouldn’t have chosen to live outside of town by myself. I wouldn’t have chosen to live in a big old bedroom house by myself. I bought this house for my previous boyfriend and I. He agreed he wanted to start a family. I had enough money to put a down payment on a house suitable for kids so I did. But he woke up one morning and decided he no longer wanted kids, packed his things and left. 

I spent a lot of time by myself even when I was living with my boyfriend but it was nice to have someone to eat dinner with, talk about things with and not feel lonely. 

I have no friends. I haven’t made a friend since high school, I’m 26. 

I don’t know what to. I love my house. Maybe I have to move.",lonely,I go weeks without talking out loud.,2020-12-05 01:57:22

4042,hiddenspliff,1607090043,1,"If I offed myself, it would take at least a month before anyone would realise I'm gone.

I would probably have people i knew who'd rock up to my funeral to pay tributes but they wouldnt have really talked to me regularly anymore. Probably only make attendance to show face, they wouldn't have talked to me if I stayed alive. I wasn't really worth anyones time.

I don't have anyone who'd miss me aside from mum and my grand parents. Mum would be so upset. My sister wouldn't feel much, she doesn't even let me see our dog anymore, my dad in hong kong would feel sad.

All my stuff would go to waste, my semi successful music career, my hard earned life knowledge in architecture and construction, my life experience in music, my still early dj career. My love for being creative..

I want to off myself because I have no one to be real life mates with. I'm socially inadequate. I don't bring good vibes anymore. 

I've run out of people to look forward to being close with.

I want to disappear but i cant be so selfish to waste my mothers hard work.

I want to be free of feeling this pain of missing out of having company i enjoy.

4044,Tinenos,1607088765,1,"Been in this relationship with a good girl, one that I was proud to tell others about, one who made me feel like they'd always be there, one that I would do anything for. 

Endlessly complimented her, as she did me. Kept her company 24/7, gave up sleep to spend with her, lost a few friends on the way just to be with her. It was a relationship that I was committed to, and we never had even one disagree or fight. This girl at first wouldn't even leave alone to go to the bathroom one second. She was stamped into my head, I say her name at least three times a day in my head. We started out as friends, I've known this girl for 6 years, moved into a relationship of which we have been together since April 2015 and we really did love each other. So I am in this relationship at least 5 years, have her as my top priority to take care of when she has bad days, give my full attention to, watch/play what ever, to just suddenly....a relationship that I thought would have no expiration date....suddenly, since early September of this year, she has with out explanation, closure, or reply multiple texts/emails/calls is just gone. Maybe she ghosted me for what ever reason. Maybe she got covid of which I hope she didn't, &amp; that she is healthy/ok. The last thing I remember her saying was that she was having phone issues - but. She has been having phone issues all year, even when her phone decided to stop working earlier this year, she made sure to keep in contact immediately over email until it started to work again. So this is not like her to disappear. 

I don't see her coming back, and I don't know why. All I wanted to say to all is that this lack of closure can really hurt and that if you ever feeling a way to an extent that you just don't wanna be involved with someone don't do what she did. Its wrong, unhealthy for that other person, and its so weak...like say something, don't do that. Rather cry for a day or two, than cry every day not knowing what has happened, going crazy with my mood shifting from sad to angry to feeling insignificant. My whole life I been happy, when I first met this girl she was depressed for reasons I won't share, they were reasons enough. Of which at the time I pampered her and cheered her up to an extent that I made sure she was smiling every day from the day we connected. Now for the first time in my life, I feel utterly disgusted, depressed, fragile, and lost. Been together since I was just turning 19. I am now 24, going on 25 and she is all I ever known...I put all my eggs in one basket, and I never saw this coming. My life went from the top of the world, to the gutter. \*aside\* (We never been on reddit before but if you know this is you...for what ever reason you'd be here, just call to say goodbye so I can rest knowing you are okay.)",lonely,She's just gone,2020-12-05 00:32:45

It’s 11:05 pm, I’m getting ready for bed. Just staring at my Xbox’s home screen, then I scroll through my friend’s list. (I appear offline all the time, my internet won’t let me talk to anyone so I don’t want them to invite me to something and have to say no) I see my old best friend, call him Dill, is on. I was excommunicated from him by his parents. They said I was a bad influence, and I guess that was just because me and Dill were both deconverting from Christianity together and bouncing ideas off each other and finding solidarity with each other. We were like the only ones we knew who were atheists. But yeah, his parents were dipshits and thought hurting me for sure (and maybe hurting him, I can’t know for sure) would stop him from thinking. Anyways, Dill was online, and in a party. My controller occasionally double clicks A so it’s risky to check who’s in the party cuz I might accidentally join it, but I always do it anyways. I just want so badly to be in that party, talking to Dill like we used to. He has a new friend now that he’s always playing with. I guess he replaced me, but I never could replace him. I don’t know how to feel. Good for Dill, angry at him, hurt, sad for me... idk. In any case, I’m glad he isn’t quite as alone as I am. Maybe he’s happier... Well, anyway, another old friend was in the party, and he was playing something Dill wasn’t, Minecraft. On our old realm, back when I had a friend group... And even though I was appearing offline, he invited me! Tbh I never liked this old mutual friend of mine and Dill’s that much and we weren’t close, but he’s a good guy and pretty fun. I didn’t want to talk to anyone, it’s almost easier sometimes to stay alone when you’re this lonely. But I pushed myself and accepted. Like I mentioned, my internet is shit and won’t let me play online, but I foolishly let my hopes get up and started planning how I’d say hi, if I’d talk or use text chat, anticipated what he might say. Then the infinite loading screen I’m so used to happened, and it never connected, leaving me with a pit in my stomach and the lonely music of Minecraft menus playing in my ears. I’ve never felt so strongly what that music was supposed to evoke, just pure and utter solitude, without hope of ever being near another human. It was transcendental and beautiful, in a way, even though it hurt me so badly.

I wanted, I had hoped, that our old mutual friend would tell Dill I joined and he would drop his multiplayer game and come see me and we’d talk and catch up and things would be good again. I was a fool, and I shouldn’t have hoped. Hope just makes coping that much harder.

I wanted to let Dill know I got him a present too. We’re fileshared, and I knew I couldn’t actually buy him anything because of his batshit parents, but if I bought a game on XBL he would get it too. It would even start downloading when I downloaded it, unless he turned off that setting. So I got Doom 2016 and Doom: Eternal cuz I love the series and he did too, and were cheap enough on Black Friday, plus I figured his parents would never let a game with satanic imagery in there house willingly, so maybe this would work. Idk if he even knows he has it. I wanted to tell him, but I know I can’t. I miss him so much... God, I just wish I could talk to him

Idk, I guess writing that helped. Moral of the story is Minecraft music is seriously bad for your health if you’re lonely, do not listen to it alone, it hurts!

(Also I’m still lonely af rn, but also tired af. I’m just gonna go to bed. But if anyone wants a Minecraft buddy who’s ok-ish at the game but has shit internet, hmu in dm’s. Realistically, as long as your NAT is Open and we play around 8-12 pm central time, it should be decent and playable. Idfk, just thought I’d offer that if anyone needs someone to talk to.

I straight up feel guilty for asking my best friend to pick me up after a surgery under general anaesthesia. 

I’m upset because if he was in my shoes, I would have offered to drive him to the hospital, stay with him until he goes to surgery, then leave for a couple hours (length of the surgery) and come back later for him not to be alone when he would wake up and drive him back home. Not just pick him up : be there to support. I guess it’s too much to ask for when it comes to me and that’s very disappointing...

I'm sitting outside in the cold, on my own. There's a bittersweetness to the feeling.

Do you ever feel like you're drowning.

Like the world around you if an ocean of problems in the middle of a storm, and you're trying to survive it in a tiny dingy boat.

That's me, all the time.

And my issue is, I HAVE PEOPLE I COULD TALK TO

Just last night, my mum tried to talk to me about how I was feeling. Because recently I've seemed a 'bit flat'.

And instead of sitting down with her and telling her about how I constantly feel like I'm not good enough, or how I turn to food to eat my feelings because I crave the happy endorphins that rush to my brain every time I make a mug cake, or eat a full Battenberg, or a giant bar of Cadburys by myself.

I'm disgusting...I know. My eating habits aren't healthy but that doesn't stop me.

And that's what scares me the most. If knowing something is bad for me doesn't stop me... what will?

What does will it take for me to finally stop myself walking into a shop and buying packets of sweets?

A breakup? No. I've spent nearly a year believing I was cheated on (a story for another day) and all I did was eat even more. To supress the flood of emotions I had.

Losing someone? No. I lost my grandad last year and I still kept eating... I didn't even think about it... it was a natural reaction

So what? What will it take for me to finally stop and think before I eat my weight in food?

Today I saw him comment on a friend's social media post being super sweet and supportive and the reply was all ""omg you're so amazing"" (this was not a sexual/romantic conversation - the girl he was talking to is not into men) and it made me feel super gross about myself and like there was something severely wrong with me if I can be this hurt by a person and yet they treat other people so well that they get these public declarations of love, even when other people know the things they've done and how they've treated people.   


I had to cut most of my social circle off to get away from him, and because I realised after that all happened that basically nobody was in my corner and now I feel so lonely. It's so easy to feel like I must have been the problem if all these people are able to coexist together and support each other and while I was able to be part of the group, I was never completely accepted into that dynamic, and it was so easy for everyone to just cast me out once this guy deemed me ""unacceptable"".

&amp;#x200B;

It's just a very shitty feeling knowing that not only did the person you were dating who you put your trust in hurt you in a really gross way, but nobody in your social circle cares that it happened because your feelings were never really that important. These people all get to feel loved and supported by each other, and I have had the worst year of my life and I've had to go through it entirely alone.   


I know it's better to feel lonely and alone than live in a situation like that where friendships are about social status and social politics rather than genuine connection, but the loneliness makes me feel like I made a mistake and I should have just tolerated and accepted that crappy treatment so I could have kept the illusion going. The longing also makes me romanticise it all and see it as ""look at these people and their great friendships  that I'm not a part of"" despite knowing half of them have talked shit about each other behind their backs. With the way things are in the world right now I'm unable to really form new friendships or meet new people and losing an entire group of people I genuinely thought cared about me all in one week makes me terrified to ever trust anyone again.

The things that felt so natural to me, that truly made me feel comfortable with myself were the subject of scorn and ridicule. “Boys don’t do that, be a man!” they’d say.

Societal norms labeled my emotional and delicate personality as “feminine” or “homosexual”. The searing heat of embarrassment felt intense, all because I had hobbies like sewing or baking or obsessed over my looks.  I felt like I didn’t belong, that my desire for true friendships built on love and caring simply turned away others. 

Self-loathing slowly creeped into my heartbroken and lonely soul, branding painful fears. Would I truly have been better off as a girl; was I trapped in this cursed body?

I recently had a world of shit dumped on me on top of everything else - ended an engagement, took over full rent/bills, working remote, and my health just took a nosedive. I’m normally a very healthy, very active, “typical” California beach and hike loving girl... but I’m basically now trying to figure out all these things going on with my body which decided to just pop up all at once (doctors are thinking it’s autoimmune but not sure what and have been going to many different people for about 3 months)...Chronic fatigue. Hair loss. Eczema. Fluctuating hormones/thyroid... again blah blah blah. I came back to my parents house in another state and it sucks, and I miss my life...but... BUT.

I may not be the closest with them, but my heart truly breaks from reading these posts by you guys saying you have no one. We’re humans and we need and crave connection.

No, you’re not bad, or there’s nothing wrong with you. A lot of us are just searching for the same thing - connection, validation, comfort... remember to love yourself and don’t be too hard on yourself. If people don’t like you or don’t want to be friends with you, fuck em. Be true to yourself, don’t change who you are to try to mold into something that you think people will like more. I know SO MANY people who do this and their friendships are superficial.

4154,BerkBork,1606969329,1,"25M first time posting something personal on here and am mostly doing it because I really don't have anyone to talk to. I've isolated myself from my family, moved to a new state where the only people I know and speak to are my wife's family.

I've been unhappy since I can remember. 

I've been miserable my whole life. Incapable of being happy no matter how hard I try.
Depressed through most of my teenage life.
Was a loner most of high-school and anti social.
I had 2 friends but didn't really spend much time with them besides lunch time.
I had strict overbearing parents who wouldn't let play outside and who liked to control all aspects of my life.
A father who was an alcoholic and a mother who rarely showed affection.
When I graduated from high school I joined the national guard.
After some time I was fortunate enough to meet someone and get married.
She made feel happy like I never had felt before. But over time I went back to being miserable. 
And in doing so I also made her miserable.
She finally asked me to divorce her and I agreed because she deserves better. Im anti social and have made her as miserable as I am. She used to be so bubbly and positive. But now all i see is anger behind her eyes. And I never knew how to fix it..
And the worst part is that we have 2 beautiful twin girls (age 2).
So now I have 2 other little people I'm scared to poison with my bullshit.
I feel like I sabotage myself. 
I moved to this state (OH) 3 years ago to save my marriage and I ruined it again.
In these 3 years I've managed to make no new friends or acquaintances. 
And I'm scared to start alone from scratch again.
I don't know how to approach new people.
Or even start a conversation.

My wife says I turn everything into a joke. That I can't take anything seriously. Its how I cope with stressful situations and I've known this for a long time. But I had no idea that in doing so that I was hurting her feelings.
I hate how I am. Who I am. And have no idea on how to fix myself.
I feel awful and ashamed for what my wife has had to put up with.
And I'm tired of living life the way I have.
I can't seem to enjoy anything.  
And at this point the only happiness I feel is when I'm with my kids. 
The only redeeming quality is that I'm a good dad. Or at least I think I am.
I'm currently seeking professional help to try to find what is wrong with me. 
I HATE that I pushed away someone I cared about and neglected.
She was so patient with me and was always a good wife.
And I hate myself for making her feel the same way I do.
It seems like I make everyone miserable.
I hardly go outside.
I don't socialize.
And assume everyone is out to get something.
I see the worst in everything.
And am generally just upset.
I don't know if I was just born broken. Incapable of being happy...
And at this point I don't feel like I deserve to.

I don't know what I'm going to do for myself.

I don't think I will ever find someone who can love me for who I am. And I'm afraid of doing the same thing to someone else..

But he followed it up with “Anyways, there’s some girl he likes, I’m hoping once he gets laid he’ll grow out of all that.” And all of his friends laughed and agreed and mentioned how their children all “got better” after being in relationships.

I'm a third year college student studying in an international university in Germany.
I'm a typical second generation expat TCK which also means I never got to keep friends for more than 3-4years. I have a hard time finding someone to open up to because I'm afraid I'll have to detatch from the people *again*, as I've done three times already.
I've been taken for the last 3 years with three different relationships. There were not much time inbetween the three relationships because 1) its pretty complicated 2)im a hoe

So after all those times where I had someone else to love me for me, when I became single a few months ago I had no clue what to do. I never had to love myself ever since I knew what/how romantic love is. Now the joke's on me. Well, I wouldn't go so far as to suggest its karma, but some parts of my brain seems to agree.

Anyways, another problem is that I rarely see genuine people around me. Even people the I trusted the most and the closest friends turned out to be these.... People that are busy merely wanting simple attention from others. People that are selfish and shameless. People that are so calculative.

All these relationships and experiences just seems like it's making me lonelier and bitter. It's such a cruel thing people do all the time. They become friends with you because you have something they want. It doesn't necessarily have to be some object. It could be location, niceness, money, whatever. And when they see another target or get enough of what they wanted, they just leave. No more visits, no more texts, no more looks, words, attention... Nothing.

It started out as some simple simp stuff, subbing to her OnlyFans and such. Paying to talk with her on the phone. As we grew closer we started to talk privately- no cost. After a few months of going on like this, I was so happy with our arrangement. I knew I’d never be her priority. Never mean as much to her as she did to me. But what I had was the world to me. Idk what happened, but suddenly talking with her, I mean really talking, became so rare. Now she won’t even make time for me on those paid platforms. I literally can’t pay her to talk to me anymore.

I'm just a lonely like most of you guys and I want to be your online girl. I want to be there for you, keep you company and really care for you. 

I don't want anything in return, neither your money nor your personal information. I only ask that you are of legal age.

But there's a problem, I'm not a girl (not even a transgender girl). However, I want you to imagine that I'm. We would just chat and if you want we can also play something together. 

I know a lot of you imagine fake relationships (I speak from my own experience lol). At least with me, your girl would have her own will. 

And probably you don't want to do that cause you are not into guys. But I think it would be like if you were into a character written by a guy, not me exactly. 

I don't know exactly how it will work and maybe it's a terrible idea. But I want to try if someone is willing.

Even after being put under lockdown and rejected, I still did my best to keep my head over the water, I kept striving for improvement, but now my best friend whomst I've talked with for 3 years cut all ties with me, her reason being that she did not want to feel too bad from talking to online friends whom she'll probably never meet anyways, I had plans to go and meet her, but it didn't do anything. 

I just did what anyone caring enough would do, I didn't argue with her choice, just wished her the best of luck, and wished for her to be well and to do the best she could in every field. What a badass way to stop talking, huh?

&amp;#x200B;

And now here I am, shaking, realizing that I lost the person I cared for the most on this whole damn planet, with no one else to talk with, with no one else to laugh with. I had dreams were we met, and I was crying from joy while sleeping, now I will only cry from the sadness whenever I think about it. Deep down, I did not want her to go, but this was for the best, I should not contest anyone's choices and resolves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now everything I want is to find a loving and caring partner to hug me every second of my life, I want to feel loved and to love in return, I won't let this destroy me again, everything I want is to become an even better person, I shoudln't give up on anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

But even though I say all that, I still fear that I was the problem, that she actually only stopped talking with me, and no one else, even though that doesn't quite sound like her, I am scared that I did the wrong choices at some point, and even if I cannot change it, I still hope that someday, I will meet her and tell her thank you.

I have Autism Spectrum Disorder which is a blessing of sorts but it can be a curse when it comes to making any kind of meaningful connections, most of the time I just feel like a literal alien in social situations, as though I’m on the wrong planet.

4230,the-nowhere-girl,1606920597,1," Do you ever feel like you're drowning.

Like the world around you if an ocean of problems in the middle of a storm, and you're trying to survive it in a tiny dingy boat.

That's me, all the time.

And my issue is, I HAVE PEOPLE I COULD TALK TO

Just last night, my mum tried to talk to me about how I was feeling. Because recently I've seemed a 'bit flat'.

And instead of sitting down with her and telling her about how I constantly feel like I'm not good enough, or how I turn to food to eat my feelings because I crave the happy endorphins that rush to my brain every time I make a mug cake, or eat a full Battenberg, or a giant bar of Cadburys by myself.

I'm disgusting...I know. My eating habits aren't healthy but that doesn't stop me.

And that's what scares me the most. If knowing something is bad for me doesn't stop me... what will?

What does will it take for me to finally stop myself walking into a shop and buying packets of sweets?

A breakup? No. I've spent nearly a year believing I was cheated on (a story for another day) and all I did was eat even more. To supress the flood of emotions I had.

Losing someone? No. I lost my grandad last year and I still kept eating... I didn't even think about it... it was a natural reaction

So what? What will it take for me to finally stop and think before I eat my weight in food?

If you're reading this, you don't know me yet. Maybe you're hoping you will eventually, but the chance of that are tiny.

My name is Angel Becersy.

That's not my real name of course, but I like it, so we'll go with it.

I live somewhere and nowhere all at once.

Because I'm invisible.

I don't want to be invisible, I just am. I was born to be an enigma.

I could disappear off the face of the earth and nobody would really notice.

I started this so I'd have a legacy...

Legacy, what is a legacy?

Haha if you haven't watched or listened to Hamilton you won't get that.

But I want to be remembered. I don't want to disappear. I want to stand out.

So here I am... **THE FRONT PAGE OF THE INTERNET**

So I guess... welcome to Nowhereville...

In my last relationship I did not but of course it failed to last because I got so depended and clingy that she broke up with me. 

Now since I'm alone I actually managed to make some friends - I see people 2-3 times a week even.

But the lonely isn't going away. I even open myself up. Talk about my depression - sometimes have good meaningful discussions. It feels like a bond has been made.

But still .. lonely. Sometimes even in company. But mainly once I'm alone. When I wake up in the morning to sit on my PC for 8h. When work is over and I .. cook for myself. When I have friends over and the door closes behind them.

I'm working so hard, I try to meditate, read, do yoga, sport, go for walks, try new stuff sometimes, cook for myself, try to be more disciplined at work, .. but in the end it just won't get better.

Will it eventually? I installed Tinder but realized that will probably not be ""the solution"" so I deleted it again. But I want someone close to me. I have dependency for ..someone..

When I'm really sad I'm just lying in bed crying, looking at photos of me and my ex. But denying myself to meet someone new because I know I will just lose her again once I become too clingy.

4283,Cyntical,1606885430,1,"I've been lonely my whole life. You wouldn't notice it by looking at me or by talking to me, which is quite strange considering all the things I've gone through. 

Recently, I've tried to think just what caused the unbearable loneliness that I'm experiencing. Perhaps when I couldn't get any friends in kindergarten, or maybe when my father decided to jump under that train, or perhaps it was already predetermined when my grandpa shot himself with that shotgun behind the barn. I guess pondering it now is useless right, as if I could change the past.

In elementary and middle school I was the upbeat, loud kid, who always got into fights with others. I was still very kind hearted, I never ever swore and I loved nature. Sadly I wasn't strong and because of this I got beat up quite a lot, I also apparently wasn't very smart either, seeing as I just kept on fighting, knowing full well I wouldn't win. Thinking back, the reason I was so eager to fight others was because I was jealous. The teachers saw me as a nuisance, and took every opportunity they got to seperate me from everyone. I had a couple of ""friends"" at the time, we didn't see each other much, but the few encounters I remember involved me getting robbed or me getting bullied. I really was naive back then.

At the end of middle school I experienced an event which caused me to destroy my own personality. I had been living in a new neighborhood for a year. And during this year the bullying had gotten pretty relentless, I remember how I sat during recess behind the school, where no one could see me. I was the new kid, and I was seen as an easy target. Despite this, I actually managed to do well for the last couple of months, I even got a ""friend"" to be with. Let's call this ""friend"" O, it's important later. My class had a group chat, in this group chat I had seen messages that everyone in class was gathering on the school yard in the evening. It was the day before graduation, so they wanted to celebrate it on their free time. I was excited to join as well, but when they saw me running towards then, they got off on their bikes. I was confused and chased them a bit, but they clearly appeared to be avoiding me. This did get me quite annoyed, and when they decided to stop, they told me it was because they didn't consider me to be part of the class. That really pissed me off, and I tried to pick a fight with one of them. I quickly realized it wasn't a good idea, but they already saw me as a threat. They instantly started throwing insults at me and I started to walk away. They circled me and walked all around me, constantly yelling at me. One of them kept throwing a basketball to my back. I was crying the whole way home until they decided to stay back. They even blamed me for the event, that they would call my mother about it. After that I completely dropped the gentle personality, and became more bitter. ""Friend"" O wasn't present at the event. 

During the summer before highschool I got to know ""friend"" O better, but that joy didn't last long, because when highschool started he became distant towards me. He even got straight up aggressive with me, and started making rude comments of me and my family. He searched the internet for photos of me or my mother and defiled them with pornographic edits. After this I stopped being his friend. It was around this time when I started to understand just how to get the bullying to stop, and it did slowly start to fade away.

At 16 years old, I moved out. Since then I have lived alone. This was when loneliness really started to consume me. Since moving out I've had one friend, who doesn't really care about me. We never meet each other. I talk with him as much as I can, and I ask him to hang out with me all the time, but he really isn't interested. And that's how it's been for the last 3 years. Just me waking up, going to school, doing all sorts of stuff around the house and going to sleep. For the past 3 years I haven't really talked outside of school with anyone, and I've noticed some pretty weird things happening. For one, panic attacks have started to appear randomly, I also sometimes just cry for hours. Scary is, that I'll sometimes realize that I've been talking to myself for hours. School performance has also gone to absolute shit. I really have been at a loss. I've been incredibly tired and sad for a while now, it really would be nice to have someone to talk to. I probably shouldn't expect much though, it's not like there's ever been any person that cared so far.

School and college have been socially hard for me, and I’ve never had a group of friends. I know people and say hi to them when they see me but beyond that I don’t have any solid friendships or anything like that. To been a struggle due to learning disabilities. I tried to get involved in a couple different things earlier this year before the pandemic hit and just like that I was back to doing nothing. Before that, I was obsessed with an online relationship and earlier this year I found out a bunch of stuff after 4 years and I am still angry about it (partly because I chose to ghost him and not say anything about my leaving). But during that time I fed my mind fantasies in place of a real relationship to make up for the fact it wasn’t in person, so I isolated myself by choice.

And.....I just didn't do anything, getting close to them made my heart race, my stomach sink and became a fluttery mess. This eventually ended as someone else got there instead.

I now work from home. Moved out of my parent’s house because they were acting like lunatics and I live alone. 2-3 months into the relationship my girlfriend cheated on me with her kid’s father. I tried to carry  on the relationship for 2 more months but eventually ended it because I didn’t trust her. I also began to hate her for previously lying to me and myself for taking her back. 

So now I’m completely alone. I never had any friends, I’m back to my normal state of being single, I’m basically estranged from my parents and the only time that I see other people is when I’m at the drive through or grocery shopping.

4338,Maobie64,1606849920,1,"Bit of a rant incoming. So last month I started watching DisguisedToast play Among Us with his friend group. Originally I haven't watched any other groups play besides the Yogscast and thought Toast's videos were better. I tried watching other videos from other groups and to me Toast's were just the best. It felt like every round displayed everyone was actively trying to win (I have seen a couple where they were doing things for jokes but it was like 3 out of 40 rounds)

Anyway that got me curious about how Toast progressed to this point because originally I watched him for Hearthstone. That's when I found out about content creation houses where from what I've seen it's just a bunch of streamers living together and they do other videos together for their organization's channel. I started watching OfflineTV and found so much of it fascinating. They talk about themselves and how they feel and I what their life is like.

I started thinking about life. I asked myself do I want something like they have? They mainly stay in their rooms and play games with each other and stream with sometimes going to each others room for face to face interaction. They rarely go outside or do anything else. I already do all of that minus the streaming and friend group. I was thinking about this a lot and I don't think I truly want a big friend group. I was in a group call last night with 5 other people but I was only playing with one of them. I realized I wasn't enjoying it that much which might have meant I just didn't click with all of them because there have been plenty of times before where I would just sit in a group call with 4-5 others and everyone would be doing something different. What I want right now at least is one person to play games with at least in December that I really click with.

There's no way I'm going to find someone like that to play with unless I start looking and talking to people. So we might not click but if you think you feel comfortable enough to try then send a message and lets see.",lonely,28 [M4R] US East/Online - Looking for a new winter friend,2020-12-02 06:12:00

4341,Southern_Zombie,1606849348,1,"First time posting here. I will try to keep it brief.

Basically, my problem is that since I started college a few months ago, I haven't been able to get to know people. If we weren't in quarantine and everything was normal, I think I would not have the trouble I'm having right now. In any case, the only way I can communicate with my classmates is via Facebook and a messenger group that was created for the purpose of information about classes being spread faster.

At first, everything was fine and every time I had a question a few classmates would try to help me out. Now, they all seem to have cultivated friendships with each other and on top of that, when I recently messaged the group on two separate occasions they ignored me...

I'm getting frustrated and a bit depressed because of all this. I have no idea of what to do. Every time I think about messaging someone privately and trying to get to know them I chicken out because I think I'm going to come off as weird.

I don't know if it matters, but yes, I have a few friends from high school who I stay in touch with. However, they too seem to ignore me sometimes or not put in the effort I do e.g. Last Monday three of us were supposed to have a video call. We had all agreed about when the video call was going to take place. I waited for half an hour and had to message the first friend to have her tell me that she won't be able to make it. The other friend vanished from existence for two days and then came back like nothing had happened.

Besides some hiccups here and there, I really enjoy spending time with these friends but I'm incredibly anxious of growing apart and losing basically every contact I have with people my age. Thus, I really need, and of course want, to make friends with at least one person from my college.

I'm writing this because I want to get it out of my system and I'm very stuck ATM.... What should I do? Is there something wrong with me??

I then stupidly fell for a girl who lives on the other side of the planet. We were pretty close, but we sort of drifted apart. Again, she's in a happy relationship with someone who lives in her area
Then there was a confusing mess that lasted a few years. Was close friends with this girl, then she became cold towards me seemingly without reason. I've got an explanation now and it's very personal so I'm not going to share it. She said she wanted a relationship with me, and I felt the same. We went to the cinema together, but she didn't see it as a date. We drifted apart, but are still on good terms as friends. I don't think she ever liked me the same way I liked her, I think she was just trying to spare my feelings. Idk if she's in a relationship, but I wouldn't be surprised

I get really jealous of people who have friends or people to talk to or people that care about them or people who do... well uh everything for them while I’m stuck here with absolutely nobody which is my fault because I don’t really think I’m the best at keeping friends honestly, I’m not that nice of a guy and it’s not like I can do much for people because I’m a loser but I still wish I had a few people. I only have one real life friend that I talk to all the time and I only go out him once or twice every month so I guess I should consider myself lucky to have him and he’s my one and only best real life friend ever (I sound childish saying that, I know guys), and I’ve known him since 2015 so I guess that’s nice but I can’t really have any deep conversations or anything like that, we usually talk on the phone for a few minutes about our days and stuff or we just talk about politics, history, or the stock market (mind you, I’m fourteen so I’m not that much of a loser yet) so I guess it’s a good thing and we do manage to have some fun when going out which is usually to a museum, to his house, or something like that, so I guess you could say I’m lucky, but it still gets lonely, especially since at school I’m kind of an outcast, actually a full blown one, I’m too scared to get out there and make an effort and the first few times I did try, people weren’t I’d say... the nicest to me so I just gave up so now I just spend most of my time off social media aka I deleted it all because there’s no point if I have nobody to talk to on it, playing video games, checking the stock market and business news, or watching the loud house and mostly old sports games since the stupid virus ruined that too. I also do have I’d say three online friends which is kind of embarrassing that I talk to mostly daily which makes me feel better but I know they don’t care most likely and probably don’t see me as an actual friend so I probably shouldn’t get my hopes up about them, but it still makes me feel better thinking that someone cares and looks forward to talking to me, even though I’m probably nothing to them, I can still make myself feel better though by saying I have a Snapchat or a discord and they’re cool in my eyes so that’s all that matters. I’ll admit, I’m all over the place right now, I haven’t had my coffee so apologies for that, I don’t really think I can function that well without a few cups of coffee but that’s a story for another day.

4402,Kooks_cookie,1606805091,1,"I just broke up with my boyfriend(M 20) again, for the second time, but hopefully for good this time. I had earlier posted about how controlling and over possessive my parents are and I literally can't do anything about it, not atleast I start earning or get into a college away from them. Earlier my boyfriend came to my place after 8 months of staying away and it was the most wonderful thing. Because of the pandemic we both had gone back to our hometowns but due to some issues in his family he decided to come back to the place where we have our college and stay in his flat there. His hometown is very very far away from mine but where he is staying now is only 4 hours away from my place. I had thought of visiting him this time but my parents literally denied it and are not letting me go anywhere, on top of it, i can't tell them the real reason of why I want to go because I basically have to hide my relationship from them or else they won't let me continue college. Even after that I was ready to run away for a day to meet him but here's the actual problem. My periods started today and what my boyfriend said to me was, ""don't come today, come after your periods end."" and when I asked him why, he said that if I come now then the purpose of my visit would be destroyed. When I asked what he meant by it, he said that he was basically calling me to just have sex. I am a person who is super scared of my parents, especially my dad because all my life I have been raised that way, in a way where i was never even allowed to raise my voice.

After I started dating him I started speaking up a bit for him and for myself. I did start changing a bit. But change is gradual, he can't expect me to all of a sudden be like ""I'm leaving you"" to my parents. My parents, without sugarcoating things, are gaslighting narcissistic parents and the fact that I have to hide my relationship be very careful around them restricts me from satisfying all my boyfriend's needs.

I talked about this with him today and he said that he does not know what he did to deserve this treatment and y does he have to suffer because I have parents as such. I don't know how to respond to that. He said that i am not devoted to him like his friend's girlfriends are and that he feels like I am using him for emotional comfort. I have his name changed in my contacts so that my mom and dad don't see it, I go out on a walk everyevening for 2 hours because that is the only time i am allowed to stay out on my own just to talk to him for 2 hours everyday and I video call him everyday for an hour after my parents fall asleep so that no one catches me. I text him to ask him if he has eaten, if he feels well, if he wants to talk or needs anything at all and this is the best that I can give him for now considering my situation. After all this he says that he does not feel that I love him and that I do nothing for him and compares me to his friends girlfriends and says that he does not know why he is in a relationship with me and feels like it is a punishment. He says he stopped loving me after our last fight. He told me this today after almost 2 months of that fight. he only cares for me and does not love me and so he was in a relationship with me. He says that he does not know what he is waiting for as I don't satisfy any of his needs.

After listening to all this I realised he is somewhat right and he says that I play the victim card being the helpless person because that is my attitude and he says he is wasting his time and life being with me. I clearly told him that the situation at my home won't change for another year or atleast till our college startes up again but he says he thinks that the situation will never change. I told him I am doing the best I can for him and doing everything in my power right now and he said ""If you are allowed to do only so much for me or for anyone because of your parents then why are u even alive right now?""

I am told that I am like a child who just wants to be loved but does not really know how to love back because all my life I have been so controlled by everyone that I don't really know how to do stuff for myself or how to live on my own.

With the situation at my house I don't think anyone desreves to have a gf or even a friend like me cause I can't basically satisfy anyone because I am not allowed to do anything. Atleast not till I actually have enough money to move out. I live in India and it is not that easy for a person here to just run away and move out just like that, so that is really not an option right now. So I really think that I should only stay alone so that no one gets hurt by me caus I won't really be able to do much for anyone.

tl;dr : I do not know how to summarise the entire thing into a small para but I basically feel that because I cannot, at the moment, satisfy anyone's needs, I should just stay alone so that no one gets hurt by the expectations they hold from me. I've been alone all my life and having a bf was like a dream that now I have woken up from and it is a dream i should never dream of again.",lonely,I(F 20) just broke up with my boyfriend(M 20) because he said that he does not deserve me and he feels like its a punishment to be with me and now I feel like I deserve to be alone,2020-12-01 17:44:51

My name is Bee (not my actual name, just an alias I tend to go by online), and like the title of my post suggests, I’m a 15 y/o female and sophomore in high school suffering from a terrible cabin fever who’s looking to make friends! I generally find that I don’t connect with people as well as I’d like to IRL, and as such, I have a rough time meeting kids my own age at school. Not only that, but the pandemic has left me unable to fully enjoy the “high school experience,” as everything is done virtually nowadays, so while, me—a relatively lonely teenager—is stuck inside the house for the better part of mostly every day, I figured turning to internet might be a start to helping me cope. 😂

A bit about me:

I enjoy singing and have a cover channel somewhere inside of the deep abyss that is YouTube. Um... I do like to read and write stories of my own! My current favorite book series is “The Darkest Minds,” by Alexandra Bracken (check her out, promise you won’t regret it). And as you can probably tell by my pfp, I love Steven Universe, but I also like to watch anime, shows  such as “The Office,” “The Good Place,” and “Adventure Time,” among many other things. Just started Distant Lands on HBO Max and HOLY CRAP—it’s friggin’ good. They’re, like, my number 4 pick-me-ups. 

There’s tons of other stuff I can tell you about myself, but to keep this relatively long post from getting any longer (and to also save info for future convos), you’re just gonna have to DM me and find out for yourself. Looking forward to getting to know so many of you!! ✨ Anyways, I think this concludes my introduction! If you’re interested in chatting, send a message my way and I’ll get back to you ASAP!

4408,Squindexius,1606802589,1,"So when I was in 4th-6th grade I had these two friends. They were named Daniel and Aidan. 


Let’s start with Daniel, I had been friends with him for 2 years. I trusted him as a friend would normally. That... was in fourth grade. Fast forward 2 years, middle school. I was talking to him one day and told him something very very personal and I won’t say what it is because I’m not and never will be comfortable with sharing it. He then proceeded to tell his mother what I said and even called the cops on me even though he had been sexting to older girls illegally. That backstab, that betrayal scarred me permanently and gave me legitimate trust issues. 


Let’s go even earlier than that but still around 4th-6th grade. I had this so-called “friend”, Aidan. At the time we hung out together. He invited me to his house to play on his games console, pool parties, etc. Something I have mentioned yet is that for the entirety of 4th-6th grade, I was the new kid... and I got severely bullied for it. There was this group of kids that were always together and excluded me, picked on me, and physically hurt me. The very unsettling part about this is that they had a good relationship with the principal of the school so they never got punished. Now you might be wondering, what does this have to do with anything? Well... Aidan knew about this.

I kept our conversations secret from my significant other, being as that I’m not allowed to have friends.

After a few weeks of writing each other almost daily I was careless and got caught. I was forced to delete my account and made to promise never to use reddit again.

The winds of winter have brought hardship and loneliness again, and with it, a renewed sense of self worth. You’re probably not here anymore, my Canadian friend. Hopefully your schooling is going well and your life is on track the way you want it to be.

If you’re out there, still crusading this subreddit giving comfort to lonely souls, maybe you might steer this way again.

4411,burbie2121,1606801661,1,"Been single for 5 years. Meet a girl on match. Went out on like 5 dates. Went to her house meet her dogs ect. Learned about her, her life, he past, her passions, he friends, and of course her ex husband and her last Ex boyfriend who cheated on her with a hooters girl. She didn’t have kids. 

Had sex 3 times and things seemed to be going great. She wanted me to stay over the day before thanksgiving so i did. When I got their she wouldn’t even look at me, she put on movie on and went right to sleep. The next morning this didn’t change. No emotion, avoiding me and almost rushing me out. Texted her on my way home and asked if she is good? She said she was bummed and sad.

Back up 24 hours. Her Ex who cheated on her had messaged her and I guess she isn’t over him. She didn’t tell me not to come over so I still did. 

Day after thanksgiving I ask if I can see her and she says she is sick and doesn’t feel good and is just gonna stay home. She had previously told me she was glad I lived so close cause her ex lived in KCK which was a 45 min drive away. 

I get on snap chat to use the map feature that shows you where friends are in real time. I look where everyone is whom I’m friends with I noticed her moving on the highway towards you guessed it l, KCK. 

I was shocked and pretty beat up about this. I didn’t tell her I knew this. I asked her if we are good and she broke it off saying she just wasn’t over her Ex. 

Moral of the story. Life sucks, people lie, you won’t get what you want even if you work hard for it, and love and happiness is a fraud.

It doesn’t work. No matter how many posts I make on find friends subreddits, most of the people I talk to stop responding within the first week. Some end up giving me only one sentence answers or one word answers during conversations. 

The absolute worst thing is when I’m talking to someone on reddit who seems uninvolved in the conversation, no matter how enthusiastic I’m trying to be.

So here's the thing

Im 20, 5ft.10, curly hair, slim build, blue eyes, and overall pretty good looking (except for my ears, I have big weird ears). I'm a pretty funny guy, pretty friendly, empathetic, nice, wholesome guy, kinda charming (a girl has described me as being ""awkward in a good cute way"") etc. etc., and I try not to be too needy or desperate, which could be my biggest flaw, and I do know how to talk to girls.

But despite all my attempts, I can't find a girlfriend, or even girls that want to date me. I have had a girlfriend before, but it didn't last very long, and I only really started dating her because I was so lonely.

I lot of the girls who've rejected me say that they think I'm cute, and they're attracted to me, and like my personality, but for one reason or another they still don't want to date me. It's happened so many times, I've been friendzoned SO often, and I think a lot of it is just due to bad luck, although maybe it could be something more, I dunno!

I'll give you an example. About a month ago I started to talk to and get to know this girl from my science class. I decided to take it slow and we texted each other and saw each other, had lunch together etc. for about a month. But when I finally asked if she wanted to go on a date she said no! I don't get it! She said she didn't want to get into dating in college at least not yet. This kind of thing happens all the time for me!

I don't get it?! Am I cursed? Did I piss off a mummy or something? This keeps happening, no girls want to date me! The more I get rejected, the more I want a relationship. And the worst part is that I'm home from college now, and I don't have an easy way to meet or talk to girls, so I'm just lonely! I've downloaded a few dating apps, and I've had mediocre luck.

Do you guys have any suggestions, or any way I could meet girls? I'm really lonely, and I don't want to feel this way anymore.",lonely,"I have horrible luck with girls, and I feel very romantically lonely",2020-12-01 02:31:30

4492,GayGingerCharlotteNC,1606747891,1,"I'm perpetually single and rarely get dates. My situation is additionally bleak as a gay man, where I'm dependent on rather sleazy/dating apps to find others and there are statistically fewer of us to begin with which makes me feel more pressured. Because of it all, I often feel like I'm getting mild panic attacks or insomnia.

Some nights, I toss and turn in bed, feeling alone and dwelling on these things which keeps me awake with my heart racing. Sometimes, even sleep aid doesn't help much. At 36, during a lonely holiday season and watching peers get married/engaged and coupled up, I'm the only single person I know amongst my coworkers, friends, and family. I feel like time is running out as I age, because it is. There's only so much life left. This further highlights my romantic loneliness and makes me ask ""Why me? When is it my turn?"". Combine that with no physical affection and sex with someone that genuinely cares, and it's left me feeling distraught. Yes, I'm sure a therapist could help me deal with symptoms and coping...but it won't fix the ""problem"" of zero romantic closeness, and I feel like I won't be satisfied until it is. I just won't.

My life is pretty great otherwise: friends, career, overall health, hobbies, etc. But the lack of a romantic partner and intimacy eats me up inside, causing me great stress. It feels like a part-time job finding someone to date on the horrible apps, and one filled with unsolicited dick/ass pics, creepy couples looking for thirds that get mad if you're not interested, requests for drugs or money, being ghosted/rejected. It's a miracle I'm still trying, but there aren't many alternatives in my situation: apps or bars. Just keeping trying is the only thing I can control, but it's never produced great results aside from verbally abusive/cheating relationships in the past, years ago. It's left me feeling a bit jaded, bitter, angry, stressed, and downright miserable - and taking over my internal thoughts.
