4,theacshow,1585653697,1,I don’t know if this relates to being lonely but over the past years I have developed a tendency to always want new things and never be grateful for how wealthy and pretty much spoiled I am. I can never be satisfied with what I’ve been given and I always want more to be given to me. Even when I was given a romantic relationship the thing I claim to be my life goal I couldn’t stop being selfish and I forgot how a relationship is probably the best thing I’ve been given and continued to be selfish. Eventually I lost my boyfriend because I threatened suicide and when I lost him I realised how lucky I was to get a BF in the first place. To this day I continue to get good things and not be grateful and claim my life will be complete when I find someone but I’m scared that I will take it for granted again or even worse be alone forever because of who I am. I can’t change myself because I don’t desire to change even though I hate myself so I’m just thinking of who I am is too toxic for this world I should just take myself out of it?,lonely,I’m a toxic person and I can’t stop,2020-03-31 22:21:37

11,Pichuco,1585645198,1,"Last years is being like I said ok I embrace that women don’t want to be with me, or something like that. Like when I did have some hope I was around trying to meet someone and date but it was it never happened, I never feel a good vibe when meeting a girl, but the opposite, girls I really like usually were already in a relationship, no one ever introduce me to anyone, nights out were a complete waste of time, no matter how many classes like dance/theater/etc I went, just no girl ever. No online daring results, or bad results with matches.

So I kind of gave up, not completely, but i almost stop going out on weekends, i was tired of putting so much effort in being presentable just to be always ignored and left aside.

So after all these processes I kind of lost track of time.

Now I’m trying to collect myself, I feel lonely and depressed as always in those years, but I gave up some bad habits that ""help me"" in the past.

I was doing kind of good, and now this pandemic, I talk more to myself in order to not loose my mind. I feel like a part of me just want to jump of the window, I don’t think I would ever do something like that, but I have the urge or fantasy of jumping, and I have to commit some mental strength to talk that idea off, that’s what bothers me.

I was doing really ok, but now I can’t sleep, I have insomnia.

Two last relationships I sabotaged, or I did t fight for them, as I thought i could do better or just find another girl.

Sometimes I’m proud of myself as I cannot believe how strong I am but I’m getting tired, like everything feels like it needs so much effort, I want to accomplished so much stuff that sometimes I feel I need several life’s, and I’m trying to be good at many things without support, just by pure will power.",lonely,"(39M) I haven’t had a date in 2 or 3 years or more, time passes and I don’t know how I’m still standing",2020-03-31 19:59:58

I have two friends who are really special to me, like sisters. I try to tell myself that if I can meet two people as great as them, surely I can meet a nice man as well.. but it hasn’t worked out that way. It hurts me a lot. To feel like no one is there for me. In my friends, I tend to be the shoulder. The shoulder to lean on. Even though they reach out and show they care, I always feel misunderstood, or like I’m just living in a society alone, invisible, unheard, and over looked. I’m not aesthetically beautiful.

I set up both of the girls with two of the guys, which led to one of the couples ostracizing us because 1 girl was paranoid their friends would tear her couple apart. So it ends up with my two best friends who are dating and my 2nd best friend being my only guy to talk to now.

18,PurrplePixie,1585639300,1,"I wish I shouldn't have talked to people again, been living as a recluse i could only afford online friendships, relationships or what's you call it. Wish i kept it for myself and continued on, cause no matter how many people I come across, those end leaving me hurt and broken into pieces and taking a part of me and tossing it into the unknown. Loneliness is better suffering to deal with rather than that, cause after sometime, you'll be content and there's no unexpected pain that can arise. But I still can't stop longing for it, I have to stop for my own sake, I'm holding myself together with whatever leftover pieces I have, can't gamble them all away thinking this time it would be different, this time I won't be left broken. I should've never reached out, I regret it, I'm back to being lonely now, back home, it feels comforting and like nothing else, or no one else can hurt me. I don't wanna leave.  
Idk what's wrong with me or why do I always get close to people who leave me broken, intentionally or unintentionally, but it happens anyways, and I push away other people who haven't done anything cause I'm scared they'll break a part of me. It takes so long to heal after being broken and I'll broken into 3 pieces while healing for that lost part.
I'm not looking for new people, I'm sharing just in general, so I can subconsciously know that someone knows my pain, like as in general, not sharing to any specific person and start going again only to be crushed.

I should've never reached out again,  I recoiled back home, to the pain I have been used to but it hurts more for each time I recoiled back.
I know I'm not making any sense, just want to put it out there and console myself, someone knows, don't worry about it. 
Don't ever lemme go, my dear friend ""loneliness"", you have always been trying to shield me from suffering by not letting me be with others, I'm sorry I didn't listen, I'm sorry I didn't appreciate it before, now I do. Don't ever lemme go",lonely,Never should've reached out,2020-03-31 18:21:40

I don't know what to do other than fill my schedule with work to avoid feeling like this. Sometimes i just don't want to live and the thought of exiting life peacefully or even violently doesn't scare me as much as it used to.

Saying that sounds super dramatic but it's how I feel at the time. Do I say it and cause fear for my friends and family, possibly end up in a mental ward like my uncle, and ruin my senior year of college.

23,coffeenpills,1585637289,1,"I just realized how weird this is today, as I got strange looks from people. I do it almost subconsciously. I talk to my dog a lot. At home I’m more comfortable because I don’t feel the prying eyes and judgements of others. I’ll tell him how much I love him. If I’m having a rough day, I’ll remind him that everything will be alright. If something triggers his anxiety, I rush to soothe him and tell him everything’s okay. When he lays in my lap I tell him how pretty and sweet he is. How I like the texture of his fur. If he looks worried I check in with him, asking if everything is alright. I often times ask for his input on matters. “What do you think about x?” And, no matter his answer, I usually answer with “Me too.” There’s no way I’m going to disagree with my little puppa. He has good, wise judgement that I trust haha. 

Welp. I’ve been quarantined for a long time (parks are the only thing open where I live), and decided to take my dog to the park as a little treat. I kind of forgot that you’re *not* supposed to talk to animals in public. As we walked I talked to him, mostly about dog stuff. Asking him what he thought of people playing tennis. Pointing out the cute girl dogs I saw or warning him when a big dog was headed our way. Telling him how uncomfortable the droves of shirtless, running men made me feel. Asking him what he saw in the woods and what he was sniffing at. Talking to him about how gross it is that some pet owners don’t clean up after their dogs. I love him to bits and pieces, and I’m so embarrassed, but some days, I feel like he’s all I have that’s safe and gentle. He’s never tried to hurt me. He has trauma (like me), which can make him a little bitch (pun not intended). He sometimes snaps at people, but he’s always immediately sorry about his knee-jerk reactions, trying to make up for it with cowering kisses. In spite of all he’s suffered, he’s still lovable somehow. He gives me hope that I can be lovable someday, too. 

So if you see some wack ass lady talking to her dog in the park, please don’t stare loathingly. Just move along. She might be lonely.",lonely,I talk to my dog when I’m at the park with him.,2020-03-31 17:48:09

By the time I get the new therapist i realize they don't really want to help me, they don't care if I tell them how miserable I am. They just want me to fill in a questionnaires over the phone so they can tick boxes. I am not a regular person in a regular situation so i found the sessions incredibly unhelpful. After the 9th time of her canceling my sessions because of either sickness / holiday and multiple 10 min late calls / 20 min early ending of sessions I gave up. I cut contact with her, her email to me was as cold as I felt she had been throughout our sessions together. I realized there wasn't anyone to help me anymore and therapy isn't an issue. I wont be waiting another year for another sucky therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to try to do something with my life. I am a gamer who relies on distractions within the home to keep myself ""sane"". I gave up on getting a switch console for my final birthday present before being considered ""too old"" for an expensive present off my parents. I gave up the switch to get a good camera for taking macro shots.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a youtube channel in hopes I could earn enough ad revenue to become self supporting. I planned that I would make videos about my passion (ecospheres). Every so often i would leave the house with my mom. I would go to a lake or whatever to film a video. I would spend a lot of time editing thumbnails and the video itself, but i lacked any previous experience. My content got better with each video, but i had nobody to share my journey with.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached 100 subscribers recently. I had no friends to tell, but it felt like a massive deal to me. I don't think I'll ever be a big channel on youtube or that I'll ever succeed enough to be able to support myself financially. It was a desperate attempt at trying to save myself because I had no options left. I pretty much ran out of options, so tried something different. It wasn't the typical path for someone trying to get help, but it was the path I chose.

&amp;#x200B;

I predict in the future my journey on youtube will be as lonely as my life so far. I haven't anyone i can talk to about making content, thumbnails or who's even interested in what I do. I have a lot of channels comment on my videos who later end up uploading their own videos with similar thumbnails or videos. It makes me feel dread in case they succeed and i don't. This is pretty much my last chance at life. I have put my final egg in the only basket i have.

&amp;#x200B;

My sleeping pattern is screwed because I can't concentrate on sleep anymore. I feel under a lot of pressure to succeed. If I fail I'll never get out of this mess. My mess is pretty much being trapped in my own home, completely dependent on my parents for everything and not being able to work because I'm terrified of strangers.",lonely,I feel deeply depressed and have nobody to talk to about it,2020-03-31 15:00:29

45,hamartiated,1585624945,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

53,jakerz40cal,1585616030,1,"29M [an interesting title]

Hello all. Debated on posting on here for quite some time. Figured I’d give it a go. I don’t know what the accepted way of having a social media friend is (idk what discord is).

29M. Midwest US.

In a relationship that has its ups and downs just like anyone else. 

Mall public safety officer for now (cue the Paul blart jokes) but was just hired as a youth counselor at a school for troubled teenagers.

Type 1 diabetic since 2003. 

I used to work out quite a bit and was in really great shape until said relationship.

I don’t have best friends in “real life” so to speak- I’ve always been a loner. But I’ve worked as a DJ, wedding coordinator, public safety officer, mental health professional, car sales, etc etc.

In my free time i like to play guitar, write my own music, read dystopian fiction, binge watch Netflix (designated survivor, TWD, stranger things...) i do play PS4 but i don’t do the online stuff. I’m kind of old school. I play the story mode in games. A huge God of War fan.

But there’s a huge loneliness factor. I would like to someone to talk to, text with, Snapchat with (that is not me saying i want a “relationship” or trade nudes or flirt with anyone). Just someone to talk to. Someone like minded (I’m all over the place politically). 

Someone who likes to be fit and workout. Someone who is a go getter, can be motivated but also understands that life just effing sucks sometimes. Memes, dark cruel humor (we all have our coping mechanisms). Someone who is just super chill to talk to.

I do get along better with females, I’ve never been able to have a male friend really but I’m not opposed to talk to guys either. I’m not an alpha male type, I’m just a guy who goes to work and goes home and that’s it.

But someone who can help motivate, talk about music, their life, different beliefs, etc. i don’t mind texting or snapping or trading Instagram or social media stuff at all. 

Hopefully i meet someone(s) cool? Have a great day :)",lonely,29M [an interesting title],2020-03-31 11:53:50

57,Ownerofthelonelyhrts,1585613910,1,"A year ago, I broke up w/ narcissistic, cheating ex. If you've ever dealt with a narcissist, then you have an idea of what kind of person they were.  We were together for a long time, were engaged, etc... Emotional abuse became normalized over time &amp; I feel they destroyed everything that was good within me. A month or so ago, I found an amazing ASMR voice actor/actress.  Their audios threw into sharp relief everything that I was missing in my previous relationship and magnified the abuse I sustained.  The audios I found started to help combat the loneliness while simultaneously making me feel hopeless bc that kind of ideal in a partner is completely nonexistent.

I think because every single person on this Earth craves that deep down kind of love shown in those audios.  To be utterly consumed by it and to have that love reciprocated.  The other types of love in the world don't always encompass that ideal and it becomes undesirable through which to live vicariously.

And I get that these audios are meant to be immersive and the character is whoever you want it to be, and not meant as some kind of cure all. I found an online community of fans/supporters of this ASMR person and while they're really nice, I still don't feel like I fit in.  I joined the community bc I believed that I would find people that I could be friends with.  But, a lot of them are so much younger than I am and I hate to say it but there are a few cliques that have formed.  I just think... wtf, I'm a grown ass person who doesn't have time for that.  But the truth is, I do.  I *do* have time for all of it because I am so very alone.  I've tried different venues and forums trying to make friends but haven't had a lot of luck.  Different things keep getting in the way.  Example: almost everyone in that community is playing AC so when we all gather to hang out with one another and the ASMR person, it's just them all playing AC together.  There are a few of us who don't have switch's so we can't partake.  I know it may seem silly... it just makes the goal of friendship seem more isolating.  I get that befriending people on discord or reddit/imgur can take time but when you're this lonely, you feel that you don't have the kind of time to waste on waiting for people to be your friend.

I don't know if any of you have ever felt the physical pain of loneliness/depression.  This devouring chasm in your chest, the hollow cavern of your entire body, the heady realization that no one can help you.

60,thefinancenerd,1585611882,1,"I'm currently writing a book about loneliness and ran across some interesting research that made me wonder if the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing will make some people feel less lonely and improve some people's mental health. I've been reading stories in this subreddit for a while and thought it'd be fun to test my theory with all of you. I write freelance for magazines like The Atlantic and Quartz and would love to write up a story if I hear some interesting stories. 

But first here's the research that got me thinking about this in the first place: 

**The research**

In the middle of the 20th century a man named Charles Fritz began to study the relationship between disasters and mental health. During World War II, Fritz arrived in England expecting a society in distress. But instead of finding a nation in hysteric panic, Fritz arrived to “a nation of gloriously happy people, enjoying life to the fullest, exhibiting a sense of gaiety and love of life that was truly remarkable.” Later in the war Fritz studied this phenomenon for the US Army. In order to do that he gathered more than 70 volumes of existing research on the impact of war on civilian populations. He learned that his anecdotal observations in England represented a broader truth: war seemed to improve mental health. 

Researchers have noted the same surprising observations all around the world. In the 1917 Russian Revolution, one researcher wrote that ""obsessional psychoneuroses” became extinct. Reflecting on his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, a psychiatrist wrote, “I had the impression that many depressed and other mentally ill people were better when confronted with the actual demands and situations that arose during the war than when they were concerned with their own conflicts.” The same observations would later be reported following civil wars in Algeria, Lebanon, and Northern Ireland.

After the war, Fritz led the most comprehensive study of natural disasters and mental health ever conducted. During this period he developed his theory of the “community of sufferers.” He noticed that in peaceful societies people with mental illnesses suffer alone. The distress of their inner world doesn’t match the apparent equanimity of the society they live in. As a result they suppress their emotions and rarely talk about their feelings. Wars and disasters create a natural remedy, a sort of forced therapy. Suddenly everyone suffers and speaks openly about their pain and trauma. As he wrote, “Modern societies have perhaps become ‘sick’ societies not because the stresses of life have become more intense or numerous, but because they become absorbed by the individual as an unshared experience.” During times of public distress, suffering becomes a shared experience. As a result rates of mental illness go down. 

**My hypothesis** 

On the surface, it may seem logical to predict that a pandemic like coronavirus will make more people depressed, lonely, and anxious. But if people react like they do during times of war or natural disasters we shouldn’t be so quick to draw that conclusion.

In my research I've discovered that there's a big difference between temporary loneliness and chronic loneliness. The former is what people feel when they travel alone, move to a new city, or break up with a partner. But it usually doesn't last long and rarely leads to prolonged rumination and self-doubt. The latter is what people feel when they come to believe they don't belong anywhere, they are destined to be lonely forever, or they somehow deserve to not be loved. (I realize that's a broad simplification, but hopefully you get the picture). 

I think some people will feel temporary loneliness that otherwise wouldn't have if it weren't for COVID-19 and social distancing. But I think there might be a large group of people who feel less of the pain associated with chronic loneliness and the depression that often follows. In my experience part of the pain of loneliness is knowing that I should be doing something else. I've felt most lonely on weekends because I've felt like I should be out at the bars or hanging out with friends. So I wonder if some people will feel less lonely because the obligation to go out has been temporarily removed. 

I also wonder if some people who felt lonely will suddenly have more people around given that more people are working from home. In the past I've felt lonely because I work from home alone and often times went 10+ hours without talking to anyone. But now my house is always filled with life because my roommates are working from home. 

I don't think we'll be able to accurately say whether, on the whole, more or less people feel lonely or be able to measure the degree to which that loneliness has changed. So the goal of my research isn't to figure that out. I just want to challenge the surface-level argument that everyone will feel more lonely.

I've been pressured by my parents to get a wife and kids, but I doubt that will ever happen. It's not about looks, it's almost all personality. My social anxiety is holding me back so badly and has done it my whole life. I feel like this has started to create other mental health issues for me too. I, for example, am really worried about becoming depressed. Because, despite my social anxiety, I'm pretty extroverted. I want to have friends, I never did, and I got bullied in school. I'm trapped in my house. I never leave at all. No one ever messages me, except long-distance girls, but I don't want long-distant relationships. I want someone that I can actually meet in real life and hang out with. I feel like my life, so far, is totally wasted potential and I feel like this is making me really mad at everyone and I don't like it.

Can someone PM me, please? Thank you.",lonely,Feel depressed af because of wasted potential,2020-03-31 08:38:40

73,Sol0Hobo,1585600911,1,"Things have been progressively getting worse, despite my every effort to change the things and I *can* and accept the things I *can't.*

As a male nearing 30, I've just about given up. I haven't had a romantic partner in TEN years. I've had two casual hookups, one of which was extremely toxic and destructive. Other than that, nothing. I've been lead on numerous times, and outright rejected more times than I'd like to admit. I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of playing the game, but I can't for the life of me imagine being alone for the rest of my  life. 

It is extremely hard to believe that my situation isn't hopeless.  I feel like I am trying to sell one of those tiny electric cars, the kind that would resemble a ball of reynolds wrap after an accident, in a rural mountain town where everyone drives four-door diesel pickups.  I've cleaned the exterior, and detailed the interior the best I could. Ive added accessories, upgraded the software, even went as far as pricing below market value in my opinion. Hell, this car even knows a second language, cooks, and loves to travel the world (ha ha)! But there aren't any buyers. No one seems to be looking for this type of car. I've had interested customers, some even took it for a test drive. Others have called to set up an appointment only to cancel at the last minute. All the while, cars are driving off other lots with happy new owners one after another.  And when you confide in others about your problem selling this car, their advice is to not ""try to sell the car"", or ""there's a car out there for everyone"", etc platitues etc. 

I'm short. Like, *very* short. Not the meme short where you're just under the golden 6ft. I'm standing tall at 5'1. This is the ""what went wrong/feel bad for/I don't want those genes"" range as I think of it. I'm not ugly, and actually in the best shape of my life. But my experiences have lead me to believe that  this is the largest wrinkle on my shirt so to speak.  I also have a very alienating/socially unaccepted past time. I love to ride freight trains. It's a passion of mine that I can't give up because it's one of the very few things I look forward to. But it's only a couple weeks out of the year. It's by no means a way of life for me. 

But it's not all rain and clouds, I am confident who I am and what  I stand for, and truly believe I have a lot to offer. 

I've always had a hard time dating/hooking up, and quite frankly I am surprised I had the opportunities  I did. But I  cannot seem to find a partner, a life companion. Someone to experience this ""experience"" with. 

But again, I'm exhausted. I feel beat up. My confidence and self esteem are really taking a toll as the losses pile up. I've done my best to change all that  I could, without sacrificing who I am in the process. I've spent years focusing on myself, growing as a person both mentally and physically. I've taking risks, put myself out there, and taken opportunities only for them to backfire.  

I don't know if there's a point to my post, but maybe someone can offer some kind words, or relate. Or tell me I am fucked!",lonely,I'd have completely given up by now if it wasn't for instinct.,2020-03-31 07:41:51

76,KonLiber,1585595787,1,"When I am talking about social media I mean mostly things like Facebook and Instagram not Reddit or Youtube where the vast majority of people are anonymous. People upload photos of those exotic or amazing places they go to, great things they do, friends they hang out with, kissing with their lovers and of course pictures where they either look like models or at least well groomed. Then you start thinking damn I wished I had that, wow I wished I could do that, man this person is living the life unlike me. You compare yourself to them and you start to feel like shit. IT'S NOT REAL. Yeah some people are in a better phase in their lives than you but it's a fairytale. People only upload the good parts of their life never the bad. Not the heartbreaks, their faces in the morning, the loneliness, the sadness. They show you what they want you to see and yes I too am guilty of this. Even you, you mostly talk about your problems here because you are anonymous right? I am willing to bet most of you wouldn't dare say the things you say here on your Facebook page. Yet when someone looks at your Facebook page they might think you are okay, maybe even living a great life if your latest posts was that concert you went to or that trip to that place. Looking at peoples lives through social media is like peeking through a keyhole, you'll never get a good view of the entire room.

Ive done a DAMN good job improving my life the last few years, I moved out on my own, about finish up college after heading back. I got out of a toxic home environment, worked on myself, learned healthy behaviors. I started learning to recognize what healthy interactions look like, and how to have boundaries.

Ive made SOOOO much improvement. I'm no longer blaming everyone else for all my problems, I try to see what I can do to adjust to a situation rather than just complaining about it.

And you know what? I'm TIRED. I try to be there for people, I'm an ear they can talk to, I go out of my way to understand them and listen. I'm tired of dealing with my shit ALL THE TIME. I know what healthy behavior is, i know what I should do, and by and large throughout my day I do what I should, but then I come home to an empty house and its hard to not wallow. I'm geinuine throughout my day, but in control. Someone my hurt my feelings but if I know they didn't mean it that way, and I know it only hurt because an isecurity i have, then i know I need to behave in a manner consistant with reality , not with my insecurities.

But the feelings are still there. still battling around inside me, I rarely get to express them except in therapy.

121,babyfartmacgee,1585545448,1,"Hi

I really needed to talk to someone, I've been craving talking and a hug for a while so I decided to come vent here.

Long story short:
-I've been living on my own since I was 7. When I was seven my father pretty much told me I was a shitty child and he wished I was more like my brother who was easy to love. My mother was sexually abusing me so I did a few suicide attempts at 7 years old and after 3 spent my 8th year in observation in a psychiatric ward. Came out that I was just extremely intelligent and had horrible parents.
-lived in 23 different foster houses from 8-15yo including my 11th in Isolation because the child protection services didn't have a place to put me until my 12th anniversary. So never had people close to me, nobody ever got to know me and spent most of my childhood alone eating my way to morbid childhood obesity.
-from 15 to 17 was between apartments and homelessness in Canada's winter.
-on top of that when my mother finally killed herself (after +-50 attempts) her final letter was just hate towards me and making sure everything went to my junkie brother and to blame me (her bastart child as per the will) for her death. Even with all that since my brother who I don't really know is a junkie and couldn't do it, so i paid and organized respectable funerals...
-And my weight has swung with my emotions between 420 and 270 lately I'm on the way down because I am careful at the moment.

After that I fixed my life: when I was 21 finished high school and started college in IT. I started a few businesses in IT, insurance and cars.

So now I am 32:
-If have no family to speak of (only ones still alive are decade long junkies)
-No one really knows of ever knew me,
-If lost most of my friends either when they moved, made girlfriends or I flushed then for being unethical.
-If have never in my life had a functioning normal relationship with another human being...

Lately I realized that I haven't been hugged in years, I don't know if anyone even told me they loved me (even my parents made it clear when I was 5-6 they didn't and where just stuck with kids...) and I really wished I had people that I cared for and cared for me.

Also I the last few years I started hating holidays and birthdays more and more. When I was a kid already birthdays pissed me off because my parents didn't celebrate mine (they did do my brother, even did him twice one year celebrating him on my birthday by mistake...). The last few years I don't even get a phone call of anything for my birthday yet everyone is constantly lived and cherished on Facebook on theirs.

And that's my new thing, seing people's birthdays or love makes me incredibly jealous and then feeling guilty because of being jealous of their happiness. Watching a mother love her child or a happy couple loving each other makes me feel like someone is stabbing me in the heart.

Most people, especially the ones that known me for a long time know I'm an asshole... And I am. When push comes to shove I'll put myself before anyone else without hesitation. I dismiss friends of years for doing things that hurt me. And I firmly believe people change so theres no point in trust because the same people won't be themselves in a few years and will betray you...

Actually most people that don't work for me or have some form of business relationship ignore my calls/messages. But professionally I am well respected but inspire fear because it is know that if you cheat a customer or do something wrong there is no loyalty I will crush you...

And at this point I am successful enough that the last women that got interested in me where there for the wrong reasons. I've never had a reciprocal loving relationship in my life.

So for all my success and intelligence I find my life really sad: I get home and I have no one to talk to. Sometimes I'll think of a funny joke and just start crying when I realize I have no one to say it to. I miss giving a hug so bad sometimes it actually hurts, I think it's been years, last time I got a hug was at a funeral...

Sad thing is I see myself as an amazing person:
-If walk straight: if anything I'm paying for being too honest,
-If never hurt anyone willingly,
-If went from homelessness drop out to university graduate entrepreneur
-went from 420lbs to 270
-if saved a few lives (cpr)
-I create jobs, even now with covid I've been hiring...
-I give back to my community (ex last floods I got 1000 palets of sandbags delivered)

But yet I have absolutely no one in my life and don't see where to go from there...",lonely,I need a hug,2020-03-30 16:17:28

132,hamartiated,1585538474,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

135,quessi,1585536275,1,"I have many friends and acquaintances. So why do I feel extremely lonely?

I can honestly tell you that the quantity of friends you have does not matter if you don't have a connection with at least one of them. Like I deal with so much fucking mental shit it's draining. It feels like a knife is repeatedly stabbing me or the rocks get heavier with my great amount of baggage. Like I can't escape. I want to escape this feeling of loneliness but I can't. It's not letting me. And I can't fucking talk about it with my friends because they won't understand what the fuck I'm feeling. 

""Are you okay?""
""What's wrong?""

I simply answer I'm just tired. Because I know that if I do open up about this with my ""friends"" it won't be genuine. It never is. All they care about is themselves. They're all self centered. Nobody gives a shit about anyone. Fake. Fake people around me. 

I want new people in my life. I want to press the restart button and start a new life with more opportunities.

It’s been quite long since I cried. Crying helps yet I’m unable to do it. I wonder why? Maybe I’m not someone who deserves the nice things in life. I would understand that. It won’t be a stretch to say I don’t. I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I could listen to someone. Help them. Care for them. Tell them I “love” them. Whatever love is. It does sound nice. Oh it’s almost 2:30 am. I should be sleeping. I can’t. The voices are saying bad things. But they aren’t lying. I wish I could do as they say. I would’ve escaped from this nightmare long ago. Maybe it’s not a nightmare. Maybe everyone goes through hard times. Maybe I’m just weak. Not strong enough to deal with life. It is very likely. Then again I won’t be surprised if it is. I know I’m weak.,lonely,I’m desperate. Or just lonely. I don’t know.,2020-03-30 12:19:59

• Any other people I do reach out the conversation is very minimal (it dies down very quickly) 

I guess my dream yesterday and today have me thinking more than usual. My dream just consisted of all the people that are my “friends” just leaving me and hanging out with themselves as a group.

I met them in my first year of college and before that I didn’t have any friends besides people you saw in high school. Coincidentally, two of my friends came from my hometown which was convenient. Even though I have a small amount of friends, I had many opportunities to make friends in college and through my jobs. People invite you places and show a sudden interest in you, and you them. But then things stop “clicking” and interactions become less natural. I’ve always felt like there was something wrong with me, but really I just hadn’t found who I was yet. I also failed to realize that I am very selective with who I have friendships with, and I used to make the mistake of forcing them even when I didn’t feel comfortable. With my friendships now, it’s as easy as pie and I’m so grateful.

But still I feel lonely. That is the downside to being an introvert and not being able to connect with many people. Yes I love being alone and function better when I have a lot of alone time, but still I feel lonely and wish I could meet more people I had a genuine connection with.

My goal this year is to put myself out there in meetup groups and become healthy and fit. I want to do meditation and heal my mind because I have suffered from depression in the past. I want to enjoy being alone on my own, that way more people will be attracted to me and want to hang out more. And not automatically distance myself from them as a defense mechanism.

As it says in the title, I am now 28 years old and I have spent all of those years without anyone by my side.

I have never been kissed, and obviously haven't done anything more than that either. I just don't understand what the thing is that has kept me back.

I'm average looking and I try to go out with my friends when I can. 
People always tell me I'm a nice guy. But being a nice guy hasn't gotten me anything.
All I really want is someone to talk to at the end of the day. Someone that cares about how my day went, someone that cares about my feelings and actually wants to listen to me. And more importantly, I want someone that actually shows affection to me. 

My situation hasn't done wonders for my mental health, and a couple of months ago I decided to get professional help. 
Talking with a therapist has been refreshing and she's been a help. She's trying to get me to think about things rationally, which I am usually capable if doing. I know that people like me, that they care about me, but on some days I just can't help to shake that feeling. 

My biggest fear in life is to die alone.
Since turning 28 a couple of days ago, I've been feeling down and this fear has been roaming around in my head.

I'd like to think that my 29th birthday will be a better one, but I doubt it.

**Message me to join our secret mastermind group**

Hey guys,

We are trying to have a holistic understanding of Game. We want to target everything that is going to help you become a high-value guy from fashion to nutrition to online behaviors. I see a lot of you making these MASSIVE mistakes, which are **turning you into low-value guys**. Hopefully, these tips serve as a course-correcting for you guys to become high-value guys. Unfortunately, a lot of people who give free advice out there give it without an adequate context. Therefore, one can misunderstand their information.

In this post, I will go more in-depth on confidence, bear in mind that confidence is a vast and complex topic. Therefore, I will have multiple angles on this topic. Today we will be focused on *Boundless confidence.*

**1- Understand that there are various types of confidence, but you want to focus on Boundless confidence**

There are numerous types of confidence. For instance, I believe there's the situational, there's core confidence, and there's boundless confidence. Two weeks ago, we studied situational confidence in which you are good at a specific skill in a given situation. Last week, we studied Core confidence. Core Confidence is your go-to response when doing the ability that you have mastered. This week, we will explore **boundless confidence. Boundless confidence is the confidence to do things that you are have not learned**. Next time we will focus on how to remain confident, despite new obstacles and setbacks.

*What is Boundless confidence?*

**Boundless confidence is to be confident in doing one activity that you have never done before**. For instance, imagine you have always approached girls during the day, but now you want to do it at night time. Most guys will stick to their comfort zone, even the guys who have core confidence since their confidence is limited to their mastery of one skill\*.\* However\*,\* a guy with *boundless confidence will be* **highly adaptable and adjust to his new situation.**

For instance, I remember when I first started going to hostels to do game, it was overwhelming. I was nervous; someone would see me and report me. Bear in mind; I have gotten used to approaching girls *in open spaces*. Therefore, I was shy about approaching. However, I went to the bathroom to wash my hand. I looked myself in the mirror and told myself, *""Come on, you got this.***""**

Once I got out, I started troubleshooting. I scanned the room to find patterns. Note that no one had taught me how to do, 'hostel game.' No one had written a guide to how to approach this unique venue. I had to trust my expertise and take it as a point of reference. After a few minutes, I noticed one crucial similarity. When I'm at the park, and it gets crowded, people never approach me and tell the girl I'm with, ""Are you ok?"" **Most people assume that we both know each other already.** Therefore\*\*,\*\* I took that reference point as an analogous situation. A few hours in, I was feeling very confident and approaching girls at the hostel as if I always did it.

**2-Understand that Boundless confidence means that you have a strong self-belief**

Now that we know what boundless confidence is you need to do some *self-examination,* some guiding questions are: Is there any activity in which I'm the most confident? In which area am I highly capable? **Which area am I an expert? In which area do I trust myself the most?** Maybe you are the most confident at finding your way around a city. Despite how new the city might be, you can take the lead.

**Sample Answer**: *Look! I'm very good at finding myself around anywhere! Drop me in a new city and give me a map and I'll find my way home. Moreover, I'll also discover how to get from the subway to the theme park to the hotel. I won't hesitate. Instead, I will take the map and go to it.*

Take a pen and paper or type in your notes on your iPhone or iPad. *You must go into this self-examination mode*. *Having the ability to look into yourself and determine your strengths is paramount!* Most likely, you have not attained this type of confidence, and I'll show you.

**3-Showing boundless confident sub communicates that you grew up in a positive environment**

Growing up, I realize that the guys who had this boundless confidence also had older brothers or even fathers who were guiding them through the journey. Most likely, you've had parents who were too strict or too neglectful. Whatever the case might be, your **personality is a result of your family and friends.**

Out of all the confidences, situational, and core, your ability to have boundless confidence depends on your environment. Look! You can have situational confidence where you became confident at playing Super Smash Bros. Or you have core confidence since you can beat your friends at Tekken just as much as you can beat then on Smash Bros. **However, if you are put in a novel situation, you will go back to your initial fearful self.**

What distinguishes guys who have boundless confidence from guys who have other types of confidence is that the former will not back down if faced with a novel situation while the latter will.

**4- To have Boundless Confidence shows that you are a natural leader**

There are situational alphas, and they are hardened alphas. **You can see that a harden alpha male, when dropped in a new situation, will learn how to adapt and take the lead.** You might think that this type of alpha is a myth. However, I have seen it myself. For instance, **my sister's ex-boyfriend was in a fraternity, and he was as close as you can get to the harden alpha ideal**.

For example, we went to Times Square to hang out with a group of people. He has never been to New York before; however, he took the initiative and was already leading. I was surprised since I had been to New York before, and yet I did not have this boundless confidence. I was confident I could find anyone at the things I have mastered, but I would have my reservations of leading people in something new.

Afterward, we went for dinner, and we started talking. He told me that he had grown up in a very supportive environment, and that helped him developed this confident personality. I**t is true at this stage, I have surpassed him in both confidence and mastery with girls. However, I still learned from him and other naturals alphas about boundless confidence.**

**5- How you attain Boundless Confidence is a by surrounding yourself with winners**

Now it's likely if you are reading this, you grew up a negative environment or in an environment that was not conducive to you getting boundless confidence. *The people around you made you feel self-conscious or embarrassed.* They told you directly or indirectly, ""**Know your place, dork!** Or **""Stay in your place!"" or ""Haha! Look at you!""** Therefore, you have **developed a reactive personality.** You have been conditioned not to stand out, and each time you have a chance to stand out, you choose not to. For instance, for all, you guys are still fearful of doing photoshoots or taking high-value pictures. The reason you don't do it is **that you are afraid of being judged.**

Similarly, the reason you are not will not take the lead or share is that you are afraid that if you mess up, you will be mocked or laughed up. However, *the only way of leading is to do it and learn as you go. Similarly, the only way of becoming boundless confident is to do it, fail, and do it again. The only way of losing is by not trying.*

Now, if your opportunity to **surround yourself with winners and guys who will push you to greater heights, once** you have that positive environment around you, you will have different conditioning, and you will start to *reprogram both your beliefs and actions.* When you are faced with a new situation that you are unsure of, you will know how to deal with it with high self-esteem and the right course of action.

**Conclusion**

I hope you guys learn from this list. Confidence is a broad topic, but we will be digging into it more and more. Next time we will deal with how to remain confident despite obstacles! Hopefully, you guys can start doing your self-examination as soon as you get the change and reflect on how confident you are and in which situations. Once you know you are already satisfied in one area, you can translate that confidence into another area. Ask yourself:

**""How can I surround myself in a positive environment?""**

**""Once I'm in that environment, how can I contribute to my high-value friends?""**",lonely,Practical Guide: How to be more Confident (Part 3: Boundless Confidence),2020-03-30 03:09:20

So I'm in this cycle of loneliness. I'm introverted most of the time, have been since childhood. I've always been okay with being alone. But lately I've been getting extreme waves of loneliness that don't necessarily coincide with bouts of depression, but sometimes its one of the other, ill have extreme lows from depression, then i will come up and loneliness will hit. It's like my body is anticipating to be happy, but my existence forces me not able to be, so I get hit with a BITCH-YOU'RE-STILL-ALONE slap.
I'm 23, never been in a true relationship, I've never had irl friends since middle school, I've been alone since middle school.

Eventually I moved I begged my parents to move because I just didin’t like we’re I was going so i did and got an new school. Little did I know that it would be what leaded into very dark times for me. For the first few days of the move I didin’t go to school or anything and those were pretty sick days but then school started, on my first day of school my teacher came to greet me and Lead me to class and show me around which was pretty nice of her but anyways I go to class and meet my classmates and sit down and the days go by until I make friends and these friends were great they would be really good friends until I made a joke about my “friends” place which he thought was super mean and I didin’t know that he would react in that kinda way because he would always act like that towards me but when I do it he’d get mad so he dropped me as a  friend OVER TEXT (that kinda hurted me doe) so the next day I go to school and ask him why he didin’t want to be my friend but instead of telling me he just was speechless like I was a ghost and this would kill me and I ended up crying for a long time (by the way he didin’t tell me why he didin’t want to be my friend over the phone so I didin’t know) and when I went to school I went to my other friend who was in the group avoided me too he wouldn’t even say anything which just made everything worse due to the pure fact that I had no friends other than them because the others were just un approachable or would be just complete jerks so I avoided them. Which was horrible for me so then after months the other kid in the group we will call him jack (just a random name I picked) he tells me that the first kid would force him to not interact with me or else he wouldn’t be his friend anymore and he was in my situation to without friends other then him and couldn’t lose any friends otherwise he’d end up like me sitting on a rock by myself for 60 minutes every day at school which killed me inside but was my break from my teacher which we will get into soon. But jack really liked me and wanted to be my friend and couldn’t but once the kid found out he told me this he got super mad at him and I was really mad about that but couldn’t do anything and would want to punch that kid every single day (one day I was about to swing but saw a teacher and backed off) and that’s the end of the kid story but now to the teacher story ( this teacher story starts at the next grade by the way ). This teacher seemed really nice too until a few months passed and I realized how sexist he was (we will get into that later) one day during the rememberince day assembley (don’t know the spelling but it’s a Canadian day we’re we honour fallen soldiers by staying silent for a little while) some kid was crying in the funniest way possible and my one and only friend started laughing at that my teacher came over and told us off in a way that was very wrong for 6th graders (I’m 7th now) and after the assembley we got taken to the guidance counciler for being rude and ever science then he held a grudge on me. After a little while i noticed that these kids who didin’t speak English well would constintly talk shit about people like me in their language and get away with it and when I told someone no one did Anything so instead I ranted about it to my friend and apparently some kid was listening and told on me and got severely punished by my teacher anyways also same thing with girls minus ranting about it. After a bit my teacher started yelling at me instead of doing work and telling me that I have no empathy for anyone and would CONSTANTLY harass me and cried 24/7 an when i told someone about it I just brushed off and one day after school I came home crying super hard and my parents found me crying and instead of hugging me he just yelled at me to man up and after he left I wanted to kill my self so badly (luckily I didin’t follow through just cried like hell) and then when I went to school my teacher made me go to the principles office and read first grader books about empathy and then when I told him that I don’t want to read this and please I just want to go back to regular school he made me go do “volunteer work” at a kindergarten class in the school which was hell because the kids kept on trying to hit me and I have a kind of eating disorder of sorts (not diagnosed but I know I have one) where if I see some food I don’t know or think smells I’d nearly barf and they made me clean up the kids food and I couldn’t but he told me that I’d get suspended if I didin’t so I followed through and nearly barfed like 20 times and 5 were barfs I swallowed and after at my new school (moved again) I got new friends and though everything was good till I realized that people were being blatently racist to me and constantly making fun of me and I realized I have no real friends...

I'm 22 years old and I'm essentially in my sophomore year of college after swapping majors twice (long story) and it feels like I'm missing a lot in life right now. All my friends from high school are graduating (well, just finishing their undergrad degrees considering that everywhere is canceling their graduations what with the COVID-19 stuff) and here I am just spinning my wheels. I had to drop one of my classes this semester because I have enough trouble focusing on in-person classes, and online classes make that a thousand times worse, and it's just making me feel like I've fallen even farther behind my peers.

I haven't dated anyone in over a year, and I recently found out that my last boyfriend just got engaged. Like, yeah, I'm happy for him and everything, but also he's moving on and I'm just not. Like I don't dwell on our relationship, but again I haven't really dated anyone since then. That's one of the drawbacks of staying with your parents, I guess. Is the money I'm saving worth it? Totally, but it still feels bad to not be able to really date anyone while living here. Also the whole pandemic thing puts a damper on that too. Can't forget about that.

Normally I'd throw myself into some sort of project to distract myself from this stuff, like I'd audition for some community theater shows, but with all that shut down right now I don't really have a good outlet for this.

All I do is sit at home play video games, watch shows/movies and check my phone pretty frequently and hope that someone messages me for once but of course that never happens. But I mean that's pretty much what I did before except now I don't go to my university's campus. And one other thing is that I have lots of time to just think, think about how lonely am I.

I thought social distancing would be a nice little break but everything seems so much worse. I keep forgetting to turn in school assignments but my main concern is being more lonely than ever. I've never had any close friends or a boyfriend before and what's weird is that I never wanted those things growing up. I don't know how I did it but I used to be so happy and content with just myself. I wasn't bothered by not having friends or being invited to things, I just wanted to be home all the time and work on things I liked. Not until Senior year in high school at least. That's when I started crushing and trying to hang out with people after school and stuff but it was already the end of high school so people had already formed their little circles and I wasn't able to rebuild courage after I got rejected by a crush that year. 

As for developing friendships, that didn't go well either. I have this group of friends that I used to hang out with somewhat from middle school to Senior year but I wasn't like IN IN the group, ya know? I started hanging out with them more after school and stuff while we waited for our rides. Then I was invited to a sleepover and I think I did a good job having conversations which is something I usually struggle with. One friend even suggested that I joined their group chat which was where they talked about pretty much everything, then another friend suggested that they didn't and that was the final decision I guess :l 

Now, I'm in my second semester of college and everyone I know is dating and everyone is like locked into their friend groups and it's just been a lot harder to make friends but I felt less lonely at school. 

There's one dude I meant online that has had my intention for the last few months and he's taught me a pretty important lesson: that I'm useless af. We mainly just chatted and stuff and I thought he was super duper cute, chill, silly and just fun to be around. The more I got to know him the more I liked him. I would hook up with him periodically in hopes that maybe he'd like me more. But of course, I started to realize the pattern. We chat for a while, we hook up, he ignores me. And the thing is that despite knowing that he'll do this every time, I still won't deny him because I'm so desperate for anyone to like me.

He was the last person I really talked to and I just feel empty. I cry because I want to kill myself so bad but I can't because I have a dog and I know my family won't take good care of her.

As an adult I’m lonelier than ever. I’m an affectionate person with no friends and a family that is somewhat stiff when it comes to affection. I can only imagine how lonely being a celebrity must be, constantly busy and surrounded by people that want something from them. Like just wanting to hug them and be their friend and say “I’m so proud of you, I’m here for you if you want a hug or just talk about mundane things, you’re special, you matter, you’re loved”. Isn’t that what we all want at the end of the day?",lonely,I see documentaries about lonely celebrities and my heart breaks for them,2020-03-29 18:01:52

I’m so emotionally unavailable and unable to make or keep friends and now I have no one.
It’s been like his for awhile but has steadily gotten worse and worse until now, the worst it’s ever been.

No one has spoken to me besides coworkers in so long. No one messages me. No one interacts with any posts of mine on social media. No one cares. No one at all. I switch between apps constantly hoping that someone, anyone, will care...but no one ever does. I don’t know why I still hope.

I used to message people, and then I realized they never messaged me first. So I stopped messaging them to see if they’d message me, and they never did. I probably was annoying them and they were probably glad I stopped talking to them. But I miss them. It’s been years since I spoke to some of them and I still can’t get over them.

I used to be used as someone to talk at and then abandon. Now I don’t even get that. It’s like I don’t even exist. I would take someone using me for venting than this constant loneliness. I feel like I’m losing my mind.

It dawned on me the other night that no one actually likes me and I took it really hard and have been struggling more than normal since then.

I feel like I am the worst person to ever exist. I feel like I deserve to die, because I can’t even make and keep one friend. I feel like I shouldn’t have ever existed, like there’s something so broken and wrong with me that no one will ever want me and that I’ll die alone. And no one will notice.

I wish I wasn’t so alone. I wish someone cared enough to let me know but I feel so selfish and guilty for even thinking that. 

I don’t know what to do or how to climb out of this hole. It just gets deeper and deeper the older I get. I want so badly to make actual human connections but it never works out. I’m so, so lonely. But I’m scared if I try to make friends again, they’ll leave me too.

Sometimes I just tell everybody that I'm ok and its all chill, but deep inside I'm sad. This is really terrible and it makes my life miserable sometimes.

I don’t really know where to start, heh. 

I live with my family that I don’t necessarily get along with. Not that we fight or have problems, we just don’t understand each other. Also, I have no friends. Quarantine time just made this a LOT more obvious. 

I used to talk to my boyfriend most of the time when I wasn’t outside studying or reading. Now, he spends the whole day sleeping and night playing video games with his friends. Which I understand! That might be his way of dealing with everything that’s going on. I have mental health issues, and so I know what it is to want to lose yourself in something in high stress periods. That’s why I love reading after all! But, having talked to no one in the past 14++ days and having no one ask about me somehow triggered the dark thoughts in my brain again and now I don’t have the energy or the mood to do anything, including reading. 

What I usually like doing in these situations is to talk to someone that would distract me from my thoughts. I kept sending messages/memes/videos to my boyfriend throughout the day, but of course he rarely answered them either because he’s sleeping, eating or busy with his game. This led me to being kind of resentful and act in a very crappy childish way aka being passive aggressive in my answers. He called me out on it and just lashed out on me by saying that I shouldn’t be one more thing to stress about in these times and now I just feel much more worse. 

He apologized and said that he didn’t mean what he said. But I know that everything he said was right. Of course, I don’t blame him for it. These things happen, and I deserved it. I know I need to change and I know I need to sort myself out. It’s just not easy when you have anxiety and depression ruining your life. 

If anyone wants to talk, don’t hesitate to message me. I don’t just like to talk and I love listening and helping out regardless of my being a mess. If you’re looking for a study buddy, same! God knows I should be studying way more!

On the opposite site I sit for the most time of the weekends in my darkened room, playing video games or watching youtube. And this isn't because of self isolation, it's because of me. So I sit there and insult myself that I'm such a worthless piece of trash and why I don't simply improve myself. It is my fault, that I'm like this, I could simply go out and make friends or learning a cool hobby. So I wasting my life with no purpose or meaning in it. I have no dreams, wishes, ideas or crushes like normal humans, I just feeling empty. I always hug a pillow until I fall asleep, imagining I would hug another person, but it is clear to me that I'll never be in a relationship. I don't deserve to waste precious time and energy of another person with my stupid existence. No, I get what I'm deserving, so everything is like it should be. Sometimes I even wish that I wouldn't wake up at the next day.
I also often read posts on this subreddit about people with real problems and I often feel sad and guilty for them. I should be happy and living a active live, but I'm too dumb abd lazy to do it. So I wish you all lovely and lonely people the best, I believe in you!

263,codegatsby,1585436870,3,"My mom had anger issues when I was growing up. It culminated when I was 19 and she kicked me out. It really messed with my sense of self worth and I became a sex worker to pay my rent. The men always said the nicest things to me. They showered me with compliments and validation. I remember one man gave me white roses from his garden and it’s still my favourite gift I’ve ever received. 

It’s better between my mom and I now, but I came to the conclusion that although she loves me, she doesn’t like me as a person. It’s weird to see how TV moms dote on their children and love them unconditionally. It made me feel like because my mom doesn’t like me, there’s something fundamentally wrong with me and that deep down, I’m unlovable. 

Surprise, surprise, I have issues getting close to people. I feel like if I get too close and they see the real me, they won’t like me. To prevent this from happening, I usually have a cycle of three years with friends, then I just disappear from their lives. I’m just getting off a cycle now with a group of friends. This whole social distancing situation has actually made it easier to disappear from their lives. 

But it wasn’t enough. I just ended a year-long relationship with someone. He was devastated and tried to call me out on this and tell me that he would always love me. But I wouldn’t back down.

I am writing here on the behalf of my brother, who doesn't speak English very well. He doesn't know I am talking about this here. I am writing that in order to try to help him.  
He is a wonderful person. He knows his flaws and is capable to question himself. He is constantly trying to better himself. He is, objectively speaking, smart, responsible, comprehensive, curious and sensitive. Plus, he is very successful in his career. But he is deeply unhappy.   
Since childhood, he has never really been able to connect with people, he has had ""friends"" before, when he was in high school, that are no longer in the picture (and he doesn't regret them, for many reasons), but now, as an almost 30 years old adult, he is faced with the evidence that beside our family, he has no one. And he suffers greatly from it. He has tried a lot of things, he has been going to dance, sport or other classes almost every evening for a few years, he has tried several apps (including Tinder) but never succeeded in meeting anyone. He struggles to form actual bonds with people, he never really knows what to say, has a hard time letting go of his fears, which make him a bit awkward in his way of socializing. People don't really look twice on him, never contact him again, he has to do it all the time. He says he can get people to like him, but never to be interested in him as a friend or a potential romantic partner. He suffers because he is actually trying to better himself but feels like he is failing, and he doesn't know what else to do. It doesn't help that he suffers from a sensory disability that doesn't help in having a normal social life.   
He longs for relationships, for people with whom he can share things, with whom he can ravel, ... he wants a normal social life. He is currently going to therapy and has been for a year or so, but it is (obviously) very long. He feels like he lost his youth (not that he doesn't consider himself being young, but, he says that the 20s are the time where we are supposed to do so many things) doing nothing, going nowhere, having done nothing with anyone.

As his sibling, I am deeply sorry about his situation. I am not the most social person either but I have friends and a significant other. He tells me how much he envies me... I have, however, my own insecurities to deal with, so I don't really know how to help him. I love my brother to death, and his unhappiness is a terrible thing to witness.

I would love to hear if anyone else has ever been through this and how he can get better, and how I can help him ? Thanks a lot in advance",lonely,"My brother (29M) has never had a girlfriend, and he doesn't have any true friend",2020-03-29 09:26:20

I don’t even know why I’m typing this. I know in my heart that I need to say some things but I just can’t find the right words to say them.

Our book is kind of dusty but every so often one of us takes a look at it and try to get rid of the dust but unfortunately with our human eyes we can’t see the dust slowly start to build back up again. If I had a choice I would pick up the book everyday and dust it off just to try and keep it looking alive. I would find a way to keep adding more and more blank pages to the book so there is always more room to write our story. What would you do with the book N? Would you take it outside and throw it into a fire pit and watch it burn? Would you maybe hide it somewhere and every so often pull it out when you’re feeling alone? 

I never wanted our book to end. Every time you’ve opened it over the years you’ve read a few pages and then you’ve slammed it shut. Each time you’ve slammed it shut you’ve damaged a page in the book. All these pages in the book that you’ve damaged just want you to feel sorry for damaging them and try to fix what you’ve broken. Sooner or later N there isn’t going to be anything else to write and by then the whole book will be damaged. You could be nice and maybe take the book to the library to donate so someone else can check it out.

295,Jacob1988Denmark,1585407912,1,"Now that the Corona Virus is spreading all over the world and people work from home or are sent home from work or school, it’s important that you don’t isolate yourself.

That will only bring you more down and you will feel lonely.

Remember it is “**Physical Distancing**” NOT “**Social Distancing”**

Everyone has a need of human connections. So now it’s more important than ever that you talk with people instead of isolating yourself.

That will only lead to:

❌Loneliness

❌Boredom

❌Depression

Here are some tips and ideas how to socialize online:

✅**Call your family regularly**

It’s important to keep in touch with you family. Make sure they are all right and you can share some ideas what to spend your time on.

✅**Call an old friend you haven’t spoken with in a while**

You never know what this can lead to, catch up with an old classmate, coworker etc. People are bored and they will appreciate it If you react out to them.

✅**Get to know new people in your community**

Why not get to know new people from your area? Today there is a lot of online gathering places such as locale Facebook groups, Meetups etc.

Network with people to build up a connection, this will help you once the Corona Virus is gone.

✅**Jump on Skype Calls with strangers**

Try new things out, jump on a call with new people and learn from each other. This is also a great opportunity for you to get out of your shell.

✅**Get into online discussions**

There is a lot of people online these days because people seek human connections and that is a great time for you to get into a discussion and learn something new about a new topic.

This can also make you want to try new things out when the Corona Virus is gone.

For example, picking up a new hobby.

✅**In general, improve your online presence**

Overall learn new things, improve how you connect with people and how you engage with people on forums and Facebook groups.

Be curious and seek new opportunities.

Yesterday started with a huge fight with my girlfriend. We've been having many. This time, it was just too much for both of us. Last night, I dropped her off at her sister's. Neither of us knows for how long that's going to last.

I attempted a dopamine fast today. If you're unfamiliar with the idea, it's where you intentionally drive yourself to a state of complete boredom for the purpose of starving your dopamine receptors. The point of this is to soft-reboot the brain with increased motivation and focus.

After 18 hours of no food, caffeine, exercise, reading/watching, social, interacting with friends, I finally caved into just about all of it. Going to try again now.

If any of you relate to any of this, or if you don't mind throwing good vibes my way, I'd really appreciate any interaction at all to return to when I'm done with this second fast attempt.

I just joined this group because I don't know where else to vent my feelings. I'm going to make this post as short as I can. 

I have an issue coping with my insecurities. I feel like my brain is spinning around in my head. Something that really bothers me is that I don't recieve the reciprocated attention that I want from my friends. I also feel like the way I feel is irrational amd selfish. But it hurts that some people I really care about and hold close to me don't seem to feel the same way. There is one person in particular who I love and I miss her and I want to hang out but she never contacts me. It's always one sided. And I have to beg to hang out. She claims to care about me but the fact that if I never messaged her we'd probably never talk again sucks. I have one best friend that actually cares and talks to me everyday and I am thankful. But I can't help that I also miss and care for others. I don't know what to do or how to feel better about it. I have a handful of friendships like this. It makes me feel lonely and worthless. It also hurts that I am never invited to outings. I feel ostracized. I think I am a great friend and person and I can't figure out why I can't find good friends or make good bonds. I also feel like for as old as I am I shouldn't be so emotionally immature about this. I am just confused and upset and I can't help but think I'm an awful person.

He sent me a song after a romeo + juliet private joke, and I found it really cute. Days after, I've been playing a song of the Strokes with my guitar that summarizes a lot our current situation and sent it to him... He didn't seem receptive so I quoted some lyrics that were relevant to me and this one was one of them: ""that's not just friendship that's romance too"".

It didn't have the expected outcome, he said that it was beautiful but he didn't really paid attention to my quotes. He right away told me that he saw I visited his LinkedIn profile yesterday and wanted to know why... Yeah I stalked his LinkedIn profile, but isn't it something that everyone does? He took it well, saying that men loved to be stalked but he seemed pretty cold after that, and made it clear (through private jokes that we have) that he didn't want more than sex with me. I mean, that's what I've interpreted but that seems pretty neat for me...

359,Theguywhodreams,1585359310,1,"As the title says, I am alone. I'm 36, and the only woman who ever payed attention to me left me in August of 2018. There was always a part of me that thought that I would end up this way and feared it. I always tried my best to always show love and compassion with everything that I've ever done. I never think of only myself, I honestly don't know how to. 

I've had brief conversations with people online, but it never fails that when I start developing feelings for that person, they always say that they don't feel the same way and I wind up with a broken heart, it's happened twice so far. People that I think that I can see a future with shatter me all over again. Of course I don't want them to know how deeply they've hurt me so I pretend everything is fine, even go as far to wish them luck in their ventures as I lay broken. I would never want to want them to feel hurt because they've broken my heart, but I'm so tired of giving my all to someone only to be met with rejection. Why can't anyone ever feel toward me what I feel toward them? 

I just moved into a new apartment and literally days afterward the quarantine happened. I've been shut off from pretty much all social contact. It's been so hard, I had a panic attack the other day because of all of this, the second one of my life. 

How many times can I do this? How many times can I give up pieces of myself until I'm empty? I love everyone, is it so hard for just person to love me back? Maybe I'm asking the impossible, maybe I should just resign myself to a life of longing and loneliness. Nihilism and I have never got along too well, but it could be time to become reacquainted. I don't want to suffer anymore and I don't know how to assuage that. 

Another thing, I'm tired of people telling me that I'm good looking or that I have a great personality. If either of those things were true life wouldn't be the way that it currently is.

I am 21M, and I am university student. So I have everyday interaction with people (not rn due to coronavirus but I mean like in global). Everything is like okay when I am at the uni, I hangout with people on classes and on breaks and stuff like that, you know. But I dont have anyone to hang out with besides uni. Like I dont have anyone to go out on Friday""s night, and weekend. Like everything is cool but no one ever asks me out. It makes me sad. Especially in those spring days (omg I loveee spring) when all coffee shops have their chairs outside and everything is perfect, sun is shinin' on me (DJ Khaled lol), beautiful girls(Sean Kingnston) and everything is just damn perfect. Everything except I dont have anyone to enjoy with. Sometimes I go to the downtown and just walk by myself, looking all the people enjoying and I really wish I have someone to enjoy as well. It is even worse on summer, when we have summer vacation. Whole summer alone. I ride bike, and watch other people have fun, whising I have fun too. Coffee shops are full, people are living their best, It makes me happy when I see people happy, but also when I came home, I realize again, I wish I can too. Also on summer, sometimes I lie to my parents that I am going out with my friends, just not to seem lonely. Then I go out and just walk by myself. I would really love to have someone I can talk to and tell all things on my mind, to let everything out of me. I am happy and sad in the same time.

I told her it was ok that it wouldn't affect our friendship and it probably won't change anything between us. 

She said it was probably because she is pretty much the only girl I interact with. I have been getting more introverted and shut in over the year which says a lot because I was always the quiet kid.... I still had my adventurous college days partying and dating somehow and all the times she was in my life she was always number 1. But it wouldn't make a difference bringing that up. Of course my default is callous and cruel so I can't blame anyone but myself that the vast majority if these feelings never made it out of my head. Actions have always spoken louder then words for me. Sure I was a jerk sometimes but out of all the humans I interact with I treated her the best and with the most consideration. 

She isn't even my ideal girl, I don't think I was ever truly madly in love but the flame that I hold for her will probably never go out. 

It's crazy for me when I about how it's been over 10 years.. sure I would switch between love and hate in between but that was more me trying to deal with unrequited love. I can say with certainty that I've never not felt anything towards her. 

I'll keep typing forever if I don't send this now. Im hoping reflecting like this will make trying to move on easier but I've never been good at that.(moving on) I've held grudges for years.

I am kinda cheesy and wrote lover letters, and little poems, and thought about all the nice things I could do but I never showed him. Later he told me how cute this other girl was and how he wished he could have sex with her. I went in the bathroom and cried, later that day I told him and he never responded to me again. I'm a lot better now but I just want that. I want someone to smile at me and tell me I'm pretty, I hold them when they are sad and they hold me, we play hard to get and laugh and joke about memes and talk about are lives, and even the little silly childhood stories are interesting.

I never realised how lonely I was until we broke up and within a week roughly I tried to take my life.
I'm a 16 year old bald guy (before the trend gtf) with messed up teeth and an even worse mental state and honestly I don't even know why I'm writing this.

I thought I loved her but as time passes it's clear to me that I didn't love her. I loved what I saw her as because I think subconsciously I was willing to overlook her flaws like lying and manipulating because it had been so long since I had been with someone. I hate feeling like that, it makes me feel shallow and just like a piece of shit in general.

I had been on my own for a pretty long time before I met her and both of my other ex's were cheating liars too so I really didn't trust people much and would constantly over think everything people said.

But for whatever reason I just forgot about it because I havent been happy in so long. Because I was happy I placed a lot of trust in her, told her a lot of things and this made it much more crushing when she just left all of a sudden.

It took me a little while to get over her, but as I said as shallow as it may sound, I'm pretty sure it was the idea of her that I loved. Not even sure why I'm posting this really just feel like someone should see it.

442,DuckyCharms404,1585290839,1,"Hiya everyone! Let me just get this out of the way. I have social anxiety, so making friends is pretty difficult as I come off as socially awkward and weird.   
I guess I could tell a little about myself..
I enjoy gaming (ps4 mainly), I enjoy watching movies, but I don't really enjoy it when I watch alone because I have no one to discuss the movie with. It's the same with watching videos on youtube. I have started getting back into ERBs (if you know you know). I enjoy listening to music. My playlist is all over the place, so I basically will listen to anything. 
I am open minded. I will talk about anything. Puns. Jokes. Conspiracies. ANYTHING! (As long as you don't get offended easily) 
Here is where I believe people will be turned away. I do make tiktoks out of boredom, and yes they are cringy but tiktok itself is cringy. 

So basically if you want an open minded, lonely, socially awkward friend.. message me. I'll talk to anyone. Any age. You could be male, female, alien, or zombie, and I will still find a way to talk to you!

Is it cause y’all feel you have to make the first move? 
Or that you can’t express your feelings to no one? 
I honestly don’t know. Cause women aren’t that bitter when a man doesn’t want them, I think that’s cause we turn our hatred more inward. And yes girls can get sex and attention from guys easier but is it always the attention that we want ? No. I could have 500 men behind me right now ready to date me and still feel lonely. Even my friends who have boyfriends say they feel uncared and lonely even in a relationship. I’m saying all this cause someone on here told me women can’t be lonely which made no sense btw. Anyone can feel lonely, don’t tell someone they can’t feel a certain way. And I know a lot of guys on here would die for some affection or a girlfriend but there’s also a massive majority of men who use women for sex and play them, cheat on them. And yes we could probably find someone new faster but when us women invest emotional in someone its extremely hard for us to detach ourselves from someone, I could talk to a guy all day long but if there’s no emotional connection I end up feeling lonely. And I know plenty of girls at my college who get ignored by guys or feel uncared about, I mean I myself have invested in a guy before who didn’t like me back and I spent like freakin 2 years trying to get over him. But I didn’t act bitter towards all men or get angry about it, really I just felt shit about myself. Don’t mean to be harsh here I really do sympathize with lonely guys. And of course not all dudes who are lonely act angry or bitter but a lot do. 
So I’m just curious as to how y’all feel, society has beaten in to young men’s brains that if they can’t get a girl their not a man, so I guess that’s why y’all are so scared to approach a girl because of rejection. But guys who can get girls throw that weight around and treat love like it’s nothing . So that makes me wonder if all guys just want a girl or sex as a ego booster but not actually find someone to have a true connection with. Let me know how y’all feel? Always be gently, I just want civilized reasonable responses.

The only thing that changed was I stopped directing my romantic intentions towards her, but suddenly all the things I said and did were considered annoying/being a bad friend, even though I'd always done them. The consistent negativity towards me and gaslighting became too much and I had to stop talking to her, but I still think about her. I wonder if we'd been able to figure out why suddenly everything I did was annoying to her, if we'd have been able to maintain our friendship? It really was a unique friendship, at least to me, and I'm sad I had to end it. But I just couldn't take being blamed for everything that wasn't my fault and being constantly told I was a bad person for things I'd always done, that had never bothered her before. I'm not saying I was perfect in our friendship, I certainly fucked up more my fair share, but I never gaslit her. I don't know. I think that was just the last straw for me. I couldn't take being called abusive when I was the one who the abuse was being aimed at. It's odd because I think she probably thinks it was all my fault and that I turned out to just be some arsehole. But I miss my best friend and I'm sad that I had to end our friendship. That's all this rambling is about really. I had to end the friendship because of how she was treating me but I don't feel any better for it. Towards the end our friendship made me feel like I wasn't worth anything, and that she was only talking to me because she didn't have a romantic partner to talk to. But now I just feel deeply lonely. 
Maybe that was our problem? I fixated my romantic interest on her for too long, and she used me as a surrogate for the romantic attention she needed when single, so when that stopped happening things broke down. I don't know? 
I don't even know why I rambling all this, I just didn't have anyone else to tell it to. It's not the full story, it's not even 1/100 of the full story, and I don't like airing my dirty laundry to other people, but sometimes you just need to get it out a little. 
Anyway, I know she's leaving for the army soon so I hope she does well in that and I, genuinely, hope she lives a happy life and is able to find whatever it is she's looking for.

How the hell am I always depressed with no reason, I want to ask for help but don’t know what to ask for. I feel like I’m too young to be feeling this way yet too old to act out the way some people my age do (21). No reason to be on my phone at all, I never stayed in contact with any friends. Old people at my job stay texting on their phones and to fit in I have to open up Facebook and take it off when someone passes by so I don’t accidentally strike up an unwanted conversation. I feel so alone yet act too antisocial to feel the way I am. I always think about the times “I felt happy” when in reality I never did, it’s just my mind accepting that I was less impacted by this feeling before.

457,hamartiated,1585282104,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

461,Loyalfrost,1585280267,1,"Just a random essay I wrote after watching Invisible Sister on Disney, great film btw, if you're here then you should deffo watch it lol. Here goes:

🌬❄️

People never talk about what they can’t see. Probably because it’s hidden in plain sight. Invisibility is all around us, even in the most familiar places. Both the seen and unseen, existing side by side. Arguably, we can't change it, no matter how much someone may want to.

❄️

I’m not the person everyone thinks I am. I’m the person with a mask. I’m the person who doesn’t even know what’s behind the mask. I’m the person too afraid to find out.

So; I’m the person nobody notices. I’m the person no one pays attention to. I'm the person who prefers to be alone. I'm the person who makes myself invisible. I'm the person who lives in the dark.

I’m the sarcastic one. I’m the person who may be too blunt. I’m the criminal but never the victim. I'm the person who only works in the blackest of days, the darkest of nights.

They say I’m the negative one, but I’m just the realistic once.

It's said that when you’re part of something bigger than yourself, it makes you better. But what if you’re not? I’m the invisible one, who’d prefer to face it alone. It’s easier to avoid and create a void, then it is to try and be seen. So I just embrace it, and welcome the abyss I’ve become accustomed to.

There’s a light. A light that only a few have. A light so bright that it attracts the attention of others like moths to a flame. It’s a light that spreads to others around them, emitting a powerful sonar like wave. This light finds the darkest corners of a person, and illuminates those areas.

But my light bulb is broken. I cannot do that. I cannot be optimistic about every little thing. I cannot help others feel what they’d like to feel. I help people feel what they MUST feel. I help people open their eyes to the painful truth of situations. I emit darkness.

❄️

Invisibility is everywhere. But the line between visible and invisible isn’t that wide. Transformation from one side to another is indeed possible. Invisible things can  enter the light, just as easily as visible things can step into the shadows.

What people see, what they really see, either the invisible or the visible, depends on us. Only when we are not afraid to show the world who we are, will we become truly visible. 

But until then, the shadows will be our home 🌑🎭",lonely,Invisible Essay,2020-03-27 14:37:47
462,DOOKIEFOOKIE,1585279243,1,"So, I'm a Canadian, living in Canada, in my home which is an hour north of the border. 15 years ago I was a Canadian living in the US. In a small quaint city about an hour South of the border. That is where I met him. The one who made me realize that I would never be happy with another. He was my person. 

But, I was a big city girl in a small town where I was an interloper. I came back home to Canada after a fiery 3 year romance with the one. 

We kept in touch, keeping the romantic feelings for each other, and supporting each other throughout our lives ups and downs. He was so close and yet so far... I didn't want to lose him. 

Sometimes we would go a few days without talking, and once after a STUPID fight neither of us can remember what was about, we did a few weeks of crushing silence and we agreed that it was the worst, promising to never be so hurtful to each other again. 

I had finally committed myself to going back, being his wife, because of all of my lofty dreams, I realized that they didn't matter if he was not a part of them. 

Then, this modern plague has come into the world. 

We didn't dare speak of the possibility that we would have to be separated, his life is there, I have obligations that keep me here, that I could not just walk away from...

This was not going to be easy.

Well, the new rules came out and they said DECIDE RIGHT NOW. What side are you going to choose? The clock is ticking. 

The world's longest non militarized border has now been closed since the beginning of its making. There is no end in sight,  and we will not be together, if ....God Please No! .... i can't say the words.... We are alone. Separated by an imaginary but very real line in the sand. 

I can't go to him, if he gets a cough. He will not be here when I am going to be saying my goodbyes. 

I have been alone.

471,TA_done,1585272350,1,"I've had enough. I've felt like this for way too long.


Gonna cut to the chase and jump back to September 2017, when I started a new high school for Year 10 (UK education system). I was 14 going 15, and had a fresh start along with everyone else, since they were taking Year 10 and above on board. Previously I hadn't really had a friendship group to hang with, so when I found people there I was so happy. I finally had people I could hang with. I finally had people I could open up to, be myself to, chill with. I was invited to outings. I had classmates. I had pals that would actually check up on me. I loved it.


Around February to March, 2018: someone in the group introduces this guy, from this point on I'll call him 'M'. I had talked to M a few times, but not enough to actually know him. We all thought he was a little strange at first, but gave him a chance. So, he sat with us, and became part of the group. Normal, right?

...right?


Somewhere around late-May to early-June, 2018: M starts to be a bit of a dick to me. I shrugged it off, as I thought ""Hey, maybe it's a rough patch he's going theough"" or ""Hey, maybe that's his sense of humour"". Oh, how wrong I was.


August, 2018: we're all on our summer break. M invites everyone in our group chat out, which meant me as well. Or, at least I thought. We hadn't gone out in a week or two, so I thought that this would be a cool time to chill. We go to an abandoned construction zone, and the majority of us have drinks. Except me and someone else in the group. Not as a ""party pooper"" kinda thing, just that I wasn't fond of the whole drinking and smoking thing at the time.

As I'm leaving, M is walking me back, and says ""Thanks for coming, even though you weren't invited."" I laughed it off, but remembered that. I knew he said that for a reason, and that proved right months later.

From that point, no one discussed meetups in the group chat, but there'd still be the group hanging out on Snapchat stories, doing funny and stupid shit. Without me.


November, 2018: two months into Year 11, and I hadn't been invited out again since the August hangout. I still sat in their group, but none of them asked if I wanted to go anywhere, or anything. They were discussing going out to a light festival that night, and I wasn't aware until one of the kids WHO ISN'T EVEN IN THE GROUP mentioned it in front of me, to which I asked about it. He said it wasn't much, just seeing what it was like, making it seem little. Later that same day, I overheard in the group ""How are we going to split the bill"", ""Who has fake ID"", etc. At this point, I don't know how to feel. Once I'm on my way home, I message the group asking why there were plans that didn't have my attention. Not aggressively, I simply said ""Are there plans without me?"" To which, I got responses such as ""TA_done you fucking idiot they were, we told you"", ""stop causing drama TA_done"", ""if you kick off about something so small I will literally rape your cat"". I stayed quiet, and watched the insults flood in. The morning after, they all left the group chat, and made a new one. Without me. How do I know? Well...


February, 2019: ...I know because throughout this time there are more meetups without my knowledge, more ""Check out this meme in the group chat"" which I clearly wasn't in, more of everything, without me. It took me up to this point, up to February to finally give up trying to keep in their friendship group. I sat alone. Up til June when my Year 11 exams finished and we left, I sat alone. No one to talk to me, to invite me out, to ask ""Hey TA_done, doing anything at the weekend?"", to ask about my feelings. Alone.


September, 2019: I start sixth form (aka college) alone, a new start to Year 12. Or so, I thought.

My sixth form doesn't have many people in, it has 40 students, 50 at a push. I didn't make friends. I have one person who I can talk to in a lesson, and by 'talk', I mean giving him the answers while he slacks off.


March, 2020, present day: I've found a girl online who weirdly likes me back, which is crazy. I've talked to her for almost two months, and she's not too far from me, but she's all I really have in terms of in-real-life interaction. Or so, I thought. I wanted to see her in April, but now it seems I can't. Why? Lockdown. So, here I was, thinking I'd actually hang with someone, maybe even ask them out, waiting for the moment, all to get blown by THIS STUPID FUCKING DISEASE

498,Pretend_Technician,1585252855,1,"It is I, your servant in naivety.

&amp;#x200B;

I am your regular loner, one friend on the counter, slowly becoming grimmer. My partner is no loser, however, life rolling down to the gutter like it always does, she's waging a tough war with survival. The battlefield straight up comes out of a catastrophe series: her parents spewing mad expectations, an economical crisis, her life on a thread of paychecks to paychecks, depression's bees. You know the drill. 

We used to make art together, write stories and worlds. Our imagination sprouted with life, death, and everything in between. Picture it! The perfect bond, sitting together, chattering about our latest creations, our latest ambitions. It felt nice, didn't it?

Then came the struggle, its power-up, our power-down, and life kicked us in the face.

Meltdowns have shaped our time together anew. Our castles of dreams turned into some crumbling houses of cards. Love still rides with us, though we don't smile so much anymore. We don't speak so much anymore, and when we do, it is never scar-less. She bursts into raging fury, I spit some passive aggressive comments, she tells me I'm a burden, I retort she's full of her overthinking brain... 

When we drop to our knees and admit to the sin of having being carried away, none can be erased anymore. 

I pat her back, I try to be there. After all, she's a lone soldier at war with the mad happenings of life. She flings her sword and shield, spins into the air, performs some mad karate, all the while I'm sitting here simply watching like the useless spectator I always am. Holding her through the swamp is the least I can do, no matter how objectively unnecessary, futile, vain.

 I make efforts, I comply to her wishes, I grow more and more patient - it is wildly surprising how patient one can be! She receives my comfort. We build her world together, we blab about it. Hell, I thought things were quite back to normal. How foolish! Any step to my side and she drops exhausted and unable to read, unable to listen. The request always finds her ""too busy"", ""too late"". When I bring it up, she acknowledges her fault, oh yes she does. She simply cannot find the stamina to walk towards me the same way I walk towards her. 

The ying and the yang, darkness and light, demons and angels, high and low, life and death, peace and conflict... One should have warned me relationships weren't on the list of perfectly balanced and symmetric entities. When the realization hit, I felt nothing. I stood eager to prove the world wrong! After all, a relationship is *hard work*. I felt proud of my supposed selflessness and as it always goes with selfish things, pride will keep it going for a while.

Truth is, it's gotten to me now.

The bees, the depression and its treacherous wasps buzzing around, threatening. They're hovering at my threshold, darts starting to itch. Even more so, they've cut the communication lines, made them jittery with crap. Were I to reach out to my beloved, she'd only receive the white noise that gets on one's nerves, annoying.

I feel forgotten. Sure, I understand how draining it might be to go out of your way when all isn't right around you. Yet, where am I to go, while I wait for her? I have no one else. I only have her. Who else would ever commit to listening to my *self* while it expresses itself? No one. I do not want to disappear completely. And even then, how could I blame her? She's not responsible for all that crap the universe dumped on her face. 

It sucks to be lonely when you're not alone. Even more, when around the one you love.

&amp;#x200B;

I swore an oath. While she cannot love me the way she used to anymore, I shall try and love myself in her stead. I shall continue to art, for myself. I shall cherish the fleeting moments of happiness with her, stay patient, and bond with someone else while she carries her triumphant armour out of the rubble... This someone being Myself.

504,Winter-Gazelle,1585238378,1,"First serious relationship girlfriend just broke up with me, looking back i shouldve seen it coming more, but we had always had a problematic relationship and i honestly felt really secure in it, like no matter what we would be ok because we cared about each other. It was kind of a shock because i went from that safety net to her not wanting to talk to me at all. No big incident just after a week where i was particularly absent mentally she apparently had enough time to think it out and decided she actually had disliked the past months. 

Was a massive shock to suddenly not be able to talk to her at all. I do a bit but she doesnt want any discussion on anything significant. I was / am shattered, although over the past week since it happened ive gotten over that constant feeling of just having an anchor in my chest, like something awful has just happened, but constantly.

Also talking to her since then, since it took me some time to realise just how serious she was idk, i guess today is really the first day ive truly realised how done it is. Maybe we get back together in the future but thats like, only if we literally become friends again and build it up right from the bottom. And i know thats a dumb idea but i really want to haha. However she kind of doesnt ? she refuses to say she wouldnt date me again, but damn just the way she ended it, idk my first break up i suppose its a big learning curve. 

Plus since she wants so much space, she has been doing stuff with what was my group of friends. Hers too, but i knew them all from highschool. Ive kind of just been sitting here. No one has messaged me. I know they all know. No one is inviting me to stuff. Even right now two of my highschool friends are doing stuff with her.

I dont really care so much about that tbh. Like i do i guess, but i value them so much less than i valued her.

Anyway what i really wanted is to branch out right now. I need to do my own thing meet new people. Im sick of just the lame 'gamer' discord shit. The slight tension in calls and really what feels like people with shit tons of time just hanging out because they have nothing to do.

I want to start a sport haha, maybe try out surfing again. There was a chess club i took down the number for. But im pretty sure all of that stuff is on hold because of corona virus atm. Im sick of reaching out to people. I have some people i consider good friends unrelated to all thhis stuff. But im a bad friend in that if i only renew contact with them about this kind of shit then idk. Its barely a friendship just a degrading boat.

I really want her back but, ive said everythihng i possibly can. It was left off just as, lets just do what makes us happy then and if we grow close thats good, if we stay apart then ok. and she was happy i got it i guess. She does want time so eh.

512,pratikrenuse022,1585228251,1,"Hey all, 

I hope I am allowed to post this and please excuse me if I am too direct. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suffered from social loneliness years back and got out of it with the help of mentors and working on myself. Now, after having a stable career, I intend to give back to the society and make a difference to people's lives, just the way some of my mentors did. 

For this, I have worked under some of the best coaches in the world (Deepak Chopra, Vishen Lakhiani, Tony Robbins Team) to create a course which would help end a person's social loneliness in less than 12 weeks. 

We are looking for 10 volunteers who would be coached by us during these 12 weeks, completely online with the goal to end their social loneliness. The seats for these 10 students have already been paid for, so you would not be paying any money. 

Please reach out to me for further details.

Let's end loneliness together

551,Little_Okami,1585196384,1,"So to make a long story short I have been in a relationship with current S.O. for coming up on 4 years this July. Within the first year I made the mistake of talking to someone else intimately and they found out. I felt awful I genuinely did, and now fast forward to the present and I just recently found out two weeks ago they've been cheating on me for 4 months and saying some pretty awful things about our relationship ""I'm the worst thing that's ever happened to him,"" ""he asks himself daily why he's still with me"" and other things like directly letting his 'mister' say I'm ugly with my S.O. agreeing. 

He told me this was all just 'venting' and he didn't mean any of it. Well 2 weeks after all this things are getting better, we are both getting back to being happy with each other but pretty much any day where my S.O. works (typically from 9-5 or 6) they come home and often won't speak to me or show any interest in doing anything together/being affectionate unless I go out of my way to engage. He's told me that I'm just ""over thinking"" because I told him I get that he likes when I make the effort to show him affection, I just wish he'd show me some. 

So I guess my real issue and why I feel this way is the combination of those things with the fact that he met his 'mister' in a group similar to this one and he has since promised me he hasn't spoken to them but I know he's still on reddit daily and still in the groups where he met the person he cheated on me with and is meeting new people daily. He has someone new to talk to EVERY single day and I don't really have any friends that I talk to on a daily basis I spend most of my day alone or talking to the 5 friends that I have in total IF any of them happen to be on discord. I just don't really feel like I have any friends and when I'm alone I tend to get lost in my thoughts and I really hate having that happen cause I have a really hard time staying positive and my thoughts just remind me of how I'm not even my S.O's first choice of person to spend time with.

555,hamartiated,1585195465,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-03-26 15:04:25

572,lisucc,1585188310,1,"I got broken up with recently. It was a relationship that ended in part due to my mental instability and issues caused by my trauma. Since being locked up inside cause of the virus, I've had nothing but free time to ruminate on it and feel guilty about how I ruined everything for us. I hadn't dated for years before meeting this guy, and I finally felt like someone loved me. At times, it felt like he was the only person who loved me, and that was enough. But you can probably predict how that went wrong. I became codependent on him, constantly seeking validation and taking out my sadness on him when I couldn't manage my depression and anxiety. I admit that at times, things I said to him were probably emotionally abusive. I feel so, so ashamed of acting the way I did, because he was very clearly unequipped/inexperienced to deal with someone who has mental illness and felt overwhelmed and frustrated with me when I was this way. Towards the end of our relationship, he told me multiple times that he didn't have time for me anymore and that I was stressing him out constantly. Pathetic as I am, I begged him to stay with me, even though deep down I knew it wasn't right for me to do that. Eventually it just got to a point where he completely stopped caring about me and told me that we were over. He said we were never getting back together and that he didn't even want to be friends with me. Absolutely nothing to do with me.

I came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/foa8yz/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_way_your_parents/) on [r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/) that accurately describes how I am, in this context particularly the points about being ""unsure how to handle your emotions properly"", ""heavily reliant on others emotionally"", ""too clingy with people who give you positive attention"", and ""jealous and explosive"". All of these things are a direct result of the way my parents were mentally &amp; emotionally abusive towards me my whole life. Because of them, I never learned how to maintain healthy relationships with people I love. It is also what has caused me to have severe depression.

I know that anyone reading this will probably tell me, ""you need to work on fixing your trauma and managing your mental illness better before being in a relationship"", ""you need to love yourself before loving someone else"" etc. I know you're 100% right that I need to do that. But right now I just feel... so empty and ashamed of myself. I am so fucking lonely. No family and no friends to uplift me when I feel sad. He was my person and I blew it. Now I have absolutely no one but myself, and I hate myself for being the way that I am. If I knew how to have a healthy relationship without the effects of all this shitty trauma I wouldn't be here right now. I've been feeling suicidal nearly every day (although I have no intention of acting on it) and I cycle between feeling numb and crippling sadness and guilt.

So I ask, how do I even start fixing myself? How do I get over this immense guilt I feel? Will I ever be able to have a relationship, as broken as I am? Right now, everything reminds me of him and I can't bear it. I probably think about him 1000 times a day and get upset.

I was bullied when I was a kid, bullied when I was a teen too. I never had friends as I kid - I somehow managed to not fit in to any group, including nerdy groups that suited me.

In university I was put in a house with people no one would want to be friends with - drug dealers. I tried to make friends with the people in my classes but they were creative writers and very eccentric. Depressed, emos, you name it.

I now have a job with very sociable, young people. And even though I’m very friendly with them at work, I still feel incredibly lonely. I do nothing except go to work, go home and watch youtube videos. If I had friends I’d be going out with them every day, as much as possible. But I have none so have nothing to do. When I go places alone it only serves to make me more depressed.

I was getting good at chatting on dating apps. Perhaps getting a girlfriend would make me feel less alone. And lucky me that’s when coronavirus starts spreading, so meeting up for dates is now off the table.

Now we’re being forced to isolate, and would you believe I’ve actually been more social snd gotten out the house more since I was placed in quarantine. My life has been utterly uneventful and shit.

Does anyone relate? Did it get better for you?",lonely,Feel like the universe hates me.,2020-03-26 08:13:20
600,catowner85,1585170435,1,"I turned to this because it seems to be my last resort.  And I'm going type whats in my heart and in my mind and take this as a diary. If anyone is kind enough give me encouragement or help me out. It is greatly appreciated.

I bought a house with my gf 2 years ago. And things went south. I wont go in to the details that led to our break up.  But when she changed jobs, she found a new circle of friends and I was never included in it. My job was to demanding and it took up a lot of my time.  Over time we found out that we are really different from another and it was only a matter of time that we would have broke up.  The problem is we have dogs together and neither of us wants to lose them. She and I are still friends despite broken up. Everything is civil in the house. But it is incredibly hard on me seeing her have a life without me.

I'm an extremely introvert person.  I'm a homebody and I suffer from social anxiety. I don't have any friends of my own, outside of work and they work on different schedules than I do. I'm a nerd deep down and I never met anyone like me to be honest.  I have nobody to relate to and its frightening that I dont have much of a reason to step outside of the house.  I'm afraid of not finding a community that I can find my own, let alone find someone to start having a relationship all over again.   I don't know where to start and I feel like a complete loser.  And I have no choice but to see my ex going out every evening to be with her friends. Even more so, when one of her friends has asked her out. 

The whole situation has been extremely devastating for me. I dont have any human connection with anyone anymore. I'm 35 and I feel like I wasted 5 years of my life and never focused on myself.  This past monday I had multiple panic attacks.  I fought one off when I was walking my dogs one afternoon. And I nearly passed out in the shower because I was hyperventilating really bad.

Before the suggestion is raised. Neither of us can move out. This post is about that I never had a life outside of work or our relationship. I have nothing to distract myself or keep myself busy.  I'm to depressed to even enjoy my hobbies right now.  I don't know how to enjoy my life due to social anxiety.

My ex does want me to find someone that will make me happy.  As pathetic as it is, she is still my friend and has comforted me and wants to help me. But I don't think she really grasps the situation i'm in.   I don't want to go through online dating. I've tried that in the past and it never worked. Its really exhausting, and just thinking of it caused me to have anxiety. I still attempted it and well....here I am...anxiety driven, depressed and on the verge of breaking down.

I feel like a former shell of myself after the break up and I'm desperately trying to find a purpose in my life without her. And i'm coming up empty.

I'm single as fuck and lonely as shit. dont know really where to post this, but I just wanted to let my problems out and ask for a small prayer.. if you're reading this, thank you.. within 3 years, I've lost my dad, brother in law, best friend and my step dad.. My gf of 5 years left me 4 months after my brother died.. we were probably gonna get married if I didn't fuck it up.. I over came a bad oxy addiction, 2 years clean now.. My gf probably wouldn't have left me if it wasn't for my addiction.. and now having to deal with this corona virus shit, which I am praying will level out soon, as my heart goes out to everyone during this time.. I lost my brother, July 17th 2016, in a very brutal horrorfying way, it's very tragic, and not something I talk about with ease.. My best friend died of a heroin over dose, February 3rd, 2017, fucked up thing is he had same birthday as my Dad, July 25th, and died on my mom's birthday February 3rd... My dad had a stroke several years back, he was paralyzed, and also an alcoholic, he would have seizures if he didn't drink.. Me and my sister were helping take care of him, and having to change your dad's clothes and help with bed sores is not fucking easy.. he died November 28th 2018, which in turn his 1 year of passing was thanksgiving last year.. My step dad passed, November 22nd 2019, one week before my dads 1 year... After my Dad died, there wasn't any life insurance, his house went into foreclosure... I had almost empty my savings, $10k, to do a small memorial, and save the house.. a few months later my car blew up, had to by a new one, that was $5k.. and then the same week, I got arrested for a DWI, I had a BAC of .04, was barely half the legal limit, and they still issued a blood warrant, the lawyer cost me $3k.... I only drank a beer and shot of bourbon, as you can imagine I thought a drink was in order... and now after emptying my savings, broke, this pandemic hits.. luckily I'm self employed, I'm a tattoo artist and surprisingly people still wanna get tatyooed, but it definitely puts me at risk, but our shop knows about infectious diseas and proper precautions and we have sanitization and protective supplies... i make decent money as I'm pretty popular tattooer in my area, but with my sister losing her husband and single mom with kids who've lost their dad, I help them as much as I can, so saving money isn't so easy.... and now with the pandemic, I'm praying I have enough cash to last a little bit.. we aren't on lockdown yet, but I fear it's coming.. No idea where all this is going, but I just wanted to let it out.. it's hard to believe as it's been so much shit in literal sense, but I'm hoping everything works out and gets better because honestly I don't know how much more I can fucking take.. all i want out of this world, is a loving wife and couple kids, and my career.. if it wasnt for art and tattooing, i dont know how i wouldve made it this far.. thank god for art and tattooing.

some time ago i was searching in this online chat group checking random peoples profile

then i saw this profile that was belong to a beautiful girl

a tomboy

i love short hair its really beautiful on a girl

you see this country im living is not like that

i live in iran

you cant have any form of relation or friendship with the opposite gender that easy

its against the most old families rule

but i liked that profile i saw

so i called my best friend the owner of that group and told him to prepare a some kinda meeting for me with this girl

he told me that she was lesbian and i said its ok i liked what she wrote in her profile and i wanna meet her

we met

she told me that she was not lesbian and she was bisexual

so we became friend

and she was the best person i have ever met

i started to have feelings for her but i knew she had a girlfriend and she never was with a boy

2 weeks after we met

i decided to leave her alone because i didnt want to hurt her or her girlfriend

so the next time i saw her i told her everything

i was about to leave but she said that she had the same feelings

she told me that there was no love between her and her girlfriend anymore

she said she loves me

after a week she broke up with her girlfriend and became my girlfriend

we were in love

i loved her more than anything in my life

my biggest happiness was when she was happy

weve done a lot of things together  

we were the closest friends and the most lovely couple

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

but then

everything went wrong

she left me for her ex-girlfriend

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

the same person that i was about to leave for her's and my love's happiness

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

but this time i could not think of living without her

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i did everything

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

it didnt work

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

for 3 month

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i cryed every night

and screamed every day

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

my friend's girlfriends called me time to time and comfort me :""we were jealous of her... dont blame yourself its not your fault...""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

my grandfather

the most important person im my life died of coronavirus during this 3 month

and i had the virus too

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i lost my job

i lost many family members

i failed my studies

i was not good

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

after 3 month

she sent me a massage

""do you still buy items ?"" im not gonna explain my job here

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

the hope

the light

could i just hear her voice one more time ?

can i tell her that i love her one more time ?

before anything happens ?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3 days we talked in pm about random pointless things

like 5 minute whole

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and then my friend the one who prepared our first meeting in the first place

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

convinced her that i shared her privite photos and i make fun of her and her family and her body

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

the photos he took while we were unaware

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

his plan was so perfect and predetermined that i couldnt do anything

why he did that to me and her ? i dont know

he asked me about her bef

and i was so dumb that i answered him because he told me that he will bring her back to me

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

you dont know how much does it hurt when the person you love the most shakes in anger while screams your name and tell you that she hates you

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

her friends wanted me dead

her brother wanted me dead

she said that she wants to see me in pain

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i couldnt defend myself

i couldnt convince her

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

he had everything planned to crush me

my best friend

we raised together

we were brothers

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

my only hope of living was that someday i may see her again

i loved her

&amp;#x200B;

now look how much hope i have left

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i committed suicide

i just ate lots of random pills

this is it

&amp;#x200B;

im writing this to idk who and why

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

but i died

my own stupidity killed me

my best friend killed me

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i was a pianist

i was a gamer

i was a movie fan

i was a book fan

i was a goldsrc mapper

i was studying Psychology

i was a strong man

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and after a long time in my life

i had peace

i was in love

i had a person to live for

a reason to fight

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

but look at me now

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

im worthless

im hopeless

im dead

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

the pills will start working in an hour or two if in any chance i lived

i will take that as a hope but thats impossible

I've also started having lucid dreams where I am with a faceless person and am enjoying all of the little things that comes with being in love, like lazing around entangled with each other ect.

I have had some women tell me I am being stupid and that if I only got out there I'd do just fine, but I can't let myself, I literally get a fight or flight response and feel like I am going to pass out from the fear. Neither therapy no meds have helped me.

It would be an anonymous messaging app with no messages saved. I just think in this growing world that it would really help if people had an easy tool to connect really connect with others.

631,throwaway16012011,1585135467,1,"I never felt like someone actually cared about me. Besides the people who blatantly played my emotional weaknesses, others seemed to be nice until suddenly (at least to me) they stopped being nice. Just like they milked me enough and wanted to get rid of me.

I hoped I would get to interact more with other people now (online of course) since everyone is forced to stay home, but it's even worse than before, what's left for me is sleeping too much, doing some work, criticizing myself for sleeping too much, playing LoL or overwatch the with 1-3 people who sometimes join me in Discord and then try to sleep again.

Meanwhile other people seem to have fun mentioning their friends in Instagram stories or doing video calls with multiple people, I don't seem to be one of these friends. I think I get more notifications from Duolingo than I get from the so-called 'social media'. My WhatsApp conversations feel like a wasteland. Even worse when it comes to females. I have zero female people I'm in regular contact with. It hurts.

I wish I could at least use this time to do the things I wanted to do: read, learn more French, educate myself in psychology, but I don't even feel like doing that anymore. I'm just wasting time instead. A small part of me is hoping that our current society gets destroyed by the virus so that the people who survive can re-build everything on reasonable grounds.

Why do I have such radical thoughts? Probably because I've realized (other people of course may have other opinions) that we'd rather hold on to shallow, imaginary concepts than solving the real issues.
Not only our leaders, but millions of people are rather interested in the economy, the stock market, in God and religion. All of these things are made up by humans. Humans are just lucky that they subjugated the Earth. We would never be able to destroy the Earth though, only ourselves. 

This makes me sick. Combined with the pain I've suffered in the last years, it made me scream at my mother and brother yesterday. My mother hurt me so much by, in a combined effort with my father who's not living with us anymore, ruining the only serious relationship I had in my entire life. I never told her that and even yesterday, when I screamed unspeakable things to her, she didn't seem to care about what she did.

My brother is a thankless bastard. He only learned to take things, not giving anything back. That behavior dramatically increased because, although he's younger than me, he was my parents' favorite child. Even now my mother is doing everything to give him what he wants while I've been voluntarily working for years to stand on my feet by running a decent online business, almost finishing my university studies and organizing almost everything in my life on my own. 
My brother happily takes anything I'm sharing with him, including my Spotify or Netflix account. But he never (literally) shares anything with other people. I could say many more things but it seems clear to me that he's got a very distorted opinion on what a family should be like.

People say 'if you see one asshole in the morning, that's an asshole but if you see assholes all day, you're the asshole'. Maybe I am. And everyone would probably agree on that. 'Look how you screamed at your poor mother dude!', that's what most people would think. 
Part of me wants to apologize for screaming and swearing. But then, what's the point? I don't see any point. 

I'm just stuck here for the next weeks. Maybe I'm even in the wrong sub because I'm not really lonely. Sadness and great rage are with me most of the time.",lonely,what's the point of everything?,2020-03-25 22:24:27

So I thought maybe I'd make a post and see what a random person on the internet thinks (considering I'd never tell someone I know personally about this).

Currently a freshman in college, working part-time to pay for gas n shit, and getting my hours cut because of the outbreak.

To get right to the point, I feel things that I don't understand, but from what I can understand it's just loneliness catching up to me. Every since kindergarten I've had one friend, I'll call him Will (not real name), funny enough he's still basically my only friend. Sure I have other people I talk to and play games with, but Will is literally the only person I talk to on Snapchat. My whole life I've never understood how to talk to people, spending most of my time just reading books by myself every day. I know I desire actually attention, any at all, and I guess that's led me to always try to be funny. No matter the situation I am always trying to think up some way to make people laugh. Even while I'm tossing fries I tell a joke basically every few minutes, usually just ending with confusion or a short chuckle.

But to address the title, loneliness and anxiety are beginning to drown out everything else in my life as to the few people around me I am simply an acquaintance. 

I don't know how to keep friends or even how to make friends. Heck my last and (basically) only relationship ended because I was so worried about not knowing how to ack around her that I ended up (literally) subconsciously avoiding her.... 

I just want even a few people to actually give a damn if I exist, and maybe even for just one person to love me (but it's hard to believe that's even possible for someone like me). I don't know how to talk to people face to face but I'm so tired of being alone and desperately trying to get attention the one person I know how to talk to (even though I'm basically their verbal punching bag).
I only ever came out to one person about how lonely I was, years ago I broke down on a youth group trip because even though I had know all the other kids for years, I didn't really talk to any of them much and barely remembered any past interactions and even some of their names (keep in mind I saw these people every single week for years). But I ended up opening up to my youth group leader about my loneliness, but nothing every came of it and I stopped going to the meetings after that.

To be honest I want to have a small group good friends, I want to laugh with them, hangout with them, have fun conversations with them, heck maybe even be loved by one of them. I may be an extremely introvert, but even I crave human contact after all these years. It's just from my perspective I don't see ever happening.

Sorry I know that was an insanely long post and basically a pitty party. But this is just my life situation and I want to better myself. Any advice is greatly appreciated",lonely,Anyone know to to not be a lonely perma-acquaintance?,2020-03-25 19:23:33

647,Onelastmessage11111,1585121967,1,"This past December I met this girl online. Actually met her here on reddit. We started talking, eventually started talking on skype pretty regurually. For the past 2 months (at least) we have been talking on the phone for hours almost ever night. Sometimes about serious stuff, sometimes joking around, sometimes watching tv together.   


I don't have a lot of experience with women, just one ex. I felt like I could be myself with her, I could be dorky and she enjoyed my sense of humor. We were both religious and took it seriously so we could talk about that stuff as well. On top of that we share some tramua. I had sever health problems when I was younger, no one I knew understood what it felt like. Even years later its predominantly altered how I view the world. I know what its like to be unable to eat, I know what it feels like to want to die because your body is in such horrific pain, I know what its like for doctors to not be able to figure out why, I know what its like to be dependent on family because you can't work. I eventually got past my health issues and was able to move out on my own and live a fairly normal life. no one who meets me would ever guess what Ive been through.   


This woman though, she is now where I was back then. Horrific pain, struggles to eat, all of it. The result was, well I didn't realize quite HOW MUCH it had shaped me until I got to know her. It was like talking to the female version of myself. We were so different, yet so the same. I felt like someone finally understood me, that I didn't have to hide myself and that I could let my guard down and just be me.   


I always wondered what we were doing, could it ever work? We talked about it and had more or less decided to just see what happens. I care for her, I worry about her with her health issues. I loved talking to her, it was the highlight of my day. I loved watching tv shows together, or sharing memes with each other, just spending time together (even if on different sides of the country).   


it wasn't all good though. She had some problems. She lives with her parents and it was a toxic situation. Her parents are controlling and manipulative. She is DEEPLY emmeshed with them.  They still treat her like a child and occasionally i would hear them talk to her and they were demaninig to her. They spoke to her like you would to a SMALL child. She was afraid of them, afraid of their anger (though she said they had never hit her). She struggled to talk about her feelings because all her life people had dismissed them or even verbally attacked her for her views. She didn't feel valued.   


Another problem was timing. With her health issues she had insane sleep problems, she was basically nocturnal. i have a fairly normal life so I can't stay up to 4am talking and she was rarely online before 11pm. Most of the time she was getting online at around 1am. But when we talked it was worth it. There were days where she would get on earlier and we would talk 8 hours or more.  It sounds insane but somehow...we did. Ive never met someone I could be like that with. I never met someone who wanted to talk to me that much.   


As this pandemic hit and I started staying at home, she became even more important to me. At night I tend to get stressed about all this stuff and we would talk, we could confide in each other about our worries. Just talking to her was comforting.   


well this afternoon I got a message from her. Her parents have been pressuring her not to talk to me. Like I said, they are controlling and manipulative. They don't want her talking to anyone online. They threated to come take her phone and read all her messages. She sent me one last message saying that she had to block her contracts and delete skype/reddit/everything. They are making her if she doesn't they are taking her phone (They still pay for it so I guess they think that gives them the right to treat her however they want). I didn't get any closure, Ididn't even get to fucking say goodbye.   


we have been talking for an average of 4 hours a night for MONTHS. I deserve more than a long message where she says she is sorry but she has to cause her parents are making her. She should stand up for herself, but Ive been in her position. I had controlling parents paying my bills due to health issues who held it over my head.  I know how big of a threat that can be. I'm angry at her, but mostly I'm angry at them. She is an amazing person, honestly one of the most amazing people Ive met. She has a beautiful personality and these people are pressuring her to do things that she doesn't want to do. They think its their fucking right to determine what ""influences"" her . Fuck them ,they are shitty people.   


Now I have no one. I have plenty of friends but no one I could talk to like I could her. No one I could share things I was excited about with like I could with her. No one who felt as i did about things, no one like her. I didn't even know someone like her existed.   


Now its 2:30am and I can't talk to her. I can't watch a tv show with her. I already miss her. I felt isolated before, but now I feel completely and alone.

The vague delusion that someone would care makes me feel better, so since I just can’t sleep and feel so hopeless makes me think this might be a good idea. I feel forever heartbroken, and I feel empty. I searched online for tips and stuff bc I feel like talking about it with my friends  just makes things worse for me in a way. And online just mention to keep yourself busy and have goals and go to the gym and shit like that. And I actually did those things but when you are alone, in your bed, 2am in the morning, everything comes back. And makes me think I made cero progress at all I’m just distracting myself as hard as I can’t because I can’t bear the truth. I lost my best friend and the person I loved the most. There’s a pierce the veil song which says “my love for you was bulletproof but you are the one who shot me” and it really does applies. Few years ago. Sometimes I don’t think about it. And sometimes it hits me like a truck. I feel so bad for still caring you have no idea. I even feel guilt for writing this right now. I can’t talk about it with anyone, because everyone gets heart broken once, and most people get over it you know, so what the hell is wrong with me. He was my best friend for so long that the place he left is too big to replace, even years after. And sometimes I tell myself that life is too short and I should talk to him but holly shit he did some bad shit to me so that would be stupid.  And I’m like, okay. I can’t talk to him because it would be stupid to go back to the place I got so hurt. And also I can’t sleep at night not doing anything. So like what the fuck should I do. It’s like, it’s hell anyway so I should just choose one hell and bare with it, but I refuse to believe this is what’s left for me the rest of my life. And I know rest of my life sounds dramatic but YEARS have passed and I swear I can still feel him. Feel his hug, and feel the hurt like it was yesterday. It also makes me think about how fucking amazing love is because it really transcends logic and time you know? That’s something awesome I guess. But I feel like any goal that I achieve won’t fucking matter. I feel like any friend would be SO disappointed at me if I tell them this. Like omg get over it. And I completely understand. And I feel so alone. So, so fucking alone. My life feels like a lie, like all I care about is if he stills think about me as I do. If he gives a fuck. If my death would matter to him. I actually thought about suicide in a form of revenge but I understood how wrong I was And I just wanted to say, we are completely fucked but at least we are fucked together, and I guess, maybe we have to make our life a big ass distraction to keep going but I’m here for you.

They can't afford to live nearby due to work. She really misses my mom especially, even though they talk everyday. Please post advice and resources or links and I will send it to her. Thanks, everyone, much appreciated!

**This is what I told her today and have before (but it keeps happening):** 

1. When she misses us, reach out.
2. When the loneliness gets worse, try to figure out what made it worse and do something about it instead of ignoring it. For example if she misses her nieces and newphews, call them. 
3. Once you figure out why it's worse, like the stress of quarantine and worry: realize that like most things in life, that this pandemic is temporary. 
4. Ex: She worried about me because I'm starting a  new job healthcare, and I assured her that I'm educating myself and taking precautions like eveyrone else, as best I can with the resources we have available. Another example: she worried about stress eating, weight gain, and running out of dairy free food for her daughter who has severe allergies to dairy. So I  gave her some simple recipes to make it herself, with ingredients she already has. For the stress eating, I sent her an article.
5. Most of all, if she is extra lonely, then reach out even more, not less! Call the people you're concerned about. After all, we miss her too. It's extra hard for her because she had never been on her own before she got married, and she never adjusted. I told her we miss her too because she's the baby in this family. She was the last to leave home. So when she got married I m issed her so much that  I called more not less.

As for me:

* I always promise to call more often but I'm so busy! How do I teach her to help herself emotionally even when we are not physically present? None of us can travel for a long time. So  She really needs to learn to cope emotionally but can't afford therapy.
* Did I miss anything? What else can I do to help? I already let her know I love and  miss her too.   The pandemic has been making emotions more intense for her and a little for me, too.

666,Lockshala,1585109977,1,"This is silly. I have had very few people dislike me. My boyfriend has commented that everyone he's ever introduced me to has liked me and asks about me. My parents and brother say the same. The friends I do have usually say that too. My coworkers and boss have also pointed out that I'm popular with my students/parents/management. 

I have like maybe four actual friends, and I don't see any of them more than once a month. I don't really understand how to make friends... I know how to be there for people, to make people laugh, to make them feel welcome. But I'm not sure how you make friends, honestly. If I invited anyone to my birthday (besides bf), I don't know who I would invite. 

I've asked my people what it is about me that seems unapproachable, and they said that I'm a try hard or overly helpful/hostess-y and it can be intimidating. That I always remember people and always offer to help and it feels disingenuous. An example my boyfriend stated was when his roommate came out as trans, and she asked me to take her clothes shopping. He said that she was weirded out how I kept finding outfits for her and my bf but not myself. 

But thing is... it is genuine. I love to help, I love to make people happy. I've tried toning it down, but that makes me feel like a huge jerk. 

How do you make friends?

667,hopelessromantic_99,1585109732,1,This is so hard to talk about but I guess you could say I’ve never been the guy who’s been confident or good at anything as a kid I was always the fat weird uncoordinated kid who was picked last for sports and wasn’t good at anything anyway when I was 12 I started liking this girl but I really liked her and she told me to ask her out and I did and she basically said no I barely talked to anyone the rest of that year I ended up liking another girl later that year and I wrote her a poem let’s just say that was social suicide. Anyway I went back to liking the first girl and I asked her out a total of 23 times we ended up becoming what I thought was friends by the time I was 13 we talked almost every day and I really liked her she was the only girl who was nice to me and I just connected with her I played tennis with her every year and she was just amazing. Anyway fast forward to when we were 15 I texted her over Christmas break and she didn’t respond like ever I was confused as hell I ended up making the mistake of calling her a bitch for ignoring me for no reason. She hated me she didn’t talk to me for six months then she finally forgave me and we became fake friends again. All was good until the summer before our junior year when she got a bf. I got so jealous I bitched to her about it because she had rejected me so many times. It took a few months but I was finally ok with it and we became fake friends again. I still saw her every day and I talked to her when I could. Shoot forward to senior year when we were 18. We were at the peak of our fake friendship but we had reached graduation. I knew we wouldn’t see each other much anymore but I hoped we’d stay in contact. The truth was she didn’t care about me at all so when we got to college I tried to talk to her but she never responded finally one day I cracked. I got hammered I texted her a bunch of angry crap and I told her I loved her. The morning after I got calls asking if I was ok apparently she thought I was gonna kill myself. That started my depression. I tried apologizing to her and making things right but she ended up blocking me prob for my own good. Anyway I’ve been depressed since then and I haven’t been able to find a girl since. I became suicidal a year ago when I realized I’ll never love another girl like her. She’s my everything she’s all I can think about even to this day. I just know that I’ll never find a girl like her again and I know I’ll never find a relationship. I’m still fat and ugly and weak.

671,hamartiated,1585107074,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I thought all the BS on social media was probably part of the problem and anyway, I was so tired of all the arguing. So I took a scorched earth approach to social media--wiped it all out. No more FB, Twitter. I told myself I was going to get Out, do more, meet people, no matter how painful it was. Then.... the Virus. Quarantine. Wow. God was trying to tell me something. 

I hadn't been on Reddit for a long time and thought that might help me connect during this difficult time. I just made this account last night. So far I have been : Down voted to Hell for asking, ""Newbie: What's the acronym the poster just used?"", going down to actual negative karma--for asking a simple question. Rejected by another sub to actually make 'friends' that was building a chat community because they only want people 18-26 in their circle jerk--it's the net, how the hell do you know how old people are anyway? Down voted for trying to be helpful to another poster and give emotional support. And feel unwelcome at another sub because it's so male centric women, I guess, aren't really welcome even though the actual hobby is non-gender oriented. It's been a struggle on every single sub I've joined all day. 

So I guess God is trying to tell me something. People are truly assholes on every level and I'm beginning to see why I'm 'lonely'. People really, really suck. They're just mean. Why in the hell would I want to be around people when all they do is shit on everyone around them? 

But anyway, I needed to vent that out before I go to bed because, my job also sucks, and everyone there sucks and I don't like any of them either, and I can't get out of going because I'm 'essential', so I don't even have that comfort of being alone tomorrow for my current pity party; I have to go to work and deal with more assholes. Yes, I know I'm engaging in a righteous pity party right now. Fuck it. I need a good pity party once in a while. Christ knows, no one else wants to party with me, even on the internet.

683,FLguy94,1585093803,1,"Warning in advance: this will be a long text. Maybe someone will read it, maybe not.  
So here is my story: I'm a 25 year old guy and I've been an extrovert all of my life. I never had trouble to talk to people or make new friends. I talk a lot and I always find some interesting topics to discuss. I go out a lot and I love getting to know people. I also have a pretty healthy self-confidence, at least I always thought so.   
But over the last years, I lost hope, bit by bit.   
The problem is: I don't understand the concept of love. Either because I've never been loved (romantically), or because I have a vision of love where real life just can't keep up.   
Everytime I meet some woman I like, I completely overthink it and I idealize her so much, that it's over even before I really get to know her.   
I am SO afraid of dissapointment, that I can't enjoy falling in love at all. Everytime it happens, I just think: ""Oh no, not this shit again"". Because I know I will be dissapointet and heartbroken in the end, that's what always happens, every single time.   
And everytime I had feelings for someone and this person didn't have the same feelings for me, I thought: That's normal, be patient, the right person will come.   
And you can tell yourself that for a while. You can tell yourself that for a year. Maybe two. Maybe even 5 or 10.   
But someday the craving for love and physical contact will cover every other feeling. You can't think straight. Every minute of every day you will think: Will it ever happen? And in the beginning, you will believe: yes, it will. But everytime you get disappointet, you will lose a little hope. Until you don't believe in it anymore. That's the point where I am now. I tried everything and I lost everytime.

Without the smallest glimpse of hope, I just don't get why I should carry on anymore.   
I'm not just afraid of dissapointment, I am generally afraid of hope. Because the higher you fly, the lower you will fall. And what is a life without hope? Hope is supposed to be a good feeling, because it keeps you going. But everytime I feel a little hope, i automatically think: ""Don't fool yourself, you know what happened last time when you looked forward to something"".

It's a never ending circle, and while I had the strength to get out of these situations with more strength than before in the beginning, I now just don't have this strength anymore. Sooner or later it's enough. I tried to explain my bad luck with my behaviour. Then I changed my behaviour but my situation didn't change. I just feel helpless. Powerless. If you tried everything you can, what else is there to do than just giving up?

There are so many strangers in our everyday lives. They have different ages, backgrounds, sexual orientation, skin color...
What if we started talking to those people? why don't we just start a conversation? Instead of just walking past them or giving them a judgmental  look. You don't even know who they are, what they've been through, what they want to do in the future. They say our world is overcrowded, but why are there so many people still feeling alone? Maybe you want to share the same passions, have you been through the same things, do you have the same plans for the future. Why do we just let our paths cross when we also can walk them together? No one has the right to feel alone. Let alone feel that he's loved by nothing or no one. So let's talk to those people we see every day on the train/metro/bus to school/work whatever you are going to. Maybe you gain a friend, maybe you find your other part that you've been searching for so long, maybe it won't work out. But you can't know, because you didn't try.

I’ve struggled, mostly secretly, with my mental health for +12yrs (I’m 30). I’ve been doing better this last year and half since finding a really good therapist and getting into a stable relationship. He doesn’t know about my mental health struggles. I’ve been self-isolating as much as possible for the last couple of weeks and feel like I’m slipping.

A few contributing factors 
-living alone and being in a few different WhatsApp groups has made me realise how much other people are in touch with their friends via various apps
-mostly when I contribute to the WhatsApp conversation I get ignored, I don’t think it’s intentional, I think I just maybe don’t contribute the right things? 
-nobody is checking in on me 
-my boyfriend has chosen to stay at his for the lockdown, he says it’s due to both not being able to bring his computer (desktop) over to work from home and incase he needs to help his parents. But his parents aren’t particularly old and pretty active so I’m getting the feeling he just doesn’t want to.
-having left WhatsApp group (it was too much) a few of the girls have sent msgs asking if I’m ok but I feel like I shouldn’t have had to do that for them to respond and they don’t actually care for my well-being but just asking to clearing their own conscience 
-one of these girls I had a nasty falling out with a few years ago when she misinterpreted a Facebook comment I posted about wanting to come join her and a few others for a Christmas catch up. She exploded and said i was being bitchy and sarcastic, pretty much told me she’s never liked me and that it’s my fault that I’m epileptic (controlled now). This isn’t the full story but I’ve tried apologising several times for the things I said back, and she refuses to talk. We still see each other sometimes through mutual friends and watching her bond with another girl that I’ve added to the group who she completely ignored in school is making me feel even worse. I feel so insignificant. 
-this group knows bits about my mental health issues and I think that might be the only reason they keep me mood? Lore like a sympathy friendship then actually wanting me as part of the group, the conversation usually revolves around one that fell out with me 

I feel very alone - my mood is up and down but I’m crying basically every day. 
My family is round the corner all together but I live alone and I can’t tell them about this as they will worry about me and I don’t want that

It took every ounce of the little energy and money I have and occupied my every waking thought. Yes, it was stressful, but she was there, all the time, keeping me company and just being another heartbeat in this small horrible place I live in.

698,TechnicalCow3,1585079611,1,"During when I was being bullied I wasn’t diagnosed with depression but I had all the symptoms and I had little energy. My parents don’t know anything about this and how I felt during 7th and 8th grade. Being bullied made me feel like I was dead and it made me wanna die/kill myself. I guess the reason why I don’t tell people is because I don’t like telling people what I’m feeling and I’m a very private person and I hate when people get in my business. I hate that I’m like that. I don’t think I’m depressed anymore. I wish that my bully didn’t lie about it to my best friend so we could still be friends. She lied to save herself and so she wouldn’t get in trouble by the guidance counselor and her parents. Then my bully made my ex friend who was lied to lie to the guidance counselor and she said that I was being mean and she wasn’t there for any of this because my bully and I had separate classes then her and she never saw anything! She made her lie and she’s a bad influence on her and I wish she would’ve told the truth! I did everything I could to try and make her confess but she wouldn’t budge. This is a tip for everyone who reads this, lying gets you know where and there’s no use to lying. Please don’t lie and if you do please try to stop. My bully is a good manipulative liar and she made everyone believe her she was telling her these lies all along for months and she didn’t care that she was bullying me or lying. She’s crazy! My ex friend knows that I’m not a mean person and she knows who I am but my bully’s lies we’re so perfected that she made her believe her. My ex friend still wants to be my friend but she doesn’t know what to do. I hope soon that she tells the truth and it can all go back to normal. I think the reason why she bullied me is because she’s jealous of me she’s jealous that I am tall, people used to make fun of her for being short and she would always say “I wanna be y’all like you”. She’s jealous I have a sister, she always said how lucky I am to have a sister to talk to and all she has is a brother. She’s jealous because I always would go over to my ex friends house and she can’t because she’s allergic to cats and dogs and she has like 4 cats and one dog. She would always say how lucky I am to be pretty and she would always say how ugly she is and I always told her she was beautiful but she thought I just said that because I was her friend.

703,vruv,1585076261,1,"So I was off on a youth volunteer program, located across the country.  We would have been traveling to a second place, which didn’t happen.  I was in a house with 10 youth from around Canada, who started off as strangers.  We were living together for 2 1/2 months before we were sent home, which was halfway through the programme.

I met some of my best friends.  We have plans in over a year to do a road trip across the country.  But I won’t see them until then, as we live so far apart from each other.  I loved the time we all had together.  There were ups and downs, but I got a lot from the experience.  I’m generally quite shy, so it was amazing to be surrounded by people, socializing 24/7.  I definitely came out of my shell.  We would stay up late, and all sleep in the same room.  We would wake up, and have breakfast together.  Anytime I felt like going out for a walk, I always had friends around to join me.  We smoked weed many nights together, watched movies, and made food late at night.  It was what I always felt like I was missing, not having any siblings who I had this relationship with.  Anytime I was feeling a bit off, my friends were there to talk to me about it.

Also, I was independent.  I could do what I wanted and be who I wanted to be.  I wasn’t being told by my parents how to behave, or being judged by a group of friends from home who I act a certain way around.  I came into the programme as myself, and only myself.  I didn’t have to act a certain way to fit in with a group of friends, or act a certain way at home to please my parents.  Don’t get me wrong, I love my parents.  But I’m at the time of my life (, btw) where I want that freedom.  I want to explore who I can be.

We were supposed to travel other places, and fly to a different part of the country to spend the second half of the trip.  Then we got quarantined.  Then we were sent home.  My friend and I who happened to be on two flights took some edibles before.  We had to leave at 3:30, so we didn’t bother sleeping before we went to the airport.  These edibles hit HARD.  Once I got to the gate we’d be waiting at, I was paranoid.  There was people around.  These people might have COVID-19.  The seat I’m sitting on might have COVID-19.  I can’t escape it.  It is everywhere.  Whenever I heard someone cough, it felt like an impending bioweapon.  But I was trapped in this airport and couldn’t avoid it.  I had a mini-panic attack in the washroom.  

I got on the flight, and it was surreal.  I hasn’t really processed things yet.  But I started to drift off to sleep, and saw myself at the house we were staying, with everyone in my volunteer group around.  Then I woke up.  And the whole world came rushing into me.  I was on a flight.  I was leaving.  I was going home.  I might not see some of those people ever again.  My volunteer program experience was now in the past, and I couldn’t change that.  I wanted to cry.  It’s not like I even really LIKED everyone in my group.  But after spending almost three months living with them, I was still attached to them.  And it was hard to leave that behind.

After a blurry ~14 hours, I finally got to my home airport.  My parents met me there and picked me up.  I told them how things went, but it’s impossible to really communicate my experience.  I got home, but realized I wasn’t really home.  Things were different.  Society has morphed into a nightmare-like dystopia.  I’m not even allowed to see all my friends.  How has the world changed so quickly?

I was able to go out and see two of my friends.  We played basketball, and it was pretty fun.  I told them about how my trip was, and shared a few stories.  But it was weird.  These used to be who “my friends” were.  They’re still some of my best friends, of course, but now I have OTHER friends, who I consider to be almost as close.  And with these other friends, I have plans in the future to go on a road trip across the country with.  It’s weird knowing that I know have other close friends, who my best friends don’t even know.  And it was weird coming back home, seeing my friends, and knowing that I don’t even want to be here.  I want to be back with my youth volunteer group.  My friends were really happy I was back, but I can’t possibly feel the same way under these circumstances.  I’m NOT happy to be back.  I don’t WANT to be here.  My life is so depressing now.

Almost every moment since I’ve been back, I’ve felt like I’ve suffered.  Sometimes, for brief moments, something has made me feel happy.  And I’ve felt content for that moment.  But then I remember my current situation, and it feels like a pang to my stomach.  I feel like I can’t escape this world of misery.  I know that COVID-19 will blow over, I’ll have a good summer with my friends here.  And next year, I’ll go on a road trip with my good friends from the programme.  But right now I just feel empty.  What am I gonna do for the next few months?  I wasn’t even supposed to be here.",lonely,I’m lonely and depressed,2020-03-25 05:57:41

707,SheAppearsComposedXO,1585069762,1,"I have been on disability for years for mental health reasons, I have lost friends, family (shitty family - but still), burned bridges that arent repairable and I actually live my everyday life, year after year, with not one single person. I have a child 50% of the time and when I have her it is the only time I am not completely alone. Which isn't a burden she needs to bear (and I am careful not to make myself a burden to her). But when I say I have no one, I really mean I have not one single person in my life. 

Now with all of this isolation and a global pandemic - I realize that not one single person has called/texted to check in on me. I already knew I had no one before, but with the world in a crisis, I realize how true it is. I did reach out to one person who was my last friend who gave up on me because she was afraid my moods would bring her down. She answered me but it was just a wishy-washy hope you're doing ok. She is busy with her family. My parents/family hasn't bothered to talk to me. They were abusive and I have gone no contact but I guess I wished that in the event of a global pandemic, that I might matter to SOMEBODY. 

I am not writing this for sympathy really. I just wanted to write it down and put it out in the universe. I have been planning my way out for a few months. It almost seems as this is the best time to go. I hurt so badly everyday that I cannot bear to stay awake with my thoughts. I just take benzos, gravol, whatever to make me sleep through the day and then through the night. The only time I keep myself awake is when my child is with me, of course. 

Please don't say my child is what the answer is here. It isn't. I love her to pieces. But I am an adult who is craving for someone to care/love/human connection/friend/anything! I have been so desperate that I have been back to planning meeting up with strange men online to come to my house for whatever. Watch Netflix, have sex with me, talk. BUT I can't because I cannot bring myself to break isolation based upon my need for human connection. Plenty of men are willing to come over (to use me) but I just can't expose my home to the virus mostly because of my child. So, even getting someone to use me isn't an option.  

I should also say I have CPTSD and have severe anxiety, severe depression, dissociation, cannot sleep, nightmares, I don't trust anyone, etc. If I ever feel badly when I am supposed to have my child, I get her to stay at her dad's until I can manage. 

I know there are no real answers. You can only control so much in your life and I have taken control and tried harder than you can imagine. I see a Psych DR, a therapist for rape and a therapist for trauma (EMDR, other therapies) but yet my life continues the same. I have tried so many times to pick myself up but I havent been strong enough this time (I have ""started over"" 3 times prior to this and accomplished a lot).

Mainly, I am tired. I am soooooo alone and no one should be this alone (although I know many of us are). It is pushing me further and further into my mental illness. No one to discuss things with, no one to check in and see if I am ok, no one to bounce ideas off of. No one to share things with like a movie I watched or a funny thing that happened. I talk too much when I think someone will listen to me.",lonely,COVID has shown me the truth I already knew - I have no one,2020-03-25 04:09:22

I've only used sweetring so far so I'm not sure about how other apps work. (I'm not like a master of relationship or anything, but I just want to share that it is not difficult to take girls out on a date from dating apps.)

1. Be yourself.

When talking to your matches, tell him/her what your real interests are (If you don't have any interests, find one!) If you are a gamer, straight up admit it, if your match ghost you because of it, so be it, move on to the next person. Don't pretend to like something that you are not interested in at all. 

2. It's fine to be shy but ""TALK""

If you just don't talk because you feel like it's ""weird,"" it will get worse. So if you need to, memorize some topics that are ""personalized"" to the other person. Before the topic ends, start thinking about questions to ask or topics that can connect with the previous conversation smoothly. But most importantly, if you have something to say, ""SAY"" it.

3. If you feel like you are trying too hard, move on to the next person. 

There's no need to try SO hard just to get a relationship. A person who likes you will like everything you do. For example, if a girl likes you, she'd be interested to hear more about games that you've played or things that you've been working on, even if she was not interested about any of it. 

That being said, keep looking, keep chatting and just know that there are someone out there waiting for you. Be strong, be confident and soon people will start to realize that you are attractive.",lonely,For those who are craving for relationships,2020-03-24 21:38:42

737,Dainty-Love,1585030770,1,"Hello. 

I’m 28/F. Haven’t been feeling so good past few weeks but grow very fatigued. Would love to make a friend. Preferably 18+, it’s not that I’m looking for anything inappropriate, but due to my age, I’d feel more comfortable. I hope you understand. 

So I have to stay home and can’t be around anyone. My doctor doesn’t know what’s wrong but is checking in via phone, video chat. I think I’m alright but I’m awfully lonely. 

I enjoy video games, (I’m on Xbox one if anyone wants to play) drawing, writing, advanced RP writing, reading, playing MTG, and D&amp;D, too. I love all kinds of music. And I want to learn German. (Looking for a mentor, so to speak. Lol) 

I don’t feel like looks are too important when you’re just looking for friends but I’ve been ghosted simply because I’m plus sized. They ask. I tell. They vanish. So, not that I think I look bad or anything, because I don’t feel that way. If you’re only interested in looks, maybe this friendship isn’t for you. D: 

I’m kinda witty, random, and can be talkative. I’m good a listening and have life experience around mental illness as I have DPD, BPD, and PTSD. But I’m doing much better. So if anyone is anxious, lonely, depressed, know I’m not a professional, but I’m a supportive friend. 

Voice chat is on the menu at some point if a connection is made but mostly looking to chat. If anyone is interested, please message me. 

Note: I’m on EST and am usually not a night owl but due to being under the weather, I’m up all sorts of weird hours. So message whenever. (:

If I drove out to stay with my parents I could potentially get them sick, and I couldn't live with myself if I did that.  I see happy couples on social media and it kills me knowing how much happier I would be holed up with someone.  My girlfriend is staying with her parents, she mentioned that she wanted to come out a few days ago but I'd feel awful if I got her sick, or if my city fell into civil unrest while she was here. (I'm in Vegas, so most of the city is unemployed and crime is skyrocketing right now).

Usually I have roommates, but the timing worked out that my rooms are all currently vacant and the isolation has already started getting to me.  I went through this years ago when I first moved out by myself, I slowly started spiraling into self-destructive behavior, drinking alone to cope with my loneliness.  I recognized what I was doing, so I got moved to a better environment and maintained my social circle, focusing on relationships with quality people.  Well, some of those quality people have shown their true colors the past few days, and others have secluded themselves with loved ones which I get, but still it's hard knowing people are riding this out with someone they love while I'm bouncing off the walls in my house.

I've got a good stock of food, water, guns &amp; ammo, and enough gas in my truck to get to another state if things really go to shit here.  I figured in the case of a natural disaster I'd be able to ride it out until I would be able to bug out, but I didn't really anticipate something like this where all my friends would disappear to be with their loved ones and I'd be a piece of shit for spending time outside or with other people.

I have one friend who comes by in the afternoon and we go on a walk around the neighborhood, but even that seems irresponsible now.  Her roommate is pregnant, and I don't know how many people they come in contact with regularly.  If I'm a decent person, shouldn't I be able to be alone knowing I could potentially be saving someone's life by doing so? 

I try not to watch any news since it slowly sends me into madness these days but I'm being bombarded constantly with reminders in social media, which used to be my escape.  I can't even open Spotify without being hit with reminders of Covid.  My Mom keeps sending me pictures of them on their road trip, they picked up my brother and I hate how jealous I am of them being together and having each other right now.  I don't really fear getting this virus, I fear the civil unrest that it seems like it's causing as my fellow citizens just seem fine with throwing their rights in the trash for promises by a government that has proven its incompetence time and time again.  When I'm with other people I'm happy and I'm calm.  Everyone is distancing themselves and I'm left to stew alone with my thoughts.  Speaking to people on the phone or over video conferencing just reminds me how things have gone to shit, and I also don't want any of this to become normal.",lonely,Not sure if I'm going to make it through weeks of isolation.,2020-03-24 15:05:59

755,ThereShallBeNothing,1585021892,1,"*I am aware this is reddit, I am writing this because my city is in lockdown and I find myself in the unpleasant ordeal of being stuck in a literal box of an apartment accompanied with nothing but surreal boredom, take any desperation or effort from this with a grain of salt.*


I have isolated myself for almost a decade. I am nineteen and I have never had any friends since my early childhood. All because I blocked myself from the world, out of fear and sorrow. I am and have always been a ""shut in"" outside my responsibilities. I am normal, I am not scary or unique looking, I don't suffer from any mental disabilities or something like that.

Being alienated and forcing myself to be anti-social for seven years has left it's scars echoing through my conscience, making me feel guilty or insecure of the slightest mishavings. All I see is darkness, all my good memories bring regret, It hurts to know I exist, I am so full of hate, for myself, and the world. I don't know what to do. I wish I had someone to talk to. I'm tired of being lost in this void, suffering in plain sight, and nobody sees. 

I remember during my early teens, how I was ""that guy"" the majority collective chose to ignore, or just never noticed. I was always stuck in my thoughts, in my own dimension, giving myself advice and motivation to fill in a black hole of lack of group care. I tried for so long, even until now, to be my own friend. I went to the extent of adopting social constructs like the Abrahamic God, to be my opium and hence heal the feeling of painful alienation from society and lack of understanding from others. However, I was never integrated into a social group, of any kind. As far as I can remember I have been alone since birth, with no one to relate to. I haven't ""experienced"" what most have. People to me, are like pixilated characters, or contrasted personalities in stories. I can see them, and read them, but they do not see me, or read me. It is like a one-sided glass, and behind that glass is an enchanted painting called ""life"", of which I am the solitary observer, in the empty museum.

There is no point to anything I do anymore. Everything becomes duller everyday. Living is suffering, my motive for surviving has become to understand that suffering. I wish I was not invisible in plain sight, because it makes me feel like I shouldn't exist. It is the worst feeling, walking in crowds, because that is where I see everything that tortures me. Friends enjoying themselves together, a gleeful family, a romantic couple, and the priceless happiness and laughter of children, all reminding me of things I once had, and never had at all. All of this, while I feel death's nihilistic finger on my shoulder, mocking my lonely dim existence. 

I am stuck in my own alienated version of hell, where my evaporated and unseen halo of tears could fill an ocean. I am in a shadowy prison cell, awaiting the end of my world. I wish it were different, that I could be reborn, or time-travel. But this universe, seems it is just so unforgiving to the ego...",lonely,"How it feels to be ""self quarantined "" vs how it feels to be me all the time. (There's no difference.)",2020-03-24 14:51:32
756,hamartiated,1585020565,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

765,BREAK_THE_OATH,1585014091,1,"I got a question. Is it normal for me to be the first one to text to a conservation. Becuase I'm the person that does 90% of that, and the other just sends posts. I can't tell if she wants to ignore me and only talk to other people, or if she expects me to start conversations (and yes it's a her). She would also leave me on seen on the most urgent and random times. I just want to start a conversation and keep my self with company with this whole self-distancing thing. Let me tell you a story...

 One time, i even asked her for the Christianity notes and she said ""oh, let me see my notes""

Wanna know what happens next

No fucking reply

It's literally a yes or no question, how hard is it?

The next day she said to me face to face, ""oh I'm sorry, i couldn't find the notes"" I can't tell if she was focused on one thing than the other. Or she was scared that I'll get mad that she doesn't have it. 

I could say that she would say to me ""Oh sorry, I took a nap"" but realistically inside she would say ""Oh sorry, I was busy ignoring you""

I don't know if I'm bugging her too much that she does that sort of thing, or if she's distracted on the other thing. Should I probably stop talking to her for a few days and see what happens.

Im not sure if thats the right word to use. Everyone else made plans to travel together, hang out with each other, and I was never invited to anything.

If I continue to ask them about their plans, they eventually give in and (reluctantly) agree, and I will feel like I'm tagging along. I am always the one who makes (frequently rejected) plans, and I secretly fear weekends and social gatherings knowing I will have to put in a lot of effort to find someone to do something with. I've always tried to be supportive for my friends no matter what, and help them out whenever they ask me to. Sometimes it would cause great inconveniences for me (such as once I had to bring my friend her stuff because ""it was an emergency"" and missed my exam as a result), and more often than not I won't even get a thank you in return. Whenever I needed even a crumb of support, I either get completely ghosted (just to later find out through social media that they were all having fun at a gathering that I was not invited to), or they act completely indifferent and maybe say something like ""oof"" or ""that sucks I guess"". I never really got invited to anything and it has been this way my entire life. I dont remenber the last time where I wasn't suffering from some sort of FOMO. Now that the isolation rule comes into play, everyone is ""fair"" - were all stuck home and no one is out making plans and having fun (usually without my presence).

Reserved people are often ostracized because people just assume I’ve got a problem with them because I’m not in their face all the time.  That hurts me to think that people think I hate them but I can’t force myself to be everybody’s everything.  It’s also disingenuous to be someone I’m not.

I’d rather be alone and be me than fit someone else’s mold just for me to be miserable.

I’m sure there’s someone who would like who I am without being someone I’m not.  I’ve met them before, I’ll meet someone again.

Happiness comes from yourself, a boyfriend or girlfriend isn’t a solve all.  If you are unhappy now, you’ll burden them and it won’t last.

Are there days I wish I could share my thoughts and feelings with others.  Of course, but I’d rather be happy in my own skin than faking what I’m not to say I was around otherwise.

Most of my early years I’ve tried to be a chameleon and be what others think I am.  I’m in college now and realize who I am.  It’s not pretty, it’s not sexy, but it’s me.  I love myself, others might find soft spoken, reserved person who loves art and video games undesirable.  That’s fine.  I’m not for them.  But I need to be true to myself.  Being me and loving me makes me happy.  

I’m sure many will not agree, I hate being alone, but being someone else for sake of being around people is more miserable.

I mention this because I tend to write a lot about romance. Romance, second to only Historical Fiction, was my favorite genre to read growing up. I love the concept of love. It amazes me and I’ve always wanted to experience it. 

But I can’t and probably never will, at least not in the romantic sense. 

Often when I write, I try to describe what I’d imagine love would feel like. I avoid cliches at all costs, because I don’t believe love is the same movie date and box of chocolates that everyone else gets. I believe it is unique to the mind and heart of the individual. 

I just...don’t think it’ll happen. I’m way too much of a pessimist and I’m not necessarily *ugly*, but my appearance could be better if I actually tried. People like to say that looks don’t matter, but they most certainly do, and that frustrates me. 

To give you a image of what I look like (please don’t judge), I’m a 5’3 dark-skinned black girl who’s kind of on the thicker side, but I wouldn’t say I’m overweight. I think my face is average, though I’ve been told that I’m pretty throughout my life so I guess that’s something. 

But when I think about it—love and feelings and passion and all that—I can’t help but feel like no one could possibly ever love me like that. Like I’m just that unlucky in life. And for whatever reason, and this may sound weird, I wish I’d at least been born a man. I’ve always thought that I’d have been better off in the dating world as a man, because...I don’t know. 

But yeah, it kinda sucks that I’ll never get to experience that, but my characters will, and the ones I read about in other books have. I know fiction is fiction but there’s always a bit of truth in every story.

I Started this year full of goals : make new friends at University, have good grades , find a girlfriend , be more social and less shy , became a total different person.  surprisingly i actually have good grade but the rest get even worse.

the few times i gone to University i was silent. not a single chat with anyone. i cant do it , im too scared. in the morning i exit home full of expectations then i arrive in class and ""nope , i will try another time""

im total incapable of interact with other so no girlfreind , no friends an my actual friends are leaving me. they have their job , University , girl/boyfreinds and they are probably tired of my complaints and my boringness . the other people at work make fun of me beacuse im always silent 

and the worst part... *I'm* slowly *accepting* that. 

At least at the start i was positive to change , now not even that. i accepted to be alone , to die alone , watching all my freinds leave. Watching them to have fun , fall in love , live their lives , without me.

She asked for my snapchat to just be friends and I kinda immediately felt that connection we didn’t flirt we just talked a lot. then She told me she liked me and so did I and i just waited a few days to make sure and i ended what i had with emily to be with my coworker jennifer and we started dating it was a good relationship. she was my first a lot of things meaning i done things with her i never have and same with her to me. i really do love her and she’s different from other girls i just can’t quite explain how she different she was, anyways i would have these like episodes where i would just go off on her and it wouldn’t even be her fault, i would say stuff like fuck off or break up with me or even fuck you. i would never physically hit her tho because i know better. but it wouldn’t even be her why i got mad it would come from other sources. (i forgot to mention shes bi and she’s never had a boyfriend but me she has had previous girlfriends although ) and recently she told me her middle school ex basically influenced jennis best friend to keep smoking more and drinking more so she can get wasted and then later they started making out. her best fiend then told jenni oh sorry i made our wirh your ex i was drunk and high sorry i didn’t mean to and jenni didn’t really care. then that friday jenni went out with her best friend to watch a movie i already watched with her but her best friend is the same one that made out with her ex without even telling me and they’re both bi, like isn’t that suspicious and me being the toxic fuck i am claimed she had sex with her and things like that but i didn’t really know. then the next morning she told me she wanted a break and i couldn’t believe it i was so miserable and for the next 2 days bc she was barely talking to me  and later i told her other friend that i was gonna block her to try to get rid of any memories i had of her and she told me what was wrong and i explained and she said that’s weird i didn’t know you guys broke up. she told me that she likes another guy. it turns out she liked this guy that was just her friend and i got mad at first then sad. i texted her and she was like yeah it started in january where i started losing feelings for you and gained them for him. as of now they aren’t dating they’re just talking. we broke up 2 weeks ago and i have been talking to her everyday i just can’t get over this girl i tried blocking her on everything but i just missed her so fucking much. her parents liked me and my parents liked her. we were at the point where we were gonna have sex but the condom failed and didn’t want to risk it since we are so young and inexperienced. it just hurts how we can have sex then like a couple week later she loses all feelings for me and likes someone else at the same time. i’m still trying to get at her and i don’t know how to get back with her. on the brightside the guy told her that they might not even work out bc they’ve been friends since freshman year aka 3 years ago. i realized what i really did have when i lost her and if i can go back in time i would not do anything bad thing i did. i wish she xan give me one more chance. i never would be able to find someone like her literally because she’s so different. everyone’s been telling me to get over her but i really can’t i just can’t i tried",lonely,Complications,2020-03-24 03:37:53

In year 5 this boy joined my primary school and he was alone at lunch so I told my group of friends that we should go play with him

Me and him ended up being best friends I always thought something was wrong with him because he was quiet all the time

Half way through the year me and him started getting into a lot of arguments like every week we were arguing

Then I found out that he was cutting himself and being a stupid 9 year old I didn’t know why he did it or how to help him so I didn’t do anything about it now that I look back I see that he was in a lot of pain because his sister was suicidal and tried to kill herself and his parents were always arguing with each other so I guess he felt unloved and he basically took it out on me and my other friends

He started to manipulate our entire friend group and he turned us against my other friend Leo and convinced us that he was a bad person and made up a bunch of rumours about Leo and made us all hate him

Me and his arguments got worse and worse and I figured out by the end of year 5 that he was really really good at getting people to do what he wanted and I didn’t want to end up like Leo so I went along with him still being his “best friend”

My other friend jack his mum had cancer and still does and Lewis convinced me that jack said bad stuff about my family so I started to hate jack and stopped being his friend

Then Lewis focused on me but instead of making everyone else hate me he made me hate myself like he convinced me that I wasn’t worth anything and that nobody gave a shit about me and ruined my confidence

I know that he messed with other people too but I don’t know their full stories because none of them talk to me that much anymore (obviously)

Leo is a bit better now I know that he has found some decent friends that actually appreciate him he also made a song about when everyone turned on him check it out if u want to it’s on soundcloud and called replaceable by lexo

Jack still isn’t ok his mum still has cancer and he has gotten really really clingy to anyone that wants to be his friend because of what happened he doesn’t think anyone likes him anymore

I am definitely not ok I’m in year 9 now and because of the guilt of what I did to everyone in that school I cut myself and I’ve got depression and social anxiety

But you know the manipulative friend his name is Lewis btw he’s fine he’s great actually it’s like him ruining a bunch of people cured his problems

kiki and her boyfriend decide to leave our original group chat and start another one with everyone else except me. they can be a pretty judgmental and fickle bunch,guess it was just a matter of time. slowly the one i’m in completely dies out. and it makes me feel bummed because it’s apparent that i’m not valued enough as a friend. 

so i decided recently to not hang out with anyone in that group anymore and am pretty sad as i had considered them to be good friends who i would hang out with all the time. i don’t feel like asking for an explanation or confronting anyone.

I left school back in November and have failed to maintain most of my friendships. There's a few reasons for this:

1. They have plenty of other friends, so I'm not as valuable to them as they are to me.
2. There's not much we can do together that we would all enjoy. It's also difficult finding the time around other commitments.
3. My social ability isn't very strong.

It wouldn't be appropriate to spend my 18th with the friends I still have. This is because one of them just rejected me after we were kind of dating for a few months, and right now she doesn't want to see me.

As for my family, I'm not on good terms with my father or sister, which narrows the options down to my mum and brother.

Currently, I feel lonelier than I ever have. I'm concerned that I'll just feel more lonely than happy on my 18th.

844,Markham5,1584946365,1,"Yesterday was my birthday and I spent it alone.  Actually I spend the whole weekend alone and probably didn't utter a real word to anyone.   


Acquaintances of mine at times have birthday events but I  personally don't like attention so I don't feel comfortable planning anything for myself and even if I did the current health issue makes any event no matter how small one to think twice about. 

I have lived in Japan for the last 5 years without many close friends and for the most part on my birthday I get by on the sparse tepid what I see as obligatory and/or insincere FB posts.

I'm mostly ok 'being' alone but this year people making me feel alone has really gotten to me. 

I know that I could do more by being more reciprocal with birthday greeting (no matter how forced I feel giving them) but what gets to me is that I do take that time to write personal messages or reach put in a personal way to a small number of people I do care for.   


I will start by saying I was surprised to get a late but cheerful message from an ex that I have not seen in over two years. And while that provided a nice pick-me-up on an ordinary Monday I was heartbroken by those friends who did not write anything or even worse heard nothing from another ex that was a good friend.

I know the thing about my ex sounds whiny but I'll provide some context to why I feel so crestfallen.

Her birthday was on Jan 5th. I was out of the country so I mailed her present early, something I took time to get and something she told me she loved.  On that day I also sent her a birthday message and wished her family well. We have been are good terms and would see each other for dinner and movies and whatnot. She even invited me to dinner last year on my birthday knowing I was going to spend it alone.

To make matters worse and what seems like something profoundly  . . . . idk, pathetic, one of my colleague's birthday is tomorrow and I plan as usual to bake her a small cake. 

How is it possible to want to do something special for someone when you know it won't be returned?

How can I reach out to people ( generally and not about my bday) without making it awkward if they realize they totally overlooked it?

How can I reframe my disappointment (in certain people) when all I expected was a simple nod of recognition and received nothing?

so i have major depression. im pretty quiet and sad a lot of the time. ive always been good at listening though.

my entire life, im 26, ive always been there for friends. thick and thin and all that bullshit. i don't give advice to people unless they ask. ive always wanted that for myself...a friend that i could speak to about anything and they wouldn't change the subject or tell me i should be happy with my life because i have it so good and their life sucks...my life...my soul is haunted by extreme depression..
idk if you know what depression feels like because everyone that i tell doesn't. its hopelessness. its feeling like you're worthless and you dont belong..you have never belonged. feeling like you have no one. feeling like you're hated by everyone, even people that don't even know you. feeling like everywhere you go its dark and rainy(even though i like the rain bc theres no one around usually). like you cant do a damn thing and nothing is interesting anymore. 
my soul. haunted. my life? its actually pretty good. despite wanting to kill myself every day, i do have it pretty good. not going to into details bc thats not the point. point is....well there is no point im just tired of talking to my damn self and hearing silence in return. 

i don't want to dm you and vent more. i don't want your advice. i just want to know that im not alone..is that too much to fucking ask? shit..it might be.

872,Negative_Plastic,1584931061,1,"My overall anxiety and day-to-day sadness has actually declined quite considerably since we all started hunkering down. 

Working from home has actually been amazing for me. I commute about 35-40 minutes one way, so spending 70-80 minutes commuting each day can be stressful in a number of ways - most notably, it reduces the amount of time I have to unwind, and it reduces the amount of time I can devote to chores. 

In a normal week, I'm either on top of chores with little time left to unwind, causing stress from lack of time to unwind. Or I'm on top of unwinding with little time left to do chores, causing stress from mounting chores. 

This stress usually compounds the sense of loneliness I often feel. 

With a 100% work from home schedule, I get an extra hour of sleep *and* I get almost all my chores done by 9AM which is the time I usually log on to work for the day. I don't think my apartment has ever been cleaner. 

With the enhanced work-life balance, I haven't felt sad from my loneliness at all. I wouldn't have expected this since going into work and chatting with coworkers is what used to *help* my loneliness. 

I think this is coupled with the fact that another thing: normally, there's much latent pressure to put myself out there. Go to a bar, go to a meetup, go to a club, go out and meet people. Since everything shut down, I don't have that voice in the back of my head beating myself up for not putting myself out there. 

When I first learned I'd be WFH 100% for the foreseeable future, my first reaction was that I'd feel lonelier than ever. But I feel a lot better. The release of the new Animal Crossing game has just been the icing on the cake. (That series has always been very therapeutic for me, offering what I see as a fairly wholesome escape.)

I'm not any less lonely, and I'm actually seeing fewer people per week than - possibly - ever in my whole life. But somehow my feelings of loneliness have almost disappeared.",lonely,Who else is actually faring better with the self-quarantine than they were doing normally?,2020-03-23 13:37:41

To give a little background, my best friend James and his girlfriend Kaitlyn have been dating for about 3 years. They both dont have the best paying jobs so as a result , they live with Kaitlyn's parents. On top of that , they have a one year old son. In general, they are amazing parents and they love there son vary dearly. I know Kaitlyn has struggle keeping a job for longer than 4 months due to personal issues. 

I was thinking to my self , what if Kaitlyn becomes an escort and have sex with guys to make a living. Im sure it's not easy doing that but some girls make a killer doing just that.

I give up on ever having friends and I’m 18. Yes, at school, I do have people that I talk to and I guess that’s better than nothing. But the second I step out of my school’s building, I’m so irrelevant. I’m always the one reaching out to people, no one ever reaches out to me. The amount of times I’ve had to tell myself to not give up just yet and to keep on putting effort only to have the same results over and over again for YEARS. I know what people are gonna say, I’m the common denominator which means I’m the problem. I know. 

For whatever reason, people can’t love me platonically or any other way...and it hurts. But I’m done hoping for a friend since I know I can’t have one. This is why I would rather spend most of my time at the gym (can’t do that now :/) and why I can’t stay sober for too long. 

Sorry if the title is patronizing. The point of it is to show that I am not going to fool myself with false hope because false hope has fucked me up in the past. That doesn’t mean YOU won’t make friends.

We both looked each other with extreme intensity, and I felt like I wanted to be with her forever. I know it sounds crazy, but i felt like we were made to be togheter.
We started to speak between breaks, and there was a huge connection between us, but guess what... Nothing happened, because I was meeting someone else and didn't want to fuck it up.
But I think i fucked it up anyway because nothing happened with this other girl either...

I never saw this girl again, but i found her on Instagram like two months ago. Since then, I can't stop thinking about her, its crazy... Because its very difficult for me to get interested in people that much.

She has a boyfriend right now, and they seem to be very happy together... But that didn't stopped me thinking about her. 

Anyways, one day i couldn't resist it anymore and I sent a message to her, saying that I think she's the most cutest thing I ever saw, and was very interested in get to know her someday (if she gets single). 
She laughed, and say that she was interested in me too.
Later that week I saw her on the street, but she was taking the bus, so we couldn't talk, but we looked each other like the first time.

I feel that I'm not bad looking and relatively kind, but I just don't seem to get on with most people...

That or quickly feel annoying. But meh that aside people don't reach out to me to begin with otherwise anyway.

So have started doing more things on my own. Got a bag collection going, a media collection going. Used to invite friends over for such but with the corona stuff going on they at first said no thanks a few weeks ago. Now they're just not responding in general to anything.

898,Nishit-Singh,1584917206,1,"I live in India. The country is mot a good country for middle class teens. There are several reasons, some of which might be endemic to myself.

1. You are never encouraged, by anyone, in anything you do. You play a lot of sports and build up muscle, all the people will ask about your grades. Get good grades by spending all your time studying, all your relatives will fat shame you.

2. Parents never, ever provide anything other than the basics. They give me shelter, food and clothing with considerable luxuries, but they never provided me with emotional support. You can’t talk about your feelings at home. All you can talk about os school, studies and grades.

3. The last point may not seem a huge problem to many teens as they can compensate for the lack of emotional support by confiding in friends, but I have none. None I can confide in, at least.

4. Not allowed to show any hint of love interests. You cannot show that you are developing and are attracted to someone. If you do, all the teachers are hell bent on ratting you out to the parents which shut the whole relationship up without considering the feelings of the victim. They just hate it if you find someone you can really tie your hands around.

5. So here I am. Friendless, lonely, depressed with absolutely zero emotional support. Due to the pandemic, I have had a lot of time to reflect. And I cannot even start to express in words all the things going wrong in my life. So I watch shows like the Office, where I satisfy myself by looking at relationships form, bonds morph into trust and acquaintances form into brotherhoods. I watch films to listen to stories of people, because in my lonely life, I don’t have friends that tell me theirs. I play video games because I long for the encouragement. A simple ‘GG’ from a random teammate or an achievement which says ‘Best in the West’ gives my momentary satisfaction.

941,diegoeversholt,1584884569,1,"Everything started in my third year of highschool, I was moved to another college (A better one, according to my parents decision). Before that, I was a normal kid, with some good friends in school. I lived with my both parents (I don't have brothers or sisters), had a nice dog, and everything else a kid needs to be good. We were a very happy family.

When highschool started, I was bullied by my other classmates with no reason. I was beaten by other guys twice, some others put some photos of me on the internet (To make fun of me), and a random dude thretened me with dead, just because I was new on that school.  
This situation lasted about six months, six months of crying everytime I arrived home, and waking up the next day was a hell for me. My parents noticed that I wasn't alright and they decided to take me out from there when I told them what was really going on. They  informed the situation to the college and I coun't finish the schoolyear.

One day I was walking back to my house and I was attacked by seven random dudes on the Street (They knew me from that god damn school) and they sent me to the hospital with a lot of cuts in my body and contusions.  
My parents freaked out, and they seemed very worried about my condition, so when I healed my wounds, they took me to psycologycal therapy so I can have some psychological support.

The theraphy was great, It lasted about one year and half, I had to took some medication to avoid developing depression and phobias.  
I started to feel better everyday, and my fear to walk on the streets started to dissapear, so I decided to finish my highschool in a adult education program. (I was still dealing with the attack I suffered and the damage that bullying can cause, but I made a huge effort to move on with my life)  
When everyting seemed to take a normal path in my life, my parents got divorced, so I had to move with my mother to another house where I wasn't allowed to see my dad.

I got very depressed about it, and started to feel alone and insecure because my mother changed a lot, she was never in the house. She worked all day, and in the nights she used to hang out with her new Friends.  
My father always called me to know what was going on, and we meet every saturday to hang out, have some pizza, or just talk about anything. He was the only one who was worried about me, but I wasn't allowed to see him during the week.

My mother started to hang out and getting drunk in the nights very often, and one day I find out she was spending all her money on the casino, so we were broken.  
One day she left me alone in the house to never came back. (She moved with her parents without saying a word)

When my father knew what was going on, he was very angry with my mother, so he took me to live with him and his mother (I was never close to my grandma, so this was a very umconfortable situation to me). But I was very thankfully to be with my dad.

After a long time being alone and kind of sad, I met some new friends, so things started to go well... The most important thing about this time was that, I met ""Caroline"", she was my first girlfiend. Caroline was very nice with me, we had great time togheter hanging out, watching movies, and she was very important to me in every sense, even more because I think she helped me a lot to move on my pain about my parents divorce, and my mother's runaway.

But Caroline didn't know how to stay on a relationship, after three years i discovered she cheated on me many times, (Not with a single guy, with a lot of them) I was very hurt, because I put all my trust on her and she failed me. She asked for forgiveness, but everytime I did, she screw it all again and again.  
I refused to dump her out, because I was in love with her, and I always thought that she could change, but NO, she never did. So after that 3 years  I decided to put an end to it.

Since we break up, Caroline stalked me in my workplace, in my house, she stalked my friends too. She even went to see my dad crying one time because she missed me, and my dad loved her as a daughter so he always tried to fix up everything between us, but I didn't want to see her again to be honest.

As she stalked me everywhere I go, her parents tought that I was still with her, and I was encouraged many times by them, threating to put a demand on me because I was a bad influence for her and I was damaging her feelings. (WTF!!) It seemed that no one else could see the pain I was groing through, I mean... she was my girlfrend and I loved her more tan anything in the world.

Well… I moved on with my life, Caroline was put on a mental health insitutiion because she was diagnosed with depression after the break and then was moved to another city. After two years from that we both started university but we did not heard about each other anymore. (So I was single in that two Years)

My father was very happy because I got in university, and I was very happy too, I loved my career, my new classmates, my teachers were great, actually I started a band! and everything was great finally!Thats when my mother appeared again, she was very sorry about her behavior but she was happy for me to live with my dad because she knew he loved me and we were very Good Friends.

In the first year of university I knew a girl called ""Javiera"", we started to hang out for months until we started a relationship. She was very nice too, very intelligent, maybe more childish than Caroline in some aspects, but I enjoyed my time with her a lot anyways.

Javiera was very jealous, she thought every girl in the world wanted to fuck me... With the time she  started to change her behavior, She freaked out about anything, and left me alone a lot of times for stupid reasons. So I thought… ""I will not fight her as I done with Caroline, I Will remain calm and talk with her"", but it was worse, because she got very violent increasingly until one day she got mad with me and jumped in her ex boyfriend car in front of me all my Friends/classmates. (I got very very ashamed)

I felt how my hate on life and people was growing bigger, but I didn't explode, because I can always count with my father and my band mates.

In the morning of 30 August 2018 I woke up as usual, and I went to my father's bedroom to wake him up for breakfast, but I found him dead in his bed. He was pale, cold, he had a heart attack… I NEVER SAW SOMEONE DEAD BEFORE! I WAS SHOCKED!!!!

After the ambulance came to the house I called my fiends and mom to tell them what happened.  
It was the worst day of my life by far...  
That's when my life changed 200% I was very sad and angry with life, with god, with myself, with my mother, with everyone. The first two weeks I couldn't sleep well, had nightmares, cried every night,.  
My aunt paid for the funeral while I got the money to give her back, because as a family (my grandmother and me) was complety broken. The money I got paid in my workplace wasn't enoigh to pay for the funeral.

My grandmother left me alone in the house for two weeks, she traveled to the beach with some other family members, and the loneliness started to take over me... I started to fl paraoind and crazy about anything, because I had enough time and silence to overthink about the highschool, my mother, Caroline, Javiera, and now my dead father… HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO SUFFER!? WHAT DO LIFE WANT FROM ME???

When my grandma got back from the beach she were very indifferent with me, she didn't talk to me, or anything. And one day when I came back to the house I found all my clothes in the street. Yes... she trowed me out the house. When I got inside, she started to yell me out  because she needed money to pay the rent and other taxes that my father used to pay and I didn't have it.

My mother helped me to take all my stuff and came back to the house we had with my parents,  but it was avery difficult task, because  we were attacked by my grandma and my uncle who also called the cops saying that I was stealing things from her house. MY OWN THINGSS!!!!!!!!

In this point, all my friends dissapeared, they were always busy, or didn't have time to hang out, or maybe have a cup of coffee… I don't know why but seriously, they all DISSAPEARED.  
But HEY!!! I wasn't all alone, my band's drummer was always calling me, TO BORROW SOME MONEY FROM ME... or what about the other guitarist? YEAH! he called me too, but oh surprise, he needed a favor. -.-

I started to live by my own then, my mother visited me often, but I was all alone, and now with my whole family against me and dealing with the grief of my father.  
I started to develop a huge depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, and being by my own wasn't very helpful.

That summer Caroline appeared in my house, she learned about my father's death. So she was very close to me all that time. I thought she came back to support me as a friend, but she wanted to be with me as something more. (I know i was very stupid to let her got in my life, but I felt defenceless and the only thing I wanted was someone who showed me some love). So I accepted… and I feel like I was in the sky, It was better this time, because she appeared in the worst moment of my life.

We spent time togheter doing the things we used to do when we were younger, and we were very happy, more tan the first time...  
One day I noticed something strange on her IG account… there was someone who commented her pictures as he was her boyfriend??? And the comments were from weeks ago.  
Someday, Caroline texted me saying that she didn't want to be with me anymore. NOTHING MORE.  
And then I find out she had a boyfriend ALL THIS YEARS. They broke up, so Caroline came here to my house, and when they fixed things up, she came back to his boyfriend :)

In 20th August 2019 after a show with my band I tried to kill myself in the bathroom, because I didn't stand my depression, my mind was very noisy, I was vomitting everyday because of the anxiety, my hands were always shaking and my visión was blurry, but after hours thinking and looking at myself at the mirror I called my mom and she saved me from doing it.

The next day I came back to my house, but again, I was all alone...  
That's when my drummer's girlfriend showed up to cheer me out. YES! her girlfriend, not him. Why??? He was my friend, not her.  
But the thing is that she started to call me every night to ask me how I was, so I trusted her my feelings, what I was thinking, I told her how anxiety or depression feels like, and she always threated me as I was the most interesting person in the world, no matter how fucked i was.

One day she called me to tell me that her boyfriend (my band's drummer) left the city to live in another state for work, (They will have a distance relationship) She was very sad about it, but I tried to cheer her up as she done with me before.  
We talked for months, and she was very special for me, because she was the only one to convice me to see my dad at the cemetery.  
One day she came to my house at 10pm like a suprise. But she was a little nervous, I asked her what was going on and then  she told me that she was in love with me and she didn't love her boyfriend.  
I told her that she must be just confused, and we wll never have anything as a relationship.

She understood the situation, but she never tried to get away from me. Actually she was keep calling me everyday, or inviting me to a coffee.  
One day we were on my house, and we kissed each other. I felt something very powerful going on trough my veins, It was adrenaline and she felt it too.  
How can I do this?? HE IS MY FRIEND? but... is he??? He just call me to ask for money or favors, and everytime i tried to talk to him he was busy.

So long story short, we were hanging out and having sex for four months and we never told my friend. And do you know what? I didn't feel guilty at all. She didn't too.  
I believe in karma but karma is indebted to me. Always bad things happen to me without doing anything, everyone passes me by  and no one cares a fuck about me. So I started living and caring just about myself. I think about telling my friend the truth in many times, but I thought It was like betraying her, and was that a good thing? After all she was the only one who was caring about me.

This girl was in suffer, because she wanted to be with me, but she didn't know how to dump her boyfriend without breaking up my band, or her financial stability that he provided her (In her own words) and in the other hand I wasn't offering anything safe to her, because now I just care about myself.

So one day, she didn't stand it anymore and she told him everything. But, she told that I was stalking her, sending her texts and calling her everyday. When i find out she betrayed me, I tried to speak with her, but she blocked me. So the next day my band's drummer came to my house with two guys to beat me up. As the new person I became, I didn't hesitate, I pulled out my gun (Yes, I bought a gun.. Am I becoming BAD?) And I pointed it right into his forehead, and I told him to go and never came back.

The next day the police came to my house because he told them that I tried to kill him so now I have a charge for death threat.

That's how my life became what it is now.  
No father, no mother, no friends, no family, no girlfriend.  
The only thing good is that I adopted a dog and she makes my life a little less awful everyday &lt;3",lonely,You think your life is sh**? (READ MY STORY),2020-03-23 00:42:49

**Message me to join our secret mastermind group**

Hey guys,

We are trying to have a holistic understanding of the game. We want to target everything that is going to help you become a high-value guy from fashion to nutrition to online behaviors. I see a lot of you making these MASSIVE mistakes, which are turning you into low-value guys. Hopefully, these tips serve as a course-correcting for you guys to become high-value guys. Unfortunately, a lot of people who give free advice out there give it without an adequate context. Therefore, their information can be misunderstood. 

In this post, I will go more in-depth on confidence, bear in mind that confidence is a vast and complex topic. Therefore, I will have multiple angles on this topic. Today we will be focused on situational confidence. 

**1- Understand that there are various types of confidence, but you want to focus on Situational confidence** 

There are numerous types of confidence. For instance, I believe that what women say when they say they want a confident man what women mean that they want an experienced man. Moreover, I know there is core confidence that people will have in any and for every situation. I do believe that *Core confidence* does exist; however, that should not be the topic of our discussion since core confidence is more difficult to build up and involves multiple situations.

*What is situational confidence?* 

**Situational confidence is to be confident in doing a specific activity in a particular setting**. For instance, if you can talk to random girls at the park. Look how specific that is I'm approaching girls, and I'm doing it during the daylight. This practice is very different than approaching at night. Unfortunately, a lot of people do not understand that **some are confident in a given situation yet very nervous and scared in another.**

For instance, I can easily approach any girls in any setting. However, I would have much more difficulty doing it in some environments than others. For example, if it is one girl sitting down and she's with two male friends, that would be many times much more difficult than approaching a solo girl walking down the street. **Unfortunately, many coaches and mentors give you very general and theoretical advice that does not take into consideration the complexity of different settings.**

**2-Pick One thing you want to be confident in**

Now that we know what situational confidence you need to do some self-examination, some guiding questions are: In which area of my life do I want to be confident? In which activity do I want to be more confident? At what time do I want to be more courageous? What will be my setting when I'm performing my confidence act? 

**Sample Answer**: *I want to be confident in public speaking. I will take a stand up comedy class and feel comfortable performing my act in front of my classmates. I want to be able to do it in the morning when everyone is looking at me. Therefore, I have nowhere to hide. My setting will be my school's Gotham Comedy Club.*

Take a pen and paper or type in your notes on your iPhone. *You must go into this self-examination mode*. I would even take one or two days thinking this through before deciding on precisely what your goal is and why do you want to accomplish it. 

**3- Be exposed to that one thing multiple times during a day, weeks and months**

In cognitive-behavioral therapy, a lot of talk about exposure and response theory. In simple terms, exposure and response is your ability to take an item that makes you nervous, yet having a different reaction to it. For instance, if you are afraid of planes, you train yourself to be exposed to planes until you no longer feel anxious about it. The more exposure you have to the item that makes you nervous, the more prepared you are. We can conclude that **a lot of our fears are based on assumptions and not on actual threats**. Therefore, we will overblow the situation. For instance, people feel more fears when they are alone than with their friends because the social pressure that their friends put on them makes them break out of that fear. 

If we continue with the public speaking example, I will go to the comedy club once a week. Now that I have gotten used to performing at the comedy club, it will become a minor annoyance at first. However, **if enough time has passed, it will eventually become a routine**.

**4- Accept failure and continue** 

At the same time, in this process, for an activity to become a routine, you will encounter hurdles. The first hurdle will be that someone might laugh at you or make you feel uncomfortable. For instance, if you approach a girl, and she has a bad day, she might tell you to, ""Get lost LOSER!"" What you need to do in this situation is to accept pain and let it go. Instead of believing in her reflection opinion, you can conclude that its only her own.

Going back to the comedy example, say most of your classmates remain quiet during most of your performance. This silence will hurt you since you might feel no one is supporting you. However, what you can do is to continue going at it. Therefore, you are getting exposed to your fear and seeing that it's not that bad. You can conclude\*\*, ""Alright, people were indifferent to you; it wasn't that bad, I can continue!""\*\*

**Now you are replacing your imaginary fears with actual experiences.** *While these experiences might be painful, uncomfortable, and disappointing, you will be able to build character through these experiences. You will become much more self-focused than outer focused.*  It's ironic that in social skills, it's the people who are the least social interaction, the ones that are the most outer focused while people who have more experience will go ahead and take the risk to feel the pain and focus on themselves. 

**5- Change both the setting and the people you are performing for** 

One more point to focus on is to change settings and people. For instance, you can go to the library as opposed to the park to start approaching people. Or you can contact different groups of people who may be in the park. There are only outdoorsy girls; therefore, at the library, you will see me more intellectual types. To go back to our comedy example, you will get your chance to perform in various venues and in from different groups of people. The teachers are aware of the more experience their students can get, the better for their growth.

**Conclusion**

I hope you guys learn from this list. Confidence is a vast topic, but we will be digging into it more and more. Hopefully, you guys can start doing your self-examination as soon as you get the change and reflect on where exactly you want to be confident. Now is the time to take action. Ask yourself:

After failing with groups of friends in real life I tried online and I either up being targeted and bullied. Being called names and outcast or make to feel like I'm worthless. Every person I've tried to be friends with has never respected me, they ghosted me, yelled at me, told me off, and going through this over and over has made me feel so empty.

953,dahlihey,1584868242,1,"I've always been a pretty shy person. I spend most of my days alone and take solo trips (hiking, eating out, etc) so that I'm not in the house all day. I'm fighting to get better, esp cause I just graduated college and am out in the ""real world"" now. But sometimes that anxiousness comes back in a toxic way....

So about 5 or 6 weeks ago I was at a party being thrown by an acquaintance from college. He's a really nice, solid (and really outgoing) dude so naturally his friends are pretty cool too. So after meeting a ton of people I met this guy, we can call him Squid. We hit it off, contacted each other through insta dms, and finally met up again. 

The first couple times we hung out were cool, but after the first 3 weeks, things fizzled as we soon discovered that we have a hard time communicating with each other and don't have a lot in common (and both had passive aggressive tendencies). But we both wanted to make it work...but I could tell he was bored, he just wouldn't admit it. 

So for the first couple weeks I was the center of his universe, then after that he started lumping our dates with hanging out with his friends. He told me its because he recently moved away from all of them (about 30 to 40 miles) and he rarely gets to see them because he works as a full time software engineer. And he says weekends are the only time he can see them.

Now I have never had this problem in my life. I'm lucky if one person hits me up, meanwhile he has like four different friend groups pulling at him from all corners. So on top of not having much in common and him not understanding my sense of humor and a bunch of other stuff that made it hard for us to talk to each other, I notice this toxic feeling bubbling up inside of me. Jealousy, pure jealousy. Jealous that he has all these friends and I don't. And when we split up, he'll have them and I will have no one. I hate this feeling. It makes me sick. 

We were supposed to hang out on Thursday (we gave up on hanging on the weekends cause only his friends were worthy of those days now). I go to his place because traffic coming from my place was worse for him if he were to stay overnight. But it didn't happen. He once was very enthusiastic about having me over. He even offered giving my a key at one point. But this time he did not give af one way or the other if I showed up. And even tried (passively) trying to use the Corona virus as an exuse for me to stay home. That's when I knew our little tango was dead. But despite him not caring about my existence anymore, he still didn't want to break up. But I'd rather be alone than feel the pain of being unwanted, so I broke it off. 

And now I feel like I have no one again. And even though we agreed to remain friends, I don't want to have to depend on him to meet people. And all the people he knows are life long friends, people who he treats like FAMILY. Like are you kidding me?! He's so lucky and doesn't even know it. I have one friend who I met at an old job after hs and she lives all the way in NY now (I'm in Cali). But besides that like...wtf like I have no one, definitely not anyone I can call my ""fam"" or my ""tribe"". I'm 23 so I'm still pretty young, but I'm jealous that I still have to search for friends while his are just already there. Like do people even become life long friends at my age (esp cause I've already graduate college)???

 It's just that I keep everything inside of me all the time. Sometimes my thoughts feel like they're going to make my head just bust open. My thoughts make me feel like a small animal in a cage just running on a wheel all by myself; day in, day out. I write in my journal pretty often but that only relieves a small amount of the ""thought pressure"". I just needed to tell someone, honestly, how I was feeling.

I do have bad social anxiety, and because of that I actually isolated myself for an entire year once. Consequently my social skills have deteriorated. Every day it feels like they are getting worse. I also deal with a lot of brain fog..  It feels like my brain is falling apart.

I find myself riddled with anxiety in any type of social context difficult. When im talking to people online, I'm always worried about small things like wondering things strangely or saying too much in a message.

When in a social situation in person, it's like I'm outside of myself and cringing at myself. When it's particularly bad, the walls become suffocating. Also, this might sound weird, but it's like I can physically feel my own awkwardness. And that's just being around people.

When I actually talk to people, I mumble and stammer and sometimes forget my words mind sentence... So I usually avoid talking at all.

I do have 'friends', but I'm not vey close with any of them. They also never reach out to me and ask what's up or how things are going... It genuinely feels like if I disappeared, no one would notice; or if they did, they wouldn't be bothered. Even people I talk to online stop talking to me. I can't understand why people don't seem like me... I guess I'm a little quirky, and people say I lack enthusiasm (which is especially bad when you're a woman).

Maybe I'm a total weirdo? Or I'm too eccentric and awkward? Or I'm just plan boring? Maybe even ugly?

All I want deep down, is to find a group of people that I can feel like I connect with. Like people I'm not afraid to laugh in front of, or smile too big around (because yes I'm self conscious of even that).

989,LloydElysium,1584837370,1,"
My name is Lloyd, I’m an 18 year old who’s never had a friend in the past 7 years. There are many members in my family who have lots of friends - how could it be possible for me to be unable to attain them? 

On average I’m outdoors either on the local Golf course or nearby bowling alley. There are a decent amount of people there usually and sometimes I’m asked how they can pull off the high skill techniques like me, but nothing goes beyond a few questions because they do not want my friendship - but exclusively my advice (which I’m fine with, but wish otherwise)

My hobbies are Golf , Bowling , and working out - to which I’m all Great at and knowledgeable on. 

It severely angers me when I see other guys who have “pornhub” or other degeneracy featured on their clothing. How can someone like that find companionship yet I’m unable to? They do not deserve the pleasures of having friendships, It’s NOT fair. 

Everyday it’s like I’m the only one who sees the truth under a matrix of falsehoods society plant into the minds of this generation, I’m unable to relate to the experiences of other people because they have built their lives on accomplishments that can disappear by deleting a fucking account. I believe social media has destroyed a generation of socializing 

I always dress in a stylish manner , I own a nice car (BMW) , I’m good looking and in great shape. I’ve had a few hot girls approach me to come say hello and often I do get asked for my number, but I don’t want female friends so I usually just end up dating them for a while and then forget about them. I do have a girlfriend currently, but it’s not the same as having a bro. I lie and pretend to have friends because if I were to be honest I would come off as a lower value male.

I’ve approached lots of people, but I never find anyone that’s like me and so I remain trapped in this hell of loneliness. I don’t want internet friends - I want real friendships that I can do fun things with. 

I’m getting tired of all the injustices I have to face, when something cool happens - I have almost no one to tell. Nearly Nobody to share the cool experiences I’ve gone through over the years and nobody to talk about my accomplishments with.

I found two really good new tv shows and I'm very excited about them and I finally again have something to do on Tumblr. I've so far had a few interactions with people from those fandoms and they've been super nice. I'm excited for new episodes and what people have to say about them. It's also an active fandom as there are constantly new episodes. 

*I have absolutely fucking no one to talk to about it.*

My friends sometimes watch tv shows but they don't think about them after the episode ends. I got into this fandom thing with Vampire Diaries like six years ago. I browse Instagram and Tumblr (and Vine back then) for gifs, video edits and commentary. 

I didn't do much else other than watch shows at a rapid pace a few years ago but somehow just got tired of that and didn't watch much of anything until now that I found those two shows.

I'd love to have someone who would like the same shows and who I could talk to about them. 


The other thing is, I'd like a friend to play games with. I've never had a friend who I could talk to while playing something together. 

My friends don't care about video games, one of them plays CS but it's not my cup of tea. I'm sure she'd play with me if I played it.



I'm just *so lonely* so much of the time and sometimes I get the urge to post about it on some subreddit but I don't want someone to message me out of pity just for us to awkwardly talk for a day or two and never speak again. 

I want real internet friends who actually care and play with me and/or talk about tv shows. Who I can spend time with via our phones or computers... without it requiring for us to always see each other face to face to spend time together. 

I see people on Tumblr and Instagram talking to their internet friends from across the globe and I just wonder how they met. What got them talking and how did they stay such good friends. And wondering why I've never made those kinds of connections

This got longer than I intended and I don't have the energy to try to shorten it... Thanks to anyone who read it

And I didn't mean anything bad with the ""I don't want someone to message me out of pity"" and ""I want real friends"".

This process doesn't go that long, but it really grind me down if its happening. For example: in order to sleep better I often hug a big pillow and imagine that this is a certain person.

I live in a small, remote town and I'm super lonely.
I don't have any friends, which is what I want/ need the most in my life right now.
There aren't many persons my age where I live, and I don't share their interests (cars, hockey, drugs). 

I've had friends in another city which I share interests with, but they have stopped inviting me and I've gotten sick of inviting myself to their hangouts.  It's also a hassle to get to them because of the distance between us. They also don't want me around when they are with other people, which have made them lie about not being able to hang, or that they have nothing planned, just so I don't come. I don't know what problems they see in having me there, but it hurts seeing pictures and videos of them online where they are having fun while I'm stuck alone. Tbh it's gotten to the point where I start to feel bad everytime I see random people hanging out with their friends...

I'm a shy introvert, unemployed, suffering from severe depression. I'm getting treatment and help for my mental illnesses, but I feel the need for friends to help me get my mind off my terrible thoughts. 

Everytime I see people I know are having a good time without me, I start to get really scary thoughts about wanting to hurt them. I don't know what to do. 
It feels like I'm stuck in a neverending downwards spiral of self loathing, which turns into hatred. 
It doesn't feel like there's any chance to get new friends and I can't help but feel an unwavering helplessness and frustration.

The only way I have managed to meet people are through dating apps, but it's not the most efficient way to make friends and it always just end up with someone being hurt. 

I'm sorry if I rambled a bit, I'm just really frustrated and downright angry. I felt it was a better idea to write here than to do something stupid.

1015,M3cky,1584823040,1,"**TL;DR:** I was renovating my fathers and my party room and memories of my kinda traumatic heart break with P came back in my head, because it all started in there. The heart break happened in March 2018 and since then i haven't met any new women where I could say that these are women for the future and now I found someone to who i want to commit myself, but I am too scared and with recent flashbacks it's even harder, nearly impossible.

**Some information about me:**

20, zodiac sign cancer (Yes, I do believe in thisa little bit), good hearted person, been bullied almost my entire school record, because I was too nice and too happy, coming out of a wealthy family. Did I miss something important? Feel free to ask. 

**The story:**

Soooo it's starting to get warmer again and around these months of the year i felt kinda lonely since 2018. The reason for this is in 2018 I kinda started dating with the ex gf of one of my best buds. Everything was fine and we started seeing us weekly on  a friday evening with some other friends of us at my place (actually a hall which had a small office-like room that was converted to a small chill room with seats, an oven, 2 small tables and thats it. It was a folksy atmosphere in there. Quite dope. The meet-ups started after 6 moths after P's(her) break up. Anyways:

P and me came obviously closer and we had some feelings for each other. Even when P was in the relationship with my good friend she often said, that I'd be an awesome boyfriend and my future gf should be glad to have such a treasure. We started seeing us 3 to 4 times a week but never had ""the Talk"". It was just beautiful how it was. Cuddling with each other, watching some episodes of Steven Universe or the Warcraft movie, because I never watched it etc. Watching her play WoW, just talk about god and the world. No Sex,  just a full bag of emotions and warmth, because that was what we both loved. Even sometimes she still had some flashbacks of her ex boyfriend and got sad and I couldn't resist to cheer her up and drove in the middle of the night to her (5 minute ride with my motorcycle), knocked on her door and she opened, tears all over her face. It was just an amazing feeling to be there for her and to have somebody that cares about someone. We were on the same wavelength. This whole thing went until May 2018 and then i kinda maned up and asked her how things should go on, because in July I would get drafted to the other side of germany.

Once we sat down and talked about all that, she told me that she can't get into a relationship. Not due to the fact that i would be so far away, no. That wasn't the reason. She said: *You're such a good person. I can't give you what you give me. I'd feel useless in this relationship.* Yeah and that kinda destroyed me already. I didn't started crying or something, but it hit right in my heart, because we both bonded so hard and we were enjoying the time we spent together. And hearing this was just... devastating. So after we had spoken about everything and both sat there in silence, I finally got up and drove home. I drove home and couldn't really accept what all just happened.I tried to not fall into a deep hole or something and tried to stay happy. That defently failed. Whenever work was over, I drove home and bought on the way a bottle of Vodka and some Energy and sat infront of my PC, listened to the songs we showed each other and drowned myself in alcohol (luckily i just needed 0.5 L of the mixed drinks to get hammered) and tears, trying to cry all the pain out, hopeing it would help me to let her go. After 2 weeks of drinking every evening we met up once again, because we both had some unanswered Questions. This meet up didnt help at all and it was just a torture sitting there, knowing that I can't do anything to get her back. 

March 19 came and i started feeling good. I defently remebered the time we spent together but it didnt bothered me that hard. I just smiled and thought: *Man, your time will come. This was an awesome experience!* 2019 passed without any incidents. And now, 2020 my father and I started to rehab this room into a bigger one and also built it better, so that it'd be a real nice and cozy room. For  my fathers hunting-comrades and also for some parties for me and my friends. New Windows got installed, because the old ones were broken and couldn't insulate the cold from the outside. And so we pushed out those windows and I needed to clean up the area infront (outside) of the hall. There was a selfmade bench where ""it first sparked"". And while I was cleaning up the entire mess of glass, all those memories came back in my head and it felt so awesome remembering everything. But it also hurt like hell somehow. And now the room is done but i can't get rid of these memories again. It's not like I wanna hold them, because I'm chatting with another girl (C) and I don't want these emotions to block me or something like that. C is such a good hearted person and we get along almost as good as P and me 2018. And I know, that we both kinda have something for each other, but I'm scared to make some moves, because it might be too early. Plus i can't get my head clear because these memories are buzzing around in my head. So I'm asking myself if I ever got over her or am I just to clingy? Am I stupid that I can't let her go? I dont know. I didnt met many new women since 2018, because it wouldn't fit in my work shedule and would be kinda hard to keep everything running smooth. And I'm more of a love-person than a sex-person. One-Night-Stands? I'll pass. If you'd book a hooker for me, I'd probably take her out for a fance dinner and talk with her about love, the future etc. But i propbably wouldnt sleep with her, because in my opinion it needs some love/connection to sleep with someone. But i would like to take a shot on C. Defently! But I can't right now, because I can only think of P and the wonderful time we had. It's blocking me so hard! So far i can't say that C and me are as good as P and me back in the days, but I want to stop those comparisons. It's annoying and stupid! It probably won't be the same like then, but i don't mind about that. Personally I just want to finally have a person that is with me in the evening and with who I can talk about the day etc. Just the casual things. Sounds kinda retarded but I want to feel loved again. And to finally tell you what brings me to this sub is the fact that I'm seeking (?) for advices if I am just a stupid person or if this is normal. All my male friends are drug addicted, so I can't really talk with them about this and I dont really have a female friends. Just C at the moment and she is just, wow. I don't know what I should do.",lonely,Am I stupid?,2020-03-22 07:37:20

1017,xEppyx,1584821888,1,"I had a rough childhood, I was separated from my brother.. druggie parents.. one went to jail for a year or two and of course I moved schools often. School to school, I would try to meet people.. but at one point it just became pointless. I ended up spending most of high school just reading books in the cafeteria with an occasional lookie-loo who would feel obligated to try to be nice after their boyfriend threw something at me across the room to impress his friends.

After highschool, I went to university.. but quickly depression and loneliness took over and I dropped out. My mother passed away very shortly after, partly from drinking and causing liver issues to become worse. Shamefully, for the next few years.. I just kind of withdrew from everything and basically became a shut-in. 

At one point, my father and I left to be closer to ""family"" (and he was a pot head who thought that this state would make him rich). Eventually, I found out he was abusing my credit and basically piling debt onto my name and I got mad and hit a door. I ended up hitting my hand into a tiny glass window in the door and cutting my arm up. Luckily, I missed any arteries and my arm is fine.. just a hefty slice.. probably the biggest bullet to have dodged. 

After almost being homeless, my aunt and uncle took me in and gave me a chance to go back to school. I finished a two year AA that I had stalled out on. Got my first job in IT and have basically tripled my income in three years.

During these three years, I still haven't met anyone who has been interested in me. I like a woman at work, but I am sure she has someone.. and she is way out of my league, I can tell by how many guys generally hover around her all of the time. Even if I were more outgoing and had confidence, I really just don't want to be one of those guys. Sometimes I think that she occasionally stares at me, but who knows why.. definitely not a sign of anything, I am not THAT delusional.

At work or even in general public, I am super upbeat and energetic. Yet, the minute I actually get alone.. depression just hits me. I always realize that I am just going straight home to my empty apartment to do ??? to kill time. This shift in emotions is constant, daily. 

A few months ago, my company laid off hundreds of people. I lost 5 people in my group that I saw daily. After watching their tears roll down their cheeks as they said goodbye to everyone, I realized that I would very likely never see them again. I realized just how delicate my world was and it put my emotions into overdrive. 

Now with the Coronavirus, my job and company is up in the air at this point. I'll probably lose the girl that I am hopelessly crushing on, i'll lose the importance that drives me to get up every day and I'll just be kind of back where things started. 

On other fronts, I dropped a friend that I would occasionally hit up bars with. He was a co-worker from my last job. He was kind of a dbag, he would always talk trash about people or make fun of things that were like, ""eh"". One night, he kind of took off like an ahole and I decided that I wanted better in friends, I don't want to hang out with some dude once every 2-3 months to hit up bars until I am puking into my toilet.

My brother and sister-in-law have been trying to get me to date. I have looked, but I can't bring myself to reach out to anyone. These dating apps are such a weird world... people just looking to shag, women that expect the perfect guy, bitter people who have had too many bad dates, single moms and women who are too heavy for me (I know this is mean to say, but it just doesn't interest me). I am 31 in a large city, but the dating pool still seems very small. At this point, I guess the good ones are mostly taken. I know that I am nothing special and I have basically been losing frontal hair since 26... but is it wrong to want to meet the right person? Even if I could find that person, would I have any ability to interest them or would I even be able to connect to them on an emotional level?

I have slowly been easing myself into the thought that I will probably just die as a virgin, so I have been picking up snowboarding and I plan to hike in order to have something. I was going to travel this spring, but with all of the uncertainty.. I don't know if that will even be possible. Even if it were, traveling alone really sucks.

I really don't know where things will go from here, just trying to make the best of a shitty situation and sometimes it feels like a losing battle.",lonely,"One step forward, two steps back",2020-03-22 07:18:08

I am an Indian and I dropped out of high school and because of that I cannot get a job anywhere. I managed to get a job at a call centre due to my English skills; when I joined it was a Canadian process where I had to make marketing calls for a mortgage broker company. However they recently changed it to an American process where you have to call up Americans, tell them you're calling from the National Institute of Health, tell them that they have been selected in a government survey which makes them eligible for a grant of $14,566 and then take their driver's license or State ID number as ""verification"".

I'm not sure what they do with that information but I know that they are not doing anything legitimate because if you Google it you will know that it's a well known scam. So if you are an American and you get a call saying you have received a grant DO NOT give out your information, just say you're not interested and hang up (please pass this to information to as many people as you can)

I always want to tell people I call to not give me any information but since my supervisors keep listening in on my calls, I am unable to do it. It's very easy for me to fool people because I have a very thick American accent but believe me when I say I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS.

I want to leave the job and inform the FBI/Federal Trade Commission but if I leave the job I will be homeless and starve to death because I'm from an extremely poor family and because I'm a high school drop out I cannot get a job anywhere else.

I’m quite young. Not too young, and I got rejected last night.

It’s only once in a while when I get a surge of confidence and last night was it. A bit of background though, I had had a crush on my birthday twin for around 3 years and he had no idea. I would always be that close friend, I would say things like “you’re cute”, etc. Anyways, I Dm’ed him last night: “I like you, you’re really cute and witty with humour”. He basically texted me back saying, “awe thank you”. But I felt like he didn’t get the message I was trying to put across so I sent a second one. I said “____, I like like you”.

After that it went downhill on my part, he nicely put me down like a dying dog and said that he was “semi-intimate” with someone else. Which I feel like that means he likes someone else. We both decided to remain friends and I quickly switched the convo and started talking about music for a while.

I kinda cried myself to sleep and drunk a little. I suffer from depression already and I feel like it pummelled into the ground after I humiliated myself. I feel so stupid. I really just want to be held but idk if that’s “childish”. My heart aches like a bitch. I had laid off posting photos of myself for 5 years, I’m so self conscious of my body, and I feel so ugly.

1049,SuperGanondorf,1584779194,1,"Warning: long rant incoming

I'm almost 25 years old, I've been single my entire life, and at this point it's really gotten to me. I've been on all of one date in my life a few months back.

Every time in my life that I've tried to pursue a relationship, it's ended horribly. Not just not working out, but it's been thrown back in my face about as cruelly and hurtfully as possible.

There was one friend I was interested in, and she knew I was interested. She led me on for months and then suddenly grew very cold and distant out of nowhere, and pretty much stopped talking to me altogether. That definitely hurt and it took a bit for me to get over that.

Then in my early undergrad days, one of my best friends and I pretty much started a friends with benefits type of arrangement. It kinda happened naturally and it was fun for a little while. Over a couple months I wanted to progress it to an actual relationship and she seemed resistant to it. At the end of it, it blew up in a huge fight, and she basically told me that she was only using me to feel better about herself, and now there was somebody she was actually interested in, so she was going to go pursue that instead. That hurt and took me a really, really long time to get over.

Then a few months ago I asked a good friend of mine out who I had a bit of a crush on for quite a while. She said yes, and we went on a date. The conversation was a bit awkward at first but overall it was an enjoyable evening. Then later she writes me a full on letter detailing why she didn't want to continue dating, laying out all the reasons. Now I don't ascribe any malice or ill intent to her on that point but it still hurt and honestly I would have vastly preferred a simple ""I think we should just be friends."" Most of the stuff mentioned in that letter was stuff she already knew about me beforehand, so I'm not sure why she said yes if those reasons are all the case. She also said she was looking for me to bring up the ""define the relationship"" talk, which I was completely unfamiliar with at the time and still don't fully understand, and when I didn't that was a sign that we weren't meant to work out. Not sure why she couldn't have brought that up, but apparently it was on me for whatever reason.

I'm just so sick and tired of being hurt by people that I care deeply about. At this point, I want a relationship more than anything, and I am so frustrated and sad and depressed that I still have never experienced it. I want to know what it's like to actually experience romance and be loved, and to be someone's first choice instead of always being the third wheel. I'm so tired of being around couples all the time because I'm one of the very, very few people in my social circle who is single and I'm the only one who has never been anything else. I feel totally left out of conversations about dating and relationships because I just can't relate to any of it. I also just hate being around most couples at this point because when they share those little touches and looks and smiles it just hurts so, so much inside because those things are so foreign to me but I want them so badly.

And one thing I hate the most at this point is all of the completely token reassurances and advice from people who have no idea what it's like to be in this position. ""Don't worry, you'll find someone eventually!"" and ""The right person will come into your life when you least expect it!"" say the people who have had various relationships over many years and many of whom are getting married. Maybe it's true but it absolutely doesn't feel true right now and I am so fucking tired of waiting and feeling completely unloved and unlovable in the meantime. It might be different if I had ever had even one single positive romantic experience, but for the few I have had, ""discouraging"" isn't a nearly strong enough word to describe how terrible they've been.

""You need to be okay with being single"" and ""You need to love yourself first"" say the people who, for as long as I've known them, have never been single for more than a month or two at a time. I've been okay with being single and I've loved myself my entire life and it's gotten me fuckall when it comes to romance. I've hit the point where I'm just not okay with being single anymore and I don't think my frustration is unreasonable.

I'm just so fucking done with being single and alone. It has me really depressed at this point. I normally watch a lot of TV and anime but at this point I can't stand to watch most of it, because anytime there's a subplot dealing with romance, dating, or relationships of any kind it just immediately puts me in a miserable mood and headspace by reminding me of exactly the things I'm trying to distract myself from in the first place. I'm avoiding a lot of shows that are normally my comfort shows because they are full of depictions of romance and relationships that are just way too painful for me to endure right now.

There was some hope. I talked to a couple friends about this and they agreed that over spring break we would make dating profiles for me and they would take me out to bars and stuff and basically I would be putting myself out there more. My self confidence and optimism are pretty much nonexistent at this point but I was still looking forward to at least giving it a try. I'm extremely busy with grad school during the quarter so it wasn't really the time to start a major lifestyle change. That glimmer of hope is pretty much what's kept me going the last few months. And then all this shit with the corona virus hits, and now dating is pretty much off the table for the forseeable future, probably at least a few months, since pretty much everything is closed and a lot of people are just not even going to bother trying until everything blows over. So the one thing I was holding onto has just been stomped into the ground and I can't do jack shit about it. I feel like I've just been sentenced to wallow in this misery and loneliness for a completely indeterminate amount of time.

Anyway... yeah, I'm just fucking miserable right now. If you bothered to read this far, thank you. It helps a little bit to get it all out.",lonely,I am so sick and tired of being alone,2020-03-21 19:26:34

1052,bglov3,1584777648,1,"TLDR; I suffer from mental illness and find comfort in my bf and friends when at UNI but being home away from my loved ones reignites my anxiety and I’m looking for an online friend (18-25yo) for emotional support and/or a distraction... 

I go to school 4 hours away and live there. I have generalized anxiety disorder due to trauma from emotional and verbal abuse from my mother whom I’m still living within between school semesters, and you guessed it, during quarantines. She’s a teller/screamer, says so much hurtful sh*t, is over critical and so f**king controlling. Along with my anxiety, can also be considered a symptom of my anxiety, I have mild to severe depression depending on where I am. If I’m with my mom it’s moderate but can become severe if issues arise. When I’m in my dorm then it’s mild to nonexistent which is so relieving. My friends there are great, too. They hang out with me and allow me to vent which is awesome. While at UNI, I have freedom and independency that I don’t have while I’m at home. I have hobbies and clubs and an internship but at home I have none of these things. 

But recently (5months ago) I got into a really great relationship with my boyfriend. He’s so supportive and caring through all of this, but let’s me make my own decisions and doesn’t make me feel bad if my anxiety stops me from doing something. He’s so sweet and silly and caring, and we’re totally on the same page with our relationship. But my mother... gosh. I want nothing but to live with my boyfriend and finish school but that’s not an option with my mother because she pays for my school and holds it over my head. She wants what she thinks is the best for me. Little does she know how much damage she’s done and how much can be lifted off my shoulders if she just backs off and let’s me live my life independently. My dad obviously is an unknown bystander and ignores all of this- never gets involved. 

Being home for the quarantine is driving me f**king crazy. I don’t have a car anymore, it’ll be a year next month since losing it in an accident, and even if I did I can’t leave because of this f**king quarantine. My boyfriend is absolutely amazing in person, offers simple words of comfort and plenty of physical comfort. But when apart it’s totally new territory for him. I’ve learned the hard way, too. Over winter break I was going through it with my mom and made it a habit to FaceTime him and cry every night because I hated my life here and missed him and school. Towards the end, he lost his patience and I totally emotionally drained him. I realized, during but especially after, that he’s terrible at comfort over the phone, along with affection. He doesn’t treat me differently, everything is just less or muted. He explains it by saying talking on the phone is impersonal, which I agree but being apart for long periods of time, calling/video chatting is the best we have. 

At the end of the day, I understand and I do my best to remind myself of this. I remind myself that he still loves me and cares, and I know he does because he puts effort to call me despite not really liking talking on the phone, as well as watching Netflix together online and playing co-op video games, so I know he cares...it’s just different over the phone. I can’t expect the same sense of comfort over the phone that I get when he’s hugging me at night, telling me I’m okay. I just can’t. And that’s okay. And I need to learn how to take care of myself when I’m alone. But at the same time, I’m alone all day, everyday. With none of the distractions/hobbies I have while at school. And maybe it’s me, them, or just the way it is, but keeping in touch with the few friends I have is hard. I have one friend from middle school that I’m still very close with, I consider her my best friend, who lives in my area. But it’s a good 30 minute drive and we both depend on Uber and our parents for transportation. And, both our parents hate driving and Uber money adds up. But still, we don’t text much or talk on the phone often. My friend from uni, we keep in touch but not often. Idk. I just know that if I had someone to keep in touch with as often as I keep in touch with my bf, i would be less lonely and I wouldn’t bombard him so much. He hasn’t complained and he always says that I can vent to him. And I believe him. He handles stress better than anyone I know. But from having dependency issues that I recognized in a past, abusive relationship, I’m super cautious of how often I vent to my bf and how often I ask for comfort/help. I’m trying really hard to be independent and emotionally responsible for myself. So in a sense, I know I’m not becoming too much yet. But I’m afraid if this keeps up at home, I will be too much. And the last thing i want to do is lose him. 

I guess the point of this huge vent session is one, to vent, and two, to look for someone around my age (I’m 20 so 18-25) who’s willing to be my online friend. I promise I’m not always bitching and complaining about my life. I honestly just want a friendship that would offer a distraction. Obviously forming a nice caring friendship that allows for venting and emotional support would be nice, but not totally necessary. I like texting or video chatting. I laugh at memes and I have all the video streaming services. I also am a PC gamer and wouldn’t mind someone new to game with. Really anything would be nice. I just don’t want to feel like sh*t the entire time I’m home...

1053,Cuntman999,1584776447,1,"So about me. Im 23 yo student, really taking care of myself diet, gym etc. Only had few super short relationships with girls. All my life I was trying to be optimistic. Was trying to think that getting a gf wont fix my loneliness. I was trying to convince my self that life goals arent: love, touching, holding hands, taking slow walks in a park under the sunset and drowning into each other eyes. All my life I was sure that the more stress I but on my body the stronger I become, the more confidence I get until I found one girl online. It was more like she found me. We were chatting, then flirting and I slowly I felt that Im getting addicted to her. I started to wake up very early, felt the energy running through my veins, in gym all my results became better. It was like Im on steroids or something. I felt like thats it, thats the part of me that was missing all the time. I felt like with my life goals + gf theres no obstacles that I cant go though.

 But one day I realised she doesnt care about me at all. There was no sparkle left between. Wasnt trying to hold her back. I just let her go. Lost apetite, lost weight, lost energy and motivation and all this corona didnt make it any better. Every morning is like a crash now realising thay noone texts me and says good morning.

1069,bluefacetriang,1584765746,1,"Hey everyone, thank you for choosing to read this thread. It’s not for an advice. So If you choose to stop reading from this line, It’s completely okay. 

I just wanna put a heads up before you go forward with this paragraph that this could contain trigger warning. If youve ever been part of an extremely abusive family, I’m going to share a part of my life on the Internet that could probably remind you of yourself or someone close to you who went through abuse. And if you’ve made it out of that hell, you’re an inspiration for the rest of us.

I apologise for my mumbling and promise to get on with the story. This story isn’t bout me (21F) but the person who gave birth to me. My mum.

My mum is 63 years old and she has 5 kids (including me). She is a heart attack survivor, but extremely diabetic, got high blood pressure, arthritis and varicose veins.  She doesn’t have any family or genetic issues within her ancestors that she happened to deal with all of these issues. All of these problems came along from her depressing life and for your convenience I will sum it up in main points for a quicker read.
- She was born as the first child, she had a really loving father who took good care of her. He was a fisherman
- Her mother was into vanity and wasn’t keen bout looking after her kids
- She lost her father at age 12 due to an accident 
- Her family lead to extreme poverty from the loss
- Lived inside a blue tent with holes in it which easily drenched in heavy rain
- She was stopped from going to school due to poverty
- Her own mother threw her at rich households so that she can work as a maid at 12 years of age
- She had 4 siblings and she was the eldest of them all, which made her the sole provider of her house
- The rich household she worked for beat her with wooden sticks which caused bleeding bruises
- She was forced to work under the blazing sun during afternoon hours which caused her to dehydrate and faint 
- She was denied of any food during work hours 
- If she fainted, they provided her leftover food from the kids of the rich household
- Whenever my mom got her period, she used to ask for a day off during her cramps but they beat her and forced her to work every single day
- My mom was born with natural beauty, but the madam of the house made her wear torn clothes and avoided her from taking a shower so that her beauty doesn’t overshadow the rich ladies’ daughter’s beauty.
- My mother got extremely sick and malnourished she ended with all kinds of diseases like pox, influenza, nausea and she also began developing psoriasis
- They ignored all her sickness and made her work like a slave, she ended up with varicose veins due to long hours of standing 
-  She used to cry and beg her mother to stop sending her over to the rich household
- Grandma ignored her pleas as there was no other source of income
- By this time she developed extreme depression and tried to kill herself a few times by cutting herself, bleeding to death, hanging and drowning.
- She was often times saved by her youngest sister who was little at the time
- She endured this abuse for years until her uncle decided to get her married to a man of her uncles will
- The man (who is my father) turned out to be extremely alcoholic, beat my mom, broke her limbs and also raped her countless amounts of times. (Her family said rape does not count if you’re married)
- She also endured a miscarriage due to the result of his abuse, otherwise we would be a family with 6 kids.
- She had nowhere to go, nowhere to escape. Her education was halted due to poverty, she had no one to look upto in her family to help her and she had little kids who she did not want to end up with her abusive partner.
- He brought in prostitutes every night into the house, got some his filthy acquaintances to approach my mother for a night.
- She had to beg these men giving her kids as an excuse to not do anything to her 
- Cops at the time didn’t give a fuck unless you pay a ransom amount for support, hence she didn’t get any help from cops.
- Her partner never bought her proper food to eat 
- If he ever bought some ingredients to cook, he used to make her cook for his friends and made her eat leftovers
- Avoided her from using fan, AC and other home appliances so that she suffers in the heat
- Held her by the hair and smash her head on the wall a couple of times where she bled and caused severe balding on her head
- Mentally and physically tortured my mom every single day, she ended up giving birth to extremely malnourished and premature kids. 
- One endured jaundice at birth, one endured pneumonia at early stages and I dealt with cysts in my stomach which had to be operated
- One of her kids were close to not making it alive, when her baby survived (who is my elder brother) doctors marked it to be a miracle 
- Father was rich but never sent my siblings to school properly, but eventually did because of persuasion from neighbours who had sympathy for my mom and my siblings and he didn’t want his image to be tarnished
- However he never paid the school fees on time therefore some of siblings never made it through 1st grade
- None of my siblings don’t have a college degree or were able to complete college because he denied education thinking they will all end up with good jobs and take care of our mom.
- Mom endured this abuse for 30+ years
- She waited until one of her kids were old enough to support all of us in order to leave her partner for good
- My elder brother took responsibility of all of our school, education and he was 19 at the time. He was studying in a college but when father denied to support college expense he had to drop out at final year.
- My mom single handedly took care of the rest of us making sure we never felt like a dad was missing in our lives
- All this extreme pain and trauma has hung onto her, she ended up with two heart attacks for which we survived  
- Even after all of this, she manages to smile,laugh and put on a brave face
- She often tells us how she is baffled by the fact that she is still alive today.

Her story puts me in extreme sadness. Haven’t slept properly in years, got tons of sleeping issues thinking about mom. She has got chronic health issues and the fact corona virus is a thing just makes me scared even more because I don’t want her to contract it. We are still a family that tries to meet ends, but sometimes my mom wonders why she made it through all these, dying was once her only dream because she had it done with this world for good. Some of her neighbours convinced her to avoid suicide because there’s so much beauty to life but it didn’t take long for my mother to think that a beautiful life is just plain luxury.

Her pain is irreplaceable, unforgettable and has left a lifelong imprint within her memory. Even though the wound continues to remain raw, My mom still manages to have certain positive wishes that I hope to fulfil in her life. The reason why I’ve put this story out to the world is because on this Mother’s Day, I wanted to portray the strength of moms and even those single dads, who deal with all that amount of shit, endure the greatest of pains for the sake of their kids to ensure their peace and happiness. 

If you’ve got amazing mom and dad, I wanna say that me and my siblings always wished to be in your position, but if you’ve got a single parent who is amazing and taking good care of you, I wanna let you know that you’ve indeed got amazing parents. If you ever come across someone enduring abuse, depression or suicidal thoughts, please help them out. Even if it’s just that one friendly gesture, or those random acts of kindness, or a quick ‘how are you doing today? Or sharing your biscuit to the sad individual. Because these are the gestures my mom craved and lacked for. they are dealing with fucked up thoughts because they don’t have no one to get them out of that dark place. My mom is an example for being the one who got no one to help and nowhere to go. Please take a moment to say I love you or thank you to your wonderful parents, maybe give them a hug, even if y’all don’t get affectionate with each other. All I wish for is my mom to be there by my side for the rest of my life, watching her kids grow into beautiful individuals and make sure she lives the rest of her life happy which would make up to all the years she lost against sadness. Happy Mother’s Day to everyone.

I am a 15 year old white male, And I turn 16 in less than a month, and I’m currently in 10th grade. For a very long time I’ve felt like I wasn’t wanted, that people didn’t really care if I showed up or not, and it’s been this way since 6th grade.

I was never popular, nor did I want to be, in fact I alway gravitated more towards the least popular kids because I thought that if I could give them a friend, I’d feel a lot better, but I don’t.

I was constantly bullied and picked on, people called me a homosexual, I’m not, and they called me a faggot, basically a whole bunch of derogatory terms, but I still had friends, a whole bunch of them actually, and I was still feeling happy.

It wasn’t until 8th grade when I really started to notice that things in my life were taking a turn. People started avoiding me in anyway they could, hell even avoiding using the same bathroom as me. People would walk away if I joined in a conversation because I just wanted to talk. The people who bullied me tried to hurt me, mentally, socially, and physically. They always said things that effected me the most, they spread rumors about me that aren’t true, and they’ve tried tripping me down stairs and injuring me.

I slowly began to shut everyone out, I stopped talking, and I lost the little amount of friends I had, I separated myself from everybody, and for some reason, I felt happier than ever before, like I had just let go of the weight pulling me down.

But once 9th grade started everything felt wrong again, I felt something was missing in my life, and it was almost as if I was empty. This feeling of emptiness hurt me in every way possible, so I decided to open myself back up, and I regained the friends I had lost, and we’re all still very good friends, in fact they encouraged me to make this post, and now everything was back to how it was before, except I still felt lonely, and that something was missing.

Even having my friends back, it felt as if something was missing, and I have stayed up for hours, getting very little sleep, wondering what it was I am missing. I feel like this depressing loneliness will go away if I find what I’m missing, but I don’t know what it is.

Recently, due to the mandatory quarantines, people have come up with fun trends to pass the time. One of these trends has to do with instagram story sharing such as challenges where you tag a few friends. Two of the most popular ones are drawing a tomato or orange (or something else) and tagging friends to keep the loop going. Another one is called the ‘24 hour challenge’ where girls tag 10 girls in their lives they think are beautiful etc etc “spread positivity”, yada yada and the copy and paste format starts with “don’t be offended if I didn’t tag you” and you’re supposed to post a selfie. Basically I feel virtually socially excluded by these activities because not a SINGLE person tagged me on any of these. Whenever I scrolling through stories it’s ALL I see. “Oh look I have friends! Look at the people who tagged me and I’m tagging !” Obviously this isn’t new to me since I always been excluded in things like this, but it makes me feel so in acknowledged it hurts. It’s even more sad when you know most of these people but they don’t seem to even think of you. Idk maybe I’m just a sensitive person who cares about stupid shit. I’m just tired of feeling like a constant loner nobody how hard I try to put myself out there.

I thought, okay, maybe I’ll reach out to some other people. I reached out to 10 other people and got no responses.

No, I saw their stories and are having a whale of a time being able to stay at home, have friends over, chill out, etc.

Personality wise I have always been pretty friendly and easy-going. This allowed me to make a lot of friends in high school. By senior year of high school I pretty much had my solid group of friends and we’ve been friends ever since. Going into college I went to a local community college and the only friends I made were on my sports team. Because most of my teammates were international, my friendships with them dwindled when they returned home. Once I transferred out of my local community college I still couldn’t find friends. 

Fast forward a bit and I moved to a completely new city, 5 hours north of my past location. I moved to a completely new area to get over the monotonous situation I had back home. I was there for about 5 months ish and still couldn’t find a new friend. I thought maybe it was the people and how they were so work driven?

After awhile things didn’t work out and I moved career paths. I moved into a city that I actually dreamed of living. I’ve been here for almost 2 months and I really enjoy the area that I live in. The problem remains, I still haven’t made a new friend. I’m not sure whether there’s something wrong with me or maybe I’m not actually friendly or easy- going. 

I’ve moved to 3 different cities since high school and have only stayed friends with my high school friends. Many of these friends though seem to be advancing in life quicker than I am. They’re getting higher paying jobs, marriage, and kids while I’m sort of jumping left and right and not knowing where my future is heading.

Yesterday, I got a text from an acquaintance from a couple years back. Totally out of the blue. I thought it was great, I don't get texts very often. She sent some memes, I sent some, it was pretty cool. I figured, hey, I made a new friend, what more could I want?

Today I get a notification that she adds me on the app Houseparty, which is basically FaceTime but for friends of friends. I accept her friend request

I also get notifications that she goes on the app every 5 minutes or so. I was really confused. I had a weird suspicion that maybe it had something to do with me. I was right

I log on, and when you do it sends a notification to all your friends. She joins almost instantly, and gets in a call with me. She looks super excited from what I can see on my screen, like she's getting on call with a best friend, maybe even a crush. Rare occurrences for me, and even though I didn't have any interest in a romantic relationship with her, I figure I could use a friend

Then I move my face in shot.

Her smile fades, she looks confused more than anything. The only thing I hear is, ""what the fuck?"" And she leaves the call. Silence.

I didn't expect anything from the call, nor did I really want anything, but God damn that hurt. I guess she had been texting me this whole time thinking I was someone else, someone with the same name.

1148,MausAgain80,1584691775,1,"Being an island of unusual in an ocean of ""normal"" sameness is isolating, and by default sets us up to subconsciously feel like everything that makes us unique is bad....wishing we could just be like everyone else, which feeds that isolation.

The only way out of that is to power through and **find your tribe.**

Basic laws of existence dictate that like attracts like, and complimentary opposites attract. Every attribute you have that falls to the left or right of standard shrinks the pool of your tribe, those you are like, and those whose differences compliment yours.

There is nothing wrong with that! A smaller tribe still means millions of people out there who are like you, and have felt what you felt. They have possibly worked through this though, and would struggle to be around their fellow tribe members who haven't. If you don't love yourself, other people tend to not want to, especially if they see their own weaknesses or ones that they've overcome mirrored back at them. As long as you are on your path to escaping your island though, your tribe will be a mirror that allows you to love what you see in them that you share.

NOW, you have the essential key to ending loneliness. You shed your anxiety and self doubt, and start to see social interaction as a game - and that having the confidence card in your hand has changed everything about how you can play. All of your atypical attributes become cards that don't come in a standard deck, they are either assets or part of what makes you, you and gives you your assets. Your tribe will recognize and embrace you wherever you go. You can now bring people in who haven't found their own way yet.

TL;DR Embrace and love your differences at any cost, and you will attract others with the same or similar differences not matter how rare. Once you have those people on your team, you have all of the power.",lonely,Are You a Lonely Island of Unusual?,2020-03-20 19:09:35

Then they both attacked me calling me fake. I have never felt depressed or suicidal in my life until this happened. I don’t think it would matter if I died or not it’s not like anybody loves me. I want to die but at the same time I don’t. I have no friends. Everybody at school judges me by the way I look and I don’t understand why.

When I was little my siblings would always hit me when both my parents would leave and throw things at me, and yet I can’t find a way to hate them. My heart is so big that I can’t seem to hate my siblings. Nowadays that doesn’t happen anymore. My grandma died when I was in 6th grade, that was the worst day of my life. My grandpa on my dads side died a few hours after I was born and my grandma on my dads side died a few years prior. All I had left was my moms side. When my grandma died I didn’t eat for 2 days, I cried for I don’t know how many days in a row. Thank god my mom had friends to come over while my mom and dad flew to the funeral in Norway!

I only eat a few times a day and I’ve lost a lot of weight! With all this hate I’ve had it broke me and I wish I could go back to normal and forget any of this happened!

1170,lonelinessroom,1584675754,1,"What is your loneliness room?

Dear Friends,

I am undertaking a creative research project that explores how people experience loneliness, using the notion of the loneliness room as the central way to express it.

For the purpose of this project the loneliness room is defined as a real or imagined space where we feel lonely or go to find loneliness. We may also prefer to call this quality or state one of aloneness where it is solitude and isolation we seek.

Each of us will have our very own version of the loneliness room: it could be the hills we walk on, a morning swim at the beach or the local swimming pool, listening to a certain sad song in our bedroom, the morning commute, writing in our diary, or the park we go to sit in at lunchtime.

The project explores not just the isolation of loneliness but the social, creative and experiential possibilities of loneliness in all walks of life: this is loneliness as a natural part of the human condition.

I am asking those interested in taking part to respond to the idea of the loneliness room through sharing their creative responses and/or completing a short questionnaire.

The creative response is meant to capture your loneliness room and can be:  
Photograph(s) (with/without captions)  
Short video(s)  
Drawing(s)  
Painting(s)  
Diary  
Social media posts  
Hand-written letter(s) (which could be posted to me)  
Songs, composition, audio  
Recorded performance

These creative responses will then be housed in a loneliness room website, where participants can also directly post their own representations of the loneliness room. These responses can either be ‘signed’ or anonymous.

If you are interested in taking part please:

a) Forward me your creative interpretation of the loneliness room using any media you feel comfortable with. You can also supply an accessible link to this work for this purpose.

b) Complete the online questionnaire, available here: [https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/…/…/SV\_eet1GBIsIn3etiR](https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_eet1GBIsIn3etiR?fbclid=IwAR0CmhOAoHquHLL8ap7T65w1qJmUSKu61zKedX2tm_2Zxc0BK6x68m1vIvE)

1171,WillofChampions,1584675617,1,"I'm a 28yo guy, and I know I'm not alone in being lonely, or the oldest, but it just feels like there's no one that wants to be with me. 

Or ever will.

To begin with I have very little self-confidence and on the off chance that I actually do meet a girl that I can talk to in a normal casual manner it doesn't go anywhere.  Every time I have a little hope, every time I meet a new girl that I think I'm hitting it off with...ghost.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. They say Im cute, I make them laugh, I'm not a creep.... but it isn't enough.

My job doesn't help.

I'm active duty military, and while at work I'm too busy to feel lonely, I'm also so stressed out I can't catch my breath...and I'm there for 44 hours in a 72 hour period. Which makes going anywhere to meet someone incredibly difficult.

I'm sorry everyone who read this pity party and whose time I just wasted, but it feels like my chest is caving in. I want to have a nice cathartic cry, but I'm not sure if I remember how, and if I start I don't know when I'll be able to stop.",lonely,My heart hurts,2020-03-20 14:40:17
1172,hamartiated,1584675560,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I don’t think I do anything wrong, but maybe it’s because I don’t do anything? Regardless, I knew the problem was me. 

This led me to just leaving everyone alone. The problem is that I’m always alone now, to the point where I think it’s hurting me. I’ve always known something was wrong with me, that I wasn’t born correctly. I have always been the one that was bullied and left behind. I do have family but I havnt talked to them in months, recently I found out my dad has cancer and that it’s not looking good. So maybe I’ll be seeing them soon.

Anyways, I don’t have any history of psychosis but I do have a long history of depression. I used a sharp object on myself at 14. It’s just always been depression and not really any delusional thoughts or behaviour. But recently I find myself talking to myself more and hearing voices at night when I’m trying to sleep.

I can’t even be around people because I might end up being jealous of them. If they are able to succeed in being able to make friends. If they are able to talk to people first and hold conversations. I can’t do these things. I wish I knew how, I wish  weren’t like this.

I hate myself.

I hate myself because I don’t have the ability to try and make friends. If someone saw another person and wanted to be their friend, they’d probably go to them, introduce themselves. Or maybe ask them a simple question, which will hopefully lead to a conversation that will create a bond between the two of them, which will eventually lead to a friendship. When I see someone, and think about being their friend, I actually don’t do anything at all. Why? I’m just too shy. I’ve never met the person before, I’m usually not comfortable around people I’ve never been around. But Audrey, how are you gonna make friends if you don’t go to that person at least? I don’t know. Probably all the friends that I’ve made in the span of my whole life were made because that person came up to me *wow shocker* or because of mutual friends. There have been so many cases of me being left out in school, being excluded from things. The only time people would need me if it was for group work. But that was in middle school, I’m not so smart in high school right now. People would only need me if they needed help in something. Never really had genuine conversations with people, maybe only with 3 or 4 people at the time. This is why I know a lot of people in this school, but a lot of them don’t know me personally. Most people in this school know me for being smart. But for the people that really know me, they know I’m not that smart. Yes, I have some friends, but I still feel lonely because those people still make me feel excluded from certain things, and they don’t truly know everything about me because I fear that they will just judge me for that.

With the concept of me being unattractive, I truly and strongly believe that that is one of the main problems to my loneliness. I know this is something crazy to say, but based on my experience, and witnessing it from other people, the people that have less friends are the ones that are found unattractive by the general public. It isn’t easy typing this, although I have typed about this so many times, it’s hard right now because this is really sinking deep inside me, and I have tears rolling down my face. It’s really sinking in because what if I’m like this for the rest of my life. What if I just don’t know how to approach people, what if I’m just always gonna be shy? 

I’m sick.

All I do is complain, and not do anything to solve my issues. I don’t do anything. All I do is just keep having jealousy and envy.

This is my first time being single in at least 6 years, it feels so weird not having a gf, at this point it was already a part of me, always been a guy who enjoys spending lots of time with a single person, very romantic, always wanting to make things for a single individual.

I started dating a girl back in 2015 and since then i jumped from a relationship to another, always been asked to go out and when things didn't work out with the actual gf i started dating the other (never cheated).

I dated 5 girls in the last 5 years, never been single for more than a week until now, I'm a very open person so i really enjoy dating because i can vent out all my dark secrets and so on.

My relationships always started like this:

1.  Meet girl
2. Hang out with girl
3. Get to know each other
4. Girl ask me out
5. I say Yes
6. Feel disappointed in girl
7. Dump girl

This has been a cycle so far in my life, I've never fallen for someone even though i tried every single time, i don't really know where my heart is any longer...

The reason i left most of them, was because they hurt me somehow, i kept trying to make it work in every single one of my relationships but it didn't work out in the end so i take the last possible decision...

I can't even remember what was my point with this post. It just feels off because i chose the day before the pandemic was announced to break up with my last gf, she was... Kind and nice, and had everything i wanted but... I caught her pointing out my flaws with her friends and internet strangers, also sexting (she said it was a joke when i argued about it), also she became very distant (and though she wanted to work things out), she took a month and a half to see the problem, i just couldn't trust her anymore. I'm not gonna lie, we were friends for 4 years or so, so i still miss her company.

Things in life are not going great, i had such big plans for 2020, marry this girl i just mentioned, move out with her, make a company with her and a friend of mine, i was trying really hard to make things work with her, since we always thought we were meant to be together, now... I don't really have plans, and the few goals i still have are paused because of coronavirus... I hope this reaches out to someone.

My gf is in the foster care system, her foster mom took away her a few weeks ago (for private reasons) but my gf sneaks it all the time without her knowing. We chat a lot b/c we have a very talkative relationship and are VERY affectionate towards one another. However, less than an hour ago, she texted me that her foster mom is changing their internet password and that we won't be able to talk for 2 weeks. We both go to high school in Canada, and in Canada they've extended March Break until April due to the coronavirus. We can't see each other in person.

All I know is that I can't text her now. I love my girlfriend a lot. The last thing she texted asked for me not to cry, but I think I will if we can't talk for 2 weeks.

I've never had good luck with women. It was hard to have a girlfriend in high school and I only took 1 semester of college because of financial reasons. I eventually did meet a girl that showed a lot of interest in me and we got married. But as time went on I learned that she was a compulsive liar and our marriage came to an end. I had 1 other girlfriend for a while but it ended as well. 

I have 2 friends that have been like brothers to me. But they have their own families that they've started now, they don't really need me anymore. I have an older sister but she's married and has a son with autism so she has her work cut out for her. My dad is currently dying from stage 4 lung cancer, but I can't even be there for him because he lives in Panama city and I'm in Indiana.

1221,HelgaHufflepuff91,1584650081,1,"  

I am beyond frustrated. I am 29, living at home, and working a part-time job with a Sociology Degree. Over the past year and a half, I have applied for hundreds of jobs and received no calls back. I live in an aging province where the taxes are high and the job market is known to be terrible. I finally realized that a Bachelor of Arts is getting me nowhere and would like to go back to school for an Masters in Occupational Therapy. The job market and pay are both good, and I would be good at it.

However, I cannot do this because I need to upgrade two courses to get in. I cannot do that because I o not have money, since I cannot get a full time job. I am barely scraping by with my current position and I feel like a loser and incredibly guilty that I am unable to help my mom more. I currently pay a third of the rent and about half of the groceries, but I have nothing for utilities, and I would like to pay half the rent and care for my mom someday. I want to take her to Italy, where her ancestors are from. I don’t feel she should be burdened by me. This is pressure on her and I wish I could do more. BUT I AM GETTING NOWHERE AND I AM BEYOND FRUSTRATED. I am also 50k in student loan debt. I keep having to get interest halted since I cannot make payments. 

For background, I am mixed race and was raised by a single mother. I never knew my father (he had a drug problem and was overall not a great person), and my mother had a horribly abusive childhood and made mistakes with men. As a teenager, I was awful. I dealt with bullying and my own issues surrounding abandonment and I would fly into dissociative rages and my mom would have to call the cops on me. It is a terrible memory and I will always blame myself for causing hurt to those around me, even though that was all I could do at the time. It got better when I was diagnosed with depression and medicated. I have also used food as a coping mechanism for emotional pain for my whole life and am severely overweight. I feel my life has been shaped around a general theme of hating myself and coping however I could. 

My mother has her own severe emotional issues from an abusive childhood and although she was a loving mom and an angel on Earth, of course some of that gets projected onto children. She has never been in a functional romantic relationship, ever. I have also never, and don’t really think I am capable of it. I have made peace with that, however, I wish my mother could find someone, as I feel responsible for her well being in many ways (we are totally alone and isolated and each other’s sole emotional support system, which is pressure on us both).  

Now, I have a great relationship with my mom. She relies on me a lot as well for emotional support. But my younger brother (who is 22) has what I would pretty confidently say is Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He is verbally abusive to my mother and extremely controlling of the two of us. I recognize that this living arrangement cannot go on. 

But we are unable to move forward or change our lives until I have more income. And I am just having no luck and it kills me. 

Over the past year, I have done many good things for my situation. I am eating healthy, working out and losing weight. I apply for jobs all the time, and I have finally gotten off of antidepressants. I recognize that I must now make up for my poor decisions in my youth and move forward. But how will I get anywhere if I cannot find stable employment? I am even more frustrated as COVID19 is going to seriously impair my job search and likely delay me. I was hoping to have something secure within the next 2 months or so. 

I just feel extremely alone and would like someone to tell me that I am not a loser and that things will work out. I am doing all that I can right now, but it never feels like enough. Thank you very much for listening.",lonely,I just need someone to tell me it will all be okay and I am not a loser,2020-03-20 07:34:41
1222,bluesnakes321,1584650007,1,"I've been in my room a whole week now. Due to the coronavirus we have been working from home since last friday. My ""office"" is a desk in one of the two wardrobes in my room. All of the jobs we had lined up for the summer have been cancelled because of the coronavirus so there is very little for me to do whilst sat at my desk.


I rent a room in a house with strangers. I have tried getting to know them all and offered hanging out etc but nothing ever comes of it. The 2 boys I live with just want to play their computer games and not really interact much. The girl I live with is never home so is a bit of a mystery to me. I've not seen or heard her at all since this coronavirus stuff has me indoors a lot. 


I moved here and broke up with my boyfriend who I lived with before. That was in November. 


Since then I have lost my closest friends because we were all part of the same friendship group. He moved in with some of them and their house is the place where they all hang out and have parties etc. I have seen my 2 ""best friends"" 3 times since we broke up. It has become so clear that they were never my friends but his.. the one that lives with him told me ""I want to invite you to things but he is going through a bit of a mental phase right now"". That is fine, I respect his space. It was my choice to break up.


For the sake of my mental health, I stopped drinking and doing any recreational drugs. I know it doesnt sound like a lot but I am 24 days sober and dont think I have been sober for that long since I started drinking as a teen. My ex and his friends all drink heavily and do drugs a lot. That's part of why I didnt really want to be together anymore because I didnt want that to be my life.


But now I'm so detached. I've been lonely like never before. I started seeing someone from work who moved to this city 6 years ago. He has a super close family and so many friends. He moved into this amazing place with his pals. And I'm so jealous. 


I've been here nearly 2 years. I know no one other than colleagues. I've made one real friend from my old job and now I'm starting to see that we aren't as close as I once thought either. My family all live hours away. 


Last weekend I wanted to go to my dads for the weekend but didn't. I don't know why not. I guess we aren't close enough for me to want to have done that.


The house my friends and ex moved into is so close to me. I keep trying to stalk my friend on strava to see exactly where they live but I cant work it out. I just want to walk past and see it but that's such an insane thing to do. I dont know why I started thinking that. 


I had started to try and meet new people through facebook groups and going to things regularly. Now this coronavirus has everyone staying home, I have no one again.


I have so much to do at home, I've got about a million hobbies lol. So the whole staying in thing is actually really good for me to develop my skills in those which I am grateful for. 


But fuckk this is so lonely and I feel numb. Without any social human interaction I can feel myself slowing down. I excersize every day and eat healthy but its other people I need. I miss everyone. I dont know how I'm going to go on like this for so long.

I have a circle of good friends and a girlfriend that I love with all my heart, but still, I can't escape the feeling that no one will ever *actually* understand me.

Years are passing by me and all I do is think obsessively about things that I'll never have. These dreams make me realize that in such a painful way.

When I say things that I'll never have, I don't mean material things. I mean feelings. Billie represents a wild but gentle soul with whom I vibe on a different level. A person free from the shackles of this god forsaken place. She represents a friend from the neighborhood that I can always hit up to just hang around the block and absorb the sunshine. She's something that no one I know will ever be.

In my dreams we do regular ass things around this regular ass concrete town that I've spent my whole life in. This morning Billie, her friend and I were running away from someone. It was scary, but that wasn't the main emotion I felt -- I was almost tranquil being with those two. I felt immense love and understanding that I also reciprocated. Typing this out is almost making me cry, and I'm a 23 year old grown ass man.

I lived with a very abusive family. Without going into details. My character as well as my personality were pretty much none existent. Since i was a child i never managed to make friends or do well at school and my social skills were zero. I've been living in depression since my childhood.

Fast forward to now. I feel like i've matured a little bit and managed to escape the depression zone. I live alone and most of my time now i feel pretty good. But i just can't improve my character or personality. I've been trying since forever but still no actual good result. There is nothing really going on for me.

It was better to live the pain rather than numb it.

Getting out of bed feels useless, the pain of your loneliness has confided you to a cruel prison, bit by bit you get up, some of us win some of us give up.

1264,wt_anonymous,1584604859,1,"**(This was repurposed from a rant post, so keep that in mind. I'll appreciate any input, including just a ""damn bro"", I just appreciate human interaction at this point)**

Im an anxiety filled mess of a human being because I never practiced socializing when I was younger. My mom was too social for her own good and my dad did bad socially (like he can be kind of a dick), so I never had good guidance for that. I didnt have siblings to practice with, either. I'm an only child. 

So much of my fucking childhood was spent alone... it just occured to me recently but it had to have been obvious. I was always desperate for people to play with me, even adults. Once in awhile neighbors would hang out with me, but it was short lived. I can't name more than a few times that happened. I can remember constantly trying to get adults to do something with me... like even just playing a video game. 

Didnt get better with school, I was naturally shy so making friends wasn't easy. And the few friends I did make had really strict parents so I hardly ever got to talk to them until we were older and able to use Skype (which still barely made a difference, and it was too late at that point). 

And I fucking realized recently how much this effected me. I had NO ONE to talk to as a kid. I couldn't talk about things I liked, and I couldn't get anyone to help me on anything. The advice my parents RARELY gave me was shit.

My uncles literally bullied me as a kid and my parents did nothing. They did nothing until it concerned my fucking school. It got so bad I couldn't help but just randomly mention it to my teachers. It wasn't that bad, but it was for so fucking long and I had no one to talk to about it- it just slowly built up over time until it concerned my school. Fuck.
And it got worse with my ACTUAL grade school bully who was an ass up until the day he left the school. ""Just ignore him"" my parents fucking said until I couldn't help but cry about it. 

So many of my fucking issues today just stem from the fact I had no one to talk to as a fucking kid! Fuck me.

But I quickly throw away that idea, that no one will like me and it’s silly to think about that. So I keep a mind set that no one will care, cause anyway I can’t tell people how I feel, cause if I do feel sad and depressed people punch that idea with “be a man” and I close up realizing that the person I do Like. Won’t like me back, but I will never know, the anxiety and nerves overcome me. And the thought of being rejected hits me harder then a Boulder. Or things won’t be the same.

Hi Everyone! During this time of the cornonavirus and having to stay home and enact social distancing, I've found the perfect way to keep busy and offer some relief from everything going on in the world around us. I've been inspired by Netflix's Hit Show ""Love Is Blind"" and I'm inviting you to see if that's actually true for yourselves!

Here's how it works. Using the link attached you are going to fill out the survey to the best of your abilities. From there I will place you all into groups of ten according to your responses. Once everyone is placed we will hold blind speed dating rounds to test your compatibility. Depending upon the demand we will have one (possibly more) speed dating rounds per day. If you think that you have a match at the end of your seventh round, you'll be eligible for a face reveal and will be able to take on your love story form there. Once we have all the participants I will go ahead and post an update going further in-depth about the process.

If you're interested go ahead and give it a shot!! The application will close on March 21st by midnight.

A group-chat will be made for all participants and updates will be posted there.

This starts March 25th, can't wait to see you there!

1309,Maari_Blanc,1584574045,1,"I used to have a a lot of friends back in middle school and I think I was the one who pulled away first, I was never allowed to go out and hang outside of school so of course it was bound to happen. I don’t even have Facebook either, I would if I could but I don’t feel like having my mom constantly checking on it and having relatives who I would rather keep at a distance contact me.

Throughout my high school years I’ve only had three friends (One was my ex)  and I was happy with them, up until last year two had betrayed me and the other hardly had access to a phone so she didn’t know anything. I’ve made a lot of poor choices since then, I’m tired of constantly trying to prove my worth to them.. My ex cheated on me and refused to tell the other girl or to get rid of her the entire time and wanted to keep me in his life, my friend simply didn’t want to bother anymore entirely and told me that I was straight up toxic and that she wanted to stay away from me. I was going through withdrawal symptoms from anti depressants I was on at the time (I cut myself off cold turkey and I think it’s messed with my head at this point) and I know I shouldn’t have bothered, but they were all that I had all these years.. I don’t know how to let go. I’ve been sheltered all my life and I just.. don’t know what to do.

I tried making friends before on here and Instagram but it never really worked out except for two, one who has been dealing with my withdrawal mind and honestly I feel terrible, he shouldn’t have to deal with a lot of things in his life and I want the best for him. I really do. He’s been there much longer and has become a really good friend of mine.

I want to become a better person, a new mindset, I would really like to make new friends.. not to replace the ones I had before, I want new experiences; Let me hear your stories, the good and bad times, let’s talk late into the night about whatever, lets.. become good friends

1312,abcde88888,1584572217,0,"I’ve been living in my head thinking about what went wrong with this woman I’ve fallen for. It's not exactly a break-up but we've gone out a few times!

We first met back in mid-2018, connected briefly, then went back to our respective countries which are on opposite sides of the world. We stayed in touch and met once again at the end of the year when I travelled to her country.

During the second half of 2019, we got in touch again and started text almost every day and have occasional scheduled calls. While we still lived far away, I felt there was a connection between us and the conversations have always been… natural, raw and personal. As we grew closer, I picked up the courage to do things that I hoped would show how I felt, such as sending her a gift on her birthday, which she seemed to love. I’ve been honest about how I thought she was special and amazing - although I never said “I like you”.

Then, we met again in Christmas 2019 when I travelled to her place again. At this point, I started to really like her but was unsure of what would happen with the distance - and the fact that there’s no chance of us moving closer to each other in the next 2 years at least. We went out a few times and had the best time. I did what I thought would show how I felt - flowers, gifts with handwritten notes, picked up the tabs and planned the dates to her liking. By this point, it was clear that both of us really enjoyed each other’s company. She has always been receptive of my advances and said she had lovely time with me, asked me to visit often.

I was still hesitant to tell her outright I liked her, as I was still hoping there would come a day in which we’ll live in the same city together, and I’d stand a better chance then. Throughout our interaction, I've felt she's not the type who could do a long-distance. I was trying to make an arrangement in which I would live closer to her for a few months mid-year and wanted to use the momentum to tell her then.

Anyway, after returning home, we still texted. I did a couple more things to keep keep the “sparks”, e.g. sending flowers to her office, which she said she liked! 

However, several weeks in, things turned different. After she came back from a trip to visit her parents, her schedules had turned busy with work and other commitments, and she started responding less. I didn’t have any reason to believe that she didn’t want to speak with me - everything was going well just before that. I didn’t hear back for a couple of weeks, couldn’t call her. Finally managed to hear back. She said she’d been hectic so wasn’t able to text anymore. I was surprised so decided to tell her outright how I felt. She then said she just wanted to be friends and saw me as a friend/brother figure and that she doesn't want me to waste my effort/time. I was surprised because she never referred to me as a ""friend"".

I've been replaying this to figure out if there was anything I could have done to save the situation. Or is trying to build a relationship someone you barely know long-distance a lost cause from the beginning?

Things started to get worse when they made an appointment to go to the mall or watch a movie. I am a very busy person, always studying for exams or doing anything related to school, and because of that, my mother does not let me go out during the week, only on the weekend, where I have more free time. Once, when they asked me why I couldn't go to the event, I explained the whole situation involving school activities and exams. Everything seemed normal and, I still felt part of the group, even if it was a very little. However, at the end of 2018, I repeated my year at school, and ended up separating myself from this group of friends, who started high school. Since then, I have been gradually excluded from everything, events, birthdays, whatsapp conversations, everything in general. Every time I send a message in the group, it seems that all the members disappear and ignore my message, starting another subject. Please help me, this whole subject is making me very bad and making me very sad, and i don't know what to do anymore. Im tired of meeting someone, and after some time, see them leaving me

However, my sister left her kids(7  years girl and 2 year boy) so she can live ""her life"" and now I'm stuck taking care of them 24/7(been 4 months now). 
Because of that I have no money(no job) nor time(kids and online school) to go out with friends. 
I've been doing bad in online classes because I'm struggling to learn and I have little time to study and when I do, I try to enjoy my little time I have free. I wanted to take the semester off but my father told me if I did I'd lose my tricare benefits and my mother threaten to kick me out of the house if i did. 
I'm gonna be doing this until summer or even after summer. I want to socialize with my friends but I rarely ever talk to them and kids broke my Xbox so I can't even play with my friends. My girlfriend broke up with me because I hardly spent anytime with her. So now I'm more lonely than ever. 
I hardly have any hobbies and I'm slowly losing interest in things I love.

And does it feel like that you must be really blind as to how you really are, and in this sense walks in the blind, not knowing how to fix yourself?

Do you feel like you are not able to not be lonely because you're scared due to being so wrong, that it feels like you not only could be jinxing people, but that you should not be existing?

She was the worst girlfriend anyone could’ve imagined and my friends told me that often. I ignored all of them, I had put so much work into this relationship and I loved her. When I told her I loved her she didn’t say anything and made a joke about how she didn’t love me later. When I asked what I could do to fix our sex life that was only ever a thing in the first two weeks she said “I think that ship has sailed for us”. When I told her I’d always wanted to kiss my girlfriend at midnight on New Years she said she hated one of the friends I invited so she refused to go. Then she got mad at me for being sad she wasn’t going. On Valentine’s Day we were going to go to a concert and we were supposed to write each other poems. She had this bad habit of distancing me without telling me why except for this time she would also yell at me when I would try to kiss her. Still I tried to be hopeful that this night would work out. The card she made me was actually nice but the rest of the night I just felt like a driver while her and her friends enjoyed the show. She got mad at me in front of her friends for wanting a picture with her at the show because she told me earlier she didn’t want any pictures. She took one with her friends though and on the car ride home refused to hold my hand 4 times because it was too cold and I just sat there rubbing my hand on my jeans to warm it up for 10 minutes. I broke up with her the next morning because she said she never asked me to do the things I did for her in the relationship and that I shouldn’t expect anything back. She promised that she wouldn’t change because this was just the way she was. I have yet to experience a fulfilling romantic relationship in my life. 


I know breaking up with her was the best thing for me but I feel so alone and this social isolation thing while the world is going crazy is so hard.

3. Puts minimum effort to reply
4. Have their own group of friends they rather hang out with instead

Due to past events, I have a horrible fear of trusting people and of abandonment so it is almost impossible to make new friends that would stick around or be fine with small groups of maximum 3 people as any larger numbers tend to scare me into not talking and just vanishing.

Plus, I find that im always the one initiating something. For once I would like someone to converse with me or ask me out first.

I’m sorry you get no matches on those glorified hook up apps. I’m sorry women are forced to believe that they have to be with the hottest or richest guy. I’m sorry that the attractive girls are cruel and that a lot of cute girls are unstable. There’s no ugly girls or guys and there’s nothing wrong with standards. They say we end up falling in love around our late 20’s-30’s because that’s crunch time, when we realize we’re getting old and soon no one will want us. Maybe we are too young to fall in love. I keep telling myself this because I can’t overcome past trauma that stops me from falling in love or allowing men to get near me. I know I’m just using excuses but I don’t have my shit together yet. I can’t be worrying about love when I can’t even love or forgive myself. Please don’t try to end it all. Keep going and work on yourself. Maybe you have flaws you must work on? While you’re alone at this time because you will meet someone I can promise you that, concentrate on who you are as a person. Do you like the man you see in the mirror? Are you treating him well? What’s wrong with him? What don’t you like about him? Just do you until you are financially, mentally, and physically stable. After that seek love or even better a long friendship that can turn into romance. That’s the stuff that lasts forever or so I’ve heard. 

This is for everyone not just directed to men, we could all learn to love and forgive ourselves. If you get into a relationship without accomplishing this you’ll be swallowed by your lovers existence and become part of their life not co-exist. Women have struggles too, we all do.

in these quarantine days i had a lot of time thinking about some shit happened  in my life 

I m 23 yo M and at the age of 14 i have been sexually  harass by an much older  man , he tried to kiss me and touchs me , i didn't know what i do , but somehow i run away . i didn't tell anyone about this in my entire life till this moment , i feel it s kinda break something inside me but i tried to move on and forget that even happend . that was the first thing that broke my trust in my self and changed me. 

Also i m from an middle East country so i was afraid from society and how  if i spoke things will be. 

at the age of 16 , i was riding my bike at midnight  near my home some police car thought that i was fishy and doing some  troubles , i got beaten up by them , throw to their car , and insulted by them  took me to the police station and kept insulting me there . the beating marks were all over my back and arms , i didn't want to make a scene or idk i was afraid maybe i just went home cried the whole night and my family didn't notice or know shit . i just isolated my self and that's it ... 

that was the 2 thing that broke me and i feel like since that time , i have lost all the joy and feelings in me , i pretend to be happy and kept myself busy so i don't think about  shit . 

idk why i m writing this ... i feel like i can do a lot of things and accomplish a lot but sometimes i just can't take it anymore and isolate my self again . I m a software engineering student , yeah sometimes i keep pushing myself to do my best but it couple of days , everything just vanish , all that trust and energy just gone .

No idea if anyone else has this, but it seems I'm rude and/or hurtful all the time without meaning it.

Like, sometimes I say things that are meant as compliments, but they come across as very mean. Or I ask someone to do something, but it's in an apparently rude way. Stuff like this happens very often.

Whenever I say something stupid like that, I don't get it at first. Until someone else tells me, and then I manage to imagine myself in the other person's situation and I start to feel bad. It's like speaking before you think. But at other times, I think of every scenario before saying something because I'm quite shy - but even then I might still say something rude.

It's gotten to a point where I almost think I might be autistic or something, even though people told me that I'm probably not.

Does this happen to anyone else? I guess it comes from social inexperience (I hardly had any friends until the end of high school and just stayed inside, gaming all day).

1394,hamartiated,1584502203,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I'm not a lonely person, I quite enjoy my own company though, I'll happily spend time (up to a lot of time) on my own. I have no difficulty making IRL &amp; online friends, I'm in a relationshjp that I'm perfectly happy with (emotionally / sexually etc...) so essentially to be clear, I'm looking for a purely platonic, friend / friend relationship and I feel like this could, possibly, be one of the places I could come to find a mutual friendship that can be agreeable in terms. (not the only place this is being posted).

Long story short, my life and mental situation is complicated,  but I'm looking to work / improve that and I've been told I'm pretty alright company so... it takes 2 to tango? xDD 

I mean I'm looking for someone who I can be completely honest with without fear of recompense  etc... I dunno it's a strange one to explain, much easier to do as part of a dialogue, I typically tend to get on more with females, but, I'm open to discussions with anyone of any gender etc... etc... if you need to vent / rant, I'm perfectly capable of helping you with that, but I'm looking for a situation of mutual help so yes. That's deffo a plus for me!

A little bit about me, I'm from the UK, although timezones are no issue, I'm male (classic! xD) mid / late 20's, looking for a non-judgemental friend to talk through ""normal"" shit and feelings in an abnormal way / aspect.... probably not articulating well.... hence the throwaway, but, regardless of the above, I'm also up for being a beacon of optimism / help if you need it so by all means reach out if you need someone to talk to.... this has been harder to articulate than expected lol much love people of r/lonely I get how you feel and wish ya'll all the best!!!

My “best friend” since I was 3 or 4 (20 now) has likely given me COVID19 for starters, I have lung issues and he knows this yet he’s laughing at me for being annoyed with him. On top of that our friendship is basically just him arguing with me saying I’m wrong, or him bragging about making more money than me. Also I had nowhere to stay so he said I could crash on his couch, now he’s charging me a crazy amount of rent and if I don’t pay it or something it’ll mess up my life with my family too as his entire family is close with mine. 

I don’t have many other friends they all eventually get tired of me and leave and I don’t have any idea on how to make friends despite being popular in high school a few years ago.

I do thankfully have a girlfriend but I’ve been so depressed lately that it’s hard to see the point in even having a relationship. 

I’m so numb emotionally, if I do have COVID-19 I’m not even bothered by it. The only thing I really feel is loneliness. I just want a couple genuine friends who care about me, that I enjoy being around, etc. I’ve given up on most of my aspirations in life, at this point I really just want to feel like people care for me and want me around in any capacity.

1412,Diiny89,1584492835,1,"I think I’ve always craved attention in a way where it has sort of taken over the usual thoughts that I have. I spend most of my time thinking and daydreaming and this has been especially apparent in the last couple of years since I never came to terms with the fact that I havent and will never amount to anything in life. In most cases I’m just a drug infatuated degenerate 17 year old whos whole life revolves around playing video games and being high. Me not being attracted to anything that life offers has made my life very monotone and depressing. There is nothing that can really fill the lonely ness that has taken over my day. There really isn’t anything that keeps me going, there isn’t a lot of reason for me to wake up, to find a girlfriend, to be a normal functioning human being. Everything in life is very dull and useless. Nothing gives joy or pleasure because I feel as I am too aware of the fact that life truly has no inherent meaning. I’m not religious so me existing on this earth has no value at all. 

To go back to my first statement. I feel as recently I have gotten insecure about how I spend my days. Being in love with drugs and sitting my room doing nothing, It’s almost like I’m missing out on something that I am not aware of. It’s almost like I am jealous over usual teenagers who are socially and sexually active and people who don’t suffer from a constant loop of thoughts which remind them of the fact that us living on this earth means absolutely nothing. I wish I also could go to parties every weekend but not because parties are fundamentally fun, more so because it’s a distraction from the cruel mystery which is life. Because of the fact that I am a loner and completely insecure about my personality and looks, I have found myself constantly pondering and fantasizing about what it would be like to be a teenager who is confident in themselves, has constant attention surrounding them and has several clicks they fit into while also being popular with girls. What I meant with me craving attention is that I would love to be a chad girl magnet that gets invited to parties but instead I’m just me. I want to feel like I’m wanted in someway and I want the attention that I have been missing throughout all my life. 

Even though I am completely fine with being alone, at this point it has gotten overboard. Instead of trying to act on my emotions which usually tell me to better myself, I find myself trying to drown my discontent with life and my insecurities with weed or music and before it was even Xanax. This disconnect I feel severely affects my mood and my outlook on life in general. I’m never happy neither necessarily sad, I’m just stuck in the middle. I can’t feel happiness or enjoyment from anything but I’m also never angry or frustrated about anything. I don’t really know where to go as I feel I am completely alone and that there is no one to talk to at all about this. I’m weird and completely disconnected with everyone else in my environment. I have to put up a facade every time I am in school or every time I am with people but as soon as I come home I am completely lonely and quiet. Sadly because of my human biology my body doesn’t really want to kill itself so I will forever be stuck in this torture that is life, I have no where to go and no one would understand who I am as a person and if I anyone did they would definitely just look at me like I’m some sort of fucking alien who can barely function. 

I am 100% sure literally no one will find this but w/e, I have never posted on reddit before so I might aswell try. &lt;3",lonely,"I, 17 year old Swedish dude, feel completely disconnected with life.",2020-03-18 11:53:55
1413,dj000nt,1584491927,1,"Im a 21 year old... VIRGIN guy who is a roughly, a disaster.  I'm about to graduate college relationshipless and a virgin.  It feels like I've wasted the four easiest years of sex and relationships I'll ever have.  Everyone else seems to have an s/o by now.  I recently asked a girl from class out and she said she was taken.  It didn't feel like rejection, it felt more like her just saying she can't cause she's seeing someone else, if that makes sense.  She was really nice about it and even seemed a little happy I asked her out (which briefly gave me a hope that I shouldn't have), but honestly, it felt like my last chance.  My school is largely antisocial as it's a commuter school, but still, the only interaction I ever really have with people is there.  My PT job is a group of five guys and that's it.  I'm not gay so I don't want to fuck any of them, however... just kidding.  

I've been so depressed and nervous around people for years due to how my first true ""love"" dumped my ass for another guy four years ago.  She was my first kiss at age 18 or so.  I became bitter, cold, angry, spiteful, depressed, isolated, etc.  Lost all my friends.  That hasn't changed throughout college.  Didn't help that one of my best friends was killed in a car accident at the same time that BITCH cheated.  Didn't help that my own dad sexually abused me when I was younger.  Pretty sure that's fucking up my self-conscious.  I've had a few girls express interest in me that were honestly pretty good looking - one eye fucking me and one basically begging for it sending me pics in bed, and I just, for some reason, never took the initiative on either.  I want to do it just to get it over with at this point, but I keep stopping myself when I get my very few chances.  At the same time, I'm not even so much interested in sex as much as I am in just having someone to lie next to and feel loved.  I've never had that and there's an empty pit inside of me.  Shit, I don't even really have friends to go out with.


The reality is that I know what I need to do to in an attempt to get laid - say fuck it and go out and meet people, but I don't know where to start.  I need to just not be myself, because myself is just some introverted video game playing loser with no friends or girlfriend. I honestly feel pretty confident in my looks.  Im a really funny guy but my humor can be pretty dark and my personality can be a bit... abrasive?  It's just that now with college ending, Im going to have even less access to meeting people than before, and I already failed at that shit.  It's only gonna get harder from here.  Should I just load up on condoms and start going to go to bars by myself to try and pick up girls?  Not like lift/carry them, but you know, sleep with them?  Should I get a shitty part time job in the mall again on top of my other job just to try and meet people?  That's how I met the girl who was sending me pics that I for some reason didn't go after.  My interests are music, sports, video games, exercise, nature, and writing.  I have no idea where to begin, all I know is that it's time, and that I'm probably going to eat shit trying to talk to people when I do.   Im hoping to move out of this shitty state soon to start over, but idk how feasible that's gonna be considering I need to get my first full time job.  Honestly, starting over somewhere else might be exactly what I need, cause it doesn't seem like there's much to do or many places to meet people where I'm currently at.  Probably cause I haven't tried hard enough.   It's like coming out of rehab while I'm still in the bitch.  This was more of a rant than anything.

1415,literallyaspoon,1584490342,1,"I know how weird this sounds but let me explain. Fair warning, this will be quite a long post since it covers about 2 years of my life.  


About 2 years ago I started to realize that i was lonely. I had a few buddies here and there, but just the kind of people who are sort of just acquaintances that I would talk to online and maybe play games with, and about two of them i would meet up with in real life. I didn't have any emotional connection to any of them. All of them basically just spoke to me if they had no one else to speak to, and that's how it's been all my life. I feel like I have never had a friend who really cares about me as a person, and I have started to realize that I'm not really part of anyone's main friend group, I'm always just the guy on the side that some people have heard of but no one really knows who they are. For quite a long time this didn't bother me at all. Hell i didn't even realize this was how most people saw me at first. I just told myself that this was what real friends were and that was that.

A few months of me telling myself they were all how friends were passed by, and this is when I started losing ""friends"". A person I had been speaking to every day for just over a year blocked me because of a stupid argument that he started on purpose. He had anger issues and this seemed to be one of his favourite things to do, along with blaming them on me afterwards, and blocking me for days on end just because why not. This had happened a few times before and I got sick of his shit, so when he unblocked me (not to try and be civil, he did this so he could spam me and make out that it was my fault) I just told him he was a shit friend and that I didn't want anything to do with him. This is where my decent into loneliness starts.

Since this guy had been my only form of socialization for about a year I obviously got pretty bored on my own, and it gave me way too much time to think. I started thinking that the reason I was lonely was due to my own error. Eventually more people I knew started drifting away, or blocking me for various reasons and I was slowly convincing myself it was all my fault, that I was just too boring, or too stupid, or too different from them.

Fast forward a few more months and I only have one person to talk to, and he is a person who just blows me off to go do shit with his other real friends with no explanation or apology. It didn't matter if he had said he would talk to me on a certain date or not, or if we were trying to arrange meeting up, it would always just end up being forgotten by him. I eventually decided I needed new friends desperately, because at this point I was so lonely I had forgotten who I was. I started changing my personality to match others so much that I had lost MY personality along the way. When I was on my own I had little to no emotion, and most of my thoughts were about either dying or making up scenarios in my head where I had real friends who cared about me. I ended up joining a discord server for a streamer i watch, where I met a few more people. Again, they were just people I could chat with but not connect with. I ended up telling my story so far to some of the people on the server and they all agreed that none of my friends were real friends, and they told me I should try to find some real ones. They didn't know how little I go outside or even talk to people in person when they said that. In fact at the time I am writing this I have not met a single non-family member in around a few months.

About 3 more months went by, bringing us up to present. I am currently a friendless nobody who is constantly paranoid that the people I talk to, including my family members, secretly hate me. I feel utterly disconnected from the world, and I hate my life. I honestly just feel fucking hollow now, like I'm just some wasted shell of a human that no one wants. This loneliness has been building up inside me for years, and at this point I have realized that i have never once had a real friend. I mainly think about how if i were to die, I wouldn't even mind. I don't want to kill myself or anything like that, but I honestly do think that if I were to just sort of die for no reason I would be perfectly okay with it. I also have no emotions other than anger or sadness, and I am so alone that I just want the earth to fucking explode. Then something I never thought would happen, happened.

One of the people in the server I had mentioned before had invited a friend of his. I thought ""oh okay another acquaintance to talk to for maybe half an hour at most and then never speak to again"". when I actually talked to her for the first time there were about 3 other people in the voice chat so I stayed quiet, but she seemed funny and I liked her more than most of the other people on the server. Eventually they all left and it was just me and her in the voice chat. We started talking and I found out she essentially is just a female me. She thinks the same way as me, she likes all the same music and whatever else that I do, and while we were talking I started remembering what I was actually like before I was crushed by this loneliness. we ended up speaking for hours, and when we finally stopped talking it was 9 O'clock in the morning. I went to bed kind of happy for once.

About a day or two passed and we ended up speaking again over DMs. I ended up telling her things about me I can't even tell my family. While we were talking she said some things that really stuck with me, and I actually felt like she was talking to me like a friend. She was telling me how good of a friend i was, and that I should stop putting myself down all the time. To her i wasn't just some guy no one cares about, not the local idiot everyone tells to shut up, but like I was an actual human being. I was crying while we were messaging each other, because I had never met someone as kind as her, who actually gave a single shit whether I lived or died. I was actually talking to a friend for the first time in my whole life, and I had never thought I would be so happy. I cried myself to sleep out of pure happiness, a kind of feeling I had not experienced since as long as I can remember. To be honest I hadn't felt any kind of emotion this strong before, it was like everything was finally going to be okay, after so many  years of being alone.

Then we come to today, as I am writing this. I woke up feeling happy with myself, which I had not done in years. I looked in the mirror and I was actually smiling! Not just faking it like normal! I spent hours trying not to start crying again just because of how happy I was to finally have a real, true friend. Then I started getting paranoid again. I started thinking ""What if she was just faking being my friend because she felt bad? What if she just turns out to be like all the others, who treated me like a ghost as soon as they got bored of me?"". I started crying again. Not out of happiness, or thankfulness that I met someone so honest and genuine, but because I had just started convincing myself that this was just some sick joke to show me that real friends would just make me hurt more than being alone for the rest of my life. I have been breaking the fuck down on and off all day, and I don't understand why. I was never this emotional before, I never wanted to just curl up into a ball and stop existing before either. I am so fucking terrified that this is going to turn out like i think it will. I don't know what is wrong with me but I feel so lonely that my chest hurts, it's like all the loneliness and pain I have felt for the past few years of my life has just built up into one massive breakdown.

I'm sorry for how long this post is (and how bad I am at writing), and if you bothered reading this far I am so grateful for that. I just needed to write this all down to let off some stress and clear my head. Any help or advice at all would be appreciated, thank you.",lonely,I have never had a real friend up until now and I somehow feel worse than i did before,2020-03-18 11:12:22

1417,Mystical-Prince,1584489306,1,"The era that we live in has a serious defect in the departments of real empathy, compassion, kindness, and humanity.

Numerous of people are withering away not getting out of their beds, houses, or just sitting in the corner of the couch in front of the TV, with a newspaper, crumbling from loneliness. Also people who work, hold top positions, have a bleeding heart of ice unsatisfied just because they don't know who they truly are anymore without all these exteriors of prestige.

It isn't about any expectations, or holding on to things. There is just no real effort of understanding one another. People are therefore quick to jump to negative assumptions and shun one another like products.

I've seen many cries around the world of people of all walks of life hurting from loneliness that isn't just limited to the mind.

Sometimes there is no click, no chemistry, or there are no mutual interests, or the wavelengths are too far apart but none of this should be a valid reason to dump people and make them feel bad. 

Interpersonal isolation is a very unspoken and underestimated challenge that is very deadly.

There are families that don't care about some of their members for not meeting the standards of honoring the community, governments that discriminate citizens for their income classes/societal status, so-called friends that stop communicating because you stop serving them emotional supplies.

I think the toughest hardship for mankind is one of our body's wiring of needing not just face to face socializing but more so having someone to actually reassure that you matter as the individual you are and shows a genuine interest in your life unbiasedly.

Just like the sunshine indiscriminately gives light to all, a small text, an occasional phone call, a spontaneous invite for a hangout, can do wonders for our health on a spiritual level too.

We all are trying to face our struggles in our own ways, living in a body we alone know of what we feel and go through deep within, we all want to be happy, why not just trying to let go of judgments and all sorts of self-serving conclusions.

1446,Draper31,1584459218,1,"These are some things that have helped me along the way in my journey, I thought maybe they could help some of you too.

It will mostly be advice geared toward a romantic nature.

When meeting a new potential love interest and things are going well, fight the urge to dump all your feelings on them at first. A new connection can fill you with so much joy you forget that it’s *still* new. Give it time eventually you’ll be able to let them know without fear of judgment.

Ever heard the saying don’t go grocery shopping when your hungry? Well, don’t message your *new* love interest when your lonely. Your mind is not in the right place, you’ll probably end up saying something you’ll regret. So just *don’t* do it. 

When you have new match on a dating app or a new person’s number. Don’t blow up their inbox. Give them time to reply. I know many of us are accustomed to being ignored and we think we’ve developed this sixth sense to know exactly when it’s happening but we *don’t* that new person you just met has a life filled with problems and struggles of their own, and things they need to handle daily. If it’s been *awhile* since their last reply, let them go. You don’t want someone who’s attention you have to beg for. You *deserve* so much better.

When the loneliness is too much. Take a deep breath or two or four. It will not *always* be like this. It’s important in these times also to remind yourself to take a step back when you’re feeling this way. We’re all our own worst critics, so remember to give yourself a break every now and then. You’ll be glad you did. 

I hope this can help a few of us that are struggling out there.

Not in the sense that all humans suck and there should be an uprising done by those on the fringes of society. I mean.. sometimes I feel severely fucked in life like he was.

Ok, maybe not to the same extent. I wasn’t chained to a radiator and given a concussion as a child. But I did get beaten in the head with a plate by mother was I was 13. I was stealing stuff back then, but I don’t think I should’ve been punished that severely. Maybe you guys disagree.

But then there was the time my dad hurled a chair at me for not bringing home all my books from school. I was 7.
Not to mention all the other beatings I got for getting low marks in middle and preschool. I’ve confronted my mother about this several times (my father has long since been dead) and she’s always claimed that I’m making things up, that I’m lying. And for a while I started to believe her. Did I make it all up, was a I really that crazy, was I trying to makes excuses for my actions, did I suffer from some form of psychosis. Then I recall things she would. day after my dad died when I was a teenager (a time when it wasn’t as easy for them to hit me like they used to) like, “If your daddy was alive he’d knock you on your ass.”

Nothing like a good old fashioned contradiction.

I don’t know. I’ve done a lot do dumb and fucked up shit in my life and I want to be better. But I have to acknowledge this. I don’t know if I can trust my memory so I’m getting an MRI done.

For the first time in more than a year I felt like I didn’t have to cut myself, like I had a reason not to die. 

That was a couple months ago and I can’t stop thinking about it, I havnt had a human connection in so long, I’m so distant and I have no friends. I pushed all of my old friends, online friends away and I have no one. I remember thinking at one stage I was completely alone, but I had a couple friends back then I didn’t even think of when I was in that state of mind. But now I am turkey lonely, I have no friends, I have no one to talk to, I have anger, frustration, sadness, and so much more building up and I know it’s not going to end well.

I don’t even have the balls to jump off a roof, it’s just a fall, a long fall that will only do good for you, yes it’s selfish but its something I need, I’ve been nice kind generous and no one has done any of that for me, so it’s time I be selfish and get rid of my own problems.",lonely,"I’ve tried so hard just to get back to where I was, and no one cares enough to say anything to me, help me, reach out to me when I’m literally crying for help.

It feels wrong to even try to talk to someone, like I'm not worthy of their attention. My childhood fucked up my self-esteem, confidence and ability to socialize. It's taking me forever to write this because my mind's such a mess and I have to organize my thoughts before letting them out, which often leads to me just keeping them in.

Played a few video games where the shelves are empty. Watched movies where the shelves are emptied. Odd to actually see it happening.

I feel so ill. So unwell. Crying turns into hysteria. 

All because of the loneliness. The lack of any type of meaningful relationship. The lack of people to turn to when you’re feeling alone. Not having a single text or call come through to your phone for months on end. Reaching out but never hearing back. Missing people who probably haven’t thought about you since the last time you saw each other. 

And then going through a break up on top of already dealing with excruciating loneliness. That person who you thought knew you and loved you the most, disappearing and never reaching out ever again. A stranger, just like that. 

I miss him so much I call him on a blocked number just to hear his voice. He never answers. I’m so desperate for any contact with him but he’s gone. He doesn’t care. 

Everyone leaves. Lost my job. My coworkers who I thought I could consider genuine friends? I haven’t heard from not ONE of them all these months. I always value people. Nobody does the same for me. I’m disposable and replaceable.

Most of them just feel like acquaintances that dont really give a shit about me, and the others who im more 'close' to say they will be there for me and that im important to them, then ignore me for days or even weeks for seemingly no reason, leaving me anxious that ive done something wrong.

They also never message me or hang out when its inconvenient for them in any way, yet somehow expect me to always change my schedule around them or respond to them quickly. And I hate that i still respond to them quickly  because i feel bad if i dont if i have the time to, or because i have no one else i can talk to/ i am just that lonely. 

I still cant bring myself to cut them out though, because i have no one else and i really struggle  to make new friends, and sometimes even though theyre really shitty to me, it can still be better than being totally alone. 

This one guy friend i have for example, he can be cool and fun sometimes, but i really hate how he does all these things and is insensitive, and it ruins our friendship for me, since i spend a lot more time just feeling like shit about him ignoring me than anything else.

1501,hamartiated,1584415684,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-03-17 14:28:04

1533,vegetarianbard,1584382468,1,"I see a lot of your posts and feel like most of you have a common problem. That feeling of isolation and of having no one in your life is just the worst. I mean I'm not much better off but I have become much better emotionally than I was before. I want to help all of you but really there's only so many people I can talk to. So I recommend that you all do a couple things that have helped me personally. 
1) Watch Taxi Driver and Fight Club. And I mean really watch them. Pay attention throughout the entire movie and take time to take it all in and try to understand what they are saying.
2) To overcome social anxiety I recommend you all try to talk to as many people as possible. If you're having trouble try mirroring where you repeat the last thing the person said in the form of a question. Or pick up the smallest movie detail about any movie or a movie they like. Or maybe their favorite song! The possibilities are endless.
3) If you're having trouble doing it in real life at least try it over the internet. Or here with anyone you like. I still can't talk to my crush without stammering but at least I'm able to speak full sentences. And I've seen this growth in myself and I love it. Believe me you all can do it too and will love it too.
4) It isn't necessary for you to have a lot of friends just a few who like and understand you no matter what and you like and understand them no matter what. If you don't have one, MAKE ONE! Not everyone is strong enough to exist alone in a sound emotional state.
5) If you're having emotional problems, I recommend you confront it. For eg those of you dealing with rejection should just rant to someone how they were wrong to do it, from the bottom of your hearts just once. That one time will clear the major boulder in your path to emotional contentness.
6) Do stuff! This loneliness isn't going to away itself. Nor is someone going to take it away. This is your problem. You HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT YOURSELF.
7) Realize that the world is a big place. You'll be much happier exploring it rather than isolating yourselves within a prison of your own making.
8) Remember overcoming loneliness and social anxiety is a emotional rollercoaster and a mountain ride. Like Sisyphus himself. But no matter what YOU CAN GET TO THE TOP. Not necessary that you'll make friends climbing that mountain. In fact you're not doing it to make freinds at all. YOU'RE DOING IT FOR YOU AND NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE.  

PS: I hope y'all have a great day!

I feel like there's a couple of things more I should add:

9) ALWAYS speak the Truth no matter what. Lying is just plain wrong. Even the ancients realized that. And it's so much work too. When you have to repeat it and then add details to make it sound more realistic. Forgot to do something for someone JUST SAY THE TRUTH AND APOLOGIZE! Lying is too complicated anyway. Didn't think that someone's performance was good enough? Let them know but in a kindly worded and positive way like ""what you could do instead is..."". Honestly really is the best policy!

10) Don't be a people pleaser. Just don't. Didn't like the new song by that famous singer? Just say it. Can't afford new shoes to look cool just don't think about them. Wore the sweater your Grandma made you to school HELL YEAH YOU DID! Don't have the time to meet someone just say it!

He wasn't particularly good at anything and what I saw was a resource, I could teach him some stuff, guide him and we both would make great stuff. I did learn quite a lot and as it turns out he mostly faked it all through cause to this day his progress has been pretty much nothing in addition to him being overly distracted now. I'm not expecting anything much from him in regards to this but in general yeah I hope we remain friends now that our communication is limited ( quite a lot over the past few days ).

So I'm just trying to find someone who would actually be interested in making a change cause I've realized this very well that in order to do great things, your company should be what inspires you, mine doesn't and I clearly don't have any other options since basically there is no one else out there my age who is interested in the same stuff as I am.

I'm still in high school and I'm a tech guy. I've built an AI startup but I'd rather not provide any more information that could sabotage my anonymity.

Either way, that friend of mine is pretty much involved in stuff that won't have any impact on his future and I'm a little concerned cause, in particular, he's the only one of my friends who had some potential but he's just sitting out there doing nothing. We have our college applications coming up later this year, he doesn't have much achievements ( close to none ), he doesn't have the big spike and even though he aspires high, he's not working for it. I used to try to give him the sense of reality so that we could be out of the place we are in for the better and not live in mediocrity, he's just not motivated.

In all, it sucks to have no like-minded person out there to talk to as a friend. Yes I do have friends but in reality, I feel lonely. I simply am not able to talk about stuff I like, it's weird in all and it's even pretty evident. They talk to me the least, I'm usually missing out on what they talk about not that it matters but the point is in actuality within myself I feel lonely since there is no one to talk to in times of distress or simply when I need company to work on interesting stuff, it does feel good at times being alone but too long and it becomes turns into lonely. So yeah I'm mostly just involved in my software projects, watching Tech Youtuber vlogs, doing competitive programming and so forth.

It really made me wonder what it would be like if everyone could be like him; if there are people out there who actually care about us so passionately and unconditionally, without expecting something in return.

It’s sad to think about it, but the thought of someone giving a shit about me through a television screen really brightened up my day, especially in these trying times.

1561,deebob24,1584346618,1,"Hello everyone, 

Long time lurker but I'm on the same boat as most of you guys. As the Corona crisis is spreading with more and more measures taking action, I guess it will happen to a lot of us that we'll have to stay at home for quite a while to do Home office or quarantine. This means even occasionally social interaction will decline. This might be very difficult to handle for some people. I think most of you know, that long term social isolation can perturbate depression and generally causes negative emotions.  I'd like to discuss and collect things to endure this. I'm very far from being an expert and all I post here is just stuff that I read somewhere and thought of so input and advise is highly welcome. 

Things I came up with:

&amp;#x200B;

* Keep a routine. Keeping a sleep/work/exercise schedule gives your life structure and prevents you from just strolling into the day.
* Do something. Don't just sit around and watch Netflix all-day without any plan. Set small solvable task and then do them.
* Don't do drugs alone. Especially when you're already feeling bad don't increase your level of suffering.
* Stay in touch with other people if possible. I know, it sounds stupid to put that here but even a phone call to your mom or another relative might help you. 
* Move your body. Even small exercise just with your body makes you feel better. Don't just sit around. Do a small walk around outside (if possible) or exercise in your flat. Maybe the 30-day push-up challenge is something for you.

I hope we can collect some more ideas/tips/strategies. I plan to update this post to include more tips from the comments. Stay strong fellow loners.",lonely,What to do while staying at home during the Corona outbreak,2020-03-16 19:16:58

For most of my life I was lonely, with my mom working odd shifts and my father never around, i took quite a liking to being by myself, and due to i shyness and social anxiety, just never really pursued any hobbies that would put me in the spotlight or require people to acknowledge me.
Moving out, i thought it would force me out of my shell, but my life has taken a step backwards. From having acquaintances (drinking buddies, work colleagues) I find myself today in a major city without a single friend. None. The last time I hung out with somebody from Uni, was in October and the whole time all I could think off was going home so I could be to myself. It’s hard for me to find motivation to even go downtown for any activity, be it shop clothes, watch a movie or study, let alone meet, conversate and relate to other people. 
I don’t like being alone, however I hate being around others.

At age 20 I really feel like I’ve thrown my life away. I hate the person I am, however I seem unable to change and when I try, I fall back to the same habits that got me in this position in the first place.

Recently, I noticed an increased sense of lonliness and I discovered I was also touch starved. To be clear, I have meaningful friendships and I am quite an active person however, this doesn't seem to cut it. I don't feel like I am anyone's first choice or very important to someone. I don't feel cared for and I haven't felt human touch in years. A few years ago, I come out of a relationship with a woman I loved so damn and when it ended, I was crushed. I decided to focus on myself and I did but, I later noticed how I shut off all feelings (and switched to being extremely rational all the time) and built walls around myself. Yes, I was hurting and perhaps what I'm feeling right now is my fault but, it is what it is. My humanity did catch up with me though and, I am now feeling lonely, uncared for and touch starved. It's taking a serious tall on me; my motivation has decreased substantially to the point I barely find point anymore in what I do in my life but, I still do them. I also feel myself becoming bitter and distant. I know I'm surrounded by people who love me but, they never show it. To top it all, I didn't make any success (and neither believe I will) in the love department. It's been 4 years now since my last relationship.

I can't go to the gym (just getting back on the road to fitness), I can't go to the bars, can't go to the restaurants, basically it's total isolation the next two weeks. 

And it's terrifying me. I'm a deeply, deeply social person. I go to a bar or cigar lounge pretty much every single night to talk to strangers just so I'm not a burden on my friends (most of whom are pretty introverted).  I'm pretty good at it, I usually can find someone to chat with for a few hours every night. I socialize at the gym every day, I hang out with my buddies at BJJ.

And even with that I'm horrifyingly lonely. My constant socializing barely keeps the crippling abyss of loneliness at bay. I don't have a single hobby that I do solo (hate tv and movies because they make me restless, I can videogame but only enjoy it if I limit it to a few hours a week) and I've tried so many.

1613,GrumbleGrits,1584307163,1,"As far back as i can remember i was always the one to sit away from everyone else. Having been an introvert and a loner i had always willingly excluded my self from everything. I barely had any friends, never participated in any clubs or extracurricular activities. I just stuck to my self and kept quiet, atleast when i wasn't busy making a fool of my self as a class clown.

All throughout school i had never held much interest in getting any sort of romantic relationship, up until the end of my senior year. I didn't know any one, didn't know who was single or who was taken. So i eventually asked a girl i was vaguely familiar with on the bus to construct me a list of all the singles. She took her sweet time making that list, and some how through a series of events i can't remember thanks to a healthy dose of depression ruining my memory i ended up dating that very same girl. 

She was sweet, it was nice having some one and i quickly grew accustomed to all the PDA and other such things that came with a relationship. Skip forward a year though and things had gone stale.. we never had anything to talk about, she wanted to have phone sex every songle night, and doing such activities had become a chore for me. Any time she came over the first thing on her mind was sex, and it didn't take too much longer for me to brgin thinking thay was all she wanted me for.

On one fateful night my depression got the better of me. I got in my own head, began freaking out.. ended up spontaneously breaking up with her. It could have gone better, but it was probably best for me as i feel she wouldn't have been a good partner in the long run.

Anywhoozy, skip forward through another 2 years of being single again and here i am.. an awkward, introverted, depressed 21 year old male that's stuck at home in the middle of no where with no where to go, no one to talk to, nothing to do. I've got no friends, my parents are never around(not that i even like them), and depression has utterly fucking ruined me.

I'm not lonely in the sense of not having friends or family that care, that's why I'm not sure if this subreddit applies to me. But I do feel lonely, it's a long story and knowing me I'll use a lot of unnecessary detail so I'm sorry.

I've always felt sad, apparently I even wanted to drown myself when I was like 7, I still wouldn't say I'm depressed tho because I have a lot of good moments. But I think about 2 years ago I fell for this girl, I'm gonna be calling her deodorant as I don't wanna use an actual name. I literally became obsessed with her. I ended up becoming friends with her and eventually my other friends pushed me to tell her how I felt. She didn't feel the same way, about a year goes by and I steel have the same feelings for her and I end up finding out she did like me back but she lied because she was scared she would hurt me, this ended up making me very sad and confused for a while and another year later I met this other girl online, fell in love and we became a thing. Even though she lived in a different country and we'd never met in person everything seemed perfect, but sometimes I'd get these feelings for doedorant coming back as I'm still friends with her and I'm not one to let go of people i care about. My gf ends up breaking up with me and since I knew my best friend was on a date and I didn't wanna ruin it for him I turned to deodorant and she has really helped me get through everything including several anxiety attacks extremely well, sadly this also rekindled my feelings for her and it consumed me as I didn't know what to do because I didn't wanna ruin our friendship, after keeping it in for a while I told her and got the answer I expected. now I just feel like I can't or maybe even don't deserve to be loved.

This is the problem. I am always worried that I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve, and that nobody cares as much about me as I do them. It's not just with our relationship, either. With all of my close friends at school, I can't truly believe they like me all that much, and that if I ever ask to hang out or, hell, even text them first, they'll think something like ""ugh, this girl again?! Why can't she take the hint that I don't want to hang out?""

Looking at reality, I can see this is mostly all illogical (I struggle with both anxiety and social anxiety). Each time my good friend from middle school and I hang out, she's mentioned getting together again and how much she loved seeing me. A person I'm really fond of from school came up to me last Monday, gave me a ring she bought for me, and told me she was one of my best friends. Another friend from school told me last night at a get-together for a school club that I was one of my favorite people. And yet there's no one person or group from school I can comfortably call my own - no one I could consider a best friend, where being together on weekends and holidays is a given.

It all feels so good and so genuine when I'm around these people at school. They pay attention to me, we've got inside jokes, and we laugh together all the time. It's also really easy because we all know one another and are comfortable with one another. But when the weekend or a holiday break comes around, I find myself feeling alone. I'm scared to initiate any plans because I'm so afraid that it'll make our friendship awkward or that I'll seem way too eager while they've all got their own friends. I've been invited to things in the past with them, but it's always in group scenarios. I've also asked the friend who gave me the ring if she'd like to hang out twice in the past, and once she was sick and the other she'd already made plans (I did, however, ask on a Thursday so that was probably my bad) and she never said anything like ""let's reschedule for this date."" This particular friend and I talk about hanging out a lot, but it just feels like there's a barrier I can't get past, when all I really crave are close, comfortable friendships with these people.

I'm a 25, almost 26 year old guy and I have never been in a relationship. I live by myself and my life consists of work, school and the gym. I'm currently in nursing school with lots of girls, I do like one of them and have liked her ever since I laid my eyes on her (she is single as well).

I would do anything to be with her but I'm not really sure what is stopping me from asking her out; is it fear of rejection, me being not ready for a relationship; the awkwardness of her saying no and then having to be around each other for one more year.

1677,TheAmazingWebSlinger,1584245579,1,"There is a lot going on in my life right now and I feel like I am spiraling.

Firstly, everyone in my friend group are international students at my college but two of them. They all leave in May. One of my American friends is probably moving away in May with one of the internationals because that's his boyfriend and he wants to move out of America as it is. The other American is someone I talk to but I can't see myself getting super close to. So, when they leave in May, I'm kind of fucked when it comes to friends.

Secondly, I'm 25 (turning 26 in June) and I have never had a significant other, let alone been on a date or even asked on a date. That hurts. A lot. I meet these amazing people from overseas and I adore them all but they all have found significant others within the few months they've been here (some are staying from August to May, others already left in December but had somebody here they had to leave behind). I have done it all: stopped looking, actively looked, put myself out there, actually hit on people which is huge for me, stopped looking some more, tried online, and now I'm in the stopped looking stage again. Everytime I asked how they met, it was either through online or just on campus. What the fuck? That makes me question my own likeability and attractiveness since I've never been asked out on a date but they manage to snag someone? Great.

Thirdly, all but one of my friends talks to me everyday and checks in on me and wants to actually hang out. The others are too caught up in their romance or are supposedly ""too busy"". That one friend does have a boyfriend but he is super sweet and actively shows he cares about me and wants to spend time with me. He leaves in May and the closer that time gets, the more distressed I become. Ever since I cut off my ex-best friend years ago from being too toxic, I never thought I'd find someone I could call, at least, a close friend. Not sure I will ever claim to have a ""best"" friend again but this guy comes pretty damn close. It kills me a little that I'm gonna lose this close contact in a couple months. Sure, we can still talk, but obviously it won't even be close to being the same.

Fourthly, I feel like such a creepy loser because my little nephew's friends (who range from 13 to 15) have somewhat became my friends. Or, I see them as such. I play Fortnite with my little nephew (I'm not ashamed lol) and he often invites his friends to play so we all talk on the headset and play together. I have come to care for these kids like I do my own nephew and consider them friends. It makes me feel really lame and almost creepy because is it weird for an adult to be friends with kids? I don't know. I don't even play with my nephew's friends unless he is online with us because I feel so weird about it.

Fifthly, I am turning 26. I mentioned this before. I am feeling... not old. I know I'm young. But, I see all these amazing couples around me. Hell, even my parents worked it out and got back together! And here I am. Not even having been on a date before. It fucking hurts. Badly. I want to fall in-love. I don't even really care about the sex or anything. I just want to be... comfortable and content with another person in my space. I want to begin starting a life with someone. Yes, I am young. But I also don't want to keep waiting around for my lifelong partner. But... here I am... waiting... like I always have been. It really is getting harder to keep faking smiles and happiness for my friends. Which sounds shitty. I am happy for them, seriously. But going out with the group of them and being the only single one? Damn, that's another level of pain I'm barely able to handle.

This is long. I have a tendency to write a novel when I'm in my feelings. I can keep going too, oops. But I'll stop here.

TL;DR: Damn near everyone in my friend group are international students so I'll be having to say goodbye soon. I am the only single one which hurts like hell. Only one friend really reaches out to me and isn't completely caught up in his significant other. I feel like my little nephew's teenage friends are my friends which makes me feel weird/borderline creepy. And, I'm turning 26, never dated, and I'm fucking lonely as all hell.",lonely,Reality is setting in,2020-03-15 15:12:59

1679,laConeja19,1584245112,1,"For context, I graduated college in another state and moved to Central US shortly after for personal reasons. I don’t have family here and I have always been in the east coast. I’m a first generation college student who has been diagnosed with mild depression with therapist, bipolar with psychiatrist (although I don’t think I really am and stopped meds after a few months. Ik that’s bad). I am in a relationship and have been for about 3.5 years now. I am finishing up my second bachelor degree currently. 

I’m a self-destructive person and “loyal” friend. I make friends and get closer to one person or a few people and I just blindly follow them. 
Example: In my sorority, my friend I was closer with didn’t like a certain group of girls and I stopped talking to them and even started being mean 😔


What I mean by self-destructive is I just lose touch with my friends by thinking the worst. When I took AP psych in high school, my teacher mentioned the theory that there is one person on a friend group that doesn’t really belong. They’re there because the rest of the group needs someone to laugh at (pretty pessimistic of him I know). 
Wellll, I kept this in the back of my head and actually isolated myself from my best friends from 9th-11th grade. Same thing, I ended up being mean to them because of my new best friend (who I also had issues with but that’s for another day). 

Now that I am an adult with horrible social skills, my “friends” are coworkers.   Earlier this year I left my main job—albeit not by choice—because my school schedule interfered with work. I don’t really talk to them much and my other job is a mobile job where I get a different crew each shift so I only really interact with them when I am scheduled. 

There are a few people at this job that I do interact with outside of work and occasionally hang out with. 

Lately, I’m sure due to all the chaos of COVID-19, I have wanted to hang out with more people. 
Some “friends” are participating in spring break on the coast and some just are busy. 
My partner enjoys the racing and car scene so they are pretty much always hanging out with other people who share the same interest. 
I get angry though. I don’t want them to not enjoy their interests but I feel...unwanted because I rarely see my partner like today where I had a 12 hour shift. I expected to see them afterwards but to no avail. 

I don’t mean to get angry that they go out almost every night. My partner doesn’t want to bother me since I’m in school and usually I am studying. And I understand but, I’m on my spring break and classes have switched to online...

I’ve tried to enjoy the scene with them but I am not a fan of reckless driving (I am guilty of speeding and such but not to this degree). And yes I have communicated this to them but again, I don’t want them to give up their interest. 

Sorry for the long post and thank you if you read it all.

I was in boarding school since 6th grade all the way till I graduated highschool. All girls boarding school. I’ve not always had that many friends but when I do make friends we get really close. I’ve always wanted to have many friends but that’s never the case. And I just don’t understand why. When I ask some people, they say I look mean or unapproachable. Others say I have a crazy personality. Look, I am not rowdy or anything but I can be outspoken and my demeanour can come off as hmm I don’t even know the right word, kinda like I’m out there. I have major insecurity and self esteem issues. And no, don’t get me wrong, this is not to even blow my own horn but I’ve always been book smart, pretty attractive and multi talented. However, I tend not to fit anywhere. I can’t fit in with the popular people, they think I’m not cool enough and I can’t fit in with the chill crowd they think I’m too all over the place. Deep down I am a really nice person and all I want is to make friends. I’ve definitely had my fair share of “boys” but now I am completely single. Recently went through a breakup, about like 6 months ago. However ever since then, I haven’t had anyone to talk to. Literally. My phone’s been dry af! I work from home so I don’t go out much. I have a few friends but their lives are too busy now and I can’t keep hitting them up. I just don’t know what to do with myself or my life. I don’t want to feel insecure anymore. I don’t like when people judge me before getting to know me. I now have social anxiety. Even when I going to meetup with someone, I drink before I go there to curb my anxiety but I end up not being myself the entire time and for the most part things end up not working. It’s frustrating. When I do have school I always leave class as the first person and tend not to talk to people because the few times I’ve had, nothing really came out of it. No one really followed up and I felt like I was trying too much. I just need a normal social life not to feel so left out.

First of all, they found new people to hanging out with and secondly they didn't approve my boyfriend. They became so judgemental by the fact that I decided living with him. Slowly, I broke away from them. For a while, it was feeling good. When I didn't spending time with my bf, I really enjoyed being all by myself.

So about 5 months ago i got out a relationship with my ex. He was emotionally abusive and very manipulative. I don't really hate him because I know he had other mental issues so I just kind of forgave him. But ever since we broke up I've just felt so alone. I have no desire to get back together with him. But I've been on dating apps and I've been trying to find other guys to fill this void. I don't know how to explain it but I just feel like I need to have a boyfriend. But its seems like every guy I date just either wants sex, they lie to me about what they want, they turn out to be crazy, or were just not compatible. After this last date I went on a few days ago turned out to be a fucking nut I deleted my apps. Being I don't want to deal with that anymore. But I have this urge to redownload them.

Aside from the occasional bad attempt at small talk with coworkers I have no social connections whatsoever. The only people I'm close with are my parents. Due to the current pandemic I feel that there is a decent chance that my country will shut down everything except supermarkets and drugstores, so it would mean that I'd be basically bound to a self-imposed quarantine if my workplace got shut down as well. Even if not, I'd at least have to stay inside during the weekends. 

I don't like my job, but sitting at home all the time with nothing to do would feel horrible. At least at work I'm surrounded by people, while my apartment feels so utterly devoid of anything joyful. There is this constant silence in here that drives me utterly crazy. I don't just mean literal silence, even when I'm listening to music or doing things around the apartment it still is present to me.

If my workplace really was to be shutdown, I would want nothing more but go to my parents and stay with them until the whole thing blows over, but I really don't wanna be the asshole that unnecessarily spreads the virus even further. I'm concerned for my parents' health in particular too. I don't think it's an option to go visit them currently.

And yeah I know, video calls are an option, but it's not nearly the same. I really miss the physical presence of another person.

I deal with a lot of depression, anxiety, and paranoia from past and recent trauma. I've always felt alone growing up due to a learning disability and had helicopter parents that made it very difficult to socialize and be an individual. I've done and continue to do my best to compensate for these in an attempt to be normal. 

Life picked up a little when I left for college. I started making friends and meeting people. I even found a girl. I was in a toxic relationship with her for 3 years, had a bad break up, and failed myself for another 3 years by isolating myself. I buried myself in my old job (which was taking advantage of me and my former coworkers), became an alcoholic, and stopped talking to everyone who could have supported me. 

Thankfully things have gotten a bit better within the last year. I quit my job for one that appreciates me more and moved to a lively city. I reconnected with some old friends and attempt to make new ones occasionally. And I don't drink as much anymore. Life is many orders of magnitude better than it was for those three years alone but I'm still lonely. 

There is someone I'm currently interested in. We started at our job on the same day. We've known each other for almost a year and have gotten close with each other. We hang out, talk almost everyday, and occasionally go on dates but we don't but have avoided calling it dating. I've expressed interest because I want to more to her but she doesn't feel the same. She's also gotten out of a long term relationship more recently than I have. I understand her and how she's just doesn't think it's a good idea but I've grown too attached.

1720,grayhighlander,1584219194,1,"Before August 2019, loneliness wasn't something I felt on the level I am now able to feel. I've never had anyone genuinely close to me who cared and what not, so not being emotionally close to others felt normal, easy, something that didn't necessarily need to change because I was so used to it. Then I got into a relationship, and when it ended 2 days before New Year's, I could for the first time feel the emptiness where such a connection should be. 

I met someone at the end of November/beginning of December and we clicked so nicely (as friends). I didn't realise that I got attached and formed romantic feelings until they entered a relationship recently. And although I am very happy for them, I can't help but feel excluded and in a way distanced from them. I understand that they have so much going on in their life and plus the honeymoon phase of the relationship must be kicking and what not, but I wish I could be closer to them. I wish we could build a deeper bond, instead of sort of growing apart. :( I wish I could tell them what's going on in my mind, and that they'd tell me the same. I also met their best friend and we also nicely clicked (again, as friends). But they both have so much on their plates already, I'd feel like a burden if I were to talk about my own problems. Even though we have established that we want to build a deeper bond. 

But bro, I just so miss the former dude. And today he told me he will be taking a break from social media, and will get on discord only sometimes. So now we're getting even more distanced. :( Idk man, I just kinda wish I could tell them how I feel about them, but it's pointless. They have a great mindset about relationships and the girl they entered a relationship with is so sweet and kind, I'm sure they will last. Not to mention I'm not ready for a relationship at the moment, and probably won't be in a while. So ig I just gotta move on and what not.

I feel like I'm again alone and without anyone who gives priority to my feelings and thoughts. I'm not close to my irl friends, the dude is kinda gone, his friend's got a lot on his plate and is quite depressed, some other people I'm just not close enough with, and I feel like I've got no energy to form other relationships or close bonds. Sucks mayn. 

And my mental health has taken a toll again. For a moment there I felt like I no longer had depression, but now I'm feeling like it's getting back and it sucks so much. I'm getting sick and it just might be corona, so who knows mayn, perhaps I die.",lonely,Sed lyf,2020-03-15 07:53:14

I never went out, went to any events, and rarely made myself available to meet people. I had one pretty consistent friend group but I was often not happy with them and only hung with them cause there wasn’t really anybody else there for me. I had fun times with them, laughed a lot, but there was still something rotten in me when I was with them and it felt like something was always missing. I had a few individual friends outside of them too but I never felt connected, like in it you know like the college experience seems like it’s supposed to be. On the other hand it seems to me that that idea might be fake, and that all those people are kind of figuring shit out and putting it together in the same way I am but it still hurts. I talked to a friend a few days ago who was talking about how sad it was that her art shows were cancelled and some of the school parties and events weren’t gonna happen and I was upset I didn’t have that same connection. In a way, it feels like I won though, I won’t deny that. All of the things that other people seemed to have over these years are gone, the things that’s stressed me, I get to go out without literally missing out on anything, everyone level with me.

Over the course of the relationship I've had with my boyfriend, let's call him Daniel, my friends kept trying to find ways for me to break up with him because they didn't think he was a good guy for me and didn't trust his intentions. Daniel knew about this because I told him about it and also because one of my friends, let's call him Alex, reached out to Daniel to tell him to never speak to him again. Alex and my other friends kept trying to coax me out of the relationship to the point where my friends took my phone one night while I was drunk just to block Daniel from all social media so that I would not interact with him anymore.

That got Daniel really upset, and he broke up with me a few days later after that because he didn't like that other people kept trying to do something to our relationship while we were together. I tried to convince him to stay and that we could work through this together, but he just didn't budge. An hour after he broke up with me, he called me to say that he found a solution on how we could approach this situation together, which was going to a counselling session. I agreed to do this, but I haven't heard from him about it since the phone call. At the same time, I just found out that all my friends blocked me, and Alex was the only friend willing to discuss why they all blocked me and it was because I was still talking to Daniel. So at this point, Daniel broke up with me on Saturday, and the next time I would see him would be in our shared class together on Tuesday, and I thought I could speak to him then after class to discuss a potential meeting time with the counsellor, but he never showed up to class. I broke right then and there in the middle of class when I realized he wasn't coming, and left while the teacher was in the middle of teaching to go straight to the counsellor's office at my school so I could have a safe place to cry. I decided to try to take my mind off of things that night and go to one of the many libraries our school has, and on my way to the entrance, I see Daniel studying with his friends through the window. I immediately started crying but I wanted answers to see if he was going to still consider going to the counsellor with me, so I worked up some courage and approached him. I asked him about the counselling session and he said he already went by himself the day before and he told me what they said. In my head, I was wondering why he didn't tell me he went there or why he didn't ask me to come with him, but I just didn't say anything. I told him I blocked my friends back and he said, ""that's good,"" and that was the end of our last conversation.

The thing is, I'm not as sad about the friends blocking me part as I am about the break up. I'm mostly sad about the fact that he said that we would work through this together, and then actually not end up doing that. . I don't have anyone to turn to or talk to about anything, and when I do, it just feels forced. Also recently, our school cancelled in-person instruction indefinitely until further notice because of the coronavirus and everyone was sad that they wouldn't be able to spend time with their friends anymore, and everyone has been posting their memories of their year, and I just can't relate because all the good friends that I've made in this past year have all blocked me or I blocked them. It's to the point where I just don't have any close friends and I can't confide in anyone about anything and it's just such a lonely feeling. I feel like here's no one there for me and all I feel when I breathe is sadness and I always feel like I'm about to cry. I just don't know what to do to cope with this empty feeling inside of me and this heaviness in my heart. I can't focus on anything without just thinking about how lonely I am and I just want it to end.

1750,GeneralWalters421,1584202207,1,"I’ve been really depressed and lonely and I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts. I’ve been lonely for a long time after my parents divorced in middle school and moved me across the globe multiple times. Here in university things seemed to be finally changing but that soon feel apart. University just closed thanks to the virus so now I have nothing to keep me busy and nobody to talk to, even just dumb small talk. My Mum lives in the other side of the world while I live with my Dad who doesn’t care and literally just gets angry with me when I try to talk to him about these things. I have seen counselling but they never seemed to be helpful, I’m just told dumb things like make friends by joining clubs. It’s not that I don’t know how to make friends, I’m just autistic and struggle maintaining relationships, plus I’m depressed. I don’t even know if I want a friend, they seem so overrated at this point. It’s so much work to build... But I hate constantly being told to “reach out and talk to somebody” when I have nobody to talk to... This whole mental health supporting movement is such bs.

I only have one friend, who I made here in uni recently, but shes pretty fed up with me after I fell in a downward spiral of depression and sort of dumped a lot of it on her. I feel bad, I just really had nobody else and I was confused. Shes also going to be leaving to her home after the uni closes. I don’t know what to do anymore, thanks to coronavirus counselling is going to be difficult to continue and everyone I’ve tried just doesn’t seem to help. I’m not in an immediate crisis but I’m struggling to find the will to live at this point, and I literally don’t know what to do, nobody in my life seems to even care. I don’t know how being told the “brutal truth”, about how things suck and you just have to get through it on your own, is supposed to help me, like a lot of people seem to say. I don’t have the will to, I don’t see the point. I know I can’t use friends as an emotional dumping ground but I don’t know what else to do, I just can’t keep going through everything alone.",lonely,I fear being trapped all alone thanks to the coronavirus after university closed and I now have nobody to talk to.

1751,wintermoonstun,1584202012,1,"Everything I knew only 2 months ago was a lie. I look at this time and I see nothing different in how I live at home than now. Isn’t that strange? I spend almost every day doing exactly what I did 7 months ago. Yet, at one point I had way more friends to talk to. So did I have friends in the first place? I have no way of knowing if I ever had friends when I lock myself in a room of darkness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say this as if I never had friends. I did, or at least I was lead to believe I did. My closest friend speaks to me so sporadically. It feels so inconsistent as well. One month we can spend time talking to each other having a good time. The next radio silence wondering where he went.  I have even spent time with him for a weekend every month or so. that's it other than random texts which we don't have anymore. he moved on with his life and for me to sit here and complain about him moving on is not fair. He has a girlfriend and a bunch of new friends. I wish I could have been involved but I'm not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had asked many of my friends to hang out with me too. this is super enjoyable for me. Spending time with my friends and getting to have outside my room experience. the thing is these people who I called my friends never want to.  they even have said they will never hang out with me. When one of them said that I didn't know what to think about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never had many friends but for the ones I have made recently, they are very kind. I just don't view them like I did my former friends. the old skype calls where we dicked around and just had a fun time. these new people weren't the same as me. they were nice but I felt a sense that they only talked to me because of some other reason. Reasons like I was alone and looked like I needed friends. This person did grow to become someone I consider a friend, however. the person who first reached out to me got me to talk to someone else who was extremely interesting to talk to. I just wish I had friends like that who would talk to me all the time. these people don't talk to me regularly but I will forever appreciate them.

&amp;#x200B;

I have one final friend who I still can get a hold of. When I say get a hold of I mean once every week or so. he shelters himself as well. He is the last person I would consider my friend. We used to have the old school skype calls and all that. it's just now so many people I used to talk to are gone and he is always away. This makes it so 90 percent of the time I am just sitting in my room alone. I used to not care because I knew that one day I would have somebody online to talk to but now I know the truth.

My “best friend” is somehow super chill with just being alone and doesn’t really want to talk. I always have to instigate convos with others and I don’t have any female friends who I feel I could just randomly talk too without it feeling forced.

At least when I was in school I could just chat-up people randomly and feel like I have friends.

Lastly, I’m not getting any better in terms of physical shape, my progress for going to the gym has halted due to quarantine (yes I know I can workout with weights and run outside) but one of my main motivation for gym (aside from personal health) was the dumb thought that it would lead to girls actually giving a damn bout me.

meanwhile for the past 2 years or so i feel that whenever i get into a situation that allows me to make other friends (im in college rn), i just get let down by them somehow. idk if u guys can relate with me but all the disappointments in the earlier stages of my life (of being abandoned by friends) left me with some implicit high expectations? either that or we just drift away \~ 

oh and my counsellor says just go out there and make non-sh\*tty friends + new close friends. well i wish it was that easy, i spend most of my time on school work, and the rest of the time on staying fit and maybe like one day out of the week with my boyfriend. i joined activities in the past but i couldnt really cope with the intensity of my school work :( 

subpoint: oh and ironically, when people say joining a gym makes you feel less lonely, i beg to differ lol. my experience of joining a gym with regular crowds in the past was just me going in there to workout and out , but i never got invited to do anything with them. i also didnt want to voice out and self invite by barging into their convo because it felt out of place. can anyone relate on this? 

i know u guys think that ohhh she has a boyfriend so its not too bad right? well he thinks that im being clingy because i dont spend as much time with my other friends (aka that singular friend group) and he wants me to make more new close friends. i also wish that i have other people to talk to , but i don't, i keep getting abandoned :(  

ive stopped going to my main social media account (with tons of followers) because it hurts seeing acquaintances hangout with one another. im also kinda wary to hangout with acquaintances from my socials because of 'hidden agendas'.

Mr.goof I guess decided to go and rat me out too Mr.H to which he decided to try and call me on Facebook to which I didn't answer I had seen he messaged me and told me to pretty much leave the guy alone 

Christ I had even told Mr.H about how this dude tried to fondle and grab up on my dick Christ this Mr.Goof dude was so high the one time he had actually threatened to kill me with a shotgun he still has it too.

But nope Mr.H didn't care he just read the messages and didn't have shit to say I basically called him out on his bullshit of how he was never around when I really needed him or about how i never got invited out for anything or how he could never remember my brithday but i could remember his and basically told him that in his eyes too him I'm a fucking joke 

I just said fuck it and decided to block Mr.H on Facebook I was really cool with this guy and his sons but after living with Mr.Goof and trying to tell Mr.H about his fuckery it's almost like just talking to a brick wall in fucking done.

1793,throw2748,1584161963,1,"Hi :)   
I've been stuck being lonely for about 2 years now and am trying to get out of it by improving my social skills, reducing my social anxiety, and reducing how much I beat myself up about not talking right.  


Situation: I have never been a people person, I've grown up without a lot of socialization and have stayed indoors for most of my childhood. I used to go to a school for around 9 years, and while there developed some friends, although we would never hang out after school. Ever since I moved schools I haven't had any friends and shut myself off from everyone. And up until my 10th grade year, I've been fine with it and never had a real desire to socialize. But now, I experience *depression and suicidal thoughts* caused by, what I believe to be a lack of socialization. I've often heard that adult life can be very lonely, so I want to end this ASAP before I do anything stupid.   
Note: I'm not ugly or overweight mostly thanks to a love of biking and good genes. Although this shouldn't affect how people socialize with me, just wanted to give a clear picture of myself.

I honestly don't know who else to turn to and am tired of trying to fix myself.

**Alright, enough of the pity party.** 

**My Q: How do I overcome my social anxiety and improve my social skills without affecting my reputation at school. (I don't like to be looked down upon or bullied.)**

I dropped out of college at 17 and I already didn't have friends in college. I was studying IT because I failed some of my exams and wasn't motivated to do the course and the people in my class had nothing in common with me. I'd occasionally eat lunch with my friends from highschool but I barely talked, I was just there. I later dropped out.

After dropping out I started to pursue my dreams of being a stuntman and starting a business while running a youtube that was growing rapidly. I decided to put all of my focus and energy into these things along with a few other projects. It got lonely, I saw success as a lonely road and was willing to drive down that road. I'd go rockclimbing in the morning, come home work, edit, go to gymnastics in the evening and then come home and continue to work. No notifications, No messages from anyone I could get food with or walk around town with, just a bedroom. 

I started to become stressed so I tried to find friends online. I fell into the wrong group, became lazy and unmotivated, lost money and now I'm just starting again. 

I've decided I'm going to stay alone. Not many people have the same interests as me, most people my age already have a friend group and looking back I've realized there weren't that many people I really connected with in highschool even though I spoke to a lot of people. 

I don't know why I made this thread. Maybe I should make a podcast like bill burr and ramble into my mic instead of posting here.

I have a best friend and I love her to death, obviously we've been talking about this a lot.

The real problem here though is not that I'm emotionally deprived and constantly feeling kinda anxious and vulnerable but even more so that I think it might be pushing her away.

Understand though that it could be a lot worse......and for some of us it unfortunately is......I'll explain as we go along. Firstly let me offer you some hope.
       You should be aware and confident that this difficult time will pass.....in all likelihood what you are experiencing at present will in time become nothing more than just another bad memory and of no real significance..... 
         For some of you here reading this, your own experience of loneliness (like my own) will be (or has been) much worse and of far more consequence.  Imagine if you had been alone in this state of emptiness and isolation for much longer.....not for a few months, or a year..... imagine these circumstances existing for a period of several years. Imagine not touching or being touched by another human being for years at a time....no physical contact of any description. Often going weeks, sometimes spending months without so much as even a brief conversation. Alone with nothing beyond your own thoughts and memories, yourself with only your sorrows and regrets. 
           Sex becoming a source of misery and frustration rather than the celebration of happiness and love that it once was. You manage the problem by denying and avoiding any feelings of longing or arousal. Masturbation ceases after a year or two, it invariably results in an overwhelming feeling of desolation and loneliness accompanied by a deep sense of an infinite emptiness....... this is then followed by silent tears.  Eventually sex is reduced to an occasional and entirely unwelcome wet dream. An unwanted bodily function.
          I wish I could claim truthfully that you eventually begin to enjoy, even prefer your own company. In sharing my experience of loneliness by way of this post.....I would truly like to be able to contribute something positive..... maybe even provide some hope and encouragement to you all. I've been by myself and almost entirely alone for almost 7 years now. The truth is that sometimes there is no hope, no happy ending. Not for everyone. And as the months pass by, eventually to be remembered as merely the beginning of a great many years of loneliness......it doesn't ever get easier, in my experience time serves only to wear you down, making you less resilient, increasingly isolated and excluded..... More cognisant of all that has been lost and of all that is missing from your world. 
          You don't ever stop imagining/fantasizing about giving someone you love or care about a hug, or receiving one. The feeling of another body pressed against your own, the warmth and comfort, engulfed in each others arms. This longing for physical contact remains......and is accompanied by a deep and hollow sadness..... emotions that I have no words to adequately describe. I don't feel able to write anything further on this subject, not just now. 
              I would appreciate hearing any comments or criticisms (relating to the above) that any of you may have. Comment below, or feel free to message me here on Reddit. Best wishes. -Geoff",lonely,Maybe You Have Been Lonely For Months Now.......,2020-03-14 08:19:49

1828,hooodelujs,1584130260,1,"i might not be seen as lonely to others, but when i get home from school, i feel pretty lonely. i have a couple close friends, and many acquaintances, but it doesn’t leave me satisfied. i wish i had a friend group. i see friends hanging out in a group of people, but i’m usually not invited. it makes sense, because one of the people in that friend group despises me. 

i just wish i had a group of friends that all got along, that all joked with each other and had fun together. i feel very out of place, especially at school. i walk around the halls alone a lot of the time, unless i find someone i know to walk with. i’ve always been one to not fit in. in middle school i felt out of place and was unliked by a lot of classmates. 

i look at people in school, hanging out with a group of people and start fantasizing about what that would be like. 

maybe i’m ungrateful? i know a lot of people don’t have anyone, no friends at all. so, i’m sorry if what i’m saying sounds ignorant. 

i just wish i fit in. last year i didn’t care at all about fitting in, i had a group of friends that cared about me. but i fell off from them. now i feel so out of place.",lonely,i feel lonely but i have friends,2020-03-14 07:11:00

i thought i was close with those people, when in reality i wasn’t. i thought my actions would repeatedly be excused, but they weren’t. i don’t know how or why i’ve become this way and i would do anything to undo it... but, i am a borderline so things like this are destined to happen.

i miss the fun and laughs and memories so much. i’m  trying to get them to talk to me with stupid strategies that i know arent going to work because i’m too scared to apologize and tell them that i’ll be a better person because i feel like they won’t care, and it won’t matter.

what’s done is done and they will forever remember as a toxic and mean person who couldn’t control their anger or behavior, but while i was shouting insults, saying slurs, and overall just being a hateful person, in my head i was thinking “what’s wrong with me? why am i acting like this and why can’t i stop it? why i cant control myself?”

and obviously that’s not a good excuse for what i’ve done, but they weren’t the only ones hating me in those moments. i’m going to be alone forever, and i shouldn’t get my hopes up when i make friends like this again because it’s always going to have the same outcome. the pain and loneliness and rejection is all too familiar, but strikes with the same power it did just a few months ago when my best friend blocked me on everything and told me i would never be in his life again. maybe it’s happening again because i deserve to pay for all my anger and toxicity, for projecting my own insecurities onto other people.

anyways, that’s all. the moral of the story is that i’m never going to have a stable group of friends because of my own shitty behavior that i can’t control, and sooner or later people will start to get tired of it and cut me off or ignore me. i just want to know how to better myself. i hate the person i’ve become. why has this happened to me?

i’ve always struggled with behavioral issues and mental illness my entire life, and it seems that those things still and forever will haunt me to this day. not a day passed where don’t i think about killing myself for the greater good of the world. i don’t deserve to be here, no one likes me anyways. i still had constant feelings of loneliness even when i was still friends with them, but it’s just different when you’re truly alone.",lonely,loneliness strikes with a vengeance against toxic people,2020-03-14 07:10:04

Also, I find it amusing that I can somehow mess up relationships with the nicest and most amicable people. There was a girl I met who’s super friendly, smiley, nice and popular. We were working very closely together to plan an event, and yet, I found out today that she deleted my contact off her phone (I saw her looking through some of the group chats we were in regarding the event, and everyone’s contact was saved but mine, despite the fact that she had it saved when we first met. I know it’s probably a bit creepy to take note of these things, but I have a tendency to be very anxious and overly attentive to things around me. It gives me something to occupy my mind with besides the usual depressing thoughts). But at that point, I just wanted to laugh and beat the crap out of myself, considering that I could mess up a friendship with someone who has literally no bad blood with any human being on planet earth. I feel so pathetic, and it’s beginning to become more and more evident that perhaps I’m just meant to be alone. Maybe I really am just that unloveable, and maybe it’s time I just accepted that fact.

Well then she blamed me for something in her head. I know I fucked up but like she didn’t talk to me about it. And then cheated on me and didn’t stop for 9 months and I sat there complacently and tried to fix it. On and off we would talk and not talk and now I’m afraid she’s truly gone and I’ll never see her again. My self esteem is so fucking gone. I feel like just a shell of even how lonely and sad I was before all this. She’s out there happy fucking anyone she wants with no care. And here I am. Sad. Alone. Crying myself to sleep every fucking night. I finally asked someone to prom but I don’t even think she wants me as anything more than a friend. I mean I’m truly happy I get a relationship with a girl that’s not centered around sex. But I just miss holding her. I miss saying I love you to someone. I miss thinking one day i can finally sleep with the girl I love. The only thing that’s helped me get through some weeks is acid and I can’t even do that all the time because I can’t ruin my tolerance. My first love and relationship and fucking everything cheated on me and im going to be haunted by it until the day I die. And she’s going to be out there happy with someone else. And just forget about me. Because she’s found a way to convince herself I don’t matter. I’ve contemplated suicide too and that would really make me happy. I know how I would do it easily too. And I can’t even do that because of my family. My dad and stepmom are having a kid and I can’t fuck up my dad like that. He would blame himself. I just wish I could drift off and not exist anymore. I wish I was never born. I don’t even know what to say to you all.

No words can describe just how bad my soul aches every day. Every second. And even then I still act happy and I feel annoying doing that. I shouldn’t but I hate who I am. I hate myself. My family gives me no support system and my friends just aren’t as emotional as me.

I honestly wish this coronavirus shit would end the world. There’s this quote I know of “everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.” I just don’t want to do this anymore. I never asked for this.

I’m young as shit too. But I’m just so scared of how alone I will be. I’m afraid of how fucked up I am now. I just don’t have any more will to go on.

My life is going to end with me putting a bullet through my skull one day but I have to wait for my family to die. And I don’t wanna wait.

I’m just venting but I can’t put this shit into words. I can’t live like this. I don’t want this. I’m not even religious but I fucking pray my life will just end tomorrow almost hourly. God I hate this world.

I can’t even hate her. No matter what she says or does or how much she hurts me I still love her. Love is the most violent act on this earth. I am so scared for her because i know her deep down. I know she’s not okay. But she’s never going to let me in. And i can’t let her destroy me over and over. And now it’s all in my head and the person I love isn’t real. I guess she never was real. From the start i thought i was too lucky and I guess i was right. I don’t even think she ever loved me now I’m just afraid she used me all that time.

Her face is burnt in the back of my fucking eyelids. And I can’t sleep. And I just

I don’t know. I just want it to stop. I know I’m a bad person but I don’t deserve to feel this. And I’m weak because this isn’t even a big problem. But I can’t live through it. I can’t get through the day. I can’t study or do homework. I’m going to be some fuck up because I’m too much of a pussy to deal with myself.

It's hard because I feel lonely in everything, and can't help but think I should have been living in my own house, making new friends at 36, but I am not... And I have tried. Believe me, I have...

1879,nofuture747,1584071938,1,"I was always the shy kid. In primary school I wasn't the class favorite, but I did have a handful of people I used to call friends. We drifted apart after leaving for high school. 

I went to a high school to a different country but it still wasn't far as I live near the border. There I was even less of a favorite than in primary school. There were only really two people I would call friends from my class. While all the other students from all the classes were in a big facebook group chat together, I was somehow missing. So I wasn't involved in any of the activities where I could develop friendships. Of the two friends I had one is getting married and I don't talk to him much anymore and the other one is busy with college so I don't talk to him much either. Plus they both study several hours drive away from me. 

When I graduated from high school some of my class mates went to a pub, so I went with them. I had a beer and then left. ONE guy noticed I left. ONE. He later asked me if I left because I had no one to talk to. I said yes. He just said huh and that was it. I wouldn't call him a friend but even with that he behaved somewhat nicely to me in class. 

Now I work long hours and that leaves me with almost no free time.  The free time I have I spend playing computer games as I live in a tiny village of 2000 old people so there are no new people to meet or any activities to do. Except do drugs or drink beer in shitty pubs. 

I have colleagues, but I can't really say that I have friends. 

There was one person I called my best friend. I met him through a certain online video game when we both went to primary school. However in real life I met him only a handful of times, as he lived across the country. Well now he's found new friends and is busy with college. 

My relationship with my parents could be better. While I love them and I hope they love me, we barely talk and almost everything I do pisses them off, while almost everything they do pisses me off in exchange. 

I never had any significant other. Never even kissed. Never even held hands. My dad tells me if I want to stay alone until I'm dead. I don't know how to respond. I missed out probably on one of the greatest joys of life, teenage love. 

I want to know how it feels being loved. I want to know how it feels to hold hands, how it feels to be kissed. 

I have no future, nor do I have anything left in life to look out for. I already turned 18 a few years ago so I could drink. I already graduated from high school... There's nothing left to look out for. Just wake up, go to work, go home, cry myself to sleep and repeat.

1882,hamartiated,1584070679,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26 (M4F) [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2020-03-13 14:37:59

There was this cute girl that rode my bus.  She was so pretty I would often try to catch a glimpse of her as often as I could without being creepy when I was listening to music waiting for my stop.  I didn’t ever talk to her nor did I think she noticed me.

One day I had fallen asleep listening to music.  I woke up with her shaking me telling me it was my stop.  I said “thank you!” And sprinted off the bus.  

I didn’t see her much until a couple weeks later I was at lunch with some of my friends.  She was with one of her friends.  Her friend asked me if she would go to the dance with her.  I didn’t handle this well.  I quickly thought it was a joke that they were making fun of me and said simply, “no.”  And turned back around.  The two girls were quiet and walked away.  

I never saw them again.

I’m still embarrassed.  I’m sad I treated someone that way.  Even if I didn’t want to go with her, I should’ve been polite.  I was so scared that they were going to make fun of me.  This is probably the reason I’m lonely, so scared of people I can’t tell when someone really does to be my friend.  

I wish I could say I’m sorry.  I hope she’s forgotten, I know how bad it feels to reject you in such a mean way and I did it myself.

The other guys I relied on weren't really my friends either, they were just around for my cash and to just show their presence. Last evening I had a recollection of all of these events and I couldn't resist but cry. All these years when I thought I was outgoing and popular was just a way of covering this inner pain.

1915,Draizy,1584037887,1,"Hi y’all,

I’m not really sure what to put here, but I’m in need of help/advice. 
I’ve been extremely lonely over the last few years, and it’s really starting to get to me. For those of you that know how it feels to feel so empty even in a room full of loved ones/peers. The best way I can describe it is like when you’re SO leaves and you feel like your heart is being torn. Stomachaches are kind of a normal thing for me when getting into anything new, or exciting (probably chalk that up to anxiety and depression) 

I haven’t had a relationship in quite a while. So it’s not anything dealing with a relationship, that’s just the best way I can describe it. 

Umm I guess into the meat and bones of this post, I can’t see to be happy. I enjoy making others happy and being funny, but when I’m at home or out and about (even with friends) I just don’t feel happy anymore. I have a wonderful dog who’s name is Charlie, and I got him because I have no one to turn to, whether it be family or friends they never take it serious, or they don’t know how to handle the situation. My mask is beginning to degrade and everyday just hurts a little more than the last. 

I always welcome suggestions. I’ve tried hiking, dog parks to interact with others, being more social in new environments, going to outings, spending time with family, shooting, and lots of other things I used to enjoy. I know this is probably the last of my worries, but romantic relationships are non-existent and that also adds to the pain. I’m either too shy, or in the words of these women “too nice and not forward enough” 

I’m not too sure what I’m hoping for out of this post, but I honestly couldn’t hide it anymore and needed someone, somewhere. 

I hope you all have a fantastic day.

- First was a coworker, second was an old 'friend'. They put their head on my shoulder and fell asleep. Thats all it was. I remember how it felt, perhaps thats why when i wake up im so...lonely. 


I (23m) haven't gotten any friends left(except work 'friends'), i haven't had a relationship in over 2 years. The relationship i was in wasn't healthy for me, so id say i really haven't been in a true relationship. 


My childhood was completely dysfunctional. My family is dysfunctional, and growing around them has made me dysfunctional. I dont trust, nor can i talk to them about anything personal. I cant talk to anybody about anything personal. Except redditors. 


Being raised in a dysfunctional family presents its mental illnesses. Im socially anxious, mainly because i dont know how to respond in those environments. I very seldomly hung out with friends or went out. So to do so now would require social learning. Which I'm not against at all, i just feel i need somebody with me, that i trust.

1924,shutupava,1584027241,1,"So, kinda hate my life right now. Or, to be more accurate, my school life.

I'm a senior in high school, and I can honestly say that in the seven years that I've gone to the same school, I don't think I've made a lot of meaningful friends or connections. I feel like a second choice to a lot of people in my life, and recently, one of my best friends seems to be disconnecting from me. I don't know why, but it feels like she doesn't consider me like a best friend anymore, and I even feel like she replaced me with a mutual friend of ours. My (first) boyfriend also broke up with me a month ago, and even though it was a while ago, I still miss him. Or maybe I just miss the feeling of being loved.

Either way, I just feel so alone right now. I just wish I had someone who understood my vulnerabilities, my emotional needs, and the fact that I'm scared that I might be on some kind of internal breaking point. I know things will get better in college, and that I have to endure another month or two with these people, but I can't handle it anymore. I know my worth, I know I deserve good friends who love and support me, but with each passing day of feeling more and more alone, the more I feel like I might not deserve that. Every close connection I've had outside of family members have eventually left me, so maybe it's me that's the problem, but I just don't know anymore.

Even right now, I'm in this area where the seniors hang out, and I'm on my laptop typing this, so people think I'm probably doing homework or something. However, there's this group of girls in the same area, and they're laughing and talking and it just makes me hurt so much. I'm happy they're happy, but it still hurts. 

Anyways, thank you for reading. I just needed to vent, so if anyone even looked at this, I'd be happy. Or even send me a DM (unless you're some creep that wants to manipulate a lonely teenage girl, I'll talk to most people).

     Introduction

     Ok first off, I don’t know if this is the right sub for this. If this isn’t please provide me with the right sub, thanks. My life is not a normal one I guess, I like to think my life is different than the 8 billion other people on this planet. But alas, it’s not. I can say I know I’m going to be rich or I’m going to make an impact! But no. It doesn’t work that way, life doesn’t go by the rules, of which I don’t think we know, I’m probably going to end up in a normal life stuck in a job, where I’m not happy, if I’m lucky have a family, ya da ya da ya da. I guess I’m just stuck in a cycle that everyone has been stuck in since the age of humans. I guess I don’t really know what my goal is, who does. Also, I don’t really know what I’m asking advice for. I guess for asking if this is a normal cycle of life or if I’m weird (honestly I already am). Life...life is something that won’t matter, life is like drunk driving without a car. I honestly don’t know. You know what? now that I think about it I would love to be in the state of non-existence, where nothing matters. We might say we don’t know what happens after life, but we do. It’s just zero, nothing, no happiness. Yet, no sadness. That’s my goal to reach there. I guess that’s why I’m such a disappointment. I just lost the will to live. Trust me I don’t want to commit suicide, I just don’t care if I died. That’s why I lost all motivation. Everything. Honestly I feel the thing I believe in is that I am the only person on earth. Everyone else doesn’t matter, this is all meant for me and when I die, that’s when the V.R. headset comes off. The reveal, that I wasn’t really on “Earth”. It’s gonna be like surprise! 

     Oh yeah and before I forget, this is on mobile, so sorry for formats blah blah. That’s the intro

     P.S: I made the intro before chapter 3, so I guess kinda like a mid story thought. 
Also one last note never forget your family, not the people who abuse you, only the people who truly love you and care for you, don’t hang out in the group that laughs at you, oh yeah and please for the love of anything don’t end up like me.

     Chapter 1; of my life

     Ok background, when I (now 14, happy birthday me) was very young, around 3-5, my mom divorced my dad. It... was kinda messy. Right before they divorced, they fought and yelled. One day it got bad and my dad went to the door and left while yelling at my mom, my sister and I heard it all, as we were sitting on the couch. After the events, my sister and I stayed with our mom. I had a lot of tantrums, because I didn’t have any attention, because my mom worked all day, just to provide for us. I was a needy child, I was also diagnosed with ADHD. One day I was having a tantrum and I yelled at my mom that I wanted to live with my dad... she ended up calling him to pick me up and I lived with him for one year. I then went back with my mom and in 6th grade, had another big tantrum and she ended up slapping me and leaving a good sized bruise on my chin. Her boyfriend saw this and (from what I think) thought I was gonna retaliate and grabbed and put me in the bath tub and turned on the cold water. He did this while I still had my clothes on... I remember this very vividly, as I felt like I was drowning and felt very weighed down. I now have anxiety about drowning. After this happened I stated fighting back because I was scared and I had a fight reaction. My mom called the police on me and they talked to me about not doing that. I told them, that my mom hit me on the chin and showed them the bruise (this will be important later). They started talking to my mom. I didn’t really hear what they said. Anyways, after this I moved back with my dad for 7th and 8th grade. I am with him currently.

     Chapter 2; of my life

     That was when I was with my mom. Honestly I could say that’s it, that is all, my mom and dad suck. I hate them. I was born in the wrong family. Blah, blah, blah. But no, that’s not it with my mom. Honestly I love her to death, she’s so soft and caring, the only reason that why that happened was because she was scared and didn’t know what to do, another reason why, was because of her old boyfriend, a man should know that grabbing a kid, who is very weak, should not throw him in the shower and not let him out, while he was screaming about drowning. Don’t wary as the boyfriend was broken up with, by my mom. She had since told me she was sacred for me, when that happened. Anyways, my mom does love me too, she tried her best to take care of two children, by herself. She worked hard. Never hanged out with friends/rejected invites. She loved us kids to death. Her current husband, is my fucking guy, I love him, he was like the father I never had. We can talk and i can trust him. My mom is a very nice lady. Alas, it’s time to talk about my dad

Chapter 3; of my life

     My dad, my dad is a guy that just wasn’t meant for me. I try to love him and trust me I really do, and I know he does too. Here’s the thing: we weren’t meant for each other. When him and my mom split up, I visited him often every weekend. He had a very weird teaching style. He often bought me what I wanted, but never what I needed. He would often forget to take me to doctors appointments, dentists, etc. he has very mixed signals he tells you what he needs you to do, and when you do it, he says that’s not the right way/do something else. He is very old school, he punishes by hitting and never showing his weak side/getting mad when you don’t do manly stuff/girly stuff. If I tried to hug him he accepts it but looks at you weird. Technically, no affection if you’re a man, and nothing but affection if you’re a girl. I was so attached to him as a kid I went with him to work tried to do everything he has. It was a very loving relationship up until he met his girlfriend. That’s it’s own chapter. When the “incident” happened between me, my mom, and her boyfriend, he was fucking lvivd. He said how could she do that to him, etc. He started going to court with her for custody of me, child support, etc. It took its toll on me, as my mom, and dad kept telling me to support them, whatever. But then, the judge saw the records of when she hit me and put it into my dad’s favor.

     This all happened last year, since then I have lost interest in most things, my dad gets mad because I can’t do basic things like doing laundry, taking showers, cleaning my room. He also says things like get outa bed, get off your phone, your clothes are wrinkled. He has also gave me lots of talks over and over again. He just recently left to Utah and I am left here at home with the people who live with me. The fucking people I will never consider family. My step brother, step sister, and his girlfriend. My step mom.

     Chapter 4; of my life

     My step mom... is a very interesting specimen. I met her 5 years ago when I was 7. My sister’s 10th birthday. 

     She was apparently My dad’s friend since childhood. She was a very sweet and great person, I considered her my fucking mom, like a second one. 

     On that day, my dad had gotten a clown for my sisters birthday. I think my worst enemy was that fucking clown, if she just had another birthday party, or had gotten sick, I think my life would’ve ended better than today. Anyways, no time to blame life, the clown made her and my dad to dress up like cows. They had to sing to a song, a Spanish song, and then at the end, they had to kiss. Hehe, that was the beginning of the end for me. 

     Soon after they started dating. Honestly, I loved her just as much as my mom. She was so soft, so understanding, she defended me when my dad was mad at me.

     I liked her kids too, her son and I, were bros, we’d die for each other! One time, We beat up a guy who was bullying me. 

     We would always want to join the army, I wanted to do Air Force, and he wanted to be a mechanic. We even had a phrase. It was “I’ll (step brother) make the bombs and you (me) will drop them!” 

     My step mom got pregnant with my half-brother, we moved into an apartment all together, life was great! everything went smoothly! Until... it didn’t...

     Chapter 5; of my life

     I recently talked to my dad and he said a main reason why everything fell apart was because apparently he flirted with another girl and kissed her (‘by accident’/‘she started it according to him) My step mom started getting cold to me and her children started being cold to me too. 

     She started pointing out all mistakes I did. Stoped talking to me in general. She started slowing untangling my life with her everything we built as a relationship started falling apart, she stoped defending me, her son started talking to other people behind my back, I hated it. Even today she has little to no involvement in my life. Her son and I stoped talking. No more friends. She started wanting my half brother to stop talking to me.

     In 8th grade, as I write this, he transferred to my school and has started making fun of me, doing little things to me, etc.

     Then the incident happened... I had finally had it with my dad’s bullshit and how he always wanted me to have a better relationship with her even though I told him, that she did that herself removing me, I didn’t do it. I was also done with her too.

     I ran away for a day, I just walked out when my dad had started yelling at me and tried to hit me, I punched him... I started fighting him... imagine that, imagine a son hitting their father, that was me. I did that. I ran out of the house, because he started calling the cops, I ran and hid on a very stormy day, I eventually went back to the house because I needed clothes and food and water... I grabbed my phone too. Anything that might’ve helped, as I was getting ready to leave I accidentally ran into my step mom and her kids. She got mad that I was there and kept saying, “DoEs YoUr DaD kNoW yOuR hErE?” And “ GiMmE yOuR kEyS! nOw!” 

     Eventually we worked through that and we  figured it out, but not her. 

     Last thing that happened that I’m not motivated to write was that her son framed me for drugs, and she fully supported him, until I had texts and other evidence to prove otherwise, oh and he wanted to fight me too, she has also told him to kick my ass.

     Chapter 6; of my life 

     Honestly I’m kinda tried. I’ve been writing for 2 hours and I wanna go to bed so this chapter will be about things I think about later (also for the future) so.... 🚨 Work in progress 🚨 


     After thoughts

     Honestly I feel like I could’ve derailed things better and I know I’ll probably be able to think about it better later so if you want me to be more specific on certain details please tell me which.

I... feel like my life story really doesn’t matter, I don’t care if you say it’s gonna get better soon and it probably will be, but I really don’t know. this story will probably only get a few views so I don’t really expect much comments anyways, but I honestly don’t care I didn’t make this looking for attention, I’m not looking for useless internet points, all I wanted was an organized place to put my thoughts and to see a few people give me their opinions to see if I’m just a dumb ass for writing this, and everyone goes through this and I’m just special, or maybe yo bro how can you think like that, idc.

     Please feel free to ask questions, comments, or concerns. 

I will update the after thoughts again soon and add a tl;dr.

1949,anonymous99189,1583993269,1,"First off, throwaway acct.

Second, ignoring my hell of a childhood (basically adoption, rape between my blood brother and sister), here's the rundown of my life:

Did well in school until middle school (when family drama hit me hard).

I barely scraped by in HS.

After HS I worked a couple jobs until I finally quit at a job as a Licensed Locksmith. 

I am glad I left if for no other reason than health issues related to stress. After working there as a 20 yo 5'8"" Male I went up to about 225 lbs. Before working there I never went over 200 lbs. After quitting I've dropped back down rapidly.

I've now started my own Locksmith business which is starting rather slow. (Not making enough money yet to feel comfortable moving out of my parent's house or provide enough to allow me to save any money.)

I've had issues with insomnia for months now without finding any sort of relief from it. Even meds that typically put me to sleep like Benadryl don't do anything.

The only bit of true happiness I can find is when I am doing some sort of volunteer work (mainly through my church) which lasts for very little time. 

I am an introvert by nature (had to be drunk to type this) and always do the most I can to help those less fortunate than I am.

I don't know what I am looking for at this point, I just feel so alone in this world. Someone on Hinge seemed to have the same morals as I did (even had attended the same mission trip yet through their own church) yet ghosted me. (Like anyone else I've met.)

I turn 21 in less than a month yet it seems the only people close enough to care is a few family members (including my parents) and maybe a friend. (Only like 2 to choose from and it seems he mainly cares because he won't have to sit at bars alone).

There is so much more detail I could add, but I just don't have the motivation to. 

To those who read this or to those who don't, I hope your life ends up better than mine has. I hope everyone can experience true happiness that lasts a lifetime. If it takes my suffering to make others happy then I will accept my fate.

I guess I am meant to be alone. Meant to be sad. Yet meant to help others.

Sorry for rambling. I hope I can get my life in check.... i guess we'll see.",lonely,Living Hell (20M),2020-03-12 17:07:49

1952,crazy_brazy22,1583991961,1,"20 yo dude...had very close friends in my teen years. All of my good friends were close with each other as well so it was like a group of 7 or so kids all super close. Then at 16 yo one of them killed themselves. Never gave us a reason why. I took a good look at all the friends after the fact and In hindsight they weren’t the best influence on him or me for that matter. So decided to cut everyone out of my life. I was okay for a while because I was enjoying the peace of mind by being “alone”. I say “alone” because I was selling weed for a couple years and talked to plenty of people every day but had no interest in being close with anyone. I am not a big drug user by the way, it was just to make some good money the easy way I guess. About a year ago I decided to stop and now I really see what it’s like to be alone. I do not see anyone anymore. When I do it’s almost natural for me to not want guy friends anymore. I don’t seem to connect with other guys like I used to. I would however like a relationship with a female. I have had I few short term girlfriends in the past year but each relationship has turned out the same. Starts out great, feeling a mutually close connection from the start then all of a sudden she loses interest. So much to the point where’s there’s not even a break up, just not making an effort anymore hoping I will go away. I never get a reason as to why it ends which bothers me the most. I am a generally nice guy and I suspect that they don’t won’t to hurt me or something by cutting it off directly. I recently turned 20 and had another one of these relationship scenarios happen to me. Feels like I will never succeed with a relationship. I have zero people in my life that I feel comfortable talking about my thoughts. I try to spend time focusing on hobbies and getting out doors rather than what’s going on in my head but I can’t do these things 24/7. When I’m not doing them I feel completely empty.

1953,JustARando674,1583989498,1,"So recently my ex and I broke up but not because of anything bad, quite the opposite actually. So we met in September 2019 through tinder of all places. At first I was super nervous but also excited you know, this was the first time since I’d downloaded the app that I felt a real connection with. So anyway we start dating for about 2-3 weeks then decide to become exclusive. The period between October 2019 and January 2020 are literally the happiest moments of my life. This was my first real relationship and for the longest time I literally thought it was me just being inadequate, weather it be looks or personality. I felt so lonely all through high school because I’d only been been lead on, played etc and all I wanted was to have a real, intimate relationship. So anyway this girl is literally made of dreams, I never knew I needed so much until I met her. She was the first person to tell me that I deserved to be loved. That I was adequate. She provided so much emotional support for me which I had never really got (it’s apparent now that I had been neglecting myself for so long) and just in general this amazing wholesome human being. So anyway fast forward to January of this year and the day we knew would always come was fast approaching. She was moving towns to start uni in February. We both knew it was always gonna happen but now that it’s happened I feel so lost and lonely again. We ended it on extremely good terms we both love each other so much but our lives were being separated. I genuinely don’t know what to do now that she’s gone. Moving isn’t an option because we had both discussed that we both believe that she needed to live her life and go to uni and have fun and party (I’m older than her and have already managed to go to uni and dropout before meeting her).

1955,Naive-Hamster,1583989430,1,"I'm struggling with black and white thinking. It's not so much the content of my thoughts as I do try to correct/police myself. Loneliness is a feeling just as much as a conscious thought.   
    
Currently I have no social opportunities. I'm in a place too small/isolated for meetups. So instead, I've tried several sites and forums for talking to people online. I'm constantly falling into bouts of hopelessness. The sheer amount of individuals with whom I've initiated conversations has given me a very deep feeling of being cut off from everyone.     
   
When I'm talking in chat apps, most of the time my availability doesn't match with other people's. So when I feel isolated, talking to people online makes that feeling seem justified. But the upside is, I get to feel like, at least that person is open to seeing me as an individual. Whereas in any other capacity like forums, no one would notice if I wasn't there next time.  
  
 I don't feel *real*. Maybe social gaming would be better? But I'm worried I'll still think that way-- ""Why dont I match up with anyone. I dont matter. Nothing I do matters. I can't get out.""",lonely,Frequent bouts of hopelessness - how to avoid?,2020-03-12 16:03:50

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

My natural response to feeling lonely is ""I should try to have more than two friends."" But whenever I try to make friends, not only does it fail to work out in one way or another, but the effort it takes to try and maintain friends so they don't leave is just rarley worth it. I don't get as much out of it as I'd hope. Yet I crave that ""best friend"" that I click with, and can have those ""natural"" conversions with; on topics we're both interested in.

I'm pretty introverted, I've got social anxiety, and most of my interests are obscure and/or conflicting to most with one of the interests, but not the other. It makes it difficult to even find someone I have common ground with. It's so tiring to try that I've more or less stopped at this point.

Downs: When I was at the burger joint, I saw a person I knew from school, which really made me regret dropping out at that moment, I also saw a group of other teens that I don't know, but they were so happy and laughing, despite feeling proud of them, it also built up quite a bit of self-loathing at that moment, seeing as I was totally alone.

The new flat was unfurnished so i tried to remedy that as best as i could afford and i guess i got carried away with it all. I bought a large sofa but collapsible into a bed in case people wanted to stay over. It was also easy clean faux-leather in case anyone was clumsy with their drink.

I bought wine glasses and coat racks, spare towels and an air bed. Around Christmas i decorated the place with all manner of tenuously balanced lights and ornaments. I bought a feast of snacks and drinks and bowls and a whole fold-away table to place them on.

Christmas came and went with only a phone call from my closest friend. I invited everyone and anyone to mine for new year's eve and no one showed, no one could make it.

I remember looking around and thinking how utterly fucking stupid it all had been. How naive i was to have these fantasies of parties and get-togethers. Even buying candles and such in case i brought a girl back after a date or something which should've been a fuckin' laughable notion from the offset.

I've been here 6 months now and i can count the friends i've had visit me on one disfigured hand. Even when i'm here, there's no one in these rooms. They're empty rooms decorated for people who no longer exist. Either they're all too busy or i'm too pathetically unemployed...or maybe they just don't care anymore.

I don't know why i wrote all this. I guess it's still playing on my mind. It still hurts. This seemed like the place to speak about this. Maybe others can relate to these sorts of fantasies.

I (20F) feel like I have no one at all to talk to, my family is complicated and my relationship with my mother is very strained.

The only person I have a good relationship with is my boyfriend although I still feel like I can’t talk to him about much. I feel like I bother him and I am alway too worried about what he thinks/ if he’s mad (he always reassures me he isn’t) he always tells me I should be going out of the house more and doing things such as spending time with friends which is easier said than done for me.

Long story short, all of my life I didn't know how to act when a girl crushed on me (happened only for 3 times lmao). This changed when I went to study abroad 1 month ago. There was this girl who showed some signs of interest toward me. Not super into me, but I think you get the idea. I was so happy that I might actually get a shot at this. When we had a week off, I visited her in her city. We held hand and stayed under the same umbrella. I already got super attached to her  (thanks to crippling loneliness I get attached to everyone who gives me the shortest bit of attention ) and kissed her on the head while I was waiting for my train. I actually made the dumb/good thing of kissing her on the mouth as she was leaving. Idk if she was into it, but she texted me on my way back home and I really thought I had a chance. Here comes the part when you'll laugh at me and say I am the dumbest motherfucker to ever live. While back on campus I didn't even kiss her again and she wasn't showing any signs of affection either, just holding my arm on and off. Time passed by and I noticed that another guy was playing with her hair while I was near her. Being the fucking loser that I am I did not do anything. I just sat. I went to my room to have a breakdown and decided to leave the city for a day to clear my mind. Then, after a long decision, I ask her why did she pretend to see more than a friend. She said she needs me in my life, BUT also said that I am her ""best friend"". She apologized and I wasn't mad at her at all. I am just super disappointed with myself. I was struggling enough with courses due to my bipolar and anxiety disorder, but this was the final straw. Two days ago I arrived back in my shitty ass country and I think about killing myself even more than I did before. (Been thinking since 2016). I had THIS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY, but due to my social retardation I fucked it all up. I swear to God, it's like a comedy.  

Disclaimer - I am , by no means, an incel. I respect her decision, but I am super mad at myself. If I had her, my life would've been a bit better. Not I have no future, I am not going back there to study anymore, bc just seeing her is ruining me.

When I lay asleep

Beneath my cold skin

With my eyes open 
to escape the world I see

The pain I can't shut off 
I feel it every day 
I'm too cowardly to die 
But not brave enough to live

I can't shake the feeling 
A feeling that I've failed 
Born into this prison of a body 
That I can't get out of.

Sleeping is not escape

2013,bisteot,1583942292,1,"I am just so tired of what is going on with my life.

Recently I started making a friendship with someone that worked for the same company I was working on, but that lived on a different country. Everything was going great or so I thought, funny texts, deep conversations. And suddenly this person just went off the radar texting a couple of times each 2 or 3 days, the only explanation was that wanted to spend less time on social networks.

This has gotten me down honestly, it is really hard for me to make new friends and find people that catch my attention. It is also hard because I really want to try to reach again, but I see little to gain going after someone that has lost interest for whatever reason.

My uncle recently had a car accident. He is old and sick. Doesnt has insurance, doesnt has savings, cant walk. We cant lend him the other family car because he will end killing himself and someone else. He may lose his job due this.

My sis was detected with a weird disease, she is doing chemo every day, and who really knows how much he can resist.

My wife doesnt help much at home at doesnt take care of herself. She recriminates me I have lost interest at her, but doesnt own for her lack of responsibilities and self care. I provide at work, maintain most of the house in order, do most of the chores and nothing really changes no matter how I ask for help.

Now we are dealing with the corona virus. So my mother, uncle and sis are at risk due their ages/conditions.

My old company owns me 2k and other money and they dont want to pay.

So yeah, I feel alone, no, i am not suicidal, just to clarify. I just feel sad and with no support and rejected.  I wish the person I was talking about would return to be how it was, just talking with someone and receiving some optimistic words would help. But instead nobody ever asks me if I need help or how I am or how I am feeling.

I've never been good with women and have only dated online.   In my 20's and 30's I had some luck but nothing that was forever it seemed.   I unfortunately settled because I feel like I could never get any better.  I am painfully shy with women and just cannot approach them in person.    As I've turned 40, it seems like I am the ugliest man alive with women.  No woman will talk to me.   We will have so many interests and I know we could be a good fit, but dear God sending 100 messages and getting 0 responses makes me feel lower than dirt.  I pay for all the dating services so I can see when my messages get read, and subsequently deleted.   Why is it women won't give me a chance?   I feel like sometimes the only reason I keep going is because I don't want my cat to be sad once I'm gone.   I have so many things going for me. I have a very good paying career, good truck, all of my teeth, not trashy at all.  Basically a middle class white man.   I still want a child, but I feel that option is gone now.

Why is it wrong for me to expect something in return? They always say you should be kind without expecting anything in return but it’s like....i’m human? and it’s not like i’m even asking for much? Just reciprocation. Just to feel appreciated and valued and cared for. To feel like a priority and not a second or third or fourth option.

I’ve realized that people rarely have the heart that I do. And maybe that sounds a bit arrogant and narcissistic but truly I don’t mean it to. There’s so much I hate about myself but the one thing I actually admire and pride myself on is my heart. Yeah, i’m proud of my heart. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with taking pride in that. 

The thing is, i’m the type of person that goes out of my way just to make someone smile. I go out of my way to make sure someone’s good. I like to make people feel loved and feel like they’re special to me and that they hold value in my life. I don’t do this simply by words but through my actions. I like to spoil my “friends” and I will easily go without to give to them. I’d give them my last dime and the shirt off my back.

I’ve been in 4 relationships, 1 of which was for 7 years &amp; was emotionally abusive (&amp; physical on 2 occasions) &amp; all of these, except the current one, have been toxic &amp; very unhealthy. My boyfriend also struggles with his mental health &amp; I don’t want to rely on him too much for comfort as I know he’s finding life hard, too. 

How do I stop being so insecure? I’m always clingy &amp; needy. I’m often irrational &amp; I have a tendency to overreact. How do I make friends? Or keep friendships? I’m convinced nobody will make an effort with me unless I contact them first. Where do I go to meet people? I need somebody to talk to, other than my boyfriend as I don’t want to overwhelm him &amp; he has his own worries. Who can I talk to? 

I’ve been referred to a Psychiatrist but it’s a 4-6 week wait (after years &amp; years of struggling, begging for help &amp; being messed around) &amp; I have nobody to talk to in that time frame. 

My lack of friends &amp; my loneliness, as a result, are causing me to feel worthless &amp; as if people wouldn’t care if I wasn’t here anymore. 

No medical professionals will take me seriously, my family don’t understand &amp; I’m completely lost as to what to do. 

Any suggestions are massively appreciated. 

TL;DR 
Been surrounded by negativity my whole life. Wanting to meet people, make friends &amp; keep them &amp; try to combat loneliness, to help improve my mental health. Looking for suggestions. 

Thank you all, in advance.",lonely,Struggling with Loneliness,2020-03-11 19:10:35
2043,wiatbenjamin,1583913656,1,"I know I want to be in a relationship. I don't really have a type. It's kinda, I'll know her when I see her type deal, but I might be stretching my luck, since I don't believe I could end up with my type of girl. In my head she has bangs (my weakness), shorter than me of course, I like brunettes a lot , but it's not a must. She has to be smarter than me, not in a condescending kinda way but smarter. I would want to just sit on the couch and watch a million movies with her, cook all kinds of food to binge on. We could take walks together and such. Just as long as she actually likes me for who I am, she can change me all she wants, it's not a big deal.

I just always feel like she doesn’t want to be around me, talk to me or hear about my weird ass rants. Even though I love having her attention and talking to her, I just never feel like anyone cares to I guess be around me so I always end up pushing the girl away or doing something so stupid I ruin everything about it. I’ve tried shutting myself off from girls and everybody but thats just made me so antisocial and awkward that I can barely form sentences without choking up and having to say sorry after every sentence. I’ve been working out nonstop to improve my image but overall I look/feel better but I still think the same way. With that being said, I’ve never been the type to go out and just talk to a girl I always feel like I’m intruding in their space and don’t want to disrespect them so I never take a shot at a girl I think is pretty unless Ofcourse we are talking, but if I see her or frequently like in class or something idk I won’t ever make a move. I’ve tried tinder, bumble etc, but I hate how I look so you can picture how that goes. I’m definitely not going to lie and say I haven’t talked to girls recently but to say that they found me interesting after the first week is a lie, I’m too awkward and just boring/weird for any girl to like.

Everybody needs a little bit of attention and care. And you guys had it. Hell, whenever I SENSED that they might be even 1% sad or lonely, I give up whatever I'm doing and do anything I can to make them feel better. But when it's my turn, why do they ignore me? Am I just an answer key to them, or a therapist? I admit, I'm no good at asking help from others. Tbh I'm so used to being the ""helper"" that I dont need any help from others. I can't just go straightforward and tell, ""Hey, comfort me."" I simply can't. So, I tried to give them hints about it. Now, whether they get it or not, they straight up ignore it or crack some lame jokes. And I only ask those for who I have a soft spot in my heart, but nah. They don't care .

About an hour ago I saw their conversation (they’re in a relationship) and I said “hey sorry to ruin the conversation but I don’t think our friendship is going to work out which is why I unfollowed you guys. Just wanted to let you know.” 

I commented it because I won’t get messages back if I dm them. They’re both the same now. Only care about each other and have successfully pushed me out made me feel fed up.

I meant what I said. They’ll probably ignore me or make me look bad but I don’t care. I felt how I felt. I hate that this hurts me so much.. but online is all I have and I can never make friends who show they love me and talk to me when they’re not busy... 

I kept blaming myself and apologizing because I kept disappearing but in reality I was the one always sending messages or tagging first, otherwise conversations wouldn’t happen. 

I’m tired. I’d rather be alone than have to deal with people who say they love and care for me but don’t show it.. 

I enjoy those who have friends to talk to online all the time. Those who form strong bonds and meet each other in person.

Shit’s happened to me. It’s been 5 years since I was in relationship and my hopeless romantic heart misses loving someone and feeling loved. I’m more than aware that out of this loneliness and desperation I developed highly intensive feelings towards online friend of mine who happened to show deep interest in me. I constantly fantasize about meeting them, spending time with them, making love with them, spending the rest of my live with them, you name it. Heck, I’m even extremely attached to them. If there’s any slight chance in communication that would give me negative vibes, my whole day falls down. The thing is, they show absolutely no signs of being romantically interested in me and moreover, not even talking about ever meeting me in person. And I just can’t do this anymore, can’t go on with that desperation and hopelessness of how much I want them, but in reality, can’t even dream of ever having them.

2073,hamartiated,1583897613,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26 (M4F) [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2020-03-11 14:33:33

Anyways, I've moved around a lot since one of my parents is military and usually i'm able to make pretty fast friends but I've been in this place for a year and a half and theirs no one. As time has gone on I've become much more anxious and just much more inept at most things in general and the only place I feel even somewhat ok is my room but my friends where like a moving defense making the day better and giving me a reason to get up and leave my room but as time has gone on this year I've been getting worse and worse. Today I went to the locker room to get ready for gym class, I opened my locker and grabbed my clothes but just decided whats even the point. I proceeded to spend 45 minutes sitting in the locker room with my face in my hands and it made me wonder whats even the point. You live and then you die, the details in between are usually shitty and unimportant. Hopefully i'll get to see some of my friends in person soon, hopefully that will bring me up a bit but i'm not sure how much more I can take this. Every day is shitty and the things that used to help help less and less every day and pretty soon I might just stop. I cant even really talk about it to anyone in person because they never understand my jumbled thoughts when they ask for details, i tell them all the shitty things and all the things that make me feel anxious beyond belief and it feels like i'm talking a different language.

2080,Tayler_Vengenz,1583895836,1,"(Sorry I am new-ish to how reddit works and I think I was supposed to cross post this since it’s in another r/) 

Anyway, I’m a 22 year old woman who is inexperienced in relationships and I have also had some awful past experiences with guys destroying my sexual confidence (if I ever even had any...).

I’ve posted before how I had a recent “relationship” with someone for 2 months but he dumped me a month ago and just now told me that partially it was because I didn’t give him head. He never asked for it or communicated this desire til after the breakup. I opened up to  him during the “relationship” before about the things a guy said to me when I was 19/20 that to this day destroy my confidence in my sexuality. This person from my past said my mouth was “too small”, my genitals were “too tight” and when I stuck up for myself he said something nasty like “good luck finding someone who’s **** is small enough to fit.” I thought my new “boyfriend” was understanding of it and patient.

But he wasn’t. 

But I also feel selfish, horrible. 

I let him go down on me. Not because it was expected, he begged. I still feel like a selfish horrible person for getting it but not giving. It felt good for once that someone wasn’t disgusted by my body. I wanted to try reciprocating in return but I just needed more time to try and with the one shitty guy that’s put me in therapy it was SO hard to try to get myself to like the idea. 

I was opening up to the idea the week before he dumped me, the week of Valentines Day. But it was too late. He didn’t even tell me why he dumped me until 3 weeks later. He complained to me “I was patient for 2 months” even though  I told him my story. 

I wanted to give to him or at least try because he was amazing. I almost even loved him. He didn’t communicate that this lack of head bothered him at all and now I’m left feeling broken and insecure again. I feel like because of this hang up due to narcissistic and hurtful men that I will never find a guy or be able to make him stay. I wish I was different and liked giving oral. Maybe some guy would actually love me.",lonely,Feeling like I’ll never be able to make a guy happy or make him stay...,2020-03-11 14:03:56

3. Have you ever dreamt that you had a SO and woken up to a daymare?
4. Have you ever wanted to go out and do something but had nobody to do it with and you were pretty sure that even if you pulled one person from your contacts and asked them they would have a reason to get out of it?

6. Have you ever needed to ask for help from someone you didn't know very well and didn't want to bother but actually ended up getting unreasonably emotional when they said ""yes"" like they owed you?
7. Have you ever been treated so nicely by someone that it caught you off gaurd and you wondered for a second if they were planning something but it actually turned out that they were just a nice person?
8. Have you ever ruined a relationship with said nice person because you sucked all of the nice energy out of them until there was nothing nice left to give?
9. Have you ever thought about how it would be to start a club or organize a community event as some kind of benefactor and how maybe then people would look up to you and respect you, but never actually went through with it out of fear?
10. Have you ever wanted to look into a person's eyes... just because it feels good?

I Barely leave the house and suffer from social anxiety maybe even a bit of agrophobia? The only outside gathering I have is on my motorcycle (alone) and even that is done behind a darkened visor as I get anxious about people looking at me, I like to feel like I am invisible? 

I do my food shopping online and get it delivered because I can’t deal with people and strangers and I can’t do supermarkets or enclosed spaces filled with lots of people as it makes me very uncomfortable and anxious. 

I recently split up with my girlfriend as she had a lot of personal stuff going on and she wanted to be friends. I am absolutely heartbroken &amp; gutted and she knows it, I’m hoping for a relationship with her in the future, as I really really do care about her a lot and she was one of the reasons why I wasn’t just going to throw it all away...

I’m hoping to start a BSc with Honours in Computing and IT in the next few weeks, but as I applied late, I was put on a waiting list. So if I don’t get it, I can start it in October and the degree will take me 6 years to complete, I then want to become a software engineer or a system architect. I have loved computers since my teenage years, always obsessing over them. 

I ride a motorcycle. A Suzuki Bandit 600. I am currently saving up to buy a new motorbike, a Honda CB1100XX Super Blackbird, which gives me some hope, but then it’s just another way of killing myself quicker. 

I would just like someone to talk to, if you’re reading this. Please say hello :) 

I am happy to talk via private message. I also use WhatsApp, but not sure if that’s allowed to be advertised in this sub. Sorry if not ok.

I look forward to talking to someone :) thank you.",lonely,"Feeling Lonely, Fighting The Urge To Give Up",2020-03-11 08:08:36

2157,Nothereortherexin,1583829709,1,"I know its probably pitiful for posting here. But I really don't know how could I express what I'm feeling right now. So here's the thing - After a breakup, I lost all desire for living or doing whatever. That was the last time I wanted to try to be happy, but my ex just decided to break up and now its been 1 month but I'm still feeling like not living at all, nothing brings me joy and I am not happy,  every day, the entire day. I tried many things but the truth is that I am sad all the damn time. I see no point in going forward, but I know I can't kill myself, but l lost all hope for life, I see nothing anymore in this life. I started drinking a bit and it helps me in a way, now the only excitement I feel is the thought of drinking again, I originally don't drink or smoke or anything, I'm into workouts and I'm a student (social pedagogy, ironically ha). I just can't see any way to cope with it, all the time memories of us just hit me and kill and the thought of the fact that I will never again see her, touch her, smell her just dismembers me. I did so much for her and the relationship, I invested so much of myself, in every aspect. I even neglected my family in some cases, I'm not proud of it. It just hurts so much to the point I am unable to deal with this pain. Now I can't even trust people or want anything with anyone. For the people who would tell me I am in depression - I have dealt with depression before, I have visited a therapist and psychiatrist, but it is a different thing, they gave me pills that actually made it worse so then I found ways how to deal with it and I did, but this is a pure emotional pain I don't know how to deal with, all day I'm thinking about her and our moments, it's just killing me. I can't even watch movies or some songs I used to enjoy, cause they remind me of love and her. I really think of death but I know that's not realistic and also I can't kill myself, that's not who I am, but the missing, the hopelessness, the sadness, the memories... seem overwhelming especially on moments like this one.

2163,DerikVen,1583827068,1,"Hey everyone, 

So I(23M) am having a really hard time at the moment, things are just all over the place and nothing seems to be working, it all started when my ex left me, everything was so wonderful and perfect when we were together, we started talking about marriage and it feels like that is where it all fell out of place.

She just left.. Never gave me any reason why nor did she take any of my calls or messages, after 6 months I  feel this extreme emptiness and its just not going away, I tried doing everything I love (play games, do dancing etc) but it is not helping, even started a new hobby and decided to learn to play guitar and I enjoy it but the second I stop playing guitar to go to bed or while I am working the emptiness returns.

It also feels like my family are forgetting about me (I don't stay with my parents for almost 4 years already and have a 31M roommate that I am actually good friends with, one of the only friends I have), they don't call anymore and don't text me unless they want something... My younger brother turns 18 on Thursday and I wasn't even invited to visit (I know none of us are party people and I decided that I am going to visit them anyway to surprise my younger brother) but still, I remember for about a year to a year and a half after I moved out they regularly messaged or called me and asked how I was doing, Since I moved into the apartment I stay in now (going on 3 years) they only visited me three times and that was only because they were in the area, and its not like I live far away, it is a 45min drive max from where they stay to me with no toll roads between us...

I found a girl that I liked a lot (23F) and would have gone out with her Saturday evening, but then she messaged me Saturday morning saying that she is pregnant with her 2nd child (2 different fathers) and it looks like a pattern to get child support or something...

So this weekend I decided to just relax and let everything go, me and 3 friends decided to braai and have a few drinks, it was fun but I got so drunk I don't remember most of the night, I woke up on Sunday morning without knowing how I got into bed or what happend.

Now I am at work and I constantly feel drained and empty (even though I recovered from the weekend) and I don't know what to do, guess I will just have to ride the highway out and let it get better with time (if there is such a thing)...

2165,Big_Shrill,1583824526,1,"hey y'all. this is just a late night ramble but i figured i'd throw my words out into a page and see what got stuck.

my name's shrill and i feel like no matter how much i improve i just... don't change in other's eyes, and that leads to me slipping back which nobody seems to really notice either. i go from this ethereal slipnslide of being front and center of attention to being muted, static.

for those who don't know me which is all of you, i lift weights. i'm loud i'm overweight as hell but at least i'm strong now. i lift because it makes me feel like i matter and that i might just might be able to change things for someone in a dire circumstance but who really knows in the end

point is i'm a massive loud man, hard to miss. and yet i have this weird way of being light on my feet, or something like that. ever read American Gods? great book, but i do something there i feel like. walking between classes or anything else i'll just slip backstage and never be noticed until i shove myself out there again, it feels so bad when i bump directly into someone and they go whup, didn't see you there. like how? i mean i should be paying attention duh but like i am so scared to accidentally hurt someone it burns

anyway so there's that and there's also the fact i'm as the sub name suggests lonely. like terribly so, and it's so weird. i hate it because i HAVE friends who all claim they care about me but i hate it when they say they love me because no. you don't you just like my presence love is for two partners or for a mother or a sibling not for someone you've known for a few months

but worst, worst of all, this girl Hannah. Hannah and i were friends (not her real name) for a few months straight and it was amazing, i had constant quick responses for whatever stupid meme i popped up with and she had a witty response, I felt like things were perfect because God this girl is beautiful, in and out. i don't think i could ever meet anyone like her again

but she just. Doesn't talk to me and I don't know what I did or why but she just doesn't reach out and normally when nobody reached out it was fine and normal but this tore the floodgates back open anew in a way I didn't know was possible because now every time I see her and I get the blank stare of a stranger it's everything I can do to bite back tears and wonder what the hell went wrong

Beginning of Junior year the high school I was in kicked me out. They found out I was depressed and instead of helping me chose to pin a suicidal and homicidal threat level on me and have me suspended. We had to get a lawyer involved to get and get it off my school record. I never had intentions of hurting myself or anyone. Was just severly depressed and the school curriculum was boring so there was really nothing keeping me there. The only reason I bring that up was because the friends I had there I didn't have anymore after I left cept one who loves me no matter how much I screw up. It hurt alot. Made the depression even worse. On top of that, right before all that happened I had broken up with a girl I loved very very much and was getting over that aswell. 

Come senior year the only school that'll take me because of the stuff on my record is an online school. So I'm in an online school with no way of making any friends other than online ones. I feel like I'm on an island with a phone but no way of calling for help. Just being able to talk to people or play games with them. On top of that. The only other relationship I've ever had idk if is even still a thing. Because the girl I was with I haven't seen in a year now. 

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm just complaining. But I turn 18 in October and I don't feel like I'm ready to be an adult. I spend many nights crying or just imaging I have a gf because its the only way I'm able to sleep. I guess what I'm trying to ask is what should I do...

I knew I was great and I could do anything. So I was just ""living in the moment"" and letting the Domino's fall as it would. Met this amazing half German half French Beauty who was also extremely intelligent and fell in ""love"" we travelled the world together and did movie scenes in real life. Birthdays in Paris, Big family reunions in Munich. I was living in a perfect world. Least at that exact moment where I thought I was happy in a beach in Indonesia. It Hit me. The person that thought ""I am great, I can do anything, I am invincible"" has achieved slim to none in 3 years. I was just a guy with a ego bigger than my body could contain.
I had  graduated as a Physio and haven't worked a day in the field. I was doing a part time gig at a grocer and using all the money to spend on everything unnecessary and being hype with fake friends.
 In about 1 minute of clarity and reflection, my world collapsed and I had my first anxiety attack on this earth.
Shit couldn't be worse at this stage,im thinking all this while sitting on a beach in Indonesia next to this amazing girl I'm in a relationship with. I couldnt be more unhappier. 
So we got drunk that night obviously to drink our sorrows away and I ended up drunk driving a scooter 60mph at 2am with my girl on the back. In a split second, I woke up again in the emergency ward in a 3rd world country with Fractured bones, dislocated elbow , bloody face and a Smashed scooter with over 2000usd in hospital fees.

I was no longer great and invincible, I was crippled and broke.
This day turned a switch that I could never turn off.
I went back home after 3 weeks of being crippled in indo. I started to work on my purpose, I have been doing everything I can to achieve it and its been 3 years since I started chasing my purpose. This purpose of mine required major sacrifices which included all my  friends, my social life, my luxuries I couldn't afford, my clothes and jewelry. My time was only spent on this on this aim and I have sacrificed everything for the last 3 years to be where Im at today. Which isn't anywhere near where I want to be however I now again, believe in myself.

As I'm writing this, I have no one to talk to, i have no nice clothes, I eat out every once a month and it has to be under 10$
I sold my clothes, shoes and my jewelry. I work 3 jobs and because of my obsession over my purpose my girlfriend left me as well. I am now completely and utterly alone and am not even a fraction of who I used to be. I haven't called a person to ""chat"" in about an year. Im going through extreme sadness these days (I try to avoid saying I'm depressed, honestly I dont know if I am) I'm constantly stressed and I have no happiness besides thinking about what the grind will result in and that isn't enough at this point. While going through all these emotions I am trying to figure out who I am and why I am the way I am (consciousness and ptsd from father) 

On a positive note
I have read a book a week for 3 years(tried) , I have read over 110 books in the last 3 years and learned 4 languages and working every single day. After rent and food all the extra cash goes straight into my investments in stocks and shares plus other investments which I have on the side. The only thing i haven't given up is my training. I have been training to keep my mind sane and to relieve some stress.

Not sure exactly why I wrote this but just thought I'd let someone know what I've been through in the last few years and see if there's anyone that can relate to my story and maybe make a friend in the midst of this agonizing journey.

I’m currently lying in bed right now crying silently in my room that I share with my two other sisters. This is the first time I’ve emotionally cried in years and it was brought on by the dumbest thing. I was watching the hunchback of Norte dame and related to Quasimodo. I’m a female (17) extremely overweight and my family constantly refers to me as hunchback. I have extremely thick skin and the things people say never bother me but when Quasimodo began to sing about being too ugly for anyone to love it shook me to the core. I began to realize how low I think of myself and how truly alone I am. I’m fucking ugly and I accept that but it does kind of hurt when I see couples or people be affectionate towards each other because I’ve never had anything even remotely close to that. I’ve never had a boyfriend or someone call me pretty and normally I’m okay with that but being a junior in high school having to pretend I’m asexual so people don’t feel bad that nobody has a crush on has just really weighed down my spirit and I have just realized this. It’s like this deep pit in my stomach that I never realized was there. I’m been perfectly fine with being alone because I have always told my self that people fatter than me have boyfriends or people “uglier” then me can get a boyfriend and that I would eventually get one in high school but so far no one has even spoken to me. I don’t even have regular friends I speak to absolutely no one in school and it really just hurts. I try to make friends but nobody wants to talk to me. When we have groups in class I speak to my group and am nice I think I’m saying the right things because we’re smiling and laughing and they always say “you’re so quiet all the time but you’re lowkey funny” this really gets my hopes up and I think that we can at least be in class friends but by the end of the week they stop talking to me completely. Idk where  this post is really supposed to go so ig I’ll stop it here.

2185,hamartiated,1583811195,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

2189,mcginlm72,1583808973,1,I emigrated from Scotland to Australia 14 years ago.  I came as my ex convinced me as I was pregnant to move.  Over the years I've tried to make friendships but being stuck at home either pregnant ( I've had 3 kids whilst here) or looking after my kids I never had time and none of my acquaintances seemed to want to hang out of our home.   My ex was controlling and abusive which also stopped me from having a life and making friends.  I'm now 47 stuck in this country as my ex won't give permission for me to take kids out of the country.  And I'm so lonely.   I head cancer two years ago I'm in remission but I'm still facing side effects and I've put on so much weight I'm embarrassed at myself.   I spend most of my days alone at home.   I find myself dreading situations where I have to speak to people.  If someone knocks on my door I won't answer even if it's just the delivery guy.  I want friends but I know I'm a crap friend and just can't face the effort it takes but I don't want my life to be like this much longer.  I feel I'm just wasting my days.

WHY DOES NOBODY TAKE AN INTEREST IN ME LIKE I DO IN OTHER PEOPLE? ALL I DO IS INQUIRE, INQUIRE, INQUIRE, AND IF I DON'T DO ONLY THAT, THE CONVERSATION FALLS FLAT AND THEY DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO TALK TO WITH ME.

And then, when somebody DOES try talking to me, I've already been turned off from people in general from others who forget I exist or don't talk to me for being so clingy that I'm incapable of liking anybody who doesn't fit my perfect image for what a friend should be like.

I fucking hate people. I'm tired of trying. I recently cut off everyone who talked to me out of boredom or necessity, and I just realized that literally nobody wants to interact with me outside the context of memes. 

I SEARCH, AND SEARCH, AND SEARCH, AND ALL I FIND ARE VAPID ASSHOLES WITH NOTHING INTERESTING OR IMPORTANT TO SAY, AND THINK ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SETTLE FOR THE STATUS-QUO IS A ""WEIRDO"".

And now, I'm completely broken. I literally can't like anybody. Every time I chat with someone, I have a bunch of unrealistic expectations for them, and when they eventually fail to surpass them, I get bored and stop really caring- not as if that affects my habits when texting the people in question, because most of the time, if I do offer a criticization of their character, they're so volatile and sensetive that it ends up in them not wanting to speak to me, and I've learned how to try until there's no will left in their hearts to bother with me.",lonely,I'M TIRED OF TRYING TO TALK PEOPLE.,2020-03-10 13:23:05

2 of my friends have cars but that just means an extra 20 or 30 minutes to get me isn't worth it for them(even though there are other friends that live further that they always pickup). 

I never ask them to pick me up or drop me off and still take the bus home on my own. I know its an inconvenience for me but if they cared about me and wanted my company wouldn't they inconvenience themselves that little amount for me? am I overreacting? is this just anxiety?

For quite a long while now I have been extremely lonely. So lonely to the point where it is seems to be affecting my ability to function like a normal competent human being sometimes. The very ability to maintain social connections like a member of the homo sapien species should be able to perform completely straight out the window. And this, of course, led to me making a decision that literally made me fucking wish time itself was deterministic just so I wouldn't be able to blame myself because it would've happened anyway. Worst part? This story is the one of the few instances (which to a lonely loser of course translates to a shit ton) that I fucked up a social bond I shouldn't have...

A few months ago I met a girl who happened to live in the same building and is the same nationality as me. Now my desperate ass of course decided to cling to her emotionally even though we barely interacted. My brain decided to let my instinct as a social organism go completely nuts and made me see her as my long-awaited opportunity to finally escape this loneliness that I trapped myself in by being a socially incompetent fucktard. It made me see something between us that wasn't there to begin with. Right after our first brief encounter I managed to find her social media by looking into a facebook group dedicated to people of our nationality studying in this particular city. It wasn't hard so I wouldn't call it stalking. Anyhow, this was during New Year so both of us were gonna return to our home country and stay for a few weeks. During this time we texted (of course I was always the one to engage the conversation) like friends. Nothing wrong yet. However, when we both came back for study, little that I know I was gonna fuck it up so hard I literally want to fucking die.

We met briefly once because I had asked her to help me with my work a bit. Basically it led to a chat. An engaging one too, I might add. We had a good amount of laughs. In short, it seemed that we would get along quite well. However, all this did was fuel my imaginary connection with her even more.

The next day I asked her to come to my room to play a few games with me. She came. We had fun. We got to know each other more. Everything was going REALLY nicely until...well, I fucking asked her to be my girlfriend on our second fucking meeting. Now, you're probably thinking this guy is the biggest fucking idiot in the world! Well yes, I agree. For months now I have cursed that moment too. I have yet to be able to grasp upon how did my mind manage to rationalise that decision and think that that was a good fucking idea? My desperate instinct as a social animal was going so wild to the point where it somehow led to the neurons in my brain firing and brain chemicals acting in such a pattern that allowed me to interpret that decision as a reasonable one. How? HOW? Like seriously, how did I let myself do that?! How the fuck was I able to rationalise asking a girl to be my girlfriend after only having interacted with her for a few hours at best?

The aftermath? Well, it's been 2 months now since that happened. We still texted, although she didn't really want to meet me in person anymore. The fact that she had a lot of work (this is confirmable since she's been talking about it since our very first encounter) didn't help either because she wouldn't be able to easily make time for me to begin with. My loneliness of course worsened over time. Now, I happen to have OCD, meaning that I am taking medication which is also taken by people with depression. Honestly, my loneliness has gotten so bad to the point where I'm starting to actually feel lucky that I have OCD because it at least made me have access to the medication which in turn helps to biologically and chemically defend my brain making it less likely for me to eventually develop depression. I've gotten so low to the point where I'm starting to appreciate a detrimental mental disorder only because it indirectly allows me to defend myself biologically to another through medication. On the bright side, my OCD has improved significantly, although now the elephant in the room seems to be my severe loneliness which may very well lead to something worse, something which I am in fact starting to notice the development of.

My motivation has dropped a lot. I feel weak and generally unwilling to get shit done. There's now this gloomy feeling that follows me everywhere I go. Intrusive thoughts have come back. I've started questioning my self-worth and my point to continue existing on this planet. Oh, by the way, I told her of my mental illness yesterday on the hopes that she may come to interact with me out of pity. She doesn't want to. No hard feelings on her though. I understand that she has enough shits to deal with as it is and that it is completely within her rights to say no. This of course made me feel even worse. Why do you think I'm writing this now when it's fucking midnight where I live? I generally don't sleep late but I just have to fucking vent it out now. I couldn't take it anymore which is why I revealed to her my mental illness, which in turn led to the creation of this reddit post into this subreddit where I think people will understand. Big fan of this subreddit by the way.

Conclusion time, I suppose? Well, fuck my life. There you go. Straight to the point. Now, you guys may think that things aren't even as bad as I make it out to be. Well, maybe. However, a distressed brain lies hard and is hellbent on making you feel shit. Whether it's objectively bad or not doesn't really matter now as I personally cannot take it anymore, hence the vent. For those of you who made it this far, thank you, even to those who may think my reasons to be this stressed out is pathetic. I hope I didn't take away too much of your time. You may suggest things that you think I should keep in mind down below. A sad mind often struggles to be rational, so Imma need somebody else to do that for me.

 ""Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible""

I just started talking to yet another redditor and as her and I voice chatted on discord I made her laugh a lot and she seemed to be having a good time but I’m not sure what happened, I tried reaching out to her a day later and haven’t heard back from her, we traded pics as well and I’m just not a lot of people’s type I think. She didn’t have the best reaction, just said “aw you look sweet”. This has happened so many times, it really hurts. I feel I never even get a shot. I’m so tired. 

The worst part is now I believe I am worthless, every person that has left me is doing better than me, financially well off, they have partners and friends. I’m just a fucking loser at this point and want to die. Idk anymore. When someone asks me what’s wrong and I’m real with them, they literally don’t care and don’t relate.

His responses were pretty good, they were long and quick, but when i stopped messaging him, he didnt bother messaging me. So i assume he isn't interested.
I asked a friend why I was so stuck up on him, and they told me, maybe it was because he took me out, and made me feel like a human being with someone that actually cared about them. And I realized, I missed him for mainly that reason.
I generally am a very sexual person, but ever since we ""broke up"" I havent been into it that, that much. Now I seek that emotional bond rather than the sexual one. And it's made me think alot.

2219,Lola2224,1583789391,1,"Hi!

So i don’t know if anyone has been in a situation like this or am i a unique case. I feel so angry, lonely and devastated about my situation and wanted to vent.

So the thing is: i’m a 27 year old female who never had a boyfriend in her life and neither do i have any friends. In school i was the typical nerdy and shy girl nobody liked. I was bullied all throughout elementary and high school which considerably reduced my very shaky self-esteem. I attended a lot of different schools over the years (because of my family moving) and in every place i went i was constantly bullied. Because of that and the fact i was very shy and had no self-confidence i could never establish a friendship with anyone. I never got along with other girls my age probably because i’m very different from other girls (i was never interested in shopping, makeup or gossip like others). I was alone all throughout school. I was never asked out by any boys (it doesn’t help that i’m extremely ugly) and obviously because of my extremely shy nature it was impossible for me to ask out boys. So i was left without a boyfriend.

I always heard that University will be diferent. Well it wasn’t. Though it’s true i wasn’t bullied anymore but i wasn’t noticed either. The first couple of years i tried to participate in some programs (mainly language programs) but somehow i couldn’t establish solid friendships. There was only two girls i occasionally chatted with but i wouldn’t call it friendship (we are friends on Facebook if that counts). I was busy studying and working and wasn’t really thinking about relationships until the last two years when i realized i needed to do something about it. But i didn’t know what. I hate going to night clubs or bars so that was out of question and i simply couldn’t establish a relationship otherwise because if i went somewhere nobody would talk to me or notice me. I went to a psychologist in the hopes of getting help. I attented sessions for almost a year but it didn’t seem to help in the long run. While i attented it was good to have someone to talk to but now University is over and i’m still not making any progress. I’m without a boyfriend and have no idea how to get one. The two „semi-friends” i used to have now live in different cities and we only speak to each other once in a while on the Internet. I have nobody in my life.

I have grown to feel very disappointed in humanity and also angry. While it’s true that i have low self-esteem but there is a part of me that says „you deserve better! You deserve to have a partner and at least a friend because you are not a bad person”. The thing is no matter what i do i don’t seem to get it. I tried going to events and nothing.

I also hate the idea that i would probably have to change myself entirely for people to like me. I have never used makeup which may be part of the problem (someone told me boys will never notice me until i start wearing it) and i’d have to be loud and chatty and i don’t know how to be that way. A part of me is heavily against changing because i think „why can’t people accept me the way i am? Why do i have to change for people to like me?” I also hate the double standards, like when people say „women have it easier, they can always find a partner if they try”. Well that’s not true at all and i’m the best example of that. Nobody wanted to be with me in 27 years. I don’t consider myself a bad person just extremely shy and ugly. Those are my only „crimes”. I have been told several times how ugly and worthless i am so it’s not me making it up. It’s a fact. Is it possible to find someone like that or do i have to reconcile myself to a lifetime of loneliness?

I know my story seems unbelievable but sadly it’s true. I don’t even know what response i’m expecting. Guess i just needed to vent about it and see if someone else has heard of a situation like this or am i the most useless/unlucky person on Earth.",lonely,Thoughts on my situation?

The first time I noticed it was when I asked if she'd buy a game (£10) so we could get back into gaming but she declined saying that she was saving up to move out her parents' house. Fair enough that's a valid reason then a week later she messaged me photos of outfits (Over £100) asking me which one she should buy for a wedding she'd been invited to. Surely if you can't afford £10 to keep in touch with your friend then you definitely can't afford £100 on clothes you'll wear once when you have plenty of outfits that are suitable for a wedding night do?

Then she was always messaging about her boyfriend and the relationship issues they were having, but never once asking me how my relationship with my boyfriend was or how my life was going. Always her with her boyfriend/family/work e.t.c.

Then to top it off I got her a Xmas present and dropped it off. She claimed she was going to mail me both my Christmas and Birthday (December) present to Uni accommodation as it hadn't arrived. Okay, that's fine can't blame her for delivery issues. Only now it's March and her birthday today, I sent her a birthday card early that got there on time whilst I'm still waiting for my supposed presents. I know it's not about giving to receive but I'd rather not be told ""I keep forgetting to post it"" ""What's your address again?"" if there are no intentions of sending me anything.

It's made me feel really lonely 

Then I joined a discord what two days ago if that? Told them I had a driving lesson and two people said well done and one said they were proud with what I achieved.

I feel like nobody at college takes me seriously, it’s been such a bumpy ride and it doesn’t feel like I belong with any of the friend groups I should, and I only have two months left to get out there and have fun like I think I want.(I know that sounds dumb. I can probably do pretty much the same shit throughout my twenties right but I dunno it feels bad like I need to do it now.) it hurts that I’ve never been with a girl or anything even when I tell myself it doesn’t matter and that there’s no timeline on that shit, and I haven’t really wanted to until recently.

I have people who are around me on a day to day basis, that I can talk casually with, about stuff that’s relevant to the conversation. But, even with this company, I honestly don’t feel like anyone is really there for me to share things I’m genuinely happy to talk about with.
Ever since I had to end my last relationship (she ended up cheating on me), that feeling of having someone there you can just talk with about just almost anything with and be able to not hold your feelings of excitement or enthusiasm back, just seemed to fade away the longer I stay single.
Usually how it ends up, is pretty much everyone around me is on completely different pages, in terms of interests, and not any of them are (i guess you could say passionate/enthusiastic?) about thing’s that I find fascinating or whatnot.
Like, I make videos on Youtube as a hobby because it makes me happy to bring entertainment to other people and just be recognized for something I put together.
But 90% of the time, when I ask about what they think of the videos or whatever, I’m usually met with the “Yeah, it was pretty funny/good.”
That’s it.

2257,KingLeopold7,1583741922,1,"I just feel like I need to tell someone about this and my friends don’t seem to care anymore.

Anyway, Hi, it’s me. I’m almost 15 now and a guy and since around the end of year 7 I had a crush on this girl (I’m year 10 now). She’s awesome and I don’t know y I still like her. The feelings went and came as waves do. Sometimes I wouldn’t somethings I would.

At the end of Year 8 I was with a different girl and I was so happy. I can’t describe that feeling anymore. We broke up because she was having second thoughts about everything. She ended it by saying that I’ll find somebody that’ll be perfect for me. It broke me. The after affects are still around even now.

And for the entirety of Year 9 is was in a slump. I was ‘semi-depressed’ and my friends tried to help but it never worked cause I would always slip back into it eventually. No I’m not depressed. I’ve been told by a friend who was depressed that I’m not so I’m not.

Then year 10 comes around. My two besties are dating and they ask me to help them sneak away so they can make out. I do cause I like to help my friends with there problems and not solve my own. Her mum doesn’t know about the relationship and I was on lookout duty. Her mum came and I, with no other options walked in on them making out. The image is ingrained in my head forever.

Why is it ingrained in my head? Because I’m extremely jealous of any relationship I see. Any. That girl I mentioned at the start, I did in year 8 have the guts to DM her and ask if she liked me. She didn’t. Surprise surprise. And here I am still liking her, thinking about her every night, not sleeping, on an almost all time low and ranting on reddit.

I guess I thought someone on here would reply to this and say it’s ok. It’s normal. Because I don’t think it is. Thank you for reading and let me tell you something.

2261,gilette_bayonete,1583737270,1,"I apologize if this is kinda long. It's just been an interesting encounter for me to say the least. 

So there's a very attractive girl at my work. Gets hit on constantly, always being approached, all the guys chase after her. I always got the impression she was sick and tired of being fucked with at work so I kept a distance. We exchanged a couple of smiles while passing but no introduction or anything. My job requires me to wear a uniform and move constantly through the building. It's pretty random if and when I'll see her.

About a month ago I sat next to her during my lunch. Still didn't introduce myself but slowly began talking. Nothing too serious or intense but laid back. Felt pretty average. It was brief but I got positive vibes for sure.

So the other night I see her sitting alone again. This time it's in the dining area. Customers and employees share it, you've got people everywhere, sometimes children so it's pretty packed. I thought the first time went well enough so why not sit with her again? I take a seat and start eating some fruit I'd gotten. We talk for a few minutes, I finally introduce myself, she tells me her name, etc. And her dad shows up lol. 

Really cool guy. I introduced myself to him and he did the same. Firm handshake and eye contact. It felt comfortable because I didn't feel that I was impeding so I stayed and chatted a few minutes. She seemed a bit quiet compared to usual which I can understand completely but she did laugh and make jokes with her dad. I thought it was so sweet. He seemed to have liked me a lot. 

Finally after a few minutes I told them both goodbye and kept it moving back to work. It had been the first time she'd ever seen me in my nice clothes without a hat. It was like she got a ""better"" look at me both visually and intellectually. But I really couldn't tell how she felt because of the unexpected turn of her dad showing up. I obviously didn't ask her out either. 

So a couple of days have passed and she actually needed something work related. A coworker of mine basically passed me the buck because she needed a food container. We looked at each other a second and I smiled slowly. She told me what she needed but it felt like way more of an explanation than necessary. Not that I minded, lol. I wasn't able to find what she needed on time  (we were out) so I saw her in line holding something else. Shit. Bad hit. 

I've seen her a couple of times since then and it's like her ears perk up. I felt kinda bad that we didn't have the right container that she needed so I sort of tried to shuffle past her when her back was turned. She turned her head and quickly in my direction and we looked at each other. Felt like thunder in my chest, lol. 

So now I don't know what's next or what she's thinking. She seems to be appearing more often since I met her dad. 

I'm very lonely but this has been good ""exercise"" for me. I would suggest putting yourself out there and just seeing what happens instead of staying in one place.

2264,buck_b4time,1583735558,1,"I’m  and in my senior year of high school. I have friends, but it seems as if all of them are disconnecting from me. Every time I pass them in the halls they wouldn’t acknowledge me at all. They’re just there. When it’s time to partner up I’m always the one left out. I would feel embarrassed and I would ask why is this happening to me? There were certain groups and clics that they were a part of. I was always the oddball, standing around by myself. I never understood why I was outcasted by them. I work out and was athletic(Basically into every sport). I’m into cars(I own and drive a Mercedes-Benz SLK). I always minded to look presentable(I would know how to dress and wear something fashionable). I’m into gaming(PC preferably but console is cool too). Regardless of having these interests im always casted out still. I sit alone at lunch watching my old friends eat and talk with each other. I would sometimes sneak out into the parking lot to eat in my car to save myself from others seeing how much of a loner I was. I always wanted to be part of something and most of all I wanted someone to talk to and I couldn’t. All these years I never had anyone to talked to on a consistent basis. I would see everyone around me interact with others and seeming happy with laughter and smiles. Everyone I knew either cut me off in some way or is just there. Sometimes I cry myself to sleep thinking about how lonely I had became and how I will never be able to know the feeling of having a close relationship. 
    There would be times where I would ask my “friends” if they wanted to go eat or hang out  and that I was willing to pay for them every time to have company and not feel lonely. They never pay me back and I convinced myself that they were paying me back by them spending time with me. There was a place where I worked that had a co-worker of mine who was also going through the same loneliness as me. We would talk to each other about what we went through and how we felt. We understood each other and I felt we were becoming very close. I thought at the time that I finally found a friend who I could talk to and relate with. A week later he quit the job. A week after that, he committed suicide. I was broken. I quit my job. I didn’t know what to do. I grew extremely depressed. A week later I would return to school normally, there were people asking why he would do such a thing? It’s sad that I was the only one who really knew why. One day I decided to take my mother’s sedan instead of my convertible to school. On the way home, it was raining with sleet the roads therefore were extremely slippery. I was approaching a blind curve which I expected( I’ve taken this road many times before) then a deer ran in front of my vehicle and instead of hitting it as I should have I swerved the car. I counter steered to control the back end of the car but the tires had no grip and the vehicle flew off the road towards the left oncoming traffic side, went airborne and flipped twice smashing into the ground into the ditch. The vehicle landed upright and airbags deployed. The body frame of the sedan saved my life. I walked away with a minor head injury. My mom and dad, very angry, but glad that I was alive. I was too, knowing that if I had taken my convertible I would more than likely not be writing this post. A week later I returned to school, I didn’t care if anyone was worried about me or not, I wasn’t asking or looking for sympathy. However a few people who I knew asked if I was okay. I was more worried about the car which I now owe my mom, the citation which I must attend court or pay and the increase in insurance payments. I was now unemployed with little to no money. Along with many people commenting on the incident that I was a stupid and terrible driver and that I should have hit the deer. It didn’t make my situation feel better but I fully understand why they would they tell me that and I accepted that fact. 
    Along with my growing loneliness and depression I now am in growing debt. I feel I have become so much more of a burden for my parents after what I have done. I’m at a point where I truly feel alone. I feel everyday is a bad place and bad time for me. And it’s  getting worse and worse.

Now I only have one friend, my best friend. Though I'm not sure if even that's going to last. Mostly because I'm just no good for them and they have better things to do than hang out with me. They have a life and soon there won't be any room for me. People move on, they find someone else and it's easy to replace old connections like me.
I was never any good at making connections with people. Even my love life has been an utter failure and has gone no where since middle school. Never had a girlfriend and the only girl that ever showed interest in me was for the wrong reasons. No girl ever seems interested in me when I try to talk to them. Most of the time I'm just trying to talk since I know there's no point in trying to to pursue something more. I guess I'm just not worth their time and I'm only nuisance.
For awhile I've been thinking that perhaps I'm just meant to be alone. That there's no hope for me and there's no point in trying anymore. All trying has ever done for me is cause disappointment and pain. My best friend says I'm only 23 and I got more time ahead of me. But I'm not strong, brave or anything like them. I've tried and tried again for years, and it hasn't got me anywhere. All I am is lonely and miserable.
Maybe it's time to just let go and realize what I want, I can't have. It's not fair, but life isn't fair. Life is selective and plays in favor for the strongest. I'm not the strongest. I'm weak. I'm so weak I can't even end my own life. Twice I've tried, but I can't bring myself to end it. I don't know if it's a part of me that doesn't want to give up. Or if it's because I'm afraid to go alone. I just want the suffering to end. Being surrounded by people who are happy and in love just makes me feel out of place.

She said it was for the best and I understand that and think so too. We are still friends but don’t see each other much at all anymore so that we can make space so that we can eventually hangout more as just friends but she was my person. I have other friends but I barely ever get to see any of them and it’s not like a group of them, they are all separate. She was my best friend and claims we still are best friends but I just don’t feel it anymore.

2.) I really rely and focus to much on minimal shit like numbers.

I don’t try to be unique, I just try to be myself and feel comfortable in my own skin. I dress differently than most, but not in the way I bet you’re thinking. I’m a 22 year old dude, I wear cowboy boots, and I tuck in my shirt. I also listen to pretty much only music from the 90’s and before (50’s through 70’s are my domain). I also tend to get a bit of compliments for my looks, but I think therein lies the problem. I’m *too* unique to where I’ve become a spectacle. My whole story starts and stops with my appearance. I’m just a character to people, and it seems like no one wants to dig deeper into who I am. Being unique is incredibly lonely because I still have yet to find someone who is like me. 

I have some “friends” but I have nothing in common with them. And frankly I don’t care all that much for them, so I guess I wouldn’t really call them my friends, so I guess that means I have no friends.

My ex never look at me any deeper than the surface level, and for a year and a half I never noticed. I never met her parents and she told me it was because they didn’t like white people, but I realized it was because she was embarrassed of me.

All I have to cope is gaming and cheering people up. I've been doing that so I can at least stay sane. I haven't been home alone this whole time. People have stopped by.

And then that said family had to leave, I realized how much I missed human connection. They offered to take me with them. I would have been delighted to go.

I look like a fucking mess all the time. I never feel any motivation to work out or do anything, really, and I always wear baggy clothes because of how self conscious I am of myself.

I’m pretty sure my friends either don’t care about me or don’t like me. Honestly though, what did I expect? I never spend that much time with them because of how “busy” I am, I only really text them for schoolwork because I’m scared to initiate conversation for fear I’ll say something wrong, and I isolate myself so, so much. Also, any time I scrounge up some courage to talk to them on our group chat, they just ignore what I say and continue on with whatever conversation they were currently having.

The worst part of all this is that it’s all my fucking fault. There’s nothing and no one else to blame. I have created my own problems, dug my self a grave to deep to get out of. I chose to isolate myself. I chose to not do my work. And I’m never going to break this cycle of hopelessness, of mental and emotional torture. I just know it. This isn’t the first time this has happened, and I’m fucking sure it won’t be the last. I’ll allow myself to fall into deeper slumps, never enjoying anything. I’m just a waste of potential.

On Feb 19, 2020, overwhelmed with emptiness, loneliness, and no one to connect with about it, I attempted to hang myself. I won’t detail the plan because I don’t want to give anyone ideas. I called my mother who lives on the east coast and said goodbye. Hugged my pets one last time. There was a gentle tap on my living room window. It was the LAPD. Mom has called them immediately and had they arrived a minute or two later, I likely wouldn’t be typing this post. They were friendly and talked with me until a social work arrived. They then drove me to a crisis center where I met with a psychiatrist, who instituted the 5150 and started my 72 hold. After a night at the crisis center, I was transported via strapped to a gurney in ambulance, to a “bed” that had become available at Cedars-Sinai, where I spent my last two days of the hold. No phone. No internet. Limited TV. No outside. Just me, my thoughts and a floor full of people who seemed much worse off than me. But where they? Sure, I wasn’t hearing voices or having multiple-personalities, but are we not equal? Perhaps just battling a different illness with different side-effects? 

This experience profoundly changed me. know for sure that I do not want to die. I’m still lonely. I’m still crying daily, but I don’t know. Something just feels more optimistic. I know I don’t want to die. But I am not sure if I want to live. I find myself in this gray area of not wanting suicide or self-harm, but unsure of if I want go to on alone, while simultaneously knowing that I will indeed go on. It still hurts. Saying “goodbye” to your mother is deep. But now I can still say “hello” to her, and that means more than anything. 

Loneliness is very painful. There is no emotional or physical pain that hurts more. I still experience it quite frequently. Now I think about it from a different point of view. The why. Why does it hurt? Because I just want to love and be loved. Why do I want to love and be loved? Because I’m human. Some people spend 25 years wrongfully imprisoned for a crime they didn’t commit. Others spend a lifetime battling addiction. Some are enslaved or force to live in garbage and filth all of their lives, living off of pennies per day. I’m seeking and offering love. We are seeking and offering love. It hurts, and like those experiencing the circumstances I just mentioned, some of us may never get away from the hurt and suffering, but the world needs people who care, even if the world doesn’t seem to care about them.

To start off I am a 16 year old high schooler. I am a sophomore and am waiting for a reply for a boarding school (Phillips Exeter Academy). For the past 3 years I have never seen happiness, believe me this is no bullshit. I have not experienced human happiness in over three years, I have experienced a small form of happiness (Good grades), but they tended to be temporary. 

Let me tell you my story.
It all started in the fall of 2018. I became a freshmen at my new school and was happy, because I got into the best school in my country.  I felt excited and passionate. I made many new friends and felt as if my social life was gaining some traction, for I felt alone through the valley of the shadow of death. The friends I made were cool, they appreciated my strive for knowledge and my characteristics. However I wasn’t able to see them very often, due to the fact that I was am and will continue to be focused on schoolwork. One day in the middle of September I met this girl. She seemed to be interested in the same things I was interested in, she was also passionate about schoolwork, philosophy and the debate club. The more I saw her the more I realized how many common interests we had. In about 1 week I was hoping to see her greet me everyday. Just seeing her made me forget all the problems I had, even though this effect lasted for a few seconds. She didn’t have a particularly good appearance, but to me she was beautiful (Super Beautiful). At the end of September I decided to go to a Halloween party organized by a close friend of mine, the party was ok (We had alcohol), but since I was an arrogant kid I decided to go to the party a bit late (To show my arrogant attitude). The next thing I knew she was talking to the brother of my close friend, I decided not to interrupt their conversation, because that would have been a dick move, but sadly I made a grave mistake. They became close friends. They weren’t as close as I was with her, but they were close. I talked to her a lot over Instagram/Messenger (Still continues to be popular in my country for some unknown reason).  I enjoyed texting her and we often called each other late at night to talk about life.

Ill get to the lonely part, but first some background.I didn't choose him, I live in a house for people who are getting out of prison. But this dude has been out of prison for like 9 years, has no probation, and is still fucking here. I wondered why for about two seconds, but then it dawned on me that NOBODY EVER wants this guy around. He's the worst. He lives off the state, and has no aspirations to do anything to improve his life. He is so lonely that when I come home from work, he runs outside and says HI with a sickening desperation. The same thing goes for when his phone rings, he pounces on it like a starving lion does a gazelle. Then he finds out it's like an automated message from his pharmacy, because nobody calls him. He reminds me of gollum physically, and he has no social skills at all. He just floats around somehow unaware of the fact that people have bubbles that you dont hover in or around. He's been choked out by other roommates, because he thinks that this is his fucking house and he gets attitude about dumb ass shit like watching tv when he wants to. My room is next to his and at night he leaves his radio on and it annoys the shit out of me. I get up at 4am 5 days a week to work 10 to 12 hours a day. So I told him that if he didn't turn that shit off at 9pm then I would smash it. What does he do? Calls the police on me and tells them that I threatened his life. The police didn't even care about him because I take it from what they said he calls them all the fucking time for reasons that waste their time. When my girlfriend came over to pick me up, he gets ultra weird. He just has to be right there at all times, to the point where she had to tell him he's creeping her out. She doesn't come over anymore. He's a fucking helpless parasite, and the point I'm getting at is that he put himself in this position. He checkmated himself with loneliness long ago. If you dont want to end up being  like this then I suggest you maintain a job, be good to your family, know social boundaries, and leave people the fuck alone if they dont like you. The most pathetic human being on earth. I'm so thankful that I'm not like this. This is the end result to loneliness, and its disturbing.

Of course I had to be one of the people who can’t see the logic of doing it, who is too nice to burden the people who know me of living with it afterwards.
There’s a party going on next door and it’s 1am, pretty fun sounding and suddenly it hits me that I haven’t been to a party since I was 14. It’s not that there wasn’t any happening but I just never got asked.

It’s day 274 since I have felt happy, I can pin it down to the hour. I got diagnosed with diabetes just about two weeks after my birthday and funnily enough I got what I wished for, a moment of happiness.

The five days I was in hospital for were both a blessing and a curse because I enjoyed the cute nurse waking me up during the night and jabbing me and I loved how the day nurse was worried about me ending back in there.

of course it was just a tease, it kept me content for awhile but I soon realised I missed it which is weird because I’d been fine for so many years but not now. New meds and a new attempt at making life work but this missing feeling is always there.
I used to be able to look back on moments where I felt the warm energising rush but I can’t anymore, I just forgot it somehow despite it being the sole reason I push onwards so I can hope to have it again.

Tried going out and doing activities didn't work as people made fun of me for doing things by myself

I found one persons profile with lots of mental health videos and pictures on it so I thought they look like they care spreading awareness ect so I sent a message like this crying my heart out saying what was bothering me for the first time but it turns out they was only doing the mental health stuff for attention to get likes and followers

After each failed attempt I got worse and worse each night I had a different thought of ending my life having a blade at my wrist, belt around my neck, going out waiting for a fast passing car or bus but I could never go through with it I don't now why maybe it's because I'm a coward

All I wanted was just at least one friend who actually cares and have fun with who will smile when I message them who wakes up in the morning and can't wait to message me and for me to do the same who puts effort into their messages with things I can reply back with

Someone who remembers my birthday rather than saying ""it's your birthday I forgot haha we will do something next week"" then they forget about it leaving me to think about myself in the dark

All I think now is it's just humans it's the way they are if that's the case I don't think I fit in with this place

 I have almost everything most guys would want, and most girls are looking for in a man. Even can cook. I just have not for the life of me found a girl I can connect to. I'm looking, i keep my eyes open, have small conversations with people, keep up appearances, but fuck it's hard to find someone who shows interest too.
Then this week happens.  I have a tutor for a class, my school provides. My classmate is part of the session, just us two, and we honestly rarely talk because what can you say really. It's just an hour and your done. I joke a bit with her after class but that's all.  I came a half hour early this week, and she was there and we started talking. Small talk but it went good. After the hour I went to for tutoring for another class. When that ended I came to see her still there for the first tutor session. We grabbed an empty classroom to study together afterwards because why not. But we didn't study. We talked. For like almost 3 hours. Even the way back home we talked for another hour. God damn but we clicked. It felt so  damn good. I came home feeling so conflicted. Shes so amazing her personality is great and she was the first one in years who ignored her phone to just give me her full attention. She cought me off guard.  But physically she's so different than what I hoped for. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful, even before this I knew she looked good. I'm just really tall, like 6'6, but she's a foot and a half shorter. I've always hoped for a taller woman, what am I supposed to do with that? I went to bed smiling that at least I felt a connection in fucking years. 2 days later we have class and we talk again the way home. Another hour. She seemed so interested in me, my fucking heart carved out of ice melted, its the only way I can describe it. When she touched my arm to get my attention for a story she wanted to say, I almost lost control of myself. She was shocked I said I have a boring lonely life because I almost never go outside to hang out because of raising my brother( dad's out the picture and mom works 2 jobs) and studying. (My only social life is studying with a boring classmate who is an acquaintance at best.) She says I seem so amazing and people are crazy to not see it. We even talked about hanging out again after the tutoring sessions. But I'm fucking paranoid man. I've had similar happpen before and it turned out she wasnt interested. I felt like crap last time. But this one is ten times more intense of a connection. I am so desperate to spend more time with her that it's all I can think about. It's all I want. Even if it doesn't work out, I need that feeling. I can't talk to anyone and I'm going crazy but she was there for me. She encouraged me even. I hate myself for it, makes me feel weak but I just can't take it anymore. How much longer do I need to go though this. There's no end. Even if wanted to, I don't know how to go about it. I'm afraid to scare her away, I'm afraid to hurt her feelings if it doesn't work out. I'm so damn annoyed that I have even a sliver of hope out of a lonely life. It was so much easier before I met her. I was happy where I was and doing what I do like a robot with a fake smile imitating emotions. But now... It's a fucking black hole. It hurts so much I want to cry but I can't. I have a sliver of hope, but I don't want it. Isn't that stupid. I'm so used to this horrible life that I'd rather stay in it and anybody who seems to help me must be tricking me. But she won't know how I feel deep down right away. No one does. I do a good job of acting like I'm fine, and acting like a normal person should when I'm around people. But it's all an act.  she won't like the real me, I'm not such a smiling happy person at home.

They looked after me quite a bit as a child and now that they don't have much time left every time I talk to them they feel bad for me because I can’t seem to find a girlfriend to start a family with. It’s not that I want to start a family right now but I just play it off because I’m not looking to start friction with them because from their perspective it’s a great idea. The issue is I feel bad for me and it’s heartbreaking because I don’t want them to waste time doing that right now given the circumstances. The thing is I’ve been thinking recently should I hire a good looking girl to have companionship with and to play up to them that I found someone? This is not a long-term thing because of there health that is terminal. I’m thinking of doing it just so they have closure that I found someone and that they don't have to waste time worrying about me. In any other circumstance I wouldn't I'm wondering should I consider this? Some people will say “ Just find somebody instead of hiring “ but The issue is the Time constraint, I don’t have a few weeks to go out there and find somebody especially because I’m already having trouble with that even without time constraints. I just don’t want them to not have closure that I haven't found somebody.   The reason why I brought up an escort at the beginning is because I have bought a few hours before to go on “ Dates “ &amp; I feel me and her could pull off being in a relationship because we know each other enough.

I’m a pretty normal guy I think. 
I’m somewhat smart and friendly and outgoing 
I try to be fun and interesting and just you know whatever humans do that makes other humans like them. 
I’m on things like tinder and what not I go out and be social 
But nothing ever materialises nobody knows I exist and i just wish I knew why or what was wrong with me that I’m destined to just be on my own. 

I just wish I had friends like every one else. People who want to spend time with me and to do things with or a shoulder to cry on...

2412,limitless0727,1583627631,1,"So about 3 weeks ago I found a discord server for people to find friends to play league of legends. I didn't think I would find any success, but I chatted in ""general"" for a bit and the people seemed nice. The next day I decided to join voice chat and play some games with them and it was really fun, this went on for about 2 days until I got into dm's with this one girl. It started in a weird, but cute way, every night we would tell each other bedtime stories that we thought of on the spot. We would also talk a lot about litterally anything, even the weirdest stuff you could imagine and not be embarrased about it one bit. This went on for about 2 weeks and the server that we met in was basically dead. We still kept talking and I even told her I wish this would never end, and she replied that she wasn't planning on ending it either. So this wednesday I decides to talk to her, nothing special just a basic late night talk and a bedtime story. She was really sad that day and I noticed, so I asked if everything was okay and she said that she will just get over it but I insisted on her getting help because the way she was talking it made it sound like there was a huge problem that she just didn't want to deal with. Also some time before this we talked about how fucked up our lives are and how lonely we are so I knew something was up. I tried to help her but she refused to accept the help. Then she said that she doesn't wanna drag me into this because she alreadi talked about it with 2 friends and they couldn't help but I still insisted. Then I told get a proffesional's help but she also refused and at this point i was really frustrated so I typed a whole paragraph on why she should go get help and it still didn't help. The next day I felt bad for pushing her so much so I apologised. And today I noticed that I don't see her online anymore and that I can't dm her because she left the server and I didn't have her on my friends list. Then I asked another guy who was also talking to her a bit to see if he knows anything, but the same had happened to him. A few hours ago she texted me ""sorry, no more bedtime stories"" and rejected my friend request. So I feel really worried about her, she was my only friend and now she's just gone.

2415,Maybestressed,1583626607,1,"So here is my life story. It is 2 am and I am overthinking of stuff. I am 19 with Aspergers. My family is very racist and they are not very accepting. It's a bit dysfunctional, they fight all the time, my father gets drunk quite often and says our lives suck. I got depression at 13 because a girl who didn't like me bullied me. My friend who knows her since kindergarten says it is because her crush liked me and sat with me in the class. Anyways I became really lonely and alienated, I missed many chances to be a normal teen. I joined dance lessons, I made a great friend who was younger but after a few years I found someone in my grade, a girl who was popular but her friends had left her all of a sudden and I was a loner all along so our ways crossed and we became besties. That other friend from the dance got jealous and she told my sister that I cut and that I was saying my life is bad and while it was true, It had been years since I cut or said those things so idk why after 4 years she went and told my sister, we had a huge fight in my family because my sister told my parents and my grandma found out and told them to chill cause the girl was clearly jealous of me finding another friend. I was really impulsive and I wish I had found a way to keep both friends but it seemed impossible cause one was a preppy s-exual popular girl who liked girls as well and my dance friend would read the bible in her spare time and go to church. Dance friend had also started hanging out with another girl who  has very malicious and two faced so even before I became BFFS with popular girl I had started to get distant. So I chose to stay friends with the popular girl because I always liked her personality but I was always too quiet and too shy due to the bullying too so we never actually got to know each other and I really needed a friend in my grade to be in class with. Looking back I regret it because I gaveaway something meaningful that I had for years with dance girl just to have a company. Anyways, dance girl and her malicious two faced friend started sending me texts that I am stupid and ignorant (the two faced said it) because I stopped talking to them after she told my sister I cut and stuff and they bullied my new bff aka popular girl and said that she slept with a teacher. I told popular girl to write on the school wall right besides her class the name of dance girl and 'telltale' besides it. Then my dance friend made a fake account about the two faced girl and mocked her Yeah we acted like 6. We got suspended but I did not mind because my family kicked me out when they found out I was cutting and blamed me for awful stuff and dance girl knew about my family having zero tolerance on me. Popular girl's reputation got horrible, mine was a bit better cause people would say I am quiet and nice so I would not do it and she affected me. She started blaming everything on me so I stopped talking to her and I turned back to an old childhood friend who did not like any of my friends and she understood me and was very happy to become good friends. We still are okay but she studies very far now. I had horrible depression since I was 13. I dropped uni now because my family pressures me to switch majors and also I got bullied and idk how to fix this. I have a boyfriend, all my good friends are away for college and I hang out with some younger friends of my good friend but we are not close. I joined Spanish class to meet new people and so far it is okay.",lonely,I feel so alone,2020-03-08 11:16:47

And somehow my parents managed to produce this ugly shit who’s last acknowledgement by a girl was a dare in 1st grade. What makes it even worse is that when people actually recognize my existence, they get distracted by my better looking siblings. No ones ever looked up to me for anything, no one is ever excited to see me. The only reason I get a fraction of attention from people is because I’m related to person they actually want to see.

We talked after a while next thing you know we were talking on a regular basis she gave me her Snapchat and number we became friends this went on for a couple months until now. She came to my town to visit her family and friends and she stopped by my store where I work at to say hi she was honestly taller than I expected anyways we talked I finally asked if she wanted to go out next weekend and she said yeah. 
Fast forward to Thursday I noticed our conversation was a too dry you could start a fire with how dry it was. Friday came I heard nothing from her. I knew it was over she lost interest or  she never had interested in me. Today I confront  her about her cold distance lately and Surprised surprised they're someone else.

2441,kitkatkhi,1583613776,1,"I enjoy spending time alone, but it does get lonely. 

For multiple reasons, I don’t necessarily enjoy long face to face interactions and find it difficult to make friends. I’m an introvert and don’t want to  have to leave the house often to hang out with new friends or do things I don’t fully enjoy for the sake of friendship (I know it sounds bad). 

The close friendships I do have are effortless and it doesn’t feel like a chore being with them, but they have moved away. I compare all new friendships to the ease of my old friendships. 

Where I live dating can get hard, for reasons I will explain if we end up talking. Again, it involves more effort than it’s worth. 

I’m looking for a pen pal. I would prefer to keep my anonymity because it makes me feel safer and able to be more vulnerable. It also removes the feeling of compulsion to continue talking to someone when I don’t want to- they don’t know who I am and can’t confront me. (Man I know this sounds really bad LOL). 

I just want someone I can talk to on here maybe, or a chatting app, who I can talk to about my day or my interests without the anxiety and stress of commitment to a friendship/relationship. 

A little bit about me: 
-22F college student 
-Stoner
-I’m very empathetic and sensitive to other people’s feelings and nothing upsets me more than seeing a person or animal in pain. 
-I’m very open minded, “liberal” (although I don’t like that word for myself because of the political connotations it has with it now) and accepting of  everyone regardless of race, sexuality, religion etc. 
-I enjoy pop culture, rap music &amp; current affairs. 
-Passionate about prison reform &amp; changing the stigma around addiction

Just got back home after being rejected by my crush I've had for the past 2 years. We've been talking for the past year and a half but on and off (we would talk for a few months constantly and then stop for a while and then start talking again) After multiple tries of dropping hints that I like her and proposing to her that we should go out some time and continuously getting shit down from dumb excuses she made up I finally got her to agree to go out with me. Now I know what you might be thinking l, I should have stopped trying since she always made excuses to stop us from going out but when we texted she was dropping hints and so I thought she was just trying to play hard to get. Moving on, today we went out and our ""date"" was going well until she got a call. When she ended the call I asked who it was she told me her boyfriend. I froze. Up to my knowledge she didn't have a boyfriend and her best friend which I am friends with and is how u met her didn't mention any boyfriend last time I saw her.
I then realised that, that was the point that my chances ended and I decided just go for one last attempt. Albeit stupid but I had to try she was my crush for the last 2 years I couldn't just give up.
I told her I didn't know she had a boyfriend and told me that they got together this week. I told her that I was confused and that I had feelings for her, and I thought she did to bc of her hints.
She then told me that no she never had feelings for me and that she was just stringing me along bc she didn't have anyone so I was the backup plan. She then laughed and scoffed at me as she told me she found it pitiful that I even thought we could be something. She compared me to her boyfriend and that I was trash compared to him and that it was purely idiotic of me to think I deserved her. After her pointing out all the insecurities that I have tried for years to get over, it absolutely destroyed me. But it wasn't worse than what she said next. She told me that if I had asked her out sooner she probably would have said yes. That was it. That was what has had me in a wretched state for the past hours absolutely void of happiness.
The idea that my own incompetence and not having courage to ask her out was what ultimately kept us apart gutted me. I have been spiraling into a dark place in my mind not knowing how I will get out of it.

My partner and I are at a low because of how my insecurity and loneliness and anxiety are pervading through things- I can no longer tell if I'm being unreasonable or he's just exhausted and unkind. I know I always create these problems for myself because I just don't have anyone else- I always just hop into new relationships and then make them last for way longer than they should because they become my only friend. I never have an actual circle. I'm the type that outwardly people think has friends- when I'm in a social situation or in class I can seem to comfortably be around people and laugh and joke. But when I'm not there...it's just silence. I'm never invited anywhere. No one EVER messages me first.

I just...want someone to talk to. Want to know if I'm just crazy. I've never been suicidal and I'm not but like...I just kinda feel like things aren't really worth it right now. I've been struggling with a lot of anxiety and depression lately and things have all been going wrong professionally so that's been amplifying the stress, and I feel like I shouldn't be where I am for school and have this massive impostor syndrome going.

And-... it’s just depressing how we try to find this vent, this escape, just somewhere to post about this. To write it out, to just express yourself with no restraints. 

Well, maybe it is genuinely therapeutic to some, writing like this. Which is obviously great, don’t get me wrong. Knowing that at least someone is reading your thoughts and feelings for a few moments can feel great. 

But to me, the internet just feels so dark. When you explicitly write your pain out, publicly, of course nice and kind people would tell you good things. Would tell you that you matter. And they definitely mean it. I genuinely mean it when I say that to a stranger, but what more can we possibly do than that?

It’s definitely not anyone’s fault by I think it only makes this whole feeling worse. I think just reading or glancing at someone listening to you, or even saying kind things to you, through a screen, just reiterates how difficult it is, to realize there is no one like that actually next to you.

2458,thowawayedconfession,1583600815,1,"I’m a 19 year old kid trying to finish up my second semester in college.  Up until I was about 17 I’d say I had a pretty normal life.  However, in January 2018 my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  He had a long-fought battle but the disease eventually took his life in January 2019.  In the months leading up to Jan. 2019, I missed a good portion of my senior year due to me having to help my mom nurse him on a day to day basis.  It was during this time when I believe my depression first was onset.  I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep at most everyday while I had to watch my father wither away.  Consequentially, due to me missing so much school, my GPA dropped significantly and I was in a dual credit course at the time with the college I planned to attend which lowered my college GPA before I was even in it.  After my fathers passing, my family began to fight over money that he had supposedly owed to another family member even though there was no proof.  This left a rift in my family and I hardly hear from that entire side at all now.  Fast forward to graduation and Summer of 2019, I started smoking weed daily just to get my mind off things.  This became an extremely toxic habit and I spent most of the money I had on a fucking plant and paraphernalia.  Finally, August rolls around and I begin my first semester at college.  For a brief period, things seemingly got better and I didn’t feel as empty as before.  However, about a month in I got a sinus infection and this persisted until February until I ultimately had to have surgery.  Around early December, I began talking to a beautiful girl who I really liked and once again I had hope that maybe things would get better.  It was at this time though I started abusing drugs and I would take Molly, Xanax, Coke, Percs, etc. to dull the pain I felt.  Fast forward again to January and rush for fraternities is starting to happen.  At my school, your social life is pretty much contingent on being Greek so it’s almost a necessity to be in a house if you want to meet new people and make new friends.  However, the process is extremely competitive as well and based a lot on connections.  The house that I’m well connected to got into trouble a day before rush started and could no longer take a new class.  Inevitably, I had to go to houses where I had no connections at and with a very large school like mine getting a bid is very unlikely.  I put a great deal of value into getting into a house because I had hoped my life would change for the better for once, but unfortunately things didn’t work out and I was left empty handed.  Additionally, all my close friends who had supported me up until this point are all now in houses and since then I have had very little contact with them.  On top of that the girl I was talking to got into an amazing house which I’m happy of her for, but this meant that I could only see her a couple days a week at most.  The week after rush I got extremely sick and was throwing up daily with a low grade fever.  My mom was worried about me so she took me home to the hospital.  The doctor told me I needed to have surgery within the next week to fix my sinuses and on top of that I also had active mononucleosis.  As a result, I missed about 3 weeks of school in February and fell behind in almost all of my classes.  When I finally got back, I had to drop 2 of my classes, putting both my scholarship and admittance into the particular school for the major i’m in at risk.  At this time, the girl I was talking to began distancing herself from me even more.  Fast forward to today, and I slept through my midterm for a required class for my major meaning there’s good chance I need to unenroll this semester now and the girl I was talking to is posting another dude all over her social media.  I’m sorry if this is trivial, but I feel like no matter how hard I try life is just repeatedly beating me down.  So here I am today.  A broke kid who got a 1570 on his SAT but could only manage to get a 2.1 in college and on the verge of losing everything I’ve worked towards my entire life, lonely and losing the one thing that made me happy.

I’m so confused on why, since he said that he didn’t want to act any differently to how we did in the relationship (e.g he still wants to kiss me and cuddle me) but he wants me to not be his girlfriend.
He says he still loves me and I know he’ll be there and I know he’ll come back it’s just the waiting for him to be back is horrible.

I know the reasons he ‘left’, he even agreed with me on what I said. It’s because in the uk, GCSE exams are coming up and we are both doing them, however we go to different schools so I can’t see him as often. He’s just stressed over the exams I just feel lonely.
I don’t ask for much, all I want is to be cared for, loved and cuddled but that’s too much still.

I’m just confused on why it was needed since it won’t change the way we act.
Another reason why he left was because he wants to go back to a child like innocence (brought on by stress) and the intense love from a slightly nsfw situation probably messed him up, he’s just not ready to handle that much intense emotion.

2463,WhiskyWildflower,1583595434,1,"My background in the social scene is I’ve never been very popular or have had many good people around. I chose to move away from my hometown, 700 miles away to be exact, leaving behind the two decent friends I had and my niece. I still talk to them when they have time. I’ve never lived more than a few hours from my home town. 

Leading into this decision was an absolutely horrible work situation where I was expected to work 100 hour weeks nonstop, recently leaving a very physically and mentally abusive boyfriend in the middle of the night, always unsupportive family, and a few dating fails. I was tired of seeing bad experiences everywhere I went and no matter what I did, nothing got better. 

I’ve lived here for three months now. Mid-December I met a decent friend that also initiated dating but I didn’t think it was a good idea because he recently broke it off a LTR. Eventually I conceded because he was pursuing it and honestly I got along so well with this guy and felt safe. Then he started hot and cold bullshit after I was a good friend and helped him through a really rough time. Skipping the details, I recently found out he’s “just fucking” his ex that’s cheated on him a load of times and around that same time he stopped talking to me. He would occasionally talk me up, call me the sweetest girl ever, say I’m the reason he’s doing so well, and just talk to me like I’m his world. He said he’s be there for me if I needed him emotionally multiple times and wasn’t any of those times. 

Now being a loner of sorts, being with my own company is okay. I am getting sick of it though. But him doing that to me? Ruined me. We could have been amazing friends and he had to fuck it up. Yes I absolutely would love a partner. I have anxiety that also causes depression and I have sleep issues when I don’t feel safe. The last time I slept well was when he was here in January.

I was popular in school and spent most of my 20’s and 30’s in a band, surrounded by people, yet still cognizant I was not happy and lonely. In hindsight I realized that my alcohol and drug abuse we’re just a slow suicide attempt. It almost worked. During this time I met a true angel and my soulmate. She was the only person that was not enabling me and telling me the truth that success was not worth dying for. I quit my band and life’s dream and totally reinvented myself and married my savior.After 20 plus years of marriage ( first 7 amazing) My wife was deep in the throes of her own addiction and I couldn’t help her out of it. Despite love, patience and rehabs, she filed for divorce, took my home, half of my retirement and moved across country. I recently met a girl after 3 plus years of total isolation. She approached me and gave me her number. We hit it off amazingly. I had strong feelings for her, and her for me. I found out quickly that she just wanted a hook up after countless conversations stating otherwise. She pulled the “ I just need to do me, now” which I feel was response from my unwillingness to have sex on our first date. The other thing I suspect is that she had just got out of a relationship and was using me to validate her self esteem, and/or making him jealous. I have been thinking a lot about suicide for some years. Lately it has been all consuming.I was afraid of suicide,because I for some reason believed that I would go to hell. Along with not wanting to leave that emotional burden on people who care about me. Truth is, I have no family except an 83 year old father that I care for. He has Alzheimer’s and probably won’t understand that I’m gone. I will leave plenty of money for him to have a pampered end of life. I assume that my ex not be too sad about it, but actually happy in a weird way because she will get to be the poor victim, again. I have no friends, just work colleagues.

I thought my life would change after high school, but it did not...I am still lonely even tjo I live with my parents and brother...Don't get me wrong, I love them to death but I still feel like...I don't know, some type of alien. Can anyone relate?

I am in my thirties now...and I am having a lot of health issues that are leaving me feel empty and exhausted. No matter how hard I try to work on myself, I will always be stuck at home without friends ny own age...

People say go out and meet people but it is neve simple, especiallyif you do not drive...The only person I hang out with most is my mother and my therapist. I am not complaining. But I never really had thatgroup of friends that would get together and go out on Saturday nights...

I don't know what it is about me that turns people off. I am nice and give people a chance to be friends but that usually stops after a few sentences...Especially with people that I have tried to conbect with on dating sites, but I do not go on them anymore...

i just don't even know where to start on making friends. where am i supposed to go? where's the hidden treasure chest location full of like-minded people who can put up with my too loud yet anxious self. i mean im a pirate in this scenario and i've been out at sea searching for a long goddamn time! i'm practically ancient dust at this point (yeah.... yeah.. i'm only 23 but STILL)

not even wikihow could save me. smh. fun fact: i once got a job interview there but was far too lazy to look into researching wines (?????? boring amirite!!!!!) for the example article piece. i mean, it's so rude. im not a wineo. im more of a vodka gal myself.

idk what you're supposed to really use this sub for. i just wanted a little bit of a rant. or if you want to talk go ahead and bug me.. online friends are always fun!

2517,wretched_and_divine,1583541964,1,"True loneliness is not having anyone to share good news with. Nobody to come home to after a long day at work, nobody to share the intimacy of a bed or the simplicity of a cup of coffee with. No friend to run to when life gets hard, nor a companion to confide in. It's also when you find yourself lost when you look in the mirror, as if the person you see is not really you but rather a consciousness without a body. When you're around people you feel some sense of disconnect but when you're alone you truly don't know who you are.

For some reason once again I tried to see the good in you. Once again you’ve let me down. I don’t know what I was really expecting to be honest. Guess you’ve gotten used to treating me like shit. Hopefully one day I won’t see any good. I know you will regret losing me for good one day. I’m way too good for you. I sacrificed so much for you. I really did want to show you the love I have to give but you never wanted. I guess it’s a good because you wouldn’t be able to handle a love so strong. You’re not capable of receiving the kind of love I have to give. I’ve grown I guess in a weird way. It still hurts and I think it will 
always hurt. It sucks always trying to see the best in people you love even when they constantly disappoint you. I don’t think I would ever be able to treat one that I once loved the way you treat me. Makes me question did you ever even love me? It hurts to think that all of my feelings were for nothing. That everything I did was just for both of us to never exist in each other lives anymore. I didn’t do all that effort for temporary. I did it for forever. Feels like no one can truly relate to me. I feel alone in this situation. But it’s okay. 


Here’s my message to him after he wanted me to come see him to just fuck. 
Not really been that clear but I kind of guessed it from how you’re texting me. I tried to see the best in you even when you weren’t showing it.

You know damn well that I care about you a lot and the fact that you think it’s okay to use me for just sex and you know exactly how I feel is what hurts but it’s okay. This is just a negative situation and I know damn well I deserve more than just to be used to be fucked. Its not surprising that I’m even having to explain this to you..It’s quite sad. I’m glad you’re doing better. If this is your definition of doing better than go all for it. I’m not going to stop ya.

2540,Narantas,1583532078,1,"Hello and thank you for reading my post 🙂.

For the past 4 or 5 years I have slowly been isolating myself without me recognizing it, mostly due to depression. It has gotten to the point where I only have 1 person left to talk to in my life, my ex girlfriend. 

Because she's the only 1 left to talk to, I've been taking up too much of her time and talked to her about stuff I shouldn't talk to her about. I've been noticing that she's starting to get tired of me. My clinging has started to push her away and that is something that I do not want. So I'm trying to stop that before it is too late. 

I've realized that it is not healthy for me to have only 1 person in my life to talk to and therefore I'd wish to meet new people and maybe make some friends.

I'm willing to talk to anyone about practically anything but to make it easier for people I'll tell you something about myself:

I'm a 31 year old male from the Netherlands (Europe). My personal interests are watching Soccer/Football, Basketball, American Football and Formula 1. I love watching series and movies, and also play games on my PS4 (currently not able to check my Multi-player games here) or PC (I have WoW and willing to try any F2P game you suggest). Iike to discuss about multiple things from politics to the every day things that go on in my or your life.

2544,Iyonia,1583528169,1,"Growing up, it was mostly just my family and I against the world. I didn't have many friends. I worked hard, and made friends - started talking with more people, tried to make something of myself, and ended up with a lot of very close, intimate friendships with all kinds of people. I fell in love, worked on my art, and traveled in spite of the bad things happening - at the time, those bad things were -- I had lost my home, and my step-dad was threatening to kill me, so I couldn't go back. I was a teenager. 

Afterwards, I ended up in a relationship with a man who, over the course of several years, isolated me from my friends and family. It's not easy to explain how it happened. Just, over time, before I had even really recognized what he was doing, I ended up without.. basically, everything. Every little aspect of independence was worn away over time, handed over with excuses -- why he needed control of things like my money, or my medical care, or why I shouldn't talk with my friends anymore, or listen to music anymore - over the years, everything was stripped away until all I did, day in and day out, every single year, was clean and cook and wait for him to come home. Sleep, rinse, repeat. Wake up, compliment him, cook for him, clean his home, cook dinner, wait for him to return, praise him, sleep, wake up. I lost track of time. He became violent. We broke up, and I fled to my grandparents home. But, something had happened to me. I stopped being able to really connect with people anymore. I tried, but it was as though there was an invisible wall between myself and everything, everyone, around me.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to reconnect with my old friends, I tried to work on a romantic relationship, I tried to get into college, and the kind of work I was always passionate about. I tried to get back into gaming, and art. I tried working out. Moving. But nothing stuck. It has begun to feel as though, perhaps, being with people at all was a fluke and I am not the kind of person who is supposed to have friends or close family. I feel completely devoid of connection, and cold. I feel disassociated. 

This is not surprising. I'm mentally ill - I have been, for as long as I can remember. I think I was born depressed, and I'll probably always be this way.  I live with my partner now, another person who experiences something a lot like what I do, by his own admission. I don't know how similar his experiences really are, but since there's no real way of knowing, I'll take it at face value. 

Living here, I once more do not speak with others. I don't see people in person. I only speak with people online. Online friends are real friends, and they can be wonderful people - but I don't have online friends. I have old friends - people I have known for over ten years, who survived my failed teenage relationship, who I write to online maybe once or twice a month. A group of people I can count on one hand, whose interactions with me can basically be summarized as:

""Hello."" ""Hi."" ""How are you?"" ""I'm okay, you?"" ""Good.""

and then nothing for another thirty days. I've tried to start conversations, share things - group together, to play video games, or talk in Discord, or meet in person. Yet, in spite of the fact that almost every single one of them complains to me of feeling lonely and isolated, we are not.. hanging out. If I manage to push a conversation beyond the initial greetings, we may have a brief, goofy conversation that's almost normal - but it is still only once or twice a month, and it is still only in writing, and it is rarely continued or about anything of real value to us.

&amp;#x200B;

I have one or two friends, within that group, who seem interested in really hanging out and staying connected. One of them is usually busy, but he is basically my closest real friend right now. The other, is a friend of mine who is in what feels like constant romantic pursuit of me, to the detriment of all else. We do not seem to be able to talk about anything at all, without the subject quickly becoming about him wanting to die, wanting to date me, or some vague combination of the two, in which he tells me he does not deserve me and that he wants to die. 

He has a lot on his plate - he's a good person, with a lot of difficult things going on in his life, and I want to support him. I want to be able to be friends with him. But, when I reach out to talk with him, it is an endless, isolating loop. I don't know why he is so fixated on getting involved with me. This image of me he has, is very incorrect. I am not a bubbly fantasy dream babydoll sparkly anime playgirl. This is the image many former friends of mine projected on me in the past, and it was very difficult to have a friendship with them, because I felt as though I was constantly having to exert energy to pretend to be someone for them to be able to be happy. I am an adult now, and I just want to have at least semi-regular interactions with people who are not only trying to sleep with me.   


I feel like we can't talk at all. Even the closest of my friends often shy away from telling me about their days, or even just bantering, because - in their own words - they don't want to burden me. What does that mean??? Everyone has issues, I just want to spend time with my friends. It is not a burden, to hear what's going on in other peoples lives, or to hang out. Why does it always feel as though they're trying to make this out into some kind of sadness competition, and because I am still recovering from an abusive relationship, I am somehow The Champion of Sadness(tm) and now can no longer be interacted with outside of the context of just, being super miserable all the time? I want to do things and talk about things that have nothing to do with my mental illness, or being sad. Why wont any of them let it go?

2546,OffWithYourNuts,1583526545,1,"I am 19 yrs old, Indian, Introvert, Socially Awkward, Depressed Software developer. I am quite lonely, and this is going to be a long long post, I need an outlet desperately.

From start -

I was very studious when I was young, rather than studious I was very bright, everybody came to me for help with their study. I knew the answer to every question the teacher asked, I was the first to put up my hand to answer in every class, I was every teacher's favourite student and they told my parents so every time. I had two very close friends and a good friend circle.

Now a little background on my parents - 

My father - A very brilliant man but has alcohol abuse history. Has completed his MBA. Works as a COO in an NGO.

My mother - A Professor. Has completed Masters in Personel Management. She is a very loud and aggressive and overprotective woman. My Paternal Grandparents are the cause of her being so but let's keep that aside.

I was in a government-run school till my 8th std (middle school), called Kendriya Vidyalaya, But the quality of education in those schools was declining gradually, till I reached 7th the quality of education was very low, so were my grades because of it, so after I completed my 8th standard, my parents decided to shift me to a boarding school (Bless them, they did it even though it was out of their financial capacity, my father took a loan to do so). So here I was in a boarding school in 9th std (High School) when a boy is supposed to make lifelong friends and explore the city where he lives, I was thrown into a very new environment where a hierarchy or pecking order was already in place and I had no exposure whatsoever to the chaos I was going into.

Now curse my fucking heart, it got fixated on one of the popular girls, who had a boyfriend who was at the top of the pecking order. What to do now? I can't have her cause she is taken (not the main reason). I couldn't have her because whenever she used to talk to me I used to get tongue-tied, my heart used to start pounding (I had no experience talking to girls because of my overprotective parents) and I had a fear in the back of my mind that her boyfriend will beat me up. I was depressed those two years because I had no option but to see the girl I was crushing so hard on with another man. Even though all of this was happening I somehow managed to score 74% in my tenth class.

Now here my father comes into the play, his parenting strategies are very wrong, in 8th standard I wanted to learn to play the guitar. but because my grades were low my father told me to get a higher grade next year and he will get me a guitar and put me in a class for learning guitar. Now, this is called reward system and this is applied to train dogs, not motivate a person. In 9th and 10th standard as mentioned in the above paragraph, I was depressed so my grades didn't go up but they didn't go down too. But the expectation of my father was very high he expected me to score at **least** above 90% (After throwing me into a new environment (He thought it was favourable but it was not.)). He was not satisfied with the marks and again used a very wrong parenting method, Berating me into improving. He berated all of my achievements, he still tells me that I have failed my tenth standard and 74% in the tenth standard are shit grades.

This caused me to lose my motivation, I didn't have the motivation to get out of my bed and go to my college. My attitude became very negative, my outlook on life became very negative. I thought on the lines of -  If you even don't want to acknowledge my achievements let alone appreciate them, then why the fuck should I perform?

As it turns out, a lot of loneliness is self inflicted, I thought I was lonely cause I had no girlfriend, or friends near me, but then I saw I was wrong. I have friends, called family, a loving mom and father, and brothers to laugh with. I was just too caught up in my selfish needs I thought I had to have because I dont have friends I can see. Yet they were with me the whole time.

I know some people are truly alone, with only themselves, but lots of people out there are like me, they just need to see who is there for them, because the cure to loneliness is not being lonely, that way you can focus on what you are as a person, and find the people that are the same, and grow together, as friends or family.

And to those that are truly alone, you must strive to reach out to people, and find people just like you, and maybe do something together and become unlonely together.

2571,ThrowAwayOldFilter,1583504687,1,"I had to get away from my last two friends because one went dangerously crazy and then about a year later I realized my last friend was a narcissistic sociopath. It dawned on me that I was being manipulated by my last remaining friend, who I had known most of my life, so I had to escape from him. Some extreme gaslighting is what finally cleared the fog and broke the spell he had over me. My ""best friend"" said something so insulting that it was hard to not get up and start hitting him. I decided that would be the last time I ever saw him, because I hate feeling that angry.

If you've seen the movie ""The Invisible Man"" that just came out in theaters, you might be able to understand how some narcissists feel like they own other people and will aggressively lash out if they've been rejected. That's what happened to me.

I spent all of 2019 being very aware that even though they were blocked, they tried to contact me probably 50-60 times. They wanted to manipulate me into being back into their life so they could abuse me more. They tried multiple different ways to get ahold of me even after I blocked them on different platforms. It's a nightmare that I just want to go away. They did it again last week after three months of peace.

Basically, what narcissist do when they've been thoroughly rejected is try to constantly remind you that they exist and that they're obsessed with you. They don't want you to have any peace of mind. That's why even though he knows it's over, he still wants to talk to me so he can bullshit me, whitewash what he's done and try to lure me into some sort of reunion.

I don't want to contact law enforcement because fuck them. They don't do shit until the aftermath. I've called the cops on people who tried to attack me on my own goddamn street and I had the license plate and they didn't want to hear any of it and just said ""call us if they come back.""

Plus, narcissists want to be involved with their targets, whether it's hanging out or sitting in a court room to get a restraining order. I don't want to even think about him. I don't want to have to waste my time showing documentation and explaining to a judge why this scumbag won't leave me alone. He lies about the most mundane shit, so I have no doubt that he'll lie about me. What am I going to do, throw a restraining order at him if he shows up at my door?

The wildest part is I'm bigger and stronger than he is. I have no problem beating the shit out of him if he comes to my home. That's what's so disturbing about it. He's relentlessly harassing me, probably hoping that I'll snap and come after him so he can claim he's the victim. Thankfully I've screenshotted and documented everything so I have proof that he's been harassing me non-stop.

This wouldn't be such a shitty ordeal if I actually had friends to talk to and hang out with. I need to vent. I need some real social interaction.

I've resorted to doing a lot of dangerous and stupid shit just to take the edge off. I overspend on dinner just about every weekend and eat fancy meals just to make myself feel better. I get drunk at least once a weekend. I have a fast car now, so I go do 60 mile laps around the forest while blasting house music or hip-hop. I go 100mph+ more than anyone ever should just to try to fill the void in my life.

I feel like the longer I'm this lonely, the odds that I do something irrational and harmful to myself increase.

On the first day of this year I drove down the coast from San Francisco to Monterey because I really thought about driving off a cliff into the ocean and ending it all. The weather was pretty shitty and it got dark early. Driving along cliffs overlooking the ocean at night in bad weather is scary. I didn't really want to go off that cliff, but at the same time I did.

When I got home and looked at the news, I found out that about 5 hours earlier, some person took their life by driving their Lexus SUV off a cliff that I had passed that day. There's a dashcam video of it and the person and their car were never found. Three months later and apparently nobody has any idea what the fuck happened to them.

It really fucks me up that that could have been me. It bothers me that they haven't been found and I think about them a lot.

I feel so fucking stupid for even considering doing that. My parents don't deserve that. They've never given up on me. My pets wouldn't have anyone to care for them and I can't stand the thought of my pets missing me. When I go out of town and have family watch my pets, my cat cries outside my bedroom door wondering where I am.

It kills me inside that I don't have any quick fixes. Nobody is going to be my friend tomorrow, or a month from now, or probably even next year.

All I want is a friend to go to dinner with, or the movies, or go to a bar or something like that. Even better if they like fast cars and loud music.

I feel so dead inside and I don't know how to fix it. I've thought about doing stupid shit like putting license plate frames on my car that say ""I'm lonely and have no one. Help"" or something like that. I've also thought about making a sign with similar messaging and going somewhere very public to see if anyone out there is trying to make a friend.

I feel like if I told anyone about this struggle in person, they'd probably think I'm crazy and ghost me.

I have met someone, and they are probably one of the best people i have ever known. Yesterday, i made a leap of faith and asked the girl from my last post if she wanted to eat lunch together. She agreed, and it was amazing, though i wont go into all of the conversations. 

BUT, at the end of the lunch, about an hour after we had actually finished eating, i blurted out that me going to lunch with someone was actually a huge step for me. And when i told her this, she stopped getting ready to leave, sat back down, and asked me why. I had mentioned that i wasn't good at making friends before, but when she asked why, everything else seemed to spill out of me. The past few months had been the loneliest of my life, and i had been dragged out of it by her. She listened to everything and made me feel heard.

Im not trying to brag, as im sure this would be the worst place to brag about something like this. What I am trying to say is that even if you think that there is no one out there for you. Or if you think no one will ever care, or you are a person who doesn't deserve love. Im here to tell you that your wrong, and i realize this sounds like a shitty fucking after school special, but there is a reason they try and hammer those points home. Its because they're true.

I am this lovely combination of someone who craves social connection but does not/is incapable of putting myself out there. I don't like people who talk about nothing, I tend to keep only two or three friends and really pour my heart into those relationships. Which is great, right? I give my best to my friends.

No, apparently not.   
Because I constantly find myself treading the line of being overbearing. I have three friends. One of them is at a party right now, one of them I have already seen today and she made plans with others for tonight. One of them hasn't made an effort to talk to me at all for the past couple of weeks, so I guess fuck that...

I just wanted to say that I am so tired of not being cared for the same way that others care for me, and I am also so freaking tired of not being able to make friends. I am in college.

2602,liferdjysk,1583468158,1,"I consider myself a high achieving person. I'm a master's student graduating in June and starting my PhD in the Fall. I've published my research, my students look up to me, and my professors all seem to like having me as their student. I am so fortunate to have so many opportunities and I'm grateful for them every day.  The only issue is that I feel so fucking alone.

I transferred to my University a couple years ago, starting as a junior undergraduate. I was admitted directly into my major and was ahead of the other juniors because I took the senior level classes as a junior. The problem with this was that all the friends I made were seniors. Long story short, they all graduated and scattered to the winds. Luckily, there were a couple other juniors, one of which I never got close with, the other became my girlfriend (yay!)

My academics really started to kick off during my senior year when I got really involved in multiple research projects. My girlfriend (now my ex-girlfriend) still lived in town and we were happy to spend lots of time together. 

We were both applying to grad schools at this time, so we were pretty stressed, but our relationship survived and grew stronger for it. She got accepted to a PhD program halfway across the country and decided to attend. We both graduated at the end of that year. I stayed in town to complete an accelerated master's degree, and she moved away to do her PhD. Most of my remaining friends in town also graduated and moved away.

My ex and I tried long distance and lasted about 8 months before breaking up a little less than a week ago. I'm feeling so alone. It's been impossible to make friends in this town, as the culture is very cliquey. My cousin, who is my last real friend in town, is graduating in a couple weeks and then I'll have no one. I consider myself close with my professors, but they have families and lives here, so my interactions with them are brief. My fellow grad students are too stressed to hang out. I keep suggesting that we grab drinks after work, but they never want to because they're so burnt out (my uni doesn't do a good job of fostering a community for grad students).

I'm not sure what to do. I have a group of friends that I talk to online, but it's just not the same as having people to hang out with in person. I just feel helpless, unwanted, and trapped in this awful town.",lonely,Feeling like I have everything and nothing,2020-03-06 15:15:58

2605,TyrannosaurusRev,1583466924,1,"This is a long one, so I apologize in advance. 

So a few years ago I found out my wife was cheating on me. I didn’t know how many there were or how long she had kept that secret but, as one often does, eventually I found out. I have never been the same since.

I have always fought with depression and anxiety. It has hung over me like a dark cloud. Even when it wasn’t obvious, it was always there. My ex wife used to use it to manipulate me. Gaslighting me and constantly yelling at me that I was a terrible person for my feelings. Ultimately, after I found out about her affair she got tired of the ruse and just resolved to tell me that “I’d never be happy. I couldn’t be happy. I’ve never loved you, and I never will”. 

I didn’t know what to do so, in shock, I packed my car. I didn’t fight her on the issue because I could see she wanted me out of the way. She had found an upgrade. I was just an empty vessel by that point. I worked 90+ hours a week, silently giving her my paycheck so she could afford cameras and film equipment for “our company”. After setting up the film company, I never even got to be part of the filming. It was just the nature of how she wanted it to work. 

What little energy I had left when I got home from work was met with a bitter and angry woman reprimanding me for being lazy. There was still so much work needing to be done around the house. It was unbearable. Alas, I stayed tough. This was love after all. I loved her desperately and thought I was doing what I was expected to keep a happy relationship. 

Anyway, when she ended it I just packed a few things in my car and left. She didn’t really let me take much. Just what I could carry, really. She’d never been so helpful as she was getting my stuff together so I could leave. 

I cried. I mean, full on ugly heaving sobbing, for about 1300 miles. I thought about driving my car right off the highway. Into rivers, trees. The thoughts of death were constant and echoed in my mind like a maniacal obsession. I was too afraid to actually do it though. Those thoughts have never stopped. And I’m still too scared. 

I wound up on my sisters porch. A complete wreck. Hadn’t slept in the 2 or 3 days since I’d left. She took me in. I started shutting out the world.

Eventually, I got a job. I just left it actually. Not for anything better but because I was drinking myself practically to death and the work environment I was in made it REALLY accessible. There are many nights I don’t remember, and some memories from nights that I do that I wish I could drink enough to forget. 

Now, here I am. Nothing has been solved. I don’t know who I am, or who I’m even supposed to be. I met her when I was 22. I’m now almost 35. I have nothing. I alienate myself from everyone I meet. I am nothing. I have lost everything and yet I still can’t find any courage to do anything about it. Neither through therapy nor suicide.

So that’s it, I guess. Even after over 3 years I’m still hurting and I am lonely. And to anyone who feels that similar pain of being an island in flames, surrounded by water but unable to put out the blaze, I’m so sorry. To anyone who feels alone, I’m sorry you have to feel this. I hope it gets better for you. I love you.",lonely,Life since the end of the world...,2020-03-06 14:55:24

2608,hamartiated,1583466681,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I want to tell you that there is certainly hope for you.  You may find someone on this sub that feels the exact same way you do.  Feels the same pain of being alone, rejected, hurt.  You are not alone.

Over 4 months ago I came into contact with someone who has made a very positive change in my life, and I have done the same in hers.  She came on here one night when she was feeling particularly lonely.  Vented her feelings on here but deleted her post shortly afterwards (she's a tough little lady, didn't want to come off as whiner)  well I saw that post and she seemed to be going through something similar to myself, so I reached out to her.  That was the best damn thing I could've ever done.

Through our mutual feelings of loneliness and rejection, and our similar situations we got to talking.  We hit it off right away.  It wasn't long and we really became very fond of eachother.  We shared pretty much EVERYTHING about ourselves and we wound up forming such a strong bond.  We have talked almost every single day since that first time, we've shared our sadness, frustrations, successes, happiness.  We have very deep conversations, we joke around, we offer advice, we lift eachother up when we're feeling down.  She became someone so very special to me I can't imagine her not being in my life.

It all began on this very subreddit.  I'm sharing this story to tell you that there is hope.  Do not give up because you may experience the same thing.  And it is beautiful.  Don't be scared to reach out to someone!

2627,WuTangGlamb,1583454467,1,"So back in October of last year, I (20M) met some girl who seemed to really like me. She talked to me for 2 months and then all of a sudden just cut me out of her life. I still to this day think it’s that I could not sexually please her (I genuinely didn’t know how and was too embarrassed to tell her I was a virgin). I’ve never had a girlfriend, let alone many girl friends at all, so when she stopped talking to me I was devastated. Well last Saturday, when I actually did something on the weekend, I ended up going to my friends’ girlfriend’s birthday party. Well low and behold I saw that girl that I used to talk to. I decided that I was not going to talk to her. Well, as I was sitting on the couch, she came up and talked to me (drunkenly) and talked about how much she missed me and how she made a huge mistake. I told her that I didn’t believe her and to show me, so she drug me downtown where we went out on the town and it really felt like things were back to the way they were. Well the next day, I texted her and told her I had a great time and responded to that message so I messaged her again. She didn’t respond for over 5 hours so I messaged her and told her everything and that I didn’t want to see her again. I know that she is not the one for me. She’s extremely immature and has daddy issues. She loves attention and dresses very promiscuously. She would never open up to me, I would tell her everything.

Will I ever find love? Or will I just be used for the rest of my life? All I want is a good girl that will lift me up and I can lift her up. I want someone to love and hold and enjoy life with. Every day is another day of getting older that I’m still a virgin and it frightens me. I am almost 21 years old and feel like even if I meet someone, they will be scared away because I don’t know how to please them. I feel that I have so much to offer but my depression lately has really been setting me back to the point where I’m genuinely convinced that I will die alone.",lonely,I feel so bad,2020-03-06 11:27:47

Problem is... He's boring like everyone else around here. I mean we've chatted about everything and I know what he'll say on most topics. He never argues. But the bit that has started to bug me is that he does... Nothing.

Everyone i know works (or not), plays games, buys  rubbish they'll just stick in a shelf and repeat.

I literally have no friends outside those people on my contact list who constantly nag me for my ""wisdom"" but will never actually follow my advice.

I play several games including Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Fortnite, but aiming to be a cloud architect is a tough gig, but I am nearly reached my goal, and most likely will get a job in June. I am currently maintaining a job and am a full-time student, graduating in May. Lots of things to look forward to, career-wise, but I don't think I will have a single friend or even get married. I am actually an extrovert forced to be introvert, which is oftentimes frustrating, and thus I am forced into my own world where I speak mostly to myself at night trying to imagine that I am an equal in this society.

2664,lmao_zedongs,1583433658,1,"Pretty much what the title says, I have been lonely most of my life and don't really see a purpose anymore in going on. My whole life I have really only ever wanted to be loved and accepted for who I am, but for what I can assume are a multitude of reasons, I have struggled to develop close and intimate relationships with others through adolescence and now into college.

I know the internet is not necessarily the best place to share these kinds of thoughts, but it's very difficult for me to open up about these issues around others due to my lack of close friends and the fact that being a virgin carries such a negative connotation now with whole forums and communities of ""incels"" posting horrible things about women. In the past, I have been ridiculed and mocked, and a few of my friends even compared me to a school shooter when I tried opening up about my depression and insecurities regarding my lack of experiences with women. Others would simply brush off my problems, telling me that I was smart and accomplished with no reason to feel upset about my life. Being anonymous, therefore, really allows me to circumvent a lot of my insecurities about opening up to others.

I thought things would potentially get better in college; unfortunately, I only developed worse and worse coping habits to deal with my issues. I started heavily drinking, using harder drugs like coke, molly, and LSD, and have developed a horrible smoking addiction with weed that has now developed into me smoking all-day almost everyday for the past 2 years. Once being a decently-accomplished, hard-working student, I now coast through all my classes, barely showing up to any lectures and completing all of my assignments drunk or high at the last minute. I tried joining a social fraternity to alleviate the isolation that I was experiencing, but most of them really didn't like me or care about me, failing to invite or include me in social events and ridiculing me multiple times behind my back.

Given that this is my reality, and I am now in the midst of the application process for medical school, I am really struggling to have hope for my future. My whole life, I have been able to solve math and science problems, which don't even matter in the grand scheme of things, quite easily, yet I can't even begin to understand or work through the most pervasive problems that have negatively impacted my social opportunities. I feel worthless everyday, like I am failing at basic human functions that are so easily learned and understood by others. It makes me constantly question what even is the point of being goal-oriented and trying to be successful, if being this way has only ever made me miserable and unhappy. When I look at others in my life who are happy, they are surrounded by loved ones who care about them and are actively engaging in enriching experiences that matter to them; they are not wasting their time in lectures, textbooks, or studying for exams. These thoughts are part of the reason it has been so hard for me to find motivation to do anything. Even so, the alternative, dropping out, has never been a viable option for me, so I feel like my college is a prison where a significant portion of time is being eaten up by academics without any fun or exciting social experiences to make up for this. I feel like I have no control, power, or time to actually address and fix the problems in my life that I want to, and my hopelessness stems from the fact that medical school will only be more rigorous and that I keep constantly hearing how making friends after college is impossible. Im so broken and worthless that I can't even do that now, so why would I bother going on? As such, I get though it and do the bare minimum, but this is no way for a fulfilled person to live their life. I am now at one of my lowest points, where even simple hygiene like brushing my teeth every morning and night is becoming a challenge to maintain.

Everyday I feel like I am just waiting for classes to end so I can go home, do drugs, and forget about my problems until I fall asleep. I know I can't live like this for very much longer, but I see now way of escaping my horrible situation. I have already lost so much time and social opportunities in life, I feel like nothing I can do in the future will never make up for how much was lost. I think ultimately it is this hopelessness that makes things so difficult. If I had just the knowledge that things could get better or that there are actually women out there who could love me as a person, things wouldn't be so bad, and I'd be motivated to work towards that future where I could be happy.

But, quite frankly, when I think about everything as scientifically and rationally as I possibly can, I really do think things are as hopeless as they can be. Outliers are a natural part of scientific experiments; they do not mean anything and there is nothing special about them, just like how my suffering means absolutely nothing to everyone else and my suffering itself is not even unique in the first place. I am simply a person who is not fit, for whatever scientific reasons are causing it, to be loved and appreciated by others. The fact that I have been this alienated and ridiculed for so much of my life is the only evidence I need to understand there is something inherent about my being that is inadequate and will always stay that way. I am probably the one of the worst combinations of personality and physical traits to exist as human. I have always had a deep hatred for myself, my choices, and the life that I live, and somehow, I always knew that I'd end up this way despite always being deathly afraid of succumbing to this fate. If 12 year-old me could see where I would end up, he would have killed himself immediately without hesitation.

If I could do everything over again, I would, but that is no longer possible, as as every second passes, I know my chances of ever being happy decrease continuously. Everyday I feel like just crying, like just going into a dark cave where I can lay down and cry and never do anything ever again. All I can even think sometimes is how much I don't want to live.

Thanks for taking the time to read if you did. My advice to anyone to not end up like me is to cherish the people in life who truly love you and only pursue what makes you happy. If I had done that, I probably would've turned out at least alright.",lonely,"I am 21, have never kissed a girl, and don't feel like going on.",2020-03-06 05:40:58

Feeling lonely for a long time makes me angry, so I do a lot of weird things to contain it, like randomly punching a wall, very hard. The physical pain is not worse than the emotional pain tbh.

I moved out of home and to a different town/ city about 5 months ago and this is my first birthday not spent with my family at all, and I'm not seeing them for another 2 weeks. 
Ive come to realise today that I genuinely have no friends. Even with the aid of Facebook to remind of birthdays, the people who I thought cared about me haven't said a word.  
Am I petty for being remotely upset about that? I know people get busy but I always wish the people I care about a happy birthday.  
I'd honestly bend over backwards for so many people I've met and care about and all I get is what on. 
I turned 21 today and ever since my 16th birthday I haven't cared all that much about them but even so I still get at tiny bit excited and low key hope that each one might be different but get disappointed each time.
I did however get a text from my step dad wishing me a happy birthday but it made me angry more than anything.  My mum and him split up just over a year ago and I haven't had much to do with him since. He'd been in my life since I was 4 and I always thought of him as my real dad. I used to think he was great but as I got older I saw things differently and as I grew to learn how my mum felt about him I felt different as well.  His text said something along the lines of 'happy Birthday, hope you have the best day.  I still remember you skipping along with me down to the chooks when you were just 4, now you're 21, it seems just like yesterday. I'm so proud of you. Love you'
My first thought was what the heck! And it made me angry because hes never said anything like that before and i just wish he'd put effort in and said those kinds of things and was actually nice to my mum, my siblings and I back then everything would have  been fine. 
It just made me realise that people don't care or put effort in until it's too late and it just made me more sad.

I have had depression/anxiety issues for the past 10 years or so, along with not enough self worth/self love. I've had relationships and don't have problems attracting women however I recently had a breakup and am currently single again. I have friends, however I still have bouts of loneliness. I wanted to share some things that have helped me out. Recently I have had several breakthroughs/insights and wanted to share those with you all. 

  **Things that have helped me out recently:**

1. Dealing with childhood trauma in a productive, healthy way (not placing blame, remaining as objective as possible). Parents were super controlling and not very loving.
2. Understanding my personality (mainly the big five personality traits) Helped me understand that I’m low in conscientiousness.
3. Goal making/planning and organizing my goals and tasks. Used Jordan Peterson's' self authoring program to figure out my true goals and planned those out
4. Understanding my attachment style. I show some anxious-avoidance. Learning how to be secure.

**So far my conclusions after all this research and insight is that:**

a) Need to resolve past trauma in order to fix habits and behaviors I do not like.

b) Need to work on loving myself

c) I have the ability to improve my life and find the peace and joy (and love) that I'm seeking

**Other things that have helped me during this time:**

My dog, meditation, reading, witnessing my thoughts and removing self critical negative ones, not being so hard on myself, being patient, having fun again, taking up hobbies activities and enjoying the challenge of them, talking to friends, joining reddit :-), cutting out social media.",lonely,Things that have helped me...,2020-03-05 22:18:56

I have never had a girl ask me out or even flirt back with me. I've tried online dating for years, but as an unattractive brown guy, no luck. The few matches I DO get leads to 1 date a year or just getting ghosted.

Initially I tried having this confident persona, obviously didn't work out, so I just was myself. I've got loving friends, I'm charming and I try to be funny (Brown Chandler Bing). I don't have the heart to ask my friends for set ups. Whenever they ask about my love life I jokingly say ""Im supposed to have one?""

I have this one white friend who is moderately atteactive, who I told my situation. He takes me out with other people to clubs or bars ( I am comfortable with partying or hanging out). Everyone else gets attention from new people but me. I can see he tries to make me sound super interesting, but all in vain.

As for people I already know and like their company and vice versa. Well I always fuck it up and drop myself in the friendzone and just accept it's too late. I guess thats how I got such close friends.

I'm a short guy as well, so I decided to start hitting the gym, and I got into a strict regime. I'm starting to shape up in hopes that I would hate myself less, but slowly even that isn't working anymore.

I'm starting to get social anxiety again and self loathing is growing. I know I'm not that boring of a person and that my friends enjoy hanging out with me. I've had an adventurous adolescence, but I still hate my physical self.

I let it go a few times but when I kept constantly getting ignored and only getting called or texted when those friends were bored (none of them know each other, so its more a one on one interaction witheveryone), or when they needed help, and I would gladly be there for them. I even was way busier than them when i was in school and id still make time for them but later on i realized that they could care less to make time for me. lately, a lot of them have stopped talkign to me as often because other, newer people have come into the picture, a few of my friends got boyfriends and now spend most of their time with them (which i udnerstand but i know id balance my time w my bf and friends if i ever get a boyfriend), and another friend always pays attention to our mutual friend more than me when we hang out, i know shes known the mutual friend for longer but it still hurts, whevenr she sees something and even if im right next to her, she will yell at the mutual friend ""hey look at this!"" and make eye contact and interaction with her but not me and it wasnt always like this. my parents and i still do so much for my friend adn the mutual friend but they rarely ask how im doing and lately left me out of somethign i was looking forward to doing with both of them, and didnt tell me, i found out through their social medias. Whenever any of these friends hurt me, they always say im being too sensitive or takign things to far, when really, i have done so much more for them and they treat me like trash, but then they are nice and fun to be with but its like a cycle. i have learned to set boundaries where i dont reach out as much or spend as much time witht hem but its just sad to see someone you once were so close too fade out like this...im always that friend that gets forgotten or replaced when a new friend comes along, and it hurts because i can make many new friends and still balance my time well with the old ones. lately though, no one seems to want to get close even if i try to. im always the one texting first or asking the questions/keeping conversation going and its exhasuting. i just started my new job this week and its tiring because it is new and i wish i had something with friends to look forward to like hanging out w them after work but we rarley do that anymore. i feel like people get bored of me easily or think im no fun, which is weird becasue i try my best to be and i know its not awkward because i only do what i genuinely mean to do, i dont try to be fake.  i recently graduated and my friends have too, and some are still in school but almost done so i understand we are all busy but we used to be tons busier and still made time for each other. im just going through a lot physcially , emtoionally, and mentally in my head and at work and with my health and it hurts more to know that these friends are not wanting to be arond me much for some reason. i dont know why its been a pattern in my life, im always mindful of them and dont make all topics and convos about myself, so i dont get why they would be annoyed with. me, and i also am a great listener and let them vent to me whenever they need so its not like im constantly badgering them... anyone experiencing or experienced the similar thing????",lonely,Lonely Season in Life all of a sudden...,2020-03-05 15:45:20

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26 (M4F) [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2020-03-05 14:50:34
2721,EvoNexen,1583379834,1,"I've been an outsider all my life

Hey guys. Sorry if this is an inappropriate topic to discuss. But I wanted to start a conversation, and see what I can get out of it. Maybe I'll walk away enlightened. 

So here goes.

I've been an outsider all my life. 

All my life, I've been surrounded by people who seem to just easily be able to make friends and build relationships. Everyday, I am surrounded by groups of friends having fun and just enjoying each others company (I'm a university student). I go on social media and I see all these people hanging out with other people, being in relationships, and just generally enjoying life.

Rationally speaking, I am happy for them. It must be great! But I gotta be honest, it makes me feel very bitter. 

Trust me, I understand how stupid and selfish that is. I should be happy for them. And I am. But at the same time, I feel sadness at not being able to have that for myself too. I seem to be having a hard time ignoring these feelings.

One day I could be in a good mood, and if I spent the entire day not making any social contact with anyone and being constantly surrounded by people having fun, it completely eradicates any semblance of a good mood for me. I start getting bitter and resenting people for having fun. (Yeah, I know. This is so stupid and selfish). In fact, the whole reason I'm typing all this is because I had a day exactly like this just today.

I believe this is mostly my fault, though. I don't make any effort to socialize with anyone. I turn down most opportunities when my friends try to make plans. I barely talk to people anywhere I go.

And I think it's because I don't have any motivation to go out and engage in social situations. Funny, right? I crave social engagement yet I don't feel any desire to do shit about my lack of social engagement. But part of me is also scared of going out of my comfort zone and meeting new people. I am too afraid to go to new places and engage with other people. What if they think I am stupid, or worse, not friend material? These are my internal thoughts during these times. 

I'm also grappling with some self-esteem issues. I have a very bad habit of thinking of myself as a burden to literally everyone, everywhere. If I sneeze the wrong way in public, I beat myself up for it pretty hard. If someone is walking towards me, I will almost jump out of their way like I'm playing Hopscotch. How dare I walk in the same line as another person? I will literally go out of my way and devalue myself in hopes of ""not inconveniencing"" some random person.

What I find tremendously fucked up is that the few times my friends have organized birthday parties for me, instead of enjoying it and feeling loved, I feel like I don't deserve this. As the people sing me Happy Birthday, I am just sort of sitting there and feeling like weird and disgusting internally. I never got why. I just pretend to smile and laugh as they cheer my name on. Maybe I feel guilty that people had to spend time and money for my birthday? Or maybe I feel like they're just here because of a social formality and wouldn't be here otherwise? I seem to never be able to accept any compliment. Btw I do feel incredibly grateful to them, though. It's sweet of them to throw me the party. 

And when I do manage to talk to some people, I get attached way too easily to them. I start daydreaming about being best buds with them, doing best bud things with them. If it's a girl, I start imagining my life with her. Again, I don't think I can emphasize enough how stupid this all is. But I can't escape these feelings. 

But at the end, when everything is said and done, I realize that there have to be people who don't feel like shit every time they go out and see other people in groups having fun. They're comfortable in their own skin, and are normal. Being alone in a sea of people doesn't bother them one bit. I guess that's my main problem, my greatest weakness. I haven't realized my own worth. I guess I don't think of myself as a person. I shouldn't ""need"" friends to have a fun life. I haven't really figured out how to do that. But I am completely willing to do anything that needs to be done. 

I'm sorry guys for the overly melodramatic tone but I guess I just want to be as honest as possible to get feedback. Thanks a million guys!",lonely,I’ve been an outsider all my life,2020-03-05 14:43:54

I get it, you feel depressed, that can be fixed. However when literally you are in your room 24/7 with zero people to talk to, it really hurts. Stop treating loneliness like it is depression, loneliness is also having no friends and wanting to go out but having no friends.

The definition of true lonely is the joker. Most of you aren't like the joker in the sense of social attributes and relationships, most of you have so many friends to hang out with and for that i envy you because you get to enjoy life in a way i never will. You get to experience everything including sex. And you wanna sit here and claim the lonely stance, you are NOT lonely, you are depressed. I envy the support circles you have and as a matter of fact i can't wish you nothing but misery and suffering because i feel no remorse for your glamorous life. nothing but ''Normies teeheheheehhe''

People would actually reach OUT TO YOU, if you showed your feelings. I have literally no one, i have no friends, my phonebook consists of family, i only have family./

My grades started slipping, I lost financial aid, and now I don't go to college. I've decided now I want to get into trade school. But my depression has just been getting worse and worse. I have started drinking about every 2 or 3 days. I've tried to reach out and socialize but people either don't even respond or they don't want to hang out. I've been on a few dates with some girls but it never makes it past 1 date, I've been on like 4 different dating apps with zero success.

I'm in uni at the moment, and it sinks in the most when I'm in class and even walking around to the library or classroom, how incredibly lonely I am. My classmates are friendly people but they are all set/fixed with the people they've been with since we started and me trying to insert myself into established friendship groups seems awkward. 
There are some people in my class that I could see myself getting along with and potentially forming a real friendship with, but I don't think they want to pursue anything with me, and their actions/body language/verbal language shows me a lot about them. They seem uninterested or something whenever I try to join in, even with a few chuckles, smiles or interactions with them. They have also found 'their people' and probably don't want to be open to talking or mixing along with anyone else. 
Not one of my classmates would strike a conversation with me. It only happens when we're doing group work together. And it's annoying, cause there's so much more to know about me; who I am / what I like etc than what is topic for the group project. And when I try to converse with them, it's like their energy/vibe feels different as if they don't care or want to talk to me, or anything to say to me but smile - talk to their original people or use their phones. 
It's just so depressing and no one knows that I feel this way or experience this level of loneliness. I brush it off to my family when I'm questioned about feeling lonely. I'm pretty sure they are 100% aware that I have NO friends and that I hang on my cousin's friends that I get along with, just fine. 
Is this a personal or environmental problem? Like? 
I first met 2 of my cousin's best friends in October of 2018 for the first time and now in 2020 I am being invited to one of their birthday celebrations. 
It just goes to show how you can get a long with people if they are willing to put the effort and show interest. And I have NEVER experienced this with any of my classmates. I'm there like I don't exist. And even a ""how are you"" or ""Hi__(my name)"" in uni would make my day 10x better, for real. I just feel so unappreciated and invaluable and friendless in uni. 
I have so many interests and hobbies, I'm known as a family comedian (since I was very young, and still am) I like to have fun, talk, go out etc. And I haven't been able to do that really but feel sadness that I have NO ONE to really do these things with, talk to anyone with, and have fun with. I'm so miserable.
I can't hang on too much onto my cousins friends cause at the end of it, those are her friends. They do things together etc. And I am here, with absolutely no one but myself.
There's lots todo in my city, nice places to travel to etc and I can't even participate if I have no one to go with. And depending too much on family won't work either (people have other commitments/ obligations)

2804,saucepancookies,1583294336,1,"So, my significant other and I went on our first vacation (literally and figuratively, we had never went on an actual vacation in our lives nor with each other) to Florida. What should have been a great trip, triggered the heck out of my depression.. 

Little backstory: I don’t have a close bond with my family; they didn’t really care much that I was leaving or that I would be boarding a plane for the first time, in a completely new and unfamiliar place, etc. And that is okay. That is my “normal”. I usually try to ignore that. However.. my SO’s family was the complete opposite and you can guess how that made me feel... while the mother cried and the father joked about all the mischief and adventure we would have. My inner child came out and bawled like a baby out of envy.. out of frustration.. out of yearning for a family that will never be..

Due to my unique upbringing I am very independent, I need to be to survive. I tried to show excitement and not anxiousness. I talked over the different places I wanted to visit. Maybe   we’ll visit the ‘Harry Potter’ part of the theme park nearby. Or go to Seaworld, etc. 

nope.. didn’t go. I felt like my suggestions were brushed off. Also triggering because that made me feel like I’m not important, I’m not being heard. Okay. Sure. Maybe it’s a budget issue, we are splitting this 50/50 so maybe they’re concerned but then again they also didn’t listen to me when I kept suggestion we actually PLAN this trip out before going. 

Think about it? A vacation away from feeling unimportant at work, and for me also home life, and yet here it is again.. 

I have 0 messages from anyone. 0 calls from home. Etc etc and they receive numerous calls from home and texts from friends. 

I tell myself ... Stop depression you’re ruining this with petty B.S. it keeps growing. Now we’re back home and they post about the trip. Okay cool what did my lovely SO post? Oh.. mainly about how they had a nice trip, glad to be away, and one mention of how they got to spend it with me... okay.. a little vague and 1 photo of me alone.. none of us.. stop depression... it’s fine.. this is .... not fine.

2805,hamartiated,1583293779,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I have a lot of great friends; my roommates and I do a lot of stuff together, I spend time with friends from work pretty regularly, and I have a bunch of friends from college in my city. The thing is, no matter how good of a time I'm having I always have this underlying feeling of loneliness. Sometimes spending time with my friends makes me feel even more lonely than I had been feeling before. The persistent feeling has left me at a point where any small thing can leave me feeling like all I want to do is cry for the rest of the day.

Today we had some friends come over. They come over every week, and it's always a highlight of my week. This morning I was so happy that I got to see them today. By the time I got home I felt so sad and discouraged that I couldn't even bring myself to be in the same room as them and my roommates, and I barely talked to them the whole night. They were understanding of me having a bad night and were so nice about it, but now I'm just so upset with myself because I really wanted to spend some time with them and I blew it.

I know that part of my problem is that I haven't been in a real relationship in around 7 years. I've had one or two short things, but no lasting relationship where I really felt like I made a connection. I try to remind myself that there's more to life than relationships, but I know that part of what I really want is somebody that I can be with that loves me as much as I love them. Of course, I almost always fall for people that are unavailable or not interested in me, and when there is somebody that's interested in me I always seem to mess things up.

I want to get rid of this constant loneliness, but I just end up perpetuating it. Sometimes it's because the feeling is so strong that it's hard for me to break through it, but sometimes it just feels like I'm self-sabotaging.

2813,heyheyheyYEET,1583290517,1,"I’ve been pretty depressed and lonely for the past couple years and thought I would share some entries I had in my notes from when I was feeling especially down. I am struggling with my sexuality and I am a teenager so it’s been pretty hard to find myself as well to deal with wanting something romantic also. 


1.)
It seems as though right now all I can do is wallow in my lonely sadness waiting for the time when I can have a love that I dream of. It may be several years until that time comes but i hope it’s as great as I’ve dreamed. I listen to music about love and heartbreak longing to know the pain of losing someone who’s heart was intertwined with your being. The pain that you lost half of yourself. That pain for some reason in my eyes is beautiful just because they have those memories that are so pure which define the reason for living. Why live to be lonely and long to have someone to love. Recently it’s been difficult to focus on the work around me, it doesn’t make sense to focus on the reality if it’s not the pure moments I wish to keep in my memory forever. Those memories that give elder people the will to live, only to be able to look back on their beautiful past. 


2.)
It’s kinda weird to think about, but sometimes I wonder if people daydream about me like how I do about other people. Building stories and scenarios in their mind about how we’d fall in love and build our life together. Dream about the cute romantic scenarios playing out only in the mind leaving yourself dissatisfied and only more lonely than ever. It’s honestly scary to think that no person would ever think about you like that. If that were to happen it would only mean that the amount of hope for you to have that perfect romantic story book love is so slim to impossible. Also would mean that people don’t like you. Sometimes I wish I could know who liked me because I feel like I would be surprised for some reason. In highschool, it’s like the time before college, a time where you find out who you are. In highschool nobody knows and it’s difficult to know who you are in a spectrum of aspects, especially with who you like romantically. It’s really scary to think that I may never find the person I’m meant to live the rest of my life with. My heart feels empty most of the time as if there is someone to meet in my future that will fill the void that causes me so much pain inside me. I’ve urned to find someone to fill that part of me now more than ever. It hurts to be lonely not only emotionally, but a distinct pain deep inside that you can feel intensely that rarely leaves you.",lonely,Old Writings,2020-03-04 13:55:17

I moved to a new city with my best friend at the time. I don’t know where I am, I don’t know things to do by myself. I have a couple friends here but they are also starting work because we just graduated so they’re busy when I’m not. Or they don’t reply.


My best friend is no longer even a friend. She doesn’t talk to me, she doesn’t care that she doesn’t talk to me. She got a boyfriend and spends every weekend with him, and talks to him on the phone from the moment she gets home until she goes to sleep. I literally never see her. I probably talk to her a combined 10 minutes every week. I haven’t spent more than an hour with her in 4 months. She doesn’t care.


I was feeling very alone. Am I trying to make friends, yes, but that takes time. I got sick last week, and I’m still battling it and I couldn’t even move last weekend. But I had not had any contact with anyone, and I saw my ex friended me on Snapchat. I shouldn’t have accepted it but I did. And now, 3 days later, I paid for it. I got in a fight with him and blocked him. I don’t even know if I reacted correctly. Felt guilty, unblocked, sent an apology text that also stated I could not talk to him. (For reference he does not want to date me. He just wants to talk to me. He has zero interest in me. I dated him for 5 years.) He said nothing to my apology. I highly doubt we will have any form of contact again so I’ll just feel guilty forever.


Fast forward. My roommate was in the kitchen, I told her I found a moldy bowl of water. She said she was growing an avocado seed. I apologized, but there was no seed in it. I think it was my cats, regardless, she smirked at her boyfriend she was FaceTiming like she was trying to hide a smile at something he was doing like I was being annoying, and continued to say nothing to me. I went back in my room.

2835,YoungGuyThrowaway222,1583283267,1,"For context, I'm 24, male obviously, living near NYC. So relatively recently I did two things that one would think would help you make friends, but fell through hard and now I feel like shit about.

#1. Did some after work intramural sports league. And by sports league I mean like bar games and drinking. It went really well during, I thought I made 3 new friends during it but whenever I tried to organize something outside of the specified sports meetup time (like 7pm after work on a weekday) they were never able to do it. And they never offered another time to meet up, always just ""sorry we can't! But maybe next time!"" Only one time when I hosted a BBQ did one of them actually show up (the other 2 said they couldn't make it and they were nice so I believe them) but quickly it got to a point where they never invited me to hang out, and the last time I tried to invite them out, you know just to a bar or something, no answer. Hard ghosted. I don't think they ever invited me out at all.

So that hurt a lot. I thought we were getting along, every game night we had through the sports league went well, we played games, drank, had fun, etc. But apparently I'm not likeable enough to be invited to anything outside the league? 

#2. Going on birthright. If you don't know what birthright is, basically its a trip to israel you can go on if you're Jewish with fellow Jewish kids about your age. After almost two weeks with these people and thinking I made some new friends, radio silence. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the more outgoing people in the group were meeting up every other week. I know some of them have met up after seeing their posts on instagram and snapchat. But did little old me get an invite? Only once, and it was for a generic NYC area group meetup. 

So I'm not like a weird, smelly, totally solo dude I'd like to think. I shower, shave, keep good hygiene, dress well, exercise multiple times a week, was not completely solitary during the trip to israel, got along with some people on the trip very well, but basically these last two instances of making friends, then getting ghosted by them, has made me afraid to try anything else. 

I've been thinking of doing an intramural sport again, like co-ed or casual basketball, but the fear of getting ghosted like that again is hard in my mind. I've always had to do the inviting no matter the group of ""friends"" I was with, at least recently. Am I unlikeable? Am I weird? Hell if I know, judging by how Israel and the intramural sports leagues went I'd like to think not, but judging by how AFTER Israel and the intramural sports league went, I'm not sure.",lonely,"I feel like no one likes me, and I'm afraid to try to go out and make friends again",2020-03-04 11:54:27

I'm 26. ive never had sex. Ive only been in one realtionship, if you removed 3 or 4 days from my life you would remove all the physical in person interaction Ive had with a women romantically. I can talk to women fine, several friends are women and its good. but I just don't know how romance works.

I'm pretty religious at times. Don't want to talk about that AT ALL. But its relevant for the next part.

I started watching porn when I was younger. about 4 or 5 years ago I started talking to women online, sometimes sexually. I just feel so absurdly lonely that I don't know how to deal with it. I just want to feel a connection with someone.

I got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperienced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect .when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I litterally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

That fills me with guilt. But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty womans voice tell me im not a horrible digusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself.

in a perfect world I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embarrassment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word.

A secret that no one knows is that I was so happy when I was diagnosed because I knew it meant I would finally have people at my side. I was only half right, many old friends did finally start talking to me again, but only through text and any time I would try to invite someone over I was met with a myriad of excuses. Even my siblings and father would barely talk to me. One upside is that my mother was finally around and she pretty much didn’t leave my side for the entirety of my treatment. It was a strange feeling being so conflicted at every doctor appointment wanting the cancer to stay because it meant people would maybe talk to me, and obviously at the same time wanting it to go away because being sick and potentially almost dying sucks. I would wonder everyday if my life was worth fighting for if I knew I would go back to being invisible after I was cured.

Anyways, as the title says, I came out of all of it alive. And three months later I am coming home from my university everyday alone and tired. There was no celebration. No one really congratulated me, except my mother who is ecstatic that her son lived. I sound like I am complaining, and maybe I am. I should be grateful for this second chance at life. But everyday I try to make connections with people and fail, everyday I wonder why I went ahead with treatment t for my illness when this is the outcome I was fighting for.

I noticed it had been a while and messaged this person apologising for being distant, and they seemed really cool with the idea of meeting up for a catch-up and said they “forgived me” (even though it was both of our faults we grew distance.)

I was hoping that after 10 years, nothing would’ve been affected by a month or two, because for me nothing had changed. I still saw them as this amazing person who i wanted around.

Around this time I decided to leave my friendship group to move to another (due to toxicity and wanted to be around people who i felt i could be myself around, etc...) and this person thought i used them as a “Plan B” even though I was happy with this new group.

They then proceeded to tell (“bitch”) about this to all her friends, one of which was a person I didn’t get on with very well, and it got spread and obvs made its way back to me.

I thought this was so shocking I called them up about it. Granted I wasn’t the most friendly when I did it but I never would’ve attacked them. Again, long story short, they concluded it was because i have “behavioural patterns/problems.” It may not seem like much but i use to suffer from severe PTSD, anxiety and depression as child/teenager. This person knew this; and they knew I’ve worked so hard on myself to change myself for the better and have apologised so many for the way I was out of guilt.

Hi. I don't know whether this topic is suitable in this room but I weighed up that maybe it is. Feel free to delete the post if it is not suitable here. I guess I just feel like venting my loneliness with regards to a situation in my life that makes me feel a persistent sadness.

I don't feel dateable. I have Aspergers and OCD (the latter is especially difficult, but the former brings its own challenges), and I have a desire for a relationship where I submit to a Dominant woman. If I were to pursue a more conventional relationship, that would be hard enough with AS and OCD but I feel it's an extra struggle if I want to find a relationship of a more irregular kind.

I have a difficult time with putting myself out there, or tolerating the unknown or the uncertain... it seems to me that it's easier in the dating world if one can embrace the unknown or the uncertain, but I feel as though my conditions barely allow it. To me, the unknown and the uncertain are a terrifying prospect to face.

So anyway I just felt like venting. I feel very lonely and unrelateable lately.",lonely,"Autism, BDSM and loneliness",2020-03-04 00:24:56

2893,justedi,1583230020,1,"I think I've always had attachment issues, fear of letting people in, fear of letting myself be vulnerable, fear of needing to part ways. I think what really hurt me was my first real relationship ending disastrously after four years. For a long time I hid myself from the world and hadn't sought companionship, thinking if love was meant to find me it would eventually... but it never did.

I let work and gaming become my life and I'd convinced myself for many years that I just valued my personal free time too much to spend it with anyone else. But once in a while when an opportunity knocked and I'd go on dates or be interested in someone, I would always have something in the back of my head making me wonder if it would be worth the pain and effort if it failed, and ultimately I'd shy away from it.

Because of this, I'm very selective about who I consciously let myself like, let alone fall in love with, and unfortunately the people I'm willing to take that fall for don't feel the same way. And honestly that's fine, I don't go ""Mr. Nice Guy"" about it and I respect how they feel and we just remain friends. Honestly a big part of me is like ""You wouldn't date me? That's cool, I wouldn't either."" Part of me finds a sense of relief in rejection and I continue to just think of the same excuses; I don't have time, it's one less thing to worry about, I'm not meant to be in a relationship, I would probably have trust issues anyway so I'm better off alone, maybe I'm just not likeable in that capacity, etc etc.

I finally moved out on my own a few years ago and the loneliness has been eating away at me slowly. Sometimes I think about getting back in the dating pool or getting over myself and joining an app/site. Sometimes after a long day at work I think it'd be nice to have someone to come home to.

Part of me wants to connect with someone on an intimate level again but old habits die hard and I just tell myself that maybe it's not for me and maybe I just have to come to terms with the idea of dying alone not knowing the love I see others have.

I've been having dreams about meeting someone and having companionship and intimacy and love and I often wake up remembering my reality and feeling hollow. It's 5 a.m. here and I'm in bed writing this because I had one of those dreams again tonight and I woke up in tears.

I thought, surely if I do all this, surely if this person or that likes my pictures or if these many unread texts mean I’m popular, I matter to someone - that I won’t be alone. 

But I should have known better. I was just filling a void that had been there since I was a child. My immigrant mother spent our childhood tutoring other’s children. Our house was always full of kids, of people. She always made time for everyone but us. My father was never home - not because he didn’t want to be, but because he could not be. My father who worked all his life, and has never stopped. Who protected us at all costs, even when we barely saw him for days. 

So I tried really, really hard to fill my life with people. The harder I tried, the quicker they would leave. They wouldn’t stay. I couldn’t make them.

I’ve been alone for ah- 19 years now. And I’m 19. My childhood wasn’t terribly awesome. I had one friend, and eventually I moved and left him behind. I made some new friends in middle school, but moved again.

I made a lot of friends in high school, and got pretty popular. But I was living in a hellhole- my stepmother hated everything about me, even though all I tried to do was help.

I’ve tried finding a special person in my life before, both online and in real life. I tried- but I couldn’t do it. I just didn’t believe I deserved someone like that in my life. So I left them- and I’m sorry, but I also know that it was for the best.

But now- I found someone else. I still don’t believe I deserve them, and they’re absolutely wonderful. I wish I could be there with them right now- laying next to them and talking with them, laughing and watching something with them as we just laid there.

I told them I didn’t want them to be disappointed, so I wanted them to wait a full week to make sure no one better than myself came there way. There’s still a full three days left.

But damn- it hurts. Even thinking that they’re talking with someone else crushes me- but I don’t want them to settle for someone like me. I genuinely want them to be happy, to be loved and to be held and to have someone always there for them. And god- I so, so, /so/ want to be that person for them.

I want to stop- I want to say fuck it, and just screw the next three days and say I’m all for it right now, right this very second. But I can’t, because I care about them so much already.

But eventually a ""political discussions"" text channel was added in the last year and some vocal individuals would go on rants about certain ethnic/religious groups and LGBT folk and it was really disgusting seeing people I thought were fairly chill just show a lot of not only callous indifference towards other groups of people, but sometimes actively wish negative things on these groups. And it was doubly bizarre that these were the same people that occasionally used to share their struggles with depression with me as we formed a sort of support group.

Their talks eventually pushed me away from the server to the point where I just didn't say anything for more months than I know, and I started to wonder why I was still on the server when it was only bringing negative thoughts to mind whenever I checked on it. I finally hit the leave button tonight, but now I'm starting to see how I both have little to no one to really talk to on a consistent, regular basis, but that I also just don't have the energy to keep up socializing anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just thinking last week about how I just want someone to hug. Anyone really. I tried to think of someone I could hug and I couldn't. Someone it would be alright to hug. 

&amp;#x200B;

You never realize how vital it is to your health to simply be touched with affection. I used to ache so bad I could feel it up from my stomach into my teeth. No exaggeration. I feel loneliness like a physical pain. If it's particularly bad, my stomach aches so bad I could almost cry. Just simple touch. I always like to say that it's been about a decade since I've been touched but that's a lie. Most of my life has been wasted in loneliness to some degree. My twenties have just been particularly highlighted by it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It gets hard to breathe at night occasionally. When I turned 28, it got particularly bad. I had to consider that I was going to enter a new decade of life without the basic building blocks of a relationship. I have never had a romantic one. I have a sex drive to deal with but I don't want just sex. I want the closeness. I don't even watch porn anymore. It doesn't supply the emotional underpinning that I need. This lack of romance has mostly been the culmination of my long standing issues with my mental state/health, my personality, where I live, and the options available to me. It got to me really bad one night. I believe I had a panic attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ashamed to talk about this to anyone. There feels like a shame in talking about loneliness in our society. Let alone being lonely. I can't bring myself to tell anyone. And who would want to listen? They have their own problems. I can't bring myself to complain about simple loneliness.",lonely,Do you ever think about how much you just want to be touched?,2020-03-03 12:45:01

2941,GreySnowdrop,1583194917,1,"I moved from a small Eastern European town to the UK. Many people called me brave but I had just nothing to lose. Since I can remember I had been bullied because I was the fat girl. In my family my mother cooked very unhealthy foods and I got used to eat the portion size of an adult man while I was just a kid. My father worked Germany and stayed there during the week days. He had difficulties to show us love or give his time. The only way he know is to buy me and my sister toys and chocolate. Do you know those large 300g Milka bars? I used to ate those every day and this was just the beginning. While my father spent his days away, my mother was at home isolated herself and us. So I couldn’t manage to learn the basic communication skills. When someone told me something, I wasn’t emotionally responding. So I started to mimic these responses. Once my classmate told me about her dad got electric shock and then asked me “why are you smiling, do you think it is funny that my father nearly died?” No, I didn’t mean it, I just thought that a gently smile shows that I’m listening. Other time someone else told me a funny story and I started to smile as I though that this is the right encouraging response. But no. Apparently I have to wait until the funny part otherwise: “do you know the story, did I tell you this before?” will be the response. I had been called (even recently) poker face, blank face as I won’t care but the truth is that this is just something I need to remember to put on my face. If something very funny, I can laugh or the other way, just cry but nothing in between. Back to my family: my mother also neglected us and my sister and we went two separate ways at the early age of us. My father was never physically abusive but he was mentally. I cried every weekend because of him and I’m still scared of the very masculine men. My parents didn’t like that I want to go to university and force me to go to work. I work at the factory for 3 months then the line closed and I couldn’t find an other job. This time I decided to go abroad. I had no money and either spoke the language so I did what I could to get free accommodation abroad. The guy raped me many times and I had to have an abortion to get rid of him but then I only had one week to find a place to live otherwise I would become homeless. I found a guy who liked me and helped me but he has temper issues and it went to physical abuse when he attacked me one night. I left him but I had panic attacks and nightmares even weeks after. I lived in a low maintenance share house. Cockroaches all over the kitchen, neighbors who can’t use properly the toilet and the front door so the house was robbed many times. I woke up once when a mouse ran over my body and after the landlord put poison out the house it was smelled very bad like something rotting. I worked at a company where I had to stand outside in the cold to give away magazines to people for free. Many people were nice but a few times happened that someone followed me and pushed me to the wall and no one stopped to help. I felt humiliated. But during this time I met with a guy who, in the very first time, showed proper love and care towards me.  He is actually a nice guy and I love him. We are married over 6 years. But he is not the right one. He doesn’t like to listen when I’m telling him something, doesn’t like to speak either. I’m with him but feel alone.

I had not the right qualification for the university so I went back to school. I found one which accepts mature students. It teaches science more practical based then theory. I wanted to learn Genetics. I applied to the university and got admission for a really good one. I started last October. I hoped that with my 27 years I won’t be the oldest one but it happened. Because of the age gap and my lack of skills I manage to make zero friends. I go to the uni and sitting there all alone whole day. I tried hard to make friends. I sat next to people, joined societies, get together nights, ect… but ended up going home heart broken. I try to be friendly. I’m polite and helpful. But I’m boring and have no idea what to add when the group is chatting around me because I was so isolated. As my school was more practical based, my level of theory was not that good. The fact that we are 500 people in the dark lecture theater with lack of ventilation doesn’t help either to keep me focusing. I’m behind and lost all the motivation I had. I feel that I have no purpose in my life and I will life my rest of my life alone so why suffer? I feel that no one likes me and I don’t belong anywhere.",lonely,"My whole life is ruined and I try my best to find friends but I can't. I'm trying to be positive, friendly, open, but nothing.

2950,poshjosh1999,1583187044,1,"Hi. I just found this subreddit. 
I’m 20, male, from the UK. 

I was born a Jehovah’s Witness, a very controlling religion meaning you’re strongly discouraged from having outside friends.

Whilst in, I had a number of friends, or ‘friends’. At about 15 I had a short unofficial relationship which ended in disaster (stress and depression because she was crazy), which has pretty well put me off of relationships. 

Even so, I still had a few crushes, one of which lasted years, others which were quite short. At the time I regularly messaged a couple of girls I liked, but didn’t often see. This was around the age of 17/18 once I had left due to their child abuse problem (another long story) 

The problem is, I had lost all of my friends because of this, and the girls I was messaging weren’t necessarily aware I had left, although at the time I was still studying and considering going back. One of the girls was very flirty with me, and we even sent inappropriate messages to each other among other things, but she ultimately friend zoned me which felt bad. 

The other girl liked me too, and thinking back, we had a lot in common and I liked her a lot, but things ended after only a few months (and only messaging, I hadn’t seen her during this time) 

This was only 2/3 years ago, as I said, 17/18 years old we’d have been, but they both got married at 18/19 which is nice. 

Recently I’ve been having weird dreams where I’m dating them, with them, and have strong feelings toward them, which as you can imagine is then all I can think about all day. Why am I having these dreams?! 

So basically the situation is, I have literally no friends, (and the witnesses basically stop you from making friends in ‘the world’, no matter how long you’ve been out). I have depression, anxiety, possibly Aspergers, so going out and making friends is nearly impossible for me, but the real problem is a relationship, I feel as if I’m longing for one, yet everyone I now know are married, witnesses, or I just don’t find them attractive or have anything in common. 

I have no idea how this reads, honestly I just wrote it out to make myself feel better and if anyone else reads it, firstly wow, that’s a lot to read! And secondly, thank you. 

That’s pretty much all I can say, thank you for reading and I look forward to reading your comments or help if you choose to reply :)",lonely,"Sharing my story and problems, first post here",2020-03-03 09:10:44

But I feel that puts me in a position where I could sometimes get guys to sleep with me but no one ever ever wants to be in a relationship with me, which is what I want. This and the fact that I am depressed and suffer from anxiety all the time. And anxiety makes me do stupid things, sometimes to the point where I annoy people too much and they start to pull away. I have a hard time accepting and connecting with others as well. I don't know if it stems from fear of rejection or what.

I feel so unlovable and unwanted because no one ever picked me as boyfriend material. I always have to beg for people's attention: from friends and more so from guys that I like. I think this is because I had always been an ugly duckling basically, not attractive at all in school. I started going to the gym and built a body that is quite okay. The problem is inside I still fear rejection a lot and have very very low self-esteem. I am also very smart (not to brag) by some standard. I feel lonely, in a way where I can't connect with people because I seek very intellectually stimulating conversation. I know it takes time for friendships to develop to that level (or it might never) but I get so tired entertaining superficial friendships, especially compounded with my anxiety, I find myself stuck in a cycle of meeting new people, fearing it won't work out, having my anxiety make me do and say stupid things and push people away. 

I think most people meet me and think I have everything - a good job, quite good looks, good family. I feel they think I am confident and are attracted to all that. But they quickly learn how I am tormented by all my inner demons and that I am a crumbling mess inside, pushing people away, fearing rejection and people leaving, immature and maybe they just decide I am not worth it or that I am not interesting enough.

Especially in the romantic realm, no one ever picks me to be a boyfriend. It seems like I am always JUST good enough to be on the side, maybe a fuckbuddy maybe someone to lead on whilst looking for something better. I am a hopeless romantic and i believe in love. I just am not sure I am worthy of it. My friend told me that I should seek validation from within. But a part of me feels, when people always tell me I am smart and intelligent, I believe them, but when people repeatedly reject me, basically telling me I am unlovable and unworthy, am I supposed to not believe that?",lonely,"Depression, anxiety and low self-esteem ruin my life",2020-03-03 08:53:28

2969,Kakaditz,1583171777,1,"Yesterday I saw a post, in which someone mentioned their age and gender (f), and offered to help lonely people on this sub. I assumed, based on things I had seen on their profile, that they were trying to get people to buy things (namely nude photos). In response, I made a post, which I called out women who target people who are lonely and try to scam them out of money. This led to pretty toxic comment section.

After reading what some people wrote, and admittedly arguing there myself, I felt compelled to clear the air on some things.

I DO NOT believe that only men can be lonely. Every female member of this sub has a right to seek companionship or advice from other lonely people, as well as the male members. I understand that the language in my last post offended some people, and for that, I am sorry. 

I also believe that it’s NOT ONLY women who scam people online. There are men out there who are just as guilty for tricking people into giving them money and other things. If you DO spot people like that in this sub, please report them.

Once again, I apologize. It was not my intention to offend or foster prejudice of any kind. I hope everyone here has the chance to form meaningful connections and gain good advice without any ugliness from people.

As far as making good first impressions are concerned, I feel like if I present myself in the right way it could help me.

Here's some accurate pros/ cons about me, I hope this helps.

Pros:

\- I have a good sense of humor, but it usually only shines when someone else really likes to make jokes as well, and I'm comfortable. Otherwise I'm serious.

\- I'm an artist at heart, and really expressive and honest about how I feel. I crave meaningful experiences, and I say meaningful things.

\- I'm a good looking guy.

\- I love adventure and creativity.

\- I do a lot of thinking about pretty much everything, especially introspective thinking. Good logic too.

\- If I'm given a chance, I could be really good to someone. I could treat them nice, satisfy them, etc. I never betray, and I'm loyal.

Cons:

\- Serious social anxiety/ social isolation. Some-what awkward when I first start talking to someone, not by choice. No clue as to where to find friends, job is a lonely one.

\- Serious depression. Sometimes I come off really negative, rejection always sets me back further, and I feel like I'm trying to fill a void in my soul by talking to people.

\- My loneliness often leads to me giving too much attention to the few people I end up talking to, especially women. I try to ignore them sometimes, but for some reason the thoughts get obsessive in my head, and I end up double texting/ responding right away.

\- I'm too up front with my feelings and it leaves me vulnerable. Then my ego/ pride gets hurt because I get ignored or insulted by the girl I want to impress.

\- Sometimes I approach emotional situations with logic, and people can view me as insensitive or worse.",lonely,How do I make the most of myself? Help,2020-03-03 02:39:54

I didn't anticipate the connection I would make with a fellow attendee. As people piled into the room for the session, a guy sat down in the seat next to mine. During the tutorial, we discovered how lost we both were in regard to what we were learning. After joking about that, we began conversing about a variety of things: school, passions, dreams, food, etc. The conversation didn't stop once the tutorial ended. He asked if we could hang out for awhile afterwards. I agreed. We grabbed some food and began to talk about deep stuff. I was dumbfounded by how open he was about the loneliness he experiences because I feel the same way. Most people don't seem to want to connect past a superficial level and it can be so crippling.

We lost track of time and then realized we had to go our separate ways since we had made prior commitments. He said he wanted to hangout with me again and we hugged each other.

2985,Throwaway_DD123,1583153558,1,"I'll start with a bit of background. I'm 38 and have been living in London for almost 12 years now. 

For 11.5 years I was in a long term relationship. I thought we were happy. We had our struggles like any long term couple but we always said we were each the person that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives with. We both weren't in a rush to get married, our aim was to save up and buy house together first. We both saw that as a priority and a bigger commitment. 

I thought everything was going great. I was happier than I had ever been. Literally fast forward to one Sunday morning when I accidentally intercepted an email from my best friend that he sent to her. The details of which revealed that they had been having an affair. I confronted her about it and she admitted that it had been going on for the last 6 months. Through various points in our relationship I had suspicions that he was in to her. I had once found out that they went to the movies together without telling me. When I asked what was going on I was told I was just being paranoid. I believed it because I would have bet my life that she would never do anything like that to me. 

Fast forward a couple months later and we decided to give things another go. We moved into a new flat and declared that it would be a fresh start for us both. Then things changed...she went from not wanting to getting married to insisting we got married right away. I asked her parents for permission and received their blessing. But when it came to actually proposing I couldn't do it. I told her that I didn't trust her enough at that point to marry her. It ended there. 

I was of the opinion that we ended things amicably. We shared a large group of friends and I was thankful because I thought we both had a support network. Little did I know she was working her hardest to turn everyone against me. Some friends stopped talking to me and when I pressed them I found out she had been telling everyone I used to hit her. I have never raised a hand to her, ever. She, on the other hand, did lose her temper and punched me before in the face and I had the blue eye to prove it. 

I told my parents about this and discovered that she had said the same thing to my step-mum (who I actually consider one of my best friends) and my sister. My sister never told me but that resulted in a massive argument between the two of them. My step-mum told her to stop talking s**t and get her life together. 

I've spoken to my step-mum and my sister about this extensively. Both have pointed out so many situations and interactions that they witnessed. It's nothing short of a toxic relationship. I thought they loved her but they only revealed that she wasn't well liked after a couple years

Despite this I still think I am irreparable. Four years later. Meanwhile, I heard that she got married a few months ago to some other poor guy.

She left me with no one except two friends who are great but they are both happily married with kids so it's not like I can call them and go have a beer on a whim. I feel like I am lost and alone and without a support network to get me through it. 

Relationship wise I have dated twice since then. Both  result in physical symptoms of illness when the commitment becomes serious. I don't sleep. I develop severe gastric reflux. I have panic attacks and anxiety. I don't want to go out. The symptoms disappear as soon as I end the relationship. But then I feel depressed that I am alone and have no one to turn to.

2997,shirokova,1583136626,1,"I was feeling very depressed today and after some self-harm, I decided to read some facebook posts to feel more miserable.

I found a link to a whatsapp group chat run by fans of a certain k-pop group. I joined to have a little chat and forget about my stupid life for a while and soon, they started another group to have a roleplay chat.

It was all good, I knew the things would become really sexual there but as I enjoy it and honestly, I haven't had a kind of sexual chat (even roleplaying) for years, I was happy to be involved.

After ten minutes, the admin of the group kicked me out from both groups without any words. That made me to realize how I'm not good enough even for online ""friends"" or people, for a stupid roleplaying chat and how something as little as that stupid chat made me to feel better even if it lasted ten minutes. Of course as most of these k-pop fans are young girls, I can understand why they act like this but it hurts anyway.

I've been thinking a lot about this, feeling more depressed and trying to understand how the ""online"" world isn't safe anymore. Years ago it was easier to find people, even make a good online friend as most of the people going online were also weird persons trying to find someone different. Now, social media sites are filled up with ""normal"" people, the normies that have great lives and despise us. I remember when people on twitter told me I didn't have the right to talk about politics because I wasn't using a ""real"" picture of myself as a profile picture. And when I used one, they made fun of my hideous appereance instead of discussing their points... also, I got a lot of people unfollowing me while saying ""you tweet too much and I don't want to see your pic too many times on my timeline"".

In Tumblr, I used to have a best friend with similar political views and even if we didn't have too many things in common, we started to chat a lot, daily and for many hours.  We used to talk about our feelings, things happening in our lives, family, pets, etc. but as she was young and beautiful, she never understood how I feel about myself and how much I struggle with life. Finally she stopped talking to me and probably forgot about my existence. I'm sure she is happier without me as she keeps posting and I never got a message from her again.

This Tumblr friend made me feel very unsure about myself when she stopped sending messages. I told her how all my previous online friends left me when they found a partner and how I was still hurting... she made me feel very unworthy of anything good as she really never showed signs of missing me. The roleplaying group chat just proved me how unworthy I am, not only in ""real life"" when people can see my deformed face and body, but also in the ""online world"" where supposedly we are more free and people won't judge us.

Do you think people would treat me the same way if I were beautiful? of course not. If I were beautiful like normal women I shouldn't be here venting, self-harming and crying over online interactions because it's all I can get.

At the end of the day, this is more motivation to kill myself.",lonely,Little rant about how online world is hell...,2020-03-02 19:10:26

I live with my parents and don't have to worry about working as long as I keep studying. I'm healthy and without addictions. I even have some friends that I can spend time with, if I want. 
Yet somehow I feel that I can't appriciate any of that. I simply have no one to talk to about stuff that haunt me. All my friends are (or were recently) clinically depressed, so I can't make them put up with my problems as well. I told my parents once, and they threatened to send me to psychiatric hospital, and then told me that I can start worrying when real life kicks in: taxes, work etc. And it's been going on for years.
In past 7 years I remember being happy only couple of times for short periods of time. I wanted to go to therapist or anyone really who could help me but I can't, because of this thought that maybe I'm not having any problems with my brain, and maybe it's just me being unable to cope with reality. 
I always feel guilty, because there really isn't any reason for me to feel this miserable. Only emotions I felt in last few months were sadness, anger and sometimes for no apparent reason envy. And I don't know why. And there is only one way I can think of, to make this all stop, but I'm a coward who would never be able to kill herself.

3028,hamartiated,1583119305,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I thought I was doing an okay job with handling the loss of my Grandma. Many people encouraged me and told me I was making progress. But after foregoing hospitalization from my other suicide attempt, I was scared that my depression and suicidal tendencies would come back, and continue controlling my life..I  grew up hiding my mental illness,  I had decided to overcome my mental illnesses but this overwhelming grief eventually consumed me. I didn’t know how to process it. The way I was feeling was a new kind of heartache. My everything was called home and I didn’t know how to deal with the ache in my heart. Mygrandma’ last words to me, “to be good” pushed me to become healthier and happier. I’d think of her knowledgeable words when I was feeling low, they repeated over and over in my head. They kept me going.
However, regardless of having this motivation, my strive to become mentally stable and to overcome my depression and suicidal tendencies, would soon diminish. The effort to break my cycle was unsuccessful. My thoughts became more and more negative as days went by. My thinking became so dreadful and I grew tiresome. I genuinely began believing, once again, that I was not strong enough. 
I recall thinking, “a life without my grandma is too painful. I’m not strong enough to deal with this pain nana , I’m sorry”. I knew what I was thinking wasn’t proper but my mental illness evidently took over. This is when I planned my suicide.
I was sober when I planned it. I knew I wanted to live and was trying to better myself but my mental illness convinced me to act otherwise. So I decided to get as fucked up as I could without blacking out. I wasn’t sober anymore but I was aware. I just sat there and cried and cried..Not wanting to die but these bad thoughts clouded my mind. I cried so much while injecting my body with insulin needles and any pills I could find. Needle after needle. My body became weak. I felt it almost instantly. But I kept going. After how many needles, in my drowsy state of mind, I unknowingly messaged some individuals. After doing so, I was starting to pass out because my body became too weak from my sugar levels dropping. I remember an individual phoning me but I don’t remember what I said. I was already going into a coma at this point.. I thought this was my last moment alive. 
Thankfully, I came to. Someone had told my family that I hurt myself, badly. An ambulance was called. As that happened, I was going in and out of a coma.. I can still hear my family members crying and shouting, “I don’t want my nelly to die!” “She’s dying!” Those screams haunt me... I couldn’t stay awake and would only open my eyes for seconds at a time. At some point, I had a seizure. I don’t remember this. I just remember someone dabbing my face and trying to keep me awake. Telling me, “don’t fall asleep. Stay alive”. So I tried. Hearing my families cries hurt me. 
After awhile, I woke up in the ambulance. IV’s were in my arm, my shirt open with cords all around my chest and a blood pressure cuff on my arm. An emt was working furiously to keep me alive. Every time the medicine was inserted through the IV’s, I cried out in pain. It was burning my veins. My veins were popping. The medicine needed to enter my bloodstream quickly, otherwise I’d flatline.. the medicine began working and I became more conscious. I was more aware. I could heard the siren and see the lights on, I drowsily asked the emt, “you only put these on when it’s an emergency. Am I going to die?” He replied, “shh, you’ll be okay. We’re working on getting you stable”. I still felt sleepy, so I closed my eyes for a moment. I felt a rubbing on my chest, I cried out from the pain. The emt told me to not fall asleep. He was speaking to me. I wasn’t interested, my eyes were on the heart monitor. I knew my vitals were not good.  In that moment, I knew there was a chance I could die on my way to the hospital. I didn’t want to die. So I kept trying to answer the EMT’s questions to stay alert. It was so hard to keep my eyes open though. I remember him asking my name. I told him and he told me a story about his daughter, she had the same name as me. Similar histories and interests too. I told him, “maybe I was meant to go through this. Look at the signs.” My eyes closed but the painful chest rub happened again. I continued on like nothing was happening and said, “your daughter and I have the same name, that’s special to me. I’ll remember you. I’m sorry you have to see me like this though but I’m a good person. I’m just very sad”. I don’t remember much of the other conversation but I went silent. After I was becoming even more stable, the driver and the paramedic helping me, switched positions. He jumped out and I heard him puking. It was evident this paramedic genuinely felt for me. (I didn’t learn till later that what I had said to him had affected him greatly. It caused him to go into shock by my choice of words and how my stories hit close to home with him). Even when I was dying, I still asked if that paramedic was okay... Time felt so slow and I just wanted to sleep. I kept trying to stay awake but I’d often doze off. My body started cramping. I was screaming from the pain. All my muscles in my body were tensing up because I had no sugar in my body. The IV could not deliver it fast enough. I had tears rolling down my face from being in such agony as my feet and legs were cramping. I tried to get up to grab my tightening muscles but was held back by restraints. I gripped the bars beside me. I tried to remove the belts holding me down but was soon forced to sit still. If I moved, my IV’s would come out. My veins were so dehydrated from the insulin that any needle would pop my vein. Needles were constantly poking me. The medicine was burning me. My organs began hurting, it felt like I was being stabbed. My muscles were still cramping. And all I could do was scream and cry from the pain. I was sweating from how much agony I was in. I started gagging, probably for many reasons. 
We finally arrive at the hospital. I’m being rushed into the big room for serious emergencies. I’m still crying and screaming but I’m being moved to another stretcher. My clothes are taken off and a gown put on. More IV’s are hooked up to me, nurses rush in. I see a doctor. Everyone’s talking. I suddenly go silent. It occurs to me that screaming won’t do anything so I tell some one near me to put the blanket in my mouth. I’m biting a blanket while tears go down my face. I’m in so much pain. My hands are white from gripping the metal bars on the stretcher. I’m regretting my decision. I fall asleep for awhile then I find myself being transported to a plane. I’m being rushed to a bigger hospital, I’m told. I sleep for the majority of the way and I’m awoken in another emergency room. They put more medicine in me as I silently cry. These doctors are unaware my veins popped. After awhile, I’m stable enough to go to a room. I’m placed in ICU.. 
My arms couldn’t handle the medicine I was being given. My veins were all popped. They tried inserting some more on each wrist. A big needle is inserted into my nearly collapsed veins then I’m crying and screaming “fuck! Ow! Fuck! That hurts!” A nurse tells the doctor to stop. She gives me some pain killer. The pain eases.. The doctor decides to give me a minor surgery and insert an IV in my jugular vein, in my neck. Due to the numbing needle I was given, I could barely feel this happening. I’m stitched up then given more needles. My body was struggling to stay alive.. these needles burned. Finally, after all this. I’m allowed to sleep. My mama is holding my hand and I’m told I’m stable enough to fall asleep. A tear rolls down my face. I’m so grateful to be alive..
Every day I spent in the ICU was agonizing. So many needles, so much pills. I had bruises and needle pokes all over my entire body. My muscles still ached. My body was bloated so bloated I couldn’t walk. The side effects from the meds I was given caused me to throw up any time I’d try eat. I couldn’t even walk to go use the washroom. I seen people die while in the ICU. I heard cries of pain. I seen people on their deathbeds. It was awful. A nurse heard about my incident and told me, “1.0? Sugar? That’s death. Most people wouldn’t survive that. You’re lucky”.
The day finally came when I was allowed to go home. I spoke to therapists while I was in the ICU. Nurses gave me advice. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I also have mood swings that get bad with breakdowns. I was prescribed  two types of pills. I’ve heard a lot of bad stories about anti-depressants or pills to help with mental illnesses. I, however, accept it as I know I cannot overcome my mental illness on my own. I know that’s it’s okay to need a little bit more help. These pills help my mind function properly.
Since I left the hospital, I’ve sobered up. I started working part time. I attend more ceremonies. I tell my family how I’m feeling. I cry more. I try to enjoy my days. With the help of therapists, counsellors, and other support. I can, for the first time since 2012, control my thoughts. I have flashbacks and bad thoughts from time to time but it doesn’t overwhelm me. I can work through my problems. 
It was so freeing to discover I was not a bad person doing these bad things. The good person I knew I was, was in control again. She was just being controlled by mental illnesses. I’m learning to heal. Everyday is a struggle. But I’m not giving up. I have a purpose in this life, and I am determined to keep going. My healing journey has been a tough one, but I survived it.

But my roommate had his girlfriend over and it absolutely crushed me seeing them together. When I got back, they were sitting together on the couch. She was laying down and had her legs in his lap and was rubbing his arm. They were both smiling and laughing watching an episode of always sunny. The way they talked to each other, looked at each other, just seemed so loving and they looked so happy. They had a look in their eyes that I'd never seen before, something that looked like pure distilled happiness and complete ignorance of any negative emotion. After a couple hours they got up to leave. He made a joke about something and she laughed and playfully punched him. He helped her get her coat and she laughed at him for dropping something. They kissed and she grabbed his hand and they left. Right after they left I looked out the window and he was giving her a piggyback ride just running down the sidewalk laughing. It was like something out of a romance movie and realizing that people actually get to experience joy like that in their lives broke me. It showed me how alone I am and how much I'm missing by being such a stupid ugly piece of shit introvert that won't talk to anyone. I realized that I've never experienced anything like that in my 21 years of living this stupid life. It's impossible for me to imagine meeting someone that I could have an experience like that with. No one could act like that around me. After they left, I smoked more weed than I ever have before and blasted music into my ears until 3AM just trying to forget that dark pit of loneliness that manifested in my brain. My life is nothing.

3092,somethingusername0,1583078502,1,"First I would like to start off by saying that “hearing” and “listening” are not the same thing. You can technically hear what someone is saying without actually listening to them.

A few days ago I was talking with my aunt about how I was really anxious about graduating and I was worried that I may have failed some of my classes. Which is something I normally don’t do, but I felt like opening up a bit because I thought she might actually care. Anyway fast forward a little bit and I was telling her that I went ahead and manually calculated my grades. I told her that I did one calculation where I assumed I made a zero on all my upgraded stuff and one where I made a one hundred, both of which were incredibly unlikely. In the best case I would make a B, worst case a C. Not even seconds after I got done explaining all that she says “oh you probably made an A!”

This really got to me because it basically said to me that not a single word that I said past the subject mattered to her at all. On top of that I was already stressed and anxious as it was. I started raising my voice and said that she has a real bad problem with listening and I left without saying another word. 

I don’t know am I just overreacting? I just want to know that someone out there is willing to listen and give a damn about something I say. What is the point in me wasting energy speaking words if they have no bearing on a conversation? Of course when I don’t talk everyone criticizes me for being “quiet” and “antisocial”. Also despite the fact that I made it extremely clear how upset I was over the whole thing she never offered offered an apology and that was days ago. I guess everyone just expects that I’ll get over it, like my feelings don’t actually matter at all.",lonely,I hate how people never listen to what I say even when they do actually hear me,2020-03-02 03:01:42

3100,_mybrainlies_,1583072108,1,"I'm a 36(m) married with a little boy.  We live in a country where we don't speak the language.  While that is not too big of a problem as most people speak English its still hard to deal with it.  It's hard when my son is with his school friends and they are playing and chatting and I have no idea what they are talking about.  I am trying to learn the language, it is just difficult.  We speak English at home and my wife speaks Italian to our son when she is alone with him or with her family and Italian friends.  Whenever we go to Italy to visit her family or friends I still feel the same way as I can understand some of the language but get lost when its spoken to fast.  I can follow along for a bit but after a while it gets exhausting and I kind of just tune out.  

I opened a small cafe and have been working over the winter and its been super slow and we knew that going into it.  Its a seasonal place and the idea is to make enough money over the summer to be able to close for a couple months over winter.  Since we only opened in August of last year we wanted to stay open through the winter to build a small base of customers.  It's working a bit but the slow long cold days have just been punishing me.  I do get to close up early and go home and have dinner with my family.  I love this and I know things will be different in the summer as my hours will be longer and I wont be at home much.  I do enjoy the time with my wife and son and that is basically all that is holding me up.  

Its just besides that I feel lonely in this city.  I have work friends from the previous place I worked at but they are head chefs and managers of businesses.  so there life basically revolves around their jobs.  The days off they have they spend with their partners and family.  And the days off are never the same.  The place I opened is a little kiosk on the pier at a beach.  It is beautiful and I know that it will do amazing in the summer. Right now the weather is shit.  its windy and cold and there is no one up here.  Its draining saying hi to people as they pass by to just be ignored.  I don't know if its intentional but its exhausting and eats at your soul a little bit.  

I think I am happy.  Things are better in my life but I just wish I had more friends.  more laughs.  more interactions.  I don't really want to go out and stuff because after dinner we put our son to bed and my wife and I usually just hang out smoke a joint and Netflix.  Its great.  But then the day, I wake up.  Take my son to school go to work come home and it just happens again.  If I do have time for myself I usually go for a bike ride and chill but I'm usually by myself.  

Things are tough financially right now because the kiosk isn't making any money  because its slow season, but we expected that and its okay.  we will get by.  My wife doesn't bring in much income, but she is a designer and she loves her job, so I support her fully.  Once the kiosk makes some money this summer we will build our savings back up.  Its just hard right now.  

I don't really have anyone to talk to.  I text with my biological brother pretty often recently.  Our relationship has been getting much better and I'm happy about that.  I miss him.  I miss my friends back home.  

I stopped drinking last July.  Alcohol was destroying my life and I had to do something about it.  I did and I feel amazing.  Alcohol has always been a big part of my job and it was consuming me but it did take away some of the loneliness.  There is something special about sitting at a bar chatting with other locals while throwing back a few beers.  I miss that feeling.  

Even now, I am sitting in my Kiosk and its crazy windy outside and I feel like I'm going to blow away but also feel like I should be open because there are people out but no one is stopping because its too windy.  I'm going a little crazy here.

I spent the next morning miserable with a stomach ache. I woke up, ate the two slices anyway, had some coffee, and trotted to the gym, specifically Planet Fitness. I was all alone.

After the gym, I had another coffee, and then went to purchase two house plants. After that I went home and hung out streaming YouTube to drown out the silence. Then I went to a couple of other stores, one was a grocery store and the other two were looking for a plant stand. All ALONE.

I then came home and exchanged texts with co-workers. I got on a discord server and chatted a bit on the Internet, and then surfed the Internet and finally fell asleep.

I woke up this morning all alone. I scheduled a little workout class at 9:30am, which I'll go alone. Then I'll spend the rest of my day ALONE.

Sounds so much simpler than figuring out how to cure cancer, solve poverty, go into space, but it's something everyone else is capable of that i can't figure out.

I suspect it's due to my looks as I am regularly called ugly by complete strangers (happens at least once a month). Anyhow I've decided to be more positive about this and invite you guys to join me if you're also in the position of being unattractive to the opposite or same sex.

1. I don't have to waste money on makeup, hair, and clothes because men think I'm ugly anyways. Up until I found myself unemployed one year ago I spent most of my income desperately trying to improve my appearance. Now I don't have to bother any more because it's useless.

2. I don't have to be thin and can eat all want. I used to maintain a thin weight and go to the gym every day. Now I don't have to bother any more because men didn't like me anyways.

3. I can tell myself I am strong because I'm able to survive without having ever had support or validation in my life.

Literally look forward to it every time. She’s 86 and attends church twice a week, and is so kind and accepting and openminded. She’s what I imagine grandparents to be like. Even if she’s confused she’ll try to follow along with what I’m saying. Even if her legs are hurtin real bad she’s take her walker and shuffle rows down to meet me. Even if she’s sick and her voice is hoarse she’ll come and croak out a conversation and I’ll still take a hug, illness be damned. 

I don’t know, I have mass in a few hours and havent been able to sleep. Was just thinking of her and her hugs :)",lonely,I’m a teenager and the highlight of my week is when the lady at my church gives me a hug and asks me how my day is going,2020-03-01 17:55:53

3144,YodyYeets,1583038462,1,"Idk if this is me being narcissistic, but I do want to hear some opinions. I couldn’t tell you when this first started, but from late elementary school to middle of elementary school over the summer I was apart of a summer camp at a community center. I will admit this camp was really fun at my age the counselors were awesome. The problem was the kids I was with, I felt bullied and didn’t belong with the summer camp cause I was slow with trends at the time for kids my age. They would’ve picked on me, made fun of me, embarrassed me, etc. The counselors did take notice and did some minor things to fix my situation but the damage was still done and I hated to kids I was with. Fast forward the next summer when I stopped going cause my parents felt I was old enough to take care of myself with no one in the house so around 7th grade. Those summers that passed by I was alone the whole time, I had no one to be best friends with and sometimes I would see other kids my age or younger in my neighborhood and I would play with them. But the whole time I felt I was a burden to them because I never included myself with them because I didn’t know them. We moved to a larger town and I still kept going to the same school. (side note: it was my 2nd time moving and the 1st time my family moved to a smaller town) Same thing with the summers but I was a freshman in high school.  Still having no best friends and the people I was friends with at school had other friends they were closer with. I always felt left out. This was when Snapchat was newer and everyone was getting it, I added a couple people. Sophomore year rolls around and I’m able to drive a vehicle anywhere. This is starting to get better as I have more people on snap and I’m talking with more people. I hanged out with a couple people, but still felt alone. Let’s step back a couple years, me and my cousin (which will be shortened to cuz) hung out a lot. Like almost every week he would stay the night and we would do shenanigans like any preteen boys. The reason I still felt alone is because he is family, and I didn’t have anyone outside of it that I was closer with than him. Well sophomore summer is when everything took a turn, I started feeling better, I had new friends, I tried weed for the first time, tried drinking and just felt great breaking the rules like teenagers do. All with my cuz which built a greater bond between us. Then junior year of  high school comes along. I got a girlfriend who I dated for 6 months.  loved more than myself. But it was a rocky relationship (I’m not gonna get into details) but we ended up breaking each others hearts and she left me. The rest of junior year and the summer after that was like misery to me, I couldn’t get over her. I tried moving on but I couldn’t bring myself to another relationship. My cuz and his girlfriend of about 3 years at the time really helped me. They were the only ones who knew how I was feeling and thinking. Nobody understood me except them. People would try to help but I couldn’t let them because the way they did felt like bullshit to me. During this time I built up an ego to defend my pride. I started looking at quotes and modifying them to suit me. Quotes like “We all have an addiction that takes the pain away” and “act like you have nothing when you have everything to lose.” I started writing song lyrics to sad rap beats. I should say after the break up I gained major trust issues, even during the relationship. I would over think things, get super paranoid and just wouldn’t trust people or their word. I am now a senior in high school, my cuz got out of drugs and started a new life, I moved on from my ex, and everything was going fine. I just felt super lonely cause I didn’t have anyone close again, my cuz moved to a different town which is about 45 min aways from mine, even though I still had a car I was gonna drive down there to see him like I use to. So I started hanging with his gf and I never thought of trying to get with her. She became a sister to me when I was going through my breakup. She helped me with so many things. But after some trouble with her mother she ended up moving in with my cuz’s grandparents which is where they are both living to this day. But for me I still feel lonely now. People will put me down if I stand up to them, criticize me on stupid shit. I don’t take shit from anyone, someone says something to me I say something back. But I’m not very fast when it comes to it. The thing with me now is I’m very smart when it comes to understanding people and how they think. When I first got snap I helped people out with problems of their own. And helping people through out the years and letting them vent to you really shows how people operate in certain situations. Now it’s the present, still  a senior, still single, and still trusting no one. And the fast couple months I’ve started pushing everyone aways cause I’m becoming distant with my cuz and his gf. So rn it seems I have no one to be close with again. People try help me on snap and want me to vent to them but I just say “you can’t help me because I’m smart enough to know half the things that you’ll say is bullshit someone else told you.” I’m glad they want to help me, but know one knows how to. Everything I type to people has a lot of meaning behind each word. I love quotes and stories, my English grade may be bad but I believe I can write something that can impact people. With me having my ego I makes me sounds very narcissistic, but I don’t want to be. I want to hear your opinions on what I just said.

3170,TeenagersDepression,1583028018,1,"My friends I've known for years don't want to hang out or play video games and ignore my messages 90% of the time. Our discord is basically me talking to myself at this point and asking questions that never get answered.

My newer friends will at least respond to me, after like 5 hours, but they don't want to hang out either. I make plans with them, but they always cancel.

My girlfriend is busy all the time, we have barely talked this past week. We're long distance, she's seven hours ahead. I usually call her as soon as I get home from school (9:30 her time) and she almost immediately goes to sleep. We talked less than 20 minutes total this past week. She's really sweet and great and she cares about me and all, but sometimes I need a convo that's more than ""hey how are you"" I'm pretty good, and you?"" ""I'm good, school wasn't anything special"" ""hey I think I'm gonna sleep now"" ""okay goodnight, love you"" ""love you too"". Other times she stays up until 2 am doing whatever it is she does and then calls me. Sometimes it feels like talking to me is the thing she does when has literally nothing else to do. One week we'd barely talked, she called me on a Saturday, then ditched me twenty minutes later to call her friend from school for six hours until 4 am, then went to bed when she called me back. That hurt. I make it sound worse than it is, some weekends we talk literally all day, but recently there's been more and more where we only talk for half an hour on a Saturday night. 

I just need someone who cares about me to talk to. Things are not good right now. Things have not been good on a long time. I used to starve myself but I ""recovered"". I realized I gained about 10-15 lbs today and I have barely eaten since. My dad and stepmom argue all the time, my dad is a drunk, I don't know what I'm doing when I graduate, I can't get a job, I told my girlfriend I'd do my best to go see her this summer but I don't know if that's going to happen.

I’m someone that gets along well with others and while I wouldn’t consider myself popular by any means, I have been able to keep as much of an outgoing lifestyle as possible.

One's tendancy to isolate him/herself is a subconcious decision of the brain to protect the being when you consider everyone a threat. I am definitely not saying that we all are victims of the world. just maybe some of us are straight up narcissists who aren't ready to negotiate a little bit to hold a relationship and want to be treated like a princess all the time.

The thing is most probably your condition is just unfortunate, your father left you, your sister molested you and you couldn't seek help, got bullied everyday,your bother was considered better than you, have a mental illness, your best friend betrayed you, you're not capable of excelling at something or whatever it is.

The reason i say unfortunate is because nothing was actually meant to happen to you, you just happened to be the one it happened to.You could come out of it but there is no guarantee or magic formula that could solve your condition. Maybe if you control your every conscious decision to make your life better you could come out of it but some battle scars would still be left.

I was trying to find all the answers but trust me there are none. It is what it is. Constant rejection and betrayal in every field of life has made me totally numb which is worse than feeling depressed. I eat alone I stay alone the friends i had have taken a step ahead in their lives so it's just me now and it's not like i didn't try. I tried hard. very hard. but i understand survivorship bias and it's not meant for everybody and again it's just unfortunate. I am writing this on a saturday night and i am a little drunk, just got rejected idk like the 100th time called my friends up got the final vibe that i am not a part of their lives, failed miserably in an exam that i studied for. and my ocd has gotten worse. I am very afraid for tomorrow and the days to come if i will be able to stay with myself anymore.

I don't know why i wrote this post ,maybe i wanted someone else to feel a little less lonely or maybe just to stop the sound of loneliness in my head. hope you don't end up like me. good luck.",lonely,your answer to loneliness,2020-03-01 04:47:12

3212,ruiiiin,1582997776,1,"I’m a chubby girl, and I’ve lost over 50 pounds for myself. I can’t help but always feel like people will just see me as I am, a girl who’s disposable to them, like I’m nothing. Guys don’t want me even as a friend as soon as they see what I look like, they see me as no benefit to them, females want nothing to do with me either. If you really want to see people for who they really are, you could try being unattractive? Because then you’ll know nobody wants anything from you, everyone is selfish.
I wish people were honest with themselves and other people, wouldn’t life be much simple and easier, everyone would get their closure.

3214,MsUnicornSparkleButt,1582994041,1,"I have a few close friends. I'm the type that's bubbly in public or in groups.  I'm an INFP. I care about those in my circles.  

I'm the one people call or go to for advice, for hangout, etc. Especially for my nieces who are closer in age to me than most of my siblings.  

I've been there for them.  

Made plans and parties for them to consistently bail on me.  And it happened again last night. Niece is going through a bad breakup, have been listening and loving and caring over the last few weeks.  She even said she felt like I was the only who cared. We made plans for a girls night because she needed it. 

But she forgot she made plans with me. No problem, she'd come hang out after.  Nooope. Things went late. Then she was upset that I didn't give much of an answer in response to her bailing.  I don't want to make her feel worse, but I'm not going to tell her it's okay either.  

And I'm tired of it. I just feel sad. I just want people to care about me too instead of being the temporary boost. I wish I could go to a friend store.  Finding friends as an adult is hard.",lonely,When You Make People a Priority and They Don't,2020-03-01 03:34:01
3215,scheteo,1582993489,1,"I'm a soon-to-be 30-years-old man and I have no friends. I am in a relationship with a woman who I adore, but I really miss just having friends. 

I'm a university student, and we used to have a group of friends there, but for whatever reason I have been shut out from that group over the years. I go to lessons alone, I eat lunch alone, and I hang out at the university alone. The only one from that group I'd call a friend these days is not that great at being one, as he more often than not cancels when we have arranged to meet. Part of it has to do with his mental health problems, but sometimes he just makes plans on top of ours or -- like today -- had failed to tell me until the time he was supposed to show up at my place that he had went to another town with his family and it looks like it's going to take a bit longer than planned and thus he cancelled. 

I don't know what it is about me. People at least seem to like me. Some have taken my phone number because they want to hang out but then just never contact me. And with those who I do hang out with, it's always me making the suggestion. I play baseball and the guys there are pleasant enough but maybe not the type of people I could see myself becoming friends with.

Sorry if this post has no place here. I just wanted to vent since the cancellation today once again makes me angry at both him and myself. I tell myself now that I won't bother with him anymore, but in the end I have no other friends so a couple of days from now I'll ask him if we wants to hang out and it annoys me so much that I have no other friends and lack the ability to find any.",lonely,I have a very hard time making friends,2020-03-01 03:24:49

My brother is in prison and I’m not coping in any sense.. and when I say I’m not coping I mean constantly crying, I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, my temper is insanely scary and I feel guilty. 

I’m the only family member visiting him and it really hurts. All the responsibility is on my shoulders while I’m trying to run a household, raise a child, work and study. I visit every two days and he quite literally BEGS me to encourage other family members to visit who flat out refuse to do so. I won’t be able to see him until Thursday next week and I feel absolutely horrible and guilty that I’m enjoying life while he’s rotting away behind bars. 

He’s gone as far to say that if anything were to happen to me then he would be screwed. I’m so lonely, depressed and heartbroken. I never imagined our lives to be like this, never.

3228,Satoshi_Is_Here,1582983205,1,"I went from daily social interactions to maybe once every 3 or 4 months. After I finished high school, I enjoyed being on my own in the summer holiday. It was relaxing.

 Then I went away to university and was basically on my own the whole time for a year.  It was ok. I felt lonely a few times but I was ok. 

I transferred to a local uni and now live with my parents since I could save money and wouldn't be missing out on any social aspect. They're good company in the day, but it's not quote the same as having friends my age. 

After almost 2 years since having daily social interactions I think it has finally caught up with me. I find it hard to sleep since every time I try to sleep, I think about how lonely I am.
