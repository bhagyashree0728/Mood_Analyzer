4,Lozo_snatch,1590917644,1,"I think everyone has at least two masks that they were. The one they were in front of people and one they were when alone. At least that’s the case for me. When I’m with friends or coworkers I’m loud and vibrant and always laughing. But as soon as I get in my car alone I am holding back tears. I drive home alone. I go to sleep alone. I wake up alone. But I put on a brave face for everyone. I look around at everyones happiness and just can’t figure out how they do it. I’ve made good decisions in life. I served in the Army, I got a decent job, never beat up my girlfriend or did any drugs. But somehow finding someone was the hardest thing I could accomplish in life. I was single for years convincing myself that I would be alone forever and honestly I was okay with that. I was okay with being single and lonely. Until I met D. I loved her. And I thought she loved me. I slowly invited her into my world but it wasn’t enough for her. She had fallen for the person I was pretending to be not the shy guilt ridden person I am in reality. She broke it off after years of being together and I was devastated. Then I found out she had fallen in love with one of my backstabbing friends. she an affair with him while we were together. They are now happily married living their best lives and I am now the shell of a human being. Living my Lonely days trying to convince myself that I am happier being alone. But I don’t know if it’s true anymore. I look back and try to relive the past with her. I play out scenes in my head trying to figure out where it all went wrong but I don’t know how.  It’s been over two years since she left me and I still can’t get over her. I try to tell myself to move on but I just physically can’t. I don’t have a single picture of her but I can still clearly see her face and smile. I still miss her. Since she’s gone I quit my job, gained 40 pounds, starting smoking heavily , drinking heavily, lost all will to keep going. I’ve gone to therapy but honestly it didn’t help. im drained physically emotionally financially and I am not finding the way out. I hate how my life has turned out and I want something to happen.

5,missgreeneyez,1590917321,1,"Its been a few weeks since, my 2yr relationship ended, besides the crippling anxiety and depression and during that time I cut off alot of people so despite what my ex thinks I wasnt sitting having multiple conversations with 50 million people like he was, but that aside, im lonely like never before 

I lost my best friend and the only person I thought who was in my corner but even he abandoned me in the end 

The lonliness is consuming, I sit here day after day never ending stream of tears and just constant loneliness

It took me alot to open up after surviving domestic violence and really just a long ass life of trauma and he knew all of this and I dont know just pretended perhaps that I was full of shit I guess over and over, like my cptsd was like some imaginary thing, fuck all communication constantly and once he made something up in his head that was fact or truth no matter what 


I feel so betrayed and hurt, its like he was hell bent on pushing me to the brink of emotional despair

I dont ever think he had a clue in the slightest how deep he hurt me , just threw me in the ""ive heard it all before "" basket and just discarded me time and time again and lied over and over and over while I genuinely sat here alone and fucking needing some human contact or just one fucking person to talk to, while trying to support him through his alcoholism

Im so lonely and hurt because of him 

He forver changed me and the kicker is he doesnt give a flying fuck, I really don't think he ever did, im pretty sure i was ""the get over my ex fiance"" fuck

He broke me 

And he moved on like I never existed, and no one ever checks in on me, I have no siblings and rare to see family

7,NewAgeDumbass,1590913573,1,"Ive been single for more than 4 years now. I've had a best friend (im 19M and shes 19F) for about 8+ years. We've been through so much together and she just flew down to see me (i moved away after we had known each other for 3-4 years) and its been 3 years since the last time we saw each other. Shes been through many relationships and i havent had one in 4 years. On this trip, she told me she has feelings for me and i have them for her. We talked about it one night but agreed not to act upon it in fear of ruining our friendship. The night after, we ended up kissing and talking about how we both wanted to be more than friends. Then the 3rd night, we ended up having sex. Tonight is the 4th night and we're road-tripping back to take her home, we're currently in a hotel room and we were going to have sex but I wasnt really feeling it so we just stopped. 

The past 4-5 years if my life i've been betrayed, played, and lied to by so many people ive had feelings for that ive learned to just turn off. I gave up awhile ago trying to get into a relationship because im not sure how i could trust anybody enough to not hurt me again. I used sex with random girls from Tinder as an escape from the daily things going on in my life. I've never had emotional attachment to any of the girls i've had sex with, this is different. I have heavy feelings for her but im afraid that some part of me is fighting to turn off because its what i've been doing.

I want to spend years and years with this girl, possibly the rest of my life if it works out. I'm afraid i'll turn off my emotions when spending time with her because that all i've known how to do for so long. I've been lonely for so fucking long and I'm tired of it. Shes been through so many toxic relationships and i just want to give her the world.

It started at october when my grandmother died, then I ended up getting in multiple really bad arguments with my boyfriend. March 13th my house burnt down and my aunts three dogs died during it. Now me and my father(the only person I lived with) now live separately. I've gotten in fights with him and he ended up injuring me. Less than a week ago my mother contacted me, after not doing for years, which resulted in a lot of intense arguing with my dad which resulted in him threatening to throw me back at her state or end up in a camp. Then I was forced to not talk to her anymore(even though I really didnt get to know her but two days). Now, the main group of friends I have, one decided to cut me out of their life(saying I neglected them, even though I always tried to talk to them and they would ignore me a lot) and now I don't have my main group of friends to hang around. I feel like a lot is being taken from me and I feel incredibly lonely. I feel bad that my boyfriend has to deal with all of this too. He is pretty social and has three big groups of friends he attends with but stays with me a lot because he feels bad for me. I hate that he stays because he is worried so I encourage him to hang with his friends when he really wants to(because he should be having fun, rather than feeling bad) but its been really tearing me up recently. I feel terribly lonely now and he is currently the only safe keeping I have. I really don't want to burden him with these feelings though.

And then I found out that she kind of likes me and thinks I'm cute, beut doesn't want to date me because are personalities are different. But anytime I see waht she posts I lose faith that she still likes my because its always about boys she thinks are hot, and I look nothing like thise boys.

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinelly feel truely alone. Im trying to hide the pain constantly by distracting myself with video games and movies etc. but every night im alone with my thoughts which is so fucking terrifying. I've struggled with depression on and off for years. It always lingers and comes out in my weakest moments tearing at my insecurities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I feel like i've lost everyone that I ever had a close releationship with. In highschool, I was seen as a loser and a weird kid. I don't really belive I was, but thats just how kids treat kids in highschool. Regardless of that social status though, I had a group of about 12-15 friends who i considered my family. I loved them all so much and we would hang out almost every week at eachothers house and just enjoy eachothers company. I also had a long term girlfriend in highschool which was cool for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

In college I made really close friends as well. There was a perioid where I was never happier. I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years and met a new one a few months after who I was compeletly in love with. I saw a long future with her. College was great up until the ending. Long story short, my girlfriend broke up with me and although we were still friends, I recently ended our friendship because it was unhealthty for me. I still love her and she doesn't feel the same. I also had a fallout with my highschool group of friends. We're still on friendly terms but i feel like we will never be as close as we once were. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that college is over, I feel like i'm left all alone. Everyone i considered my close friends in highschool AND in college are just reduced to friendly friends. Like, sure I recognize I have friends and acquaintances, but at the end of the day, who's really gonna be there for me when I need them most? Who can I talk to when I feel alone and depressed? Who will be there for me when I need someone? The answer is honestly no one. I've never felt this alone and abandoned before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im trying to accept the fact that it is a part of life. People move on and life continues regardless of where anyone is in life. This is just how it is. But it hurts. It fucking hurts.

I feel lonely. (Making friends??) 

I have a disabled family member who I spend much day time caring for, run my own (self employed) buisness and my partner, whilst is lovely, isn’t into a lot of the things I’m into. 

I would describe myself as having two ‘proper’ friends but both for over 18 months have prioritised spending time with their partner and other couples (on weekends) over time with me. I may see them but it’s kind of the ‘I’m finally bored and everyone’s busy - I’ll contact xyz’. 

One of the friends has also started lying to me a lot. Ruining plans this past Friday and then this weekend saying she’s having a family bbq 
but she’s actually at another friends. I had even asked, unlike me, if I’d done something wrong regarding Friday and received frantic apologies and continued lies. 

I have a few other ‘friends’ one has had a baby so is busy understandable and the others I wouldn’t actively contact to make plans as we are kind of friends through the first 2 so it’d be weird without either of them there. 

I am self employed, struggle to make real friends in the industry who aren’t just after something or much older than me. Have made one and she’s lovely but not quite someone I’d be rushing to social events with (not sure that’s her thing) and she’s super busy. 

One thing, which is probably stupid is that all my friends apart from 1 are in the same “group” and yet they all have friends elsewhere due to work / family and so on. 
I just don’t have this and actually wish I did. I’d like to have other friends and open up the opportunities and doing things and being social at other times. I honestly feel like I’m stuck always waiting to see when they’re bored enough to make plans with me. It’s horrid. 
A lot of them have also made friends through their partners but my partner moved miles to live with me. He’s also self employed. 

Anyway, I am ok and have lots more I could write but it’s pointless. I guess what I wanna know is, without working directly with others or  say being a mum or part of a popular local class, how can I make friends... I feel so stupid asking this, but I just don’t know what to do I’m in my early 20’s and I honestly feel so lonely! 

(Just want to add I don’t want 10 fake friends over 2 real ones but having a few more people to see socially would be nice).",lonely,"Early 20’s, feeling lonely, need better friends?",2020-05-31 10:14:42

It lasted from 2016-2019 it ended becouse i betrayed him in a way.Long story short we were out with him and a couple of my friends and a couple of guys passed by,looking very aggressively at us.We were at a crossroad then,and we were supposed to go straight forward yet,he went left for some reason i still,to this day don't know why.From then on he stopped talking to me,ignoring me and generally forgot about me.A friend that went with him said that they almost got beat up and that he still is mad about it.I still to this day carry the guild for that,as i should (in my opinion).The second time (a couple of days ago) was with a online friend i got very attached to,playing games all day and hanging out in general.So i joined the game and saw his avatar veeery different,at first i was confused becouse he didn't even talk to me nor notice me.We had the same item equipped as a sign of friendship.Then i tried talking to him but he ignored me as he was talking with another guy i've never seen before.And thats the last time i saw him...Got unfriended and blocked on discord,kicked from all groups in discord.Now i have literally no one.Even before this happend for some reason i started crying.every.single.day  never had been this sad in my life.Now i've started crying WAAAAAY more than before i just cant control myself.I would say i have depression but im not confirmed so i won't talk about that stuff as its a sensitive subject.English isn't my first language so sorry for any grammatical issues,also its 3AM so my brain isnt working.Thanks for any respond,to be honest no one notices things when i post.",lonely,Lost my best friend and now i did it again,2020-05-31 09:55:00

I know that is dramatic, but I don’t do anything, and I’m becoming cross eyed and stupid. I’ve shut myself in from the world so much, I have been so embarrassed so many times that I’ve just gone inwards. It’s just as simple as being myself, it doesn’t matter if I’m shy. I used to act strange in order to be around other people. As a kid I would make noises, as a teen I would act eccentric. All that did was embarrass me more and set a very clear distance between me and the average person.

How stupid I’ve gotten, how little my life is, how life actually is. The responsibilities of life are something I fear, like anyone. I’ve pushed life off so long because it involves other people, it has to. Life itself isn’t actually that bad, those responsibilities are how you grow, they are rewarding once you look back on them. It’s almost entirely about people, I’ve never been able to let myself into them. I really hope I just get though with it and actually do what I need to. By this point, I am obligated.

I’m not ready yet because I’m focusing on my career and I need gentle support, not some girl that’s going to argue because I forgot to text her back. It’s not like I did it on purpose but she insisted that I was ignoring her and she needed more. I constantly told her that if I wasn’t showing her love in the way she wanted, that she should just leave but somehow she made me feel like shit for putting myself first. I normally wouldn’t put myself first if I felt like it was wrong but In this situation I don’t think I was wrong for making sure I didn’t stress myself out. I soon realized it was time to hit the road and get back on the right path.

80,Hatter_killed_Wonka,1590857568,1,"Long read ahead. (Disclosure: English is my third language) 

My issue is that i am an extremely popular and well liked, but i have absolutely zero friends not even 'fake friends' 

Firstly I'm a 22 year old male doing my final year of law school. I am also a devout Christian. 

I've been struggling with this particular issue for a while and thought things would eventually change, but it hasn't. 

I have severe ADHD (extra hyperactive) but only got diagnosed and started receiving treated in the 10th grade. 

As result i was bullied for being the weird and annoying kid because of my hyperactivity this reputation stuck with me untill the end of senior year. 

My first year in university i had my ADHD ubder control with my medication and no longer i was the weird annoying person, actually the opposite happened. 

I was immensely popular under all the first year students and even the lecturers. People appreciated me for me. 

So much do that i got elected as public relations officer for the University's Judicial Society at the start of second year. Third year ibwas elected to be the Senior Moot and gead researcher for our Moot Society. 

Often people ask to sit next to me in class just so they can talk to me because they say I seem approachable or when someone frim class sees me in public they would greet me in public and introduce me to their friends along the following line
""Meet xxxx, he is in my law class one of the nicest people around"" 

I enjoy socialising and meeting new people.
Often go to the local Mall food court and buy two lunches approach the first person that I see sitting by themselves and ask them if they would like to chat over lunch and then we share lunch and have some good conversations. 

Other times strangers approach me first and ask to chat because they say I'm very approachable. 

I am equally nice to ALL the people I meet and not because I want people to think good of me i dot it because it brings me sincere joy. 

Every third Subday i check up in each and every single person in my contact list i dobt do this ""just because"" I do this because I'm genuinely interested in knowing how theyvare doing ans if tbere is anyway i csn help them if it isn't going well with them. 

NOW MY ACTUAL QUESTION:
How is it that I can be so popular and everyone tells me I'm approachable and kindhearted butvi don't gave aby friends. 

Thisvis my fourthvand last year of university - not once did i receive a gappy birthday message from anyone besides my parents. 

Not once has any asked me to hang out. 

Not once any has asked me how im doung. 

I've never received a text message first that isn't someone asking me a favour the people that ask favours don't even say hi, they just ask the favour and as soon as i help them they don't even say thank you. 

I really want to know why I don't have friends. I want friends abd im startingvti vet depressed. 

P. S
Despite this, I will still be a nice as usual to everyone and gelp tvem snd check up because i dint do those things because i wsbt friends, I do it because i love people.",lonely,Popular but no friends,2020-05-31 02:52:48
81,littleBoy10,1590856949,1,"I am not lonely in school, I have many friends. My parents love me, but I still have this feeling of loneliness, especially when I’m feeling down. I just want someone to love me back, I want someone who can hold my hand, hug me, make me feel special. Guys need love too. The more I think about it the stranger I feel. But not thinking about makes me feel like there is no hope. 

I don’t want to be alone anymore, I need someone who can help me though the difficulties of life and someone I can love and share stories, memories, laughter with. 

I don’t want to be sad anymore.

The music I listen to is ""old"". I'm a young college student who is into Elton John, the rolling stones, Bob Welch. I never liked rap or punk rock, harry styles, justin bieber that my peers are into. This has made it difficult to find people I can relate to. It's strange I've actually found myself able to relate to older adults, but still there is still that gap because, a college student and an adult who has their life settled are on two different paths; so it is not really the same as engaging with someone closer to your age.

85,reddit_discount,1590849343,1,"I've joined this subreddit about a year ago. I had just been broken up with, I had been depressed for a good 4 to 5 years, and my brain was the main source of my misery. In this group, I would find comfort knowing that I'm not the only one who's afraid, whether of loneliness, of social interactions, of death, etc.. I left this subreddit about 2 months ago because I wanted to be in a better mental place, and I just wanna tell you this:
I tried mushrooms, and it was EVERYTHING I've longed for, for YEARS.. For 5 to 6 hours straight, I felt an amount of love that would fill up oceans, and an amount of happiness that was life changing!! I was no longer concerned about aging, death, money, career, or anything, and it wasn't like I forgot about all of my problems, but my perception of them was much healthier and more calm and collected than pure negative impulses. I realized that my ego was the source of all of my mental suffering, and once I got rid of it, my experience of being just elevated to unimagined levels. I had zero judgement, zero hate, and zero anxiety, towards other people and towards myself. It's been a month now almost, and I can tell you that the long lasting effects of this amazing journey are there.
My advice to all the depressed and lonely people here is, try to eliminate your ego whether via meditation or  a guided psychedelic trip. You don't have to be under the control of your anxieties or negative thoughts, you can try and battle those with love. Train yourself to feel love, and empathy, and nothing else. You won't believe what lies on the other side of just a few micrograms of brain chemicals; your experience doesn't have to be like it is today. 
All the love to all of you, everyone is doing their best to find happiness and peace, we've all suffered, we've all done wrong, but I love you all.",lonely,Do you know what it's like to not fear death?,2020-05-31 00:35:43
86,hamartiated,1590843446,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I always make a fool of myself whenever I talk. When it comes to girls I’m a disaster. My face turns red and I basically forget how to speak, I guess it must be because the last real conversation I had with a girl was like 12 years ago. 

I’m pretty sure all the isolation has like fried my brain, I for some reason have started stuttering. I never did before and most of the time, if I’m having a conversation I ain’t even fully there. My mind is somewhere else.

114,Attentive_Attester,1590814211,1,"So...I’ve been talking with my partner (yes, I’m in a relationship), and when talking it was brought to my attention that I really don’t have anyone in my life. He is the only one who really matters and truly cares about me, which is great, but I still can’t fill this void of having 0 people to care about me. My family is out of my life. My family has always been small. I only have one living grandparent (my Grandma on my Mom’s side), my dad and I never really got along and haven’t seen or talked to him in over 6 years, my one out of 2 brothers passed away in 2014 at the young age of 25, my other brother I actually live with. I live with him, his wife and two sons (my nephews: ages 5 and 2). His wife is a bitch and psychotic and is too much that it would be more than a novel on here for me to type out. When I mean psychotic, I mean needs to be locked up, mental house, getting help kinda psychotic and I’m not even saying that to be mean, but definitely needs help but never will or see the problems she has. My brother -who has his family now, was a twin to my other brother who died, so they’ve always been close and him having his family now takes up his time. Him and I never really got along but just tolerated one another but he never is there for me and if I don’t reach out to him via phone, I would never hear from him. We fight very frequent to the point of when we do, we go low and deep to hurt. Long story short, I live with him in their huge house with my partner, but we don’t really talk, see each other and once I move out, that’s the end of that and will never see or talk to him again (which is sad, especially when my nephews get older and won’t have an uncle to hang around and get to know). Then comes my mother. Used to be very close up until recently, where I have now lost all respect for her with the things she has said to me and the toxicity just flowing out of her of evil things she said and done has broken me so bad that 1.) I have nothing to do with her anymore and want nothing to do with her ever again (and her as well with me, as she’s made that clear and concise) and 2.) I may forgive per the words of the lord, but I will never forget. This actually goes for all of my family members. I have let it go to hold any grudges or battles with them. Life is too short for this anyways and even though I have forgiven, they have not, even though there is nothing on my end to forgive. Not saying I’m perfect, but just stating the facts. My grandmother mentioned earlier, lives with my mom, and well, she’s just as equal a culprit as my mom and fits into the same category of evil as her, so, you could safely assume she’s out of my life too. 

Okay, so that’s the family side of tings. Small, and all not a part of my life. 

As far as non-family members, with the exception of my partner, there is no one. I moved around a lot when I was younger (29 yrs old now) and never went too the same school more than 2 years. This remained like this until, well, now actually. I still move a lot, even if it may be the same state, it’s always a new, further city. New people, new faces, new starting points. So, because of this, I never really made “life-long” friends. When I was younger and didn’t realize the facts of life behind it, I would always remain in contact with people I called my friends. Then, as I became older and wiser, I stopped (even though I promised I would), there was no point as I would never go see them again. So I remained alone and independent. 

Ahh, I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T, one thing I did become amazing at. I do have to say, this has taught me to self grow my best version I possibly could. I love to travel any chance I could get. New cities, all alone and meeting new souls who didn’t know me and could just feel, well alive. It was a rush and loved it so I skipped town to hop on a plane almost what seemed like every weekend. Taking my dog with me (my furry best friend) and just killing the slowing thought of being alone with no one...

It’s very sad to me for some reason, that if I did hold a funeral, there would only be one person, Daniel, my current partner. No other people would be there and idk how I feel about this. Not so much a sad feeling, but more,...hmm...embarrassed? Yes, or, hmm, pathetic. Yes, pathetic. Idk how or why I would even let something like this bother me but it does. Life isn’t forever and when it’s game over for me, there’s no real saving me from the thought that it’s just me and myself alone. How does this happen? Why? Am I That much of a douchebag? No. Then why? I guess I’ve always been more of an independent person who always knew how to fend for himself or take care of my self from a young age to now. I was never really big on my youthful charities that regular kids should be apart of or experience and always wanted to learn more. I guess I would always be home and felt that as my comfort zone, so when leaving into public, my anxiety would get so bad I would want too kill the thoughts I’d get in my head and rush home to feel safe. Idk. I really don’t know how to describe it other than I’m alone and no ones apart of my life to love, share, grow and do things with (again, with the exception of my partner, as he understands this).

So idk why I wrote this all out and decided to share as I know myself that nothing will change, no matter what opinions or ideas people suggest. I may agree and be like oh yeah, that’s cool, but in reality know my routes of my everyday life will remain, alone.",lonely,Realized I have No One &amp; My Funeral would be very sad with ZERO attendance...,2020-05-30 14:50:11

117,CleverUsenameHere,1590813152,1,"Exactly what the title says, so im here, kind of to vent, kind of to ask for advice...
I made a post a few days ago about my ex. Its been a year almost exactly since i last spoke to her, and the last few weeks, maybe even a month now i haven't been able to get her out of my head. Ive learned that i still love her, and would still chase her and follow her and pursue her if only she would be willing to put a little bit of work into a relationship... We broke up because i was always thinking in terms of ""us"" and she was thinking in terms of ""her""... I was always more of an afterthought, or at least thats how it felt.
Now im left to wonder, a year later, am i still only an afterthought? Do i even cross her mind at all? Or is she as miserable without me as i am without her?
People on the other post said i was ""strong for walking away from the relationship"" but i wonder if its strength or stubbornness.

I miss her, i want to talk to her, and if i could have a life with her (and actually be loved by her) i would leave the life i have to be with her. To put that into context im 25, have a solid career with a promising future, own 2 houses (my home and a rental property), i live 15 minutes from my family who i love so much, and have a very solid group of friends who get together just to do life... I have a good life... A year removed from the relationship and if she showed she was willing to put in some effort i would leave it all behind... Is that crazy?? Maybe im just lonely. Maybe it was just ""comfortable"" because it was ""known"" and now the unknown is too scary for me and I'm weak and just want what i had because even though it wasnt good it was there... Am I strong and should keep going, or am i just being stubborn and the only thing keeping me from her is my own stupid self?

I dont even know what i would say if i did reach out to her. It was a pretty clean break, nobody was mad at anybody, just sad at the situation...

Its just so weird to think about her, off living her life completely separate from mine. I often think of her as if she was frozen in time the moment we said our last goodbye, but every now and again it hits me that her life went on... Just apart from mine now...

My thoughts are getting less coherent so i guess that's how i know its time to shut up and go to bed... Thanks for letting me vent, any thoughts or advice would be welcome",lonely,"Its late, and I can't get out of my head long enough to fall asleep",2020-05-30 14:32:32

Which was super depressing, because up until that point I was just having a blast with not doing anything in quarantine. But that just reminded me that I've 0 friends, no motivation to do anything and when i return to school, I'll go back to spending 8 hours in a place where I have no one to talk to(I've returned to school now what I meant was I was thinking this on my birthday). It's not like i actively avoid talking to people, it's just that whenever i do talk to someone whether it's at school or some other place they just seem so uninterested to talk me. I remember this time where we had to form groups of 2 in PE class, and i was the only one left with someone else so we had to group up together. But last second another guy from my class shows up and the guy I'm in a group with just leaves me to group up with him without even saying anything to me. It wasn't like those two were good friends  either, you could just tell he desperately wanted to get away from me and that's kinda how it feels every time I'm talking to people outside of my family.

I returned to school this friday which was pretty depressing, had to watch all of my classmates being so happy to see each other again without anyone even saying hi to me. I don't think i actually really spoke to anyone the entire 8 hours i was there, probably said less than 100 words the entire time. Because I'm so embarresed to sit alone at a table and eat lunch, I always just go to the toilets and watch videos on my phone. 

I don't think I'm that bad looking but that little positive is also getting taken away from me since i have started to lose hair. I thought it was just me being paranoid at first but sure enough a year later and now I've a prominent bald spot on the top of my head. I'm far from bald yet though but with how aggresively I'm losing hair i will probably still be in high school when it becomes very visible. I've never really gotten bullied before, but if i went completely bald in high school and already had 0 friends i would just be too easy of a target.

Reading through the whole thing again it might come across if as I'm super depressed or something, but I'm actually pretty happy most of the time but sometimes it just hits me how lonely I'm.

So let's start w/ some background info. Im a 17 yrs old fob who came from Hong Kong. I immigrated to the U.S in 8th grade. I have a good amount of friends at high school. Some of them I only talk to in class and there are 6 ppl that im closest w/. I get along w/ these people at school pretty well and we eat lunch together. Other than seeing them at school, we also have a messenger group chat where we'll share memes and talk abt random things almost everyday. Before quarantine, I had gone out w/ these ppl many times like going to the mall, volunteering at Petsmart, eating dinner, and playing video games at a friend's house. But at the beginning of this year, I noticed something has changed. They started to hangout w/o me (I think last time they went bowling) and I found out that when they talked abt it in front of me during lunch. I sometimes questioned myself what I did wrong but I just couldn't figure it out. I treat them very nicely and for sure I know none of them hates me or anything. In this friends group, Ardee and I are they only ones who can drive ane I've given these ppl so many free rides b4 cuz I consider them as friends. Few days ago, Ardee baked some cookies and delivered them to everyone's house but me. I wasn't mad cuz I knew that i live kinda far from them (they live in the same city) and that it would be a waste of gas for him to drive to my house. Yesterday was the big day - graduation, a day that's supposed to be memorable and fun, however, it was completely ruined because they didn't invite me to take pictures with them. I asked in the group chat if they wanted to meet up and take grad photos and they just ignored my question as if they had not yet taken it and talked about smth else. Afterward I went on ig and saw one of them posted their grad photos w/ everyone tagged except me, and I was in my room left out and sad, almost to the point of committing suicide. I didn't really care that they didn't invite me to go bowling nor deliver cookies to my house. But this time it hurts like hell. I've been waiting for years for this day to come. It's not like I need someone to pick me up to take the photos. They all know I have a car I can go anywhere at anytime, yet no one ever invited me. Grad photo means a lot to me and my heart is completely broken with this surprise, in addition to graduation being cancelled due to the virus.

I also have another friend that I've known for awhile and he's cool too, but he doesn't go to my school.

Honestly, if I didn't have these three people in my life, I would probably feel worse.

But it sucks when you get the sudden realisation that the rest are probably in a separate group chat and not inviting you. And that's not my anxiety speaking either, its facts.

I've seen them speaking about adding eachother on Twitter but I'm never involved. I also hate it when I arrive to school early and one of the fake friends are there and it's only me and them and they say ""if it's just me and you, I'm going to go home"". Wow thanks :D. That really makes me feel better, knowing I'm nothing more than a fucking 2nd choice to you. That really brightened my day :D. Asshole. Go fuck yourself.

i feel rejected because i am rejected by my own mother. what kind of person isn't wanted by his own mother? she's not different than a mom who abandons her son, even whores her son. but more manipulative and deceptive. its harder to notice her damage at least it was harder to me since it took this long. damage was mental, emotional and psychological. not physical. although it had physical consequences like lack of physical maturation. i had a unloving, hateful, hostile, manipulative, malevolent, overbearing mother. no wonder i gave up hope of anything positive when i was a kid without being aware of it. my life makes a lot more sense now. now that i know the truth i wonder if i can feel maybe better or if i'll never be normal. i'll probably never be normal. i ask myself what did i do to deserve this? i must have done something wrong. 

since a year ago or so, i knew i exist as an insurance policy to her but apparently i didn't fully accept it before. i noticed i still feel hurt when she is unfair and hostile towards me. when you accept something, it shouldn't make you feel differently. so i realized i didn't accept the truth. so i paid more attention. that's how i discovered these stuff. 

i feel like my life was stolen from me. i'm grieving something but idk what i'm grieving. a mother i thought i had? or me? i'm crying right now while trying to be quiet.

i don't dare to think of what kind of life other people have with their family. it makes no sense to wish things were different. this is reality. it doesn't make sense to wish i had a bit of relief and comfort from a human. i suppose my relief source is knowing i can always die. it is what comforts me.

Like I used to be great friends with people in school or on my rugby team, but I almost never talked to anyone outside of those things. I'd hang out with people in my departments lounge or after classes, and I'd hang with rugby team mates before or after practices and games. But outside those situations there would be no contact.

2 years ago I moved to a different country for school and work and the situation repeated itself. Now with the lock down and my moving to a new town the problem has compounded itself.

I don't talk to anyone from home really, as soon as I left high school most of the people I knew dropped away, same for college and then university. Rugby kinda stayed even as I kept playing, but since I moved I've talked to about a dozen people or less from my old life.

I live with friends and have followed the lockdown rules/guidance but my housemate (/friend) has not. There are people I've never met spending the night here, and she is going to other houses and even between cities. To make it even worse she's a police officer (and so is her friend staying in my home tonight).

During this time I've been through a breakup and am confined to the house, the park over the road and the supermarket because I don't drive. Before the breakup, before 'lockdown' when the UK was just washing hands and being careful, I asked everyone here if they were happy for me to still see my boyfriend. Now, we are not consulted at all, and are even expected to be enthusiastic about the visitors.

I think her logic is that she is a key worker so the risk is already there, and these extra things don't make a difference. She lost her grandparents to the virus in March and now says that because it has taken the people she loved the most, she has no reason to be careful anymore. I feel for her and have supported her throughout, but the selfishness is really starting to show and my patience is running thin. I am apprehensive go sit in my Dad's garden from Monday because I'm a bigger risk than normal because of her.

Any plans she makes for here automatically become my plans, too, because I have nowhere to go. My 3 day weekend (that I used annual leave for to relax) has been filled with visitors.

Remind me that there are considerate people around, still?

I'm not  and as the years passed I started losing friends, I guess it's not easy to find a good reason why or even a solution to that, but I guess it was a mixture of my own expectations of a friend and who I was as a friend.

191,theforesthunter7,1590749825,1,"So, I was thinking a lot today about confidence. One quote I read was, see yourself the way someone who admires you sees you. But then I thought about it and realized… None of my friends really look up to me. I’m behind everyone career-wise, and my life is kind of a mess — between family tensions, shit mental health, and impulsive/reckless habits. I think they all look down on me or at best, feel sorry for me. The truth is I honestly wonder if I see myself better than I think they see me. Even when they’re being nice, I can’t help but wonder if they really judge me. So, I haven’t really been that invested in keeping up with them. It feels really exhausting to reach out. 

But... I’ve gotten really lonely. Lonely to the point where I’m suddenly really invested in internet friends. Not like Tinder, I really don't like dating sites -- but people from video game servers. I’m judging myself for it, totally. I’ve never been one to be considered romantically “desperate” but here I am in the early hours of the morning wanting to start a conversation with one of the thirsty boys I play video games with who called me hot just because I have a female avatar. I guess I’d just rather talk to people who don’t already know me. But I feel really sad, sitting here waiting on strangers to talk to me.

So I told her and it was good and some of what she said was encouraging,  but after 2-3 days I started to feel a little insecure and unsure. I asked her if we're still cool and if I violate any boundaries to tell me etc. because I don't want to do anything wrong. Was just looking for a little glimmer of hope and reassurance. But I got a lot more than I expected.

Long story short is we are now flirting finally. It's real. Someone's flirting with me, and it's HER who I'm fucking crazy about.

I still feel in disbelief. Nothing has ever happened for me. Back in school girls were attracted to me from time to time but I was too nervous to do anything, and there have been other close calls over the years that lead me to believe that theoretically there's a woman out there who would actually be with me. But I never thought it would happen, least yet with someone I'm attracted to and fucking adore every aspect of; I expected to have to settle for a My 600lb Life type woman if I wanted to not be alone.

So I can't be here anymore.

I'm not suddenly some super optimistic chad, I can't say ""someone out there will love you, just tough it out!"" we all know that's bullshit and some of us are going to die alone (I may yet), but if I can offer one bit of parting advice: try relentlessly, find out what helps you heal after rejection (weed, porn, getting addicted to a game, an escort, whatever you need), and then try some more. Because the ONLY reason I haven't blown it with this girl is because I have 7 or 8 failed attempts between me coming out of hibernation and now under my belt that taught me how to pretend to think like a normal person. I'm an expert now and by the time she figures out what an insecure needy bitch I am, it'll be too late and she'll have to deal with it or help me improve myself lol

Wish I had some interesting thing to tweet, I don't. If I do tweet, it goes to the void.

Idk why normal people use Twitter, it's just such a humiliating platform for people who don't have a business to run.

Also, I just don't have friends...only reason I want to still use Twitter because I follow accounts, like how normal people would do. Keep up to date with news. But it's like being in a party that I'm not invited to, where no one knows me or no one talks to me.


Instagram is different, feels like I'm able to express myself through art or something. 

Facebook, I never followed anyone in highschool. Was probably the only one who didn't use Facebook or anyone social media when was in highschool. So I got no friends there. And I'm not gonna follow them after like 6 years later lol.

I recently graduated high school and turned 18! Yay! However I had the realization I don’t have friends. I moved halfway through my sophomore year, and I just never made good relationships. My old friends never contacted me back, and it takes a while for me to form true good friendships. I have an acquaintance, however I sadly find she enjoys my company more than I do hers. 
This is my last ‘free’ summer before I am heading to college. Where hopefully I make new friends(I’ll try at least) but I don’t want to alone for months. 
I’ve been going on a lot of walks, since there isn’t much to do. Whenever I see a group of people I just have an intense yearning for friends, and start to cry. 
Whenever I am in a new environment, new people etc. I find that no one becomes my friend. I always am generally liked by everyone, but not their friend. Everyone has their friend, someone they pick for ‘dodgeball’ you know, but I’m always last. It’s always made me worry that I am annoying, and I know I can be as I get very excited when someone pays attention to me or wants to hear me talk ya know?

My Spotify ""repeat rewind"" consists of Flogging Molly, Jade  Bird, Bowling for Soup, Johnny Cash, The Front Bottoms, The Ataris,  Jimmy Eat World, The Mountain Goats, Tyler Childers, Barenaked Ladies,  John Prine, and Colter Wall.

217,hamartiated,1590724422,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Two weeks later I was arrested and charged with 2 felony’s. After that everything was different. I became an unruly basic teenage boy but I legit wouldn’t listen to anyone. In highschool I attended 3 schools. The 1st I would play girls get in fights didn’t do my homework at all I legit had a .93gpa... Sophomore year I got pulled after I beat a kid with a belt and was sent to a Christian school. There I met my best friend. He was the best guy on the planet I stg I miss the fuck outta him. I also met who I would call the love of my life. When I turned 17 my best friend passed away in a car accident and less than a month later the girl i loved absolutely crushed me by leaving me. When I was 19 I lost my favorite cousin to a drug OD. When I was 21 I created a Cocain habit myself. (I beat it cold turkey) but now I’m 23 just kind of drifting my parents never listen to what I say they just brush off what I say I tell them my goals and ambitions and they tell me I’m dumb and don’t think things through they don’t support me in any hobby I have and my little brother always has an attitude towards me and my adopted sister acts like I’m the adopted one.... it crushes me cuz I live with all of them and none of them are supportive towards me what so ever... I’m a heavy marijuana user now like very heavy user and it really helps my depression ptsd anxiety and over all feelings and thoughts in my head. When I told my family they were appalled that I smoke weed my moms an RN and still thinks it’s bad and argues with me all the time over it... this year I finally made a new best friend in my opinion and have now made a plan to move out hopefully by end of summer but I have literally no support when I bring up leaving my mom gets sad that I’m leaving and makes excuses for me as to why I should stay but flips around and threatens to kick me out all the time I’m so tired of toxicity in my life and idk what to do..... hopefully I can just vent this out and someone can help me,lonely,Feel insignificant,2020-05-29 12:32:56

I started to notice a trend that one of my friends would always start it, Let’s call him James. I’m not sure where it came from but James always seemed to have it out for me as we got older and due to this my other two mates would always join in. One of these two we will call Frank has been my closest friend but would sometimes join in. As time progressed I started to get left out of plans, Frank would try to get me involved though as much as he could but I’m pretty sure James would try to get me excluded as much as possible. This continued until eventually it got to the point where I would rarely be asked out and James would always have my other two friends around to his house so they wouldn’t have a say who was invited. One day Frank asked me to come out so I made my way to the bus stop. Whilst waiting at the bus stop I get a call from my other mate we will call Steve saying that the plans are cancelled so I walk back home. I find out later that they did carry on with the plans but told me otherwise so I wouldn’t come and blocked me off their snapchat etc so I wouldn’t find out. This crushed me I got extremely drunk and sat on the end of a bridge deciding wether to drop. I text them saying I found out, to which they replied we are no longer friends. 15 years of friendship gone like that. I tried to call them but all of them didn’t reply despite the fact they knew I was upset. This fucked me up quite badly now I have major trust issues and don’t believe I’m good enough for anyone.





Since the above story happened I’ve not really had any friends, I’m not sure how to make them I thought that they were friends for life but it turned out otherwise. I resulted to trying to find a girlfriend to keep me company. I met a girl who I thought was nice I treated her well and then she gave me herpes without disclosing she had it. I already had trust issues from my ‘friends’ but now I’m stuck with this virus for life which has left me no confidence to meet anyone else. I have no friends to talk this through with. My family aren’t really a big help they just worry any time I open up to them the advice they give me doesn’t really help so I just mask my pain so they stop worrying.

 Why? 

Because of their relationships. I lost them, and i feel like they lost themselves. Im not stating that relationship are terrible,  but the way they manage their time between friends and their SO is not the right way to do things. i used to have this best friend always invite me to do stuff with her. She got into a relationship, and everytime i ask her to hang out she has an excuse. One time when we hung out he forced her to be with her while she hung out with me, as if I was a threat (shes like a sister to me, i love her to that extent.) and if i was interested in her, i would have told her years ago. Now i feel like she lost her adventurous spirit. All she does now is stay home and get high with him. Im so sad from that, as she always had plans and we would plan it ahead of time, since often it was travel based.

 Other friends of mine who i would go out with to eat or to travel with got into ones too and they do the same thing. All of my mates that i felt comfortable doing stuff with rather coop themselves at home with their SO and forget their friendships. I remember being in relationships and not changing at all, i balanced my life with friendships and my gf, but also combined them too. I just feel so lost without my team. And i broke down twice because of it. Any advice for anything like this? thank you

We were in the middle of eating our big ice cream when we got a disturbing call from one of our two other friends. She started threathening us, calling us names, insulting us and demanding that we come back to our apartment immidately because they didnt have a key which was with us. The owner of the place was demanding to keep our apartment locked so we had to lock it when we were leaving. Throughout the call we remained as polite as possible while the friend was outrageous. We paid for our ice cream without finishing it and headed to the apartment. 

Other five days me and my best friend didnt even communicate with other two. When the trip was over it was a relief.

I have a “friend group” but really it’s just people I sit with during lunch while I talk to my boyfriend and when he leaves I’m just alone or go to the bathroom. During quarantine it’s been the same in the way that it’s not much different; however, seeing everyone else “missing each other” “ can’t wait to see my friends” makes me truly sad. I literally have nothing to look forward to or miss. My boyfriend is a great guy but in the last 2 months we haven’t really texted as much as we used to. Our relationship is still strong, there isn’t anything wrong. However since he is the only person I can’t talk to, I like calling him at night but he never really wants to. We will schedule a day to play online games or call but he ends up forgetting or something and then feels awful about it ( has happened multiple times). He told me he hasn’t felt very good ( he suffers from depression) and I completely understand that but I have told him quite some times that I’m really lonely and he’s the only person I got so it would be nice if we could talk sometimes cause I felt like that’s the responsibility in a relationship. Doing something for the other even if you don’t feel like it. The other day I asked him to play gta online with me and we agreed on Friday, we didn’t end up playing ( my fault) however on Saturday I asked him to play and he said “yea later” and then later he was playing csgo with his friend and forgot about our thing. I know he doesn’t do it on purpose. Am i being selfish for wanting to vídeo call and talk even if he doesn’t feel himself. It’s been 2 months and I’m personally suffering a lot from it. I have absolutely no one to talk to. I don’t know what to do. I start coming up with stuff in my head in which he actually doesn’t want to talk to me idk.",lonely,Lonely and feel like I’m being selfish with my boyfriend,2020-05-29 01:24:33

\-| However my parents did not want me to have any girlfriends or even female friends and it kind of sucked. Basically was not allowed to talk to females my age. And to hide a relationship was not as simple as my parents did not like me leaving the apartment for any reason other than school and would want confirmation from teachers if I had to go out and do a group project. They did this because “girls are a distraction” or “you are too young to feel love”. And keeping a secret relationship just at school would not have worked as my sibling would have told my parents at a moments notice just to fuck me over just because they could. 

\-| The best part is now my senior year they were surprised I did not have a date for prom???? Acting like they had no hand to play in this. Like what the fuck did they expect? They basically did not want me to talk to girls and now suddenly expect me to somehow gain the ability to do something that had been drilled into my head that I wasn’t allowed to do. And now that I am in college they somehow expect me to have managed to get a girlfriend??? Asking me if I have met anyone or if I talk to/connected to any girls???? 

\-| The best part is my younger sibling isn’t even being treated this way. Not sure if they just felt bad because they fucked up with me and somehow want penance so they give him lenience but whatever. 

\-| So here’s my little rant about why I feel lonely.  But part of it is my own fault in that I shouldn’t have listened to and obey what they said as much as I had. Though I do wish I had the practice and better communication skills that I would have likely received had I gone against their back.

Like actually cares for you as much as you care for them? Like you spend so much time in your room that you feel useless and worthless?

Has it ever gotten to the point that you hate people for having so many friends because your so jealous and that you feel like they're acting fake even if they are who they truly are? I feel so lonely because every time I try to talk to people, I'm always talking to them to become good friends. I know it takes time to make good friends but I'm so desperate to make good friends, because I really don't have any because I started too late.  Does anyone else feel like this?

Have you ever been in a relationship and after a while you realise that they'd trade you in for such little? While you'd give so much?  You first come to the conclusion that it's them. That it's probably their fault. But then it happens again in your next relationship. So you slowly start to realise it's probably you. You realise that maybe your the ugly one. You start to realise maybe your the reason why no one likes you. But you still question why after so many years of being alive, why you have no friends.

All your life you've barely done anything wrong, you've never smoked with the cool kids, you've mostly listened to your parents, you've never broken the law. But still feel like a bad person because no one likes you. Why can't you make friends? Is it you or is it others? Could it be coincidental that everyone you've met, doesn't like you or that they don't care about others? Because even though no one else will care about you, you try to care about them hoping they'd start to care about you.

The act of being around people makes me feel fake. Its such an incredible energy drain that I've never enjoyed the regular friend activities like going to the movies.

300,hamartiated,1590636764,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact.

&amp;#x200B;

Most suggest you go into a Sales job position to practice speaking.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a reason why most people wouldn't take a Sales position. It's torture and that's for the people who are **already** good in public speaking and social situations.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking about the people who pause during mid conversation because the words haven't entered the brain yet. There's some people, myself included, who has to think for a minute to respond to a statement that someone has made. It's not extremely quick unfortunately. I would love a response to be in my mind as soon as someone says something to me. It usually comes a minute or two after the person gets inpatient and angry at me for not responding in a quick manner.

&amp;#x200B;

What would a Sales position do to somebody like me you ask? Make me feel way worse. Now I gotta come up with **THE PERFECT** thing to say extremely fast. I get burned out so quickly and these are the only conversations I have with people on the day to day basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

So a lil bit about myself. My name is Jeff and im from NYC. Born and raised. Its been hard living here because of how expensive it is. Overall, i live with my mother and my small family and pretty much the lockdown has taken a lil bit of a toll on me. Its been rough but i learn to manage it because im an introvert and i game, alot. Over the past few months i been trying to better myself. Meditating, working out and trying to eat better. Honestly its been great. But since the lock down, i kinda just been depressed.   


I've always been alone, No friends. No real family connection, no one. I learned that its better to be around positive company then bad ones. So i tend to stick to myself most of the times. This then leads me to isolating myself from ALOT of people. People could just be..... mean, rude, and straight up terrible.

324,coguankush,1590618755,1,"Hi people, I am in a constant state of confusion since last 5 months. The reason for this is as follows:

I had a friend for 5 years. She is a very straightforward person and blunt. I always liked that in her. I used to help her out with whatever she needed or whenever she needed me. She was there for me on some occasions and sometimes she wasn't. Many time I used to feel that she comes to me only when she needs something or she feels alone. So last December, I started avoiding her like a stupid guy I am. I was thinking that she will come and talk to me once but she didn't cared for it. Later when I confronted her, she clearly said that we are not compatible and she has nothing to do with that. I have alone for a while now and loosing her was traumatic. When she said all those things, I got angry and I said few things as well. After saying things aggressively, I felt guilty and I gave her a small gift and apologized. She hasn't responded till today.

Now I understand she wants to be alone. But for me, it's very hard to let someone go. I am in constant state of anxiety and confusion thinking whether I did something wrong. And if I did, was I this wrong that she cannot even talk and try to resolve things. Worst part is she doesn't even care and I am living in hell all day thinking about her and our fight since last month.

337,prettycloudy33,1590615190,1,"	Currently on a 5 minute timer, taking a break from a research paper on COVID-19, rethinking my life and how downhill it had gotten. 2 years ago, I had a best friend, plus a lot of other good friends and acquaintances. I was actually at a constant state of happiness, looking forward to talking to people and making new friends everyday. I would even smile at strangers or I'de try really hard to have a meaningful interaction with as many people as I could for as long as I could. I was such a people's person and so fascinated with life. It really was like a cheesy coming of age movie kind of happiness, and I felt like I was on the top of the world. Fast forward to now, I just had gotten out of a toxic, codependent relationship with someone for a little over a year that I didn't even really like (my fault, I'm completely ashamed of this). On almost my 3rd year of community college that I was pressured to going to instead of my dream school and I can't stop thinking about how I missed my opportunity for the traditional, full college experience I sincerely wanted. I even was forced into a major I really didn't care for at all when i had started as opposed to my passion that I've worked on my entire life. I haven't done anything regarding my passion consistently since 2 years ago, in fact I'de consider it now another one of my deepest insecurities (narcissists will do that to you). I'm deciding to finally change my major and follow my dreams, but my school situation is a faaaat mess. Since all this has happened, I had dug a hole for myself and hid from everybody: family, close friends, even from the stranger frenzy I would have when I'de go out. I just shut the entire world out, right when I felt as if my life was only beginning. Like I came crashing down and fell in a pit of mud. I used to love myself, but now everyday is a constant battle with staying positive, sticking through the bullshit, desperately trying to assimilate back into society.
	I have no friends, whatsoever, which is odd to think. I was a huge extrovert and thrived from making other people happy, having deep, entertaining conversations with just about anyone who was open to one. I can't even make eye contact with people, or maintain a good smile anymore, I'm just scared... Today, I'm 19, turning 20 soon. To be honest, I would say I'm even a conventionally physically attractive person (which makes it a bit more frustrating because it feels like all this potential is just culminating to disappointment. Not saying this to 'brag', but because this is genuinely a factor that affects me), but it doesn't even matter because people stay away from me because of my anxious behavior. I know I'm young and have so much time to turn my life around, but godamn I feel like a mess. A loser. Everyday, I'm trying my hardest to choose happiness over anything. Trying to pick up what I left off with two years ago, but I don't think I'll ever be as confident as I was before. At least, that's not what I'm seeing now. 
	I'm just so confused, lonely, and unhappy. I don't want to be an unhappy person, I want to be who I was 2 years ago. Positive, radiant, enthusiastic and uplifting. The decisions I made during these crucial times in my life has brought me here, and I don't know how to forgive myself. At this point, my relationship with myself feels like a spoiled marriage and its affecting every aspect of my life.

i was a ""mature"" kid, sure, but that was mostly just because i was quiet and well-behaved (see also; anxious and afraid of my mother) and constantly wanted to please adults. i *lived* off even the tiniest scraps of praise anyone gave me, and if i'm being honest, i still do. so, flash forward to today, and i've never met someone i feel like i can actually *relate* to.

i know how pretentious that sounds, yes.

I'm 16 and I have this massive crush on my classmate. I mean I keep thinking about her ALL THE TIME. I'm not exaggerating, whenever I start doing something else, I just come straight back to the same thoughts of loneliness and depression. We text each other sometimes about homework, but the conversation never really takes off after that. 

I actually feel like I'm pretty good looking and I'm really good at football, so it kills me that the reason I don't have a gf is my personality. I feel very lonely when I'm at home and I promise myself that I will try to be more social and get rid of my anxiety around people. But whenever I actually get around other people (my teammates before training or school) I just run out of things to say and just end up staying quiet. I feel like I have no personality. 

Then I come back home depressed, after seeing my friends who have girlfriends, don't have a worry in the world and just live in the moment. Now there is no school for me to go to and be around my crush so it's even worse, even if I rarely approached her anyway.

I've been thinking about asking her to meet up and honestly I'm not as afraid of her refusing, as I am of my anxiety taking over and me staying quiet with her. I sometimes feel like I'm not quite good enough for her.

373,Darker-Blue,1590584107,1,"From the moment I laid eyes on her, I was in love. And if you met me you’d know, I’m not the love at first sight guy.

In college, she lived downstairs from me. I told my roommate at the time “I’m going to marry the girl in Apt. 424” in jest later that day. He decided he was going to take me down there to say hi. We take the stairs, right by her door, and as I get into the hallway her gaze stops me dead in my tracks. Every shred of confidence I had pumped right out of my chest, along with my heart. 

(Let’s call me, Jay. We’ll call her Cay.)

“Jay?!” She exclaimed.
*Fuck. I’m losing my mind.*
“Jay, is that you.”
*Have you met this girl before? Say something you fucking idiot.*

I’m not so good with emotional responses, so my inner Batman yells “How do you know my name!?”
*Rude idiot*
“My cousin is best friends with your brother! She told me to look out for you and say hi! I’m Cay.”

We’re going to flash forward six years. Cay and I have maintained a solid friendship, and me a rock solid crush. Life works in mysterious ways however, Cay had a boyfriend when I met her, I had a girlfriend when they broke up. Nonetheless we spent plenty of time together, hikes, gym, yoga, almost getting kicked out of school together, joining the LARP Club in college together, going to her art shows (she was the true work of art). Point is, we were real friends who spent plenty of time together. The other men in the friend group would try, and I’d sit in aching silence, trying my damndest to respect her freedom to choose. Also Cay had no idea I was already in love with her.

Let’s pause the 6 year flash forward to a night on the third year we met each other, I’d just broken up with my girlfriend at the time, Cay came over with a bottle of wine to cheer me up. We drank, and she let me touch her butt, people. Needless to say, I wasn’t hung up on the breakup for long.

Resume at the end of the six the year. Other than one largely harmless night, things remain platonic. Cay, who’d had a boyfriend for a while now stopped showing up with him. Stopped talking about him. Stopped smiling as often. As any friend does, I tried my best to be there, but I had my own shit going on at the time. I was doing my best to hide my pain, we both were. So, when I mentioned my manic buy, cruise ticket to Cuba she’d said; “Awe, I wish I could go!”

So come.
“Alright!”
*Fuck. What’s this familiar feeling*
“How expensive is it?”
*Say something you idiot.*

Three months later, we both escaped our problems on a four day booze cruise to Cuba. On our way there Cay opens up to me about her separation, I let her know I had a strong suspicion, and that I’d also been trying to escape the thought of someone. Queue the blurred lines.

Now I swear to your god that when I booked the room, I asked for two beds. When we got in there, there was only one, and I was NOT gonna push them apart to separate them. She didn’t seem too concerned. We grabbed some food, got hit on by swingers almost immediately, and returned to the room for a nap after the long trip to the dock.

No funny business. We wake up, check out the rest of the boat, what it’s got to offer, get free drinks obviously. And we got an early night because the next morning we’d be in Cuba. I think we spooned, but again, no funny business.

I’m Cuban, but not born naturally. It’s always been a dream of mine to see Cuba, that’s why I got the tickets. If you’ve been recently you know that Cuba is facing hard times right now. They pump raw sewage into the water surrounding the island, sprinklers and pools are all drained, some buildings have exposed rebar and are missing faces, and people live there. Very sad.

What’s not so sad, is holding her sun dress that was just a little too long so she didn’t trip while balancing on a rock wall along the shore, 12 ft above Cuba’s sewage. I don’t speak a lick of Portuguese, but she did, and my Spanish sucks so I wanted to try to convince the locals we were Brazilians and not Americans. We made up a story, we were married and on our honeymoon. We thought people would be nicer, and they were. We had real Cuban sandwiches, cigars, Havana Club in Cuba. We spent hours walking to this beautiful mosaic neighborhood, Fuesterlandia (google it), just to call a taxi to finish the job. On the taxi ride back, she’d rested her head on my shoulder electively. 

*Fuck. Don’t think into it. It’s a long walk she’s probably tired.*

All in all, good time. We had a late dinner together on the boat that night docked in Cuba. Something about her and those city lights, I didn’t think it was possible but I was somehow more in love with her now after spending the day escorting her through Cuba. 

Clubs, Cameras, Action.

The whole timeline gets a bit blurry, from all the alcohol, but what you need to know is this. I’d been writing in my diary sun on the second “day”, to be followed by the third “night”. That’s how it works on cruises. Anyways. Journal, she’s there. The cruel mistress laid the foundation for fantasy, if it were an anime I would’ve gotten a bloody nose when she said “So, I guess we should sort of talk about privacy. I know you’re a guy, and I’m probably going to want to too! Do you think we should put a sock on the door when we masturbate?”

*Fuck. Shit.*
I sort of smile and let out a noise but I’m at a loss for words. 

I guess I’ll take a second to back track and just say, I’m not bad looking. I’m fairly confident, and my reasoning abilities usually trump my emotional responses. I’ve got more than enough notches under my belt, hell I’d been consistently sexually active since I was 14 so why is it when it comes to her, I’m just not the man everyone else thought I was? It’s a four letter word, some call it LOVE, I call it OUCH.

So after gargling noises at her as a response to the masturbation thing, it gets quiet between us. All you can here is the quick successive breaths of pen strokes writing vigorously in my journal.
I confess to the book how long I’ve loved her. How the thought of having sex with her was too much to tolerate. How I admire her for being so bold, when I’m so scared.

Too many minutes sat in silence prompts her to ask “Hey, I didn’t make you feel uncomfortable with that question, did I?”

If you only knew how I really felt; I replied waving my journal as a gesture.

Without hesitation, her hand lurches forth snatching the journal from my hand. It’s on like Donkey Kong. We are at this point, legitimately wrestling in the middle of a cruise deck over this journal. I manage to get my fingers on the pages, which I tore off and ate right there.

Crisis Averted? Wrong. There’s a new crisis. She’s pouting. I made her pout. I’d probably beat myself up if I accidentally over salted her food, so to actually disappoint her was the leverage she needed. I told her I’d rewrite the passage in Spanish and she could try to read it. She spoke Portuguese, so I figured some of it would translate, but not all, and if we’re being honest, I wanted her to know how I felt.

SO, six years it took me to make my first move. And I couldn’t even physically say it. I had to write it down.

She’s flattered, but uneasy. We’re both dealing with breakups. We probably shouldn’t go there we agree... but maybe it wouldn’t hurt if we just held hands. Or shared my chest between her head and her hand. And maybe it wouldn’t hurt if I put my arm around her and smelled her hair. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt if we could explore these feelings over a fancy dinner that night?

Psych. It hurt.

Excited about our budding feelings, we fled to the room to get ready for dinner. We made two rules on the way to the room, no kissing on the mouth, no penetrative sex. Queue Mr. and Mrs. Smith fighting each other as an outlet for fighting our desire to break those rules. We kept each other so close, she straddled me with one leg, as her other but cheek rest on the freshly cleared desk in our room. My hand around her neck holding her head against the wall as she tried tempting me with her lips. I trade blows and tempt right back with everything I’d learned in the last ten years. It got outta hand, but we followed the rules.

I showered first and went to take a nap since I figured it’d take her hours to get ready. I woke up to the only woman I’ve ever loved crying at the foot of the bed and I am in sheer panic. What’s wrong, are you hurt, all the questions as she sobs into my chest. She reveals the guilt she’s dealing with dating another man so soon after the breakup. We didn’t need to explore those feelings, I just needed her to stop crying which is tearing me apart, especially since I’m at fault. I canceled the plans. Figuring we both probably needed a minute, I went for a walk around the boat.

*You’re such a fucking idiot. Why would you make your move now? This cruise was supposed to help us get away from all that pain. Why’d you have to go and tell her how you felt? This is all your fault.*

I beat myself up pretty bad for a couple hours until I was able to finally find enough peace to face her again. I found her, gave her my best smile, soaked in tears as it may be, and said “Let’s go get a drink.” We did, silently speaking the conversation of “I’m sorry, it wasn’t supposed to be like this” to one another.

Eventually we needed some rest after putting down enough old fashioned’s to put a diabetic in a coma. We slept separately in the same bed, that’s literal, but also a metaphor.

I woke up around 4-5 am? Grabbed my pillow, snuck out of bed and headed toward the front of the ship. There was a jacuzzi way up front, I made myself comfortable and stared at the sky as it transitioned from black, to shades of red, to blue. I watched the clouds take form as the light reflected off them, herding like gas bag sea monsters. I distracted myself with the beauty in this world for a couple hours until she finally caught up with me. 

We talked about the night prior, how if anything were to happen, it needed to be special. Not just a first kiss in some hotel room, we were on a cruise to beautiful islands, if it was going to happen, we’d know when the moment was right, like a beautiful sunrise. She knew exactly where I was.

She joined me in the hot tub, where we sat in silence, the energy between us is different now. After both of us spent the night hurt and alone, we just wanted our friend to be with. So that’s what we did, comforted each other as friends would over a hard experience. The sun is rising now, and the mood is setting. We’re out of the tub standing at the front of the ship. It’s chilly, we just got out of the water, and the sea breeze and cold night air are ever present. I use my towel (she didn’t bring one) to shelter us from the elements while we watch the sunrise. She turns around.

*Fuck*

We stare into each others eyes.

*Fuck*

There is a magnetism here, but I’m not willing to hurt her again. And when I should’ve kissed her, I didn’t. I hugged her. I wanted to show her that her friendship meant more to me than her affection. She understood.

The hug heals wounds, and suddenly we’re back to holding hands and being all giddy again. My commitment to friendship solidifying our ability to act kinesthetically with one another. After all, we were “married”.

I should mention at this point, you are currently reliving the best day of my life.

So, we pull up to this private island. Booze is included, and I’m on a sandy beach, straddled by a beautiful Brazilian woman under a palm tree who’s feeding me beer while I use my knuckles to gain leverage for my head on the beach chair. Literally, how I’ve always described heaven. Drinking continues.

She’s a lifeguard so I challenged her to a race to the buoyant. Boo-wee. Bouie. I’m not sure how to spell it, the thing in the water that says you’ve gone too far. I smoked her, cause like I said, I’m Cuban. But this far out her feet don’t touch the ground and mine barely do. So she latches on to me, stomach to stomach, and hitched a ride back to sure.

Face to face like this, hair wet, beads of water adding a shimmer to the girl who already glows to me. Feeling her body against mine. And I’m walking slow to enjoy every second of this. The level of tension rises, causing us both to stare off in separate directions. We come back at the same time only to spot each others lips and kiss.

WAIT. NO NO NO NO. Surely that didn’t count.

We kiss again. And that one definitely counts.

I’m going to spare you the details, but again. I’m quite reserved, emotionally as well, PDA should be fineable in my opinion. But this day? There was not a spot in the sand we didn’t roll around in.

After all the details that I left out, No, penetration didn’t happen. I think, idk we were drunk and there was kind of a moment on some rocks in the water. But after all that rule breaking, we begin to have that explorative feelings talk. Mind you I stopped having strong feelings in the second grade and adopted a much tougher world view, but something about her just colors me in. We talk about values, future plans, past, everything. 

She ends up getting too drunk, so we decided to go back to the boat where she taught 5 kids their first swear word. Laid across a bench meant for 4 people with her feet pressing into some strangers back. And I just could not be embarrassed, I was in love. And I tan, tatted, young, and in shape, dared someone to say something to my “wife” with the stare the hood taught me. And I put her down for a nap. 

Little did I know death was 24 hours away.

We try to go out later that night, because we had so much fun on the first night clubbing we headed there. This was fun, but I think we were both in a rush to see how close we could get to breaking rule # 2 and Man, did. we. get. close. We left the club somewhere around midnight, and spent the next 6 hours trembling in the palm of one another’s hand. We’re going to skip forward a bit, details details details, best I’ve ever had, and I didn’t even “have” it. 6 am we are absolutely exhausted and drunk and we were supposed to be out of the room by 9. Fat chance, we left that boat around 1 PM if I’m not mistaken. 

I’m borderline diabetic so I’m pretty much blind at this point from four days of drinking, we’re both a mess. But we managed to make it off the boat and into a taxi to the airport. We try to eat, I actually couldn’t for two weeks after this experience I was so nauseas. But there’s
A different energy going into this day. The vacation is over. And in a layover in Philadelphia she told me what we had stays there in fairness to her recent “ex”. And I “understood”, but I never really did. It’s been two years now, and we don’t talk much anymore.

I think it’s got a lot to do with guilt, turns out she actually manic bought some other things as well so she couldn’t pay me back for a year and it became about money. Lack of closure to the situation. There’s a lot to unpack.

She told me she wouldn’t be ready for another commitment for 10 years. And in doing so put my heart in reserve. It’s been two years now, and it hurts like it was yesterday. I can’t form relationships with anyone new because they’re just not her. And every new number I get, kiss I share, it’s all a constant reminder of the best, and worst, day of my life.",lonely,A Death in Philadelphia;,2020-05-27 22:55:07

408,hamartiated,1590549286,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I understand it's an important day to them, so I make sure to wish them a good day and get them a thoughtful gift. but when it comes down to my birthday I couldn't care less.. I think it's a mix of me not really being interested in celebrating and me not getting a message or gift from anyone the last 8 years which made birthdays, not a special day I guess. a funny thing I noticed too is that all my past friendships end before my birthday. or if I remain friends with someone, then that person realizes after weeks or months that my birthday passed. they brush it off or say that it's because I never put 'it's my birthday' or 'birthday girl' as my status so people remember. not even  sure if I'm allowed to feel disappointed, to be honest.",lonely,birthdays... don't know how to feel about them.,2020-05-27 13:00:12

Social media. I don’t even know why I keep torturing myself with that. I’m not lucky enough to have love in my life, I’ve accepted that. Your vacations look amazing, your weddings look beautiful.

I don’t understand why people get divorced, or argue, or get sick of their kids, etc. I would give anything to have that love in my life and I would be the best at it! I would never lose it over trivial matters. Maybe just a grass is greener perspective....

Looking for people from around the world and nearby to talk too. I can be shy at first but after a little bit I am not. I do not mind people who talk non stop, I prefer people who some people think can be annoying talking to much. The clingy type people I tend to like to talk to a lot more. I always like to listen to any stories or problems you may have in your life.

Hobbies are video games (was xbox but recently built a PC), learning how the stock market works, watching TV shows, listening to all types of music, taking care of my animals (tortoise, baby turtle and cichlids, have had all different kinds of pets/reptiles, so if you need help on picking a reptile and how to take care of it feel free to ask me) and fishing anywhere that has water in it. Usually more of a introvert unless it involves some type of fishing.

Games I play- Valorant, Minecraft and Overwatch but always trying different games too. I have played all kinds of other games before. Love any games that have some sort of competitive mode in it but I do enjoy playing some relaxing non competitive games from time to time.

I do have discord and snap if you like to use those instead.",lonely,M USA Anyone Else Lonely And Want To Talk?,2020-05-27 12:29:23

Today is my 21st birthday, and while I don't like to make a big deal out of birthdays in general, I still appreciate it greatly when my friends wish me happy birthday. Sadly, none did this year. I keep reasoning through it, telling myself that it's quarantine and time is a blur, or that they care deep down and just forgot, but it still hurts just a little bit. My family wished me, which I really appreciated, but we're not particularly close and I was really hoping that at least my closest friends would remember.

I left the house to go on a walk and quietly sang happy birthday to myself in the dark, and as stupid as this sounds it actually made me smile a bit.

414,minadorlia,1590546167,1,"hi. it's my first time posting on reddit. it's currently 4 am and since I've been drowning in thoughts I decided to write some of them down here. this is about how loneliness has taken over my life. I'm not proud to share this but to give you an idea of how lonely I am, I have a total of 3 contacts on my phone. my mom, psychiatrist and an old high school teacher from a few years back. of course, I appreciate them. I've been this lonely for almost 6/7 years.  I'm in my worst stage of loneliness but all of those years have been incredibly lonely. I am not going to sugar coat things, It is my fault. to keep things short, I have mental health problems that I have been struggling hard with. I never was the type of person that had lots of friends. I used to have 1 to 3 good friends. But my problems resulted in people not understanding my depressed state and leaving, which I totally understand. The one friend that stuck around and kept checking on me eventually had to move on too. whenever i experience negative emotions my throat and mouth shut down. all i can do is silently cry. I'm not used to sharing anything about myself. not even the tiniest thing. so let alone my emotions or thoughts. i really do want to lighten my heart and share my problems but thoughts and regret stop me from doing so. I realized that if my life is going to continue being this lonely I rather not be here anymore. it is too hard.

I'm so lonely. I have been for awhile now. It almost feels like I've been lonely for as long as I can remember. I'm about to move to a new place, meet new people. But I'm sick of doing that. I'm sick of moving around and having brief connections with people and then leaving because something or everything falls apart. I'm so sick of being alone and navigating this life all by myself. I just want to have a community, a purpose, a reason to live I guess. I'm so lonely it hurts. It hurts so bad. 

My best friend currently lives in the city that I'm moving too. I'm scared she's angry that I'm moving to the same city as her. I'm scared she won't want to see me or hang out with me. Not that I even need to spend a lot of time with her, just a little bit. I'm scared that me moving to the same city as her is going to ruin our friendship, because I'm scared it's just going to reveal and solidify that she doesn't really care about me that much. 

I recently just started to have an actual relationship/connection with my dad. We were never close when I was growing up for various reasons. That has been nice, but I almost want to say to him, too little, too late. But I also want to forgive and not be angry. At least he is here for me the best that he can be now. I'm so confused.

And so I’m lonely and had a lot of arguments with my parents, got super depressed many times since I decided to end it. Simple solution, right? Just ask for forgiveness and hope she understands.

423,IReallyLikedThisPost,1590542518,1,"At my college, there’s this small group of people (like 5ish) who are all friends. A few months ago, me and this one other girl started hanging out with them since neither of us really had a concrete friend group. The rest of the term passed and we all hung out a decent amount, but I always found myself being the last one to arrive, and usually by chance, as if the rest of them all knew ahead of time that they were gonna do something. When I stopped by, they’d all be kind and Invite me, but I was confused as to why I didn’t know sooner. 

Now, we all lived in the same small dorm house (before corona) so lots of times people are hanging out because they just ran into each other. However I’m confused as to why it seems like the other girl was integrated deeply into the friend group whereas I’m sort of just a satellite member who just tags along sometimes. It feels as if the whole time I was just injecting myself into their get togethers, and now I’m worried i was a burden the whole time. 

To further add to my confusion, an sort of odd situation occurred. Our dorm house has a discord server for all the freshman, and one person asked if people wanted to check a math set. So, me and one other person (not in that friend group) liked the message, so we set up a time and we all entered the voice call to check. However, soon after everyone in that friend group who was taking the class (including the girl who was also new to the friend group) joined at around the same time. So, it makes me think that they all have a group chat and messaged each other to check the set when the rest of us joined, and thus that means they have a group chat that I’m not in. 

I seriously don’t know how to go about this. I feel like i should be apart of theirs (if they do have one) given I have hung out with them just ask much as the other girl who was new to the group, so I really don’t know if I even deserve to be in the chat anyway. Do I straight up ask one of them if there’s a group chat? Or mention that “we should totally have a group chat to discuss (whatever topic we were talking about)” since I do text some of them (which further adds to the confusion). 

Sorry for how long this is. I’ve just been trying so hard to be chill at making friends and it just seems like everyone else gravitated toward each other except for me.",lonely,Halfway into a friend group? Think I’m being left out of a group chat?,2020-05-27 11:21:58

427,DifficultEffective8,1590538825,1,"Hello, and welcome to our server, The Circle of Dannebrog. What is Dannebrog you may ask;

Dannebrogism is a philosophy that is based around this thought: You feel as if you are in your own bubble all the time and that it may or may not prevent you from enjoying your life the conventional way. This is caused by having a way of thinking disconnected from the mass. This way of thinking originates from a ""discovery"", this discovery might be religious, philosophical or whatever, fact of the matter is that it disconnects you from people who ignore it, to summarize it, it is a self awareness that has grown on you so much that it hinders you socially/emotionally or otherwise. This can cause a lot of loneliness as you feel as if nobody can even begin to understand your line of thought, maybe they'll think you're stupid, pretencious, asocial and so on and so forth. This state of mind is what the people of this server have called Dannebrog; An awareness of self and an awareness of others that causes you to be a marginal. The Circle of Dannebrog has been created to enhance the lifestyle of people who feel this way by providing a proper space where they can share ideas and thoughts without fear of being misunderstood, A support server for a niche no one even thinks about. We do not claim to be smarter than the mass, but we do claim to have each learned something that has set us apart from the mass, what we learned each may be false or maybe it is true, this server is used to determine it by abiding to, this ""Dannebrogism"", a made up, abstract term for people with abstract thoughts.

If you feel as if you've become aware of something or aware of yourself to the point of virtual mental isolation, then this server is for you. Our members will do their best to provide support, to encourage your ideas or to break any possible disillusion you may have ;). 
• Debates
• Lax rules
• Healthy environment
• Brainstorming about lifestyle

434,bat_chips,1590533354,1,"I dont even know where to begin... I have a colorful history of being moved around from state to state with an unstable, alcoholic, and very abusive mother who had a tendency to leave me behind with strangers to go drinking with the next guy. I became a victim to sexual abuse very early on. And finally to my grandfather whom I was left in the care of at a very early age due to my mom's predictable action of being put in jail. He was also flooded by the FBI while my children were there due to being part of a child pornography ring. My brother, who had a different father ignored it all and wasnt bothered by him the least bit. He wasn't a girl. This haunted me for a while as my father showed up from some place in Kansas to meet me and live with my grandfather temporarily to only move out and hitch up with some woman hooked on drugs who gets knocked up and ods shortly after because she cant handle being a mom. I switched schools a lot and didnt keep friends and my grades started to falter. My mother eventually went back and forth with me and she gave me money to keep me around along with allowing me as a teenager to go wherever with whomever I please and do whatever I please. This led to drug use, very early alcohol problems that dont allow me to drink today at the age of 27. Also it led to my eventual pregnancy at the age of 16 to a 19 year old, who on the same day, went to jail for numerous reasons I was unaware of. My mother was excited instead of unsupportive. So I became a mother at 17. Wasnt ready in the least. I still wanted to party and live it up. I lashed out violently in my ways such as leaving her behind to do the same things my mother did with me. At the age of 2 I had found out, she had Autism. Things were rough and I was still very depressed and needed some sort of acceptance in my mentality. I fought with my mother a lot as she tried to get me to be better than what she was, after she had settled down and married some guy who really isnt much at all. Now, they dont even sleep in the same room anymore and she doesn't work and plays video games and is a hypochondriac but that's her life. Again, I fell for a guy I dated in high school, the first guy who gave me attention and made me feel like gold with my daughter. I thought I was in love and then a little while later... I got pregnant with my son. Things were okay for a while, we lived together, I was healthy and happy. But I started to see who he was and I was very tired of it. He would control me and manipulate me like I was property to the point where he cornered me in the shower with my son in my arms. He also struck me across the face. I left him. We are mutual now with my son who is now 6 but we do get into spats. Mainly because of my current/ending relationship. After a few years, I started to date HIM. At my work, things got sour real quick. I don't know if it's the massive amounts of drinking or the drugs his family exposed me to, such ad adderall vicodin, but things went south quick. I went to the ward because he left me behind so easily after the connections I made with him. After allowing him into my kids lives. I wanted to die. I was so tired of people not wanting me or leaving me behind. I didnt want to feel the weight anymore. So I went away for a while. And he called me in there. The first person to be there when I was normally alone. He made me feel things I thought were fairy tale. I had hope again. After a while, we got back together...and I got pregnant. My pregnancy... worse than before. I felt horrible for the stress I put on my baby while she was inside me as I was so desperately depressed. I stopped caring about who I was and what I looked like, whereas before, I glowed. I should have known, when he never just looked at me and told me I was pretty or beautiful. I should have known when it was just me going up to him and kissing him and telling him how happy he made me. I should have known that as soon as sex was over, he hopped on his computer and left me behind for this cyber world. He never once wiped away my tears and told me he loved me so much. Instead, he left me behind in silence to cry, pretending I wasnt there or altogether leaving me. Eventually I got so tired of him being sucked away into drinking or playing video games that I snapped on him and yelled and was angry when I was pregnant. He put his hand around my throat then. Only briefly but for a few seconds he didnt realize what he did. As soon as he did, he ran. And I let it go. I shouldn't have but I did. I was dumb then. But I didnt want to be alone. Also if you didnt figure it out, due to my past, I tend to not be able to make friends and push them away due to not feeling accepted or loved back. I'm very introverted and have the worst social anxiety so because of this habit instilled in my at age 27, it is very, very hard for me to make, real, true friends. The second time he did it when I punched his computer screen when he got worse, he strangled me and left bruises. I got a PFA... which last two weeks until I felt hopeless and worthless without him. Anyways. It's been almost 5 years since we were together. I've done things for him I've done for nobody. He was what I thought my future was. But the past couple of months, I feel drained and have seen who he truly is with his work. He respects nothing and no one except himself. He constantly hides things and tabs and looks at other girls. He never is affectionate with me besides wanting sex. He said something rude to me about my son and I slapped him. I was cold to him for a couple days and then he tried to be affectionate with me. I told him, that was it. I couldn't do the computer anymore. I couldn't have that be the most important thing in his life over his family, the kids, our home. It came before everything. I broke down and cried my deepest, painful cry I've ever cried and told him how unhappy I was. And today, I took a personal day from doing physical labor all weekend and to go to the store with my girls. And today, he packed up his computer and his clothes and left me while we were at the store. He made his choice so easy. I'm so angry and hurt. I feel so stupid. Honestly... I was just the little girl believing in true love that someone could be so passionate in return... today I feel I started to believe love doesn't truly exist and is a metaphor for what brings us, and only us happy. I'm 27 with 3 kids, and I don't want to be alone... I wanted love. I wanted him to choose love.

I am honestly not the best at socializing with people- I would even say that I am an introvert who doesn't like to socialize. Yet- in recent times, I have begin to find myself to wanting to spend more time with people.

So- too preface, I have been struggling with the thought that my own group of friends might not be the right ones for me and if I should just explain how I am really feeling and then maybe back off/take a break from them for awhile or if I could just be having the wrong thoughts again and should probably seek out a therapist or help of some sort.

My friends of six are actually really good people- however, some of them have a mixture of anxiety, social anxiety, feeling strange, and as a result- would be a little bit more withdrawn. I feel close to one of the people in the group, but the rest, I do not. I feel as if they have their own things going on and I feel as if I am not close enough to them for them to talk to me. I have tried a variety of things to grow closer to them.

Those ways would include: being the first to initiate conversation, being the first to come up with plans for us to play games together from time to time, and even go as far as to rope us all into a group chat, once was with their permission, the other was me explaining I just wanted to try and grow closer to them, to which they accepted and remained in it. I have done all of this in an attempt to grow closer to them. However, after about a few days, or a week or two, these activities would die down and I find myself back to a situation where everything feels dead, and when it starts to feel that way, my mind starts to wander to negative thoughts, and my mood is slowly turned from decent to bad. When that happens, I end up struggling with the thought that either something is wrong and I am not doing my best, that they might be annoyed with me, or they just don't enjoy this concept of socializing and it all just slowly goes back to the point to where its all silent. Any time I try to message the individuals themselves, either they might not respond to me at all (some of this is due to social anxiety or anxiety), or its just a short conversation that really goes no where.

The friend that I feel close too has told me repeatedly, time and time again, that me and everyone is fine, nothing else is wrong and things are just slow and quiet. I, however, despite the constant explanations, still have my doubts about this. I still feel ignored, I still feel like as if I am not part of the group, and I still feel as if there is stuff they can do for us all to feel connected. I feel as though I am the only one who really tries to connect with them, and I honestly feel its getting to a point to where there is not much I can really do on my part.

Could I be overreacting about this or does it really sound like there could be a problem that might need to be addressed and if my time might be better spent somewhere else if no other solution is viable.

TL:DR, I still don't feel connected with this group at all and despite the constant explanations from them as to why they are like that and don't like talking and such, I still feel like there is more they can do on their part, because it mostly feels like that I'm the one who initiates the attempts and might feel like my time could be better used somewhere else",lonely,I am having doubts that I really feel connected with my current group of friends and need help.,2020-05-27 07:47:01

445,idontcareanymore21,1590524221,1,"I’m Sorry if I come across weird or whatever, I’m not used to using Reddit. I’ve always wanted an account to keep up to date with stuff I like but never got round to it. I’m a fairly private person and I’ve never really posted anything like this before but i might as well try. 

I’m 21, soon to be 22. I’m Scottish and from the Edinburgh area. I’m here because the person I loved more than anything in this world just left me. We have been in lockdown together as well this entire time. We have been together over 2 1/2 years, but known eachother for about 5. Without going into too much detail, I’ve had a fairly difficult life. I lost a lot of my friends when I was in my teenage years, and then I moved and lost the rest of them when I was 18. Long story’s, not important, just a detail that I don’t have any friends. Not a single one. Other than this account, I also have no social media. I have had in the past, but never enjoyed it and it caused more harm than good. Anyway, I don’t really know what to say. I guess I’m here today because she left me. I know, people will think I’m only 21, it doesn’t matter etc. But she was all I had, and she was all I cared for. She was the only reason I was still going on. She was my best friend. She had a very complicated life as well, we where both very broken souls who found eachother. I’ll never be able to thank her enough. Anyway, point being, she’s gone. And I’m confused. I’m lost. I’m lonely. I’m back at my parents place, I drove here, distraught. I considered crashing my car on purpose , but didn’t. The realisation that other than my family, I have no one left, is destroying me. I love my family, but We are all busy people with good relationships, but that doesn’t stop me feeling lonely, now that she’s gone. 

I’m not looking for anything, or anyone, I’m just lonely. I used to have a lot of friends, of both sexes, I don’t discriminate. I play guitar, and enjoy books, and movies, and I work as a labourer at the moment, how ever I have been to college to study Legal services, but life got in the way. I know this post probably is just something everyone will wonder what the point in posting it was, even I don’t know. I’m just lonely. And I’m sad. It’s hard to be told that someone you love hates you, and is sick of the site of you. It’s been very hard hitting, hearing how someone truly feels about me. The last person I had left, gone. 

I’m not a bad person, and I’m not a saint. I’m not super exciting, and I’m not great at anything in life, but I am lonely. I just, I guess I just want to let the world know how I feel, I want to feel like I exist , just a little. I hope everyone is safe, and I’m sorry for this weird rabbling post, I just dunno where to post or what to say really.

But as for friends, i feel like i have nothing in common with them. I’m a lefty and they’re all tories, i shared an opinion and was attacked from all sides. One of them in particular is a massive cunt - and a posh one too. So after a ‘debate’ i got really pissed and didn’t speak to them for a day, and then a week, and then a month, until i suddenly had a large amount autism. I went on the group chat, which i had muted, and just said some funny shit - and now they’ll all think it was some sort of joke, if they even realised i was gone.

I honestly don't really know what it's like to be loved considering I've never dated anyone, kissed anyone, or even held hands with anyone, anytime I talked to guys they always wanted to just hookup with me, and it doesn't help when my siblings or friends tell me about the things their SO does for them..as if I'm supposed to relate to it or something. Honestly the only time I felt loved was with my mom..but she's no longer here anymore, even though that's a different kind of love..it's honestly the only thing I know, Its not that im trying to rush anything..but I want to experience these things, I've been sheltered my whole life by my family..so now that I'm finally older I want to live and experience these kind of things, even if it's for a short period of time, and of course when I tell my friends or siblings they don't understand because they have someone, I don't need advice but I just want to see if anyone can relate to what I'm feeling.

but if you want to just talk. I’m down 
- A bit about myself - I love to write stories. Most of the time I write about students life in high school. First fight, first kiss, first s*x and everything. 
   Also I do like read a good book. Mostly they are about live in a high school or about teenagers. 
   So I'm currently studying In my second year in Technical University of Oil and Gas Industry. 
   I do not want to sound nerdy, so I do go to the gym and like to do push ups and lift ups mostly. 

   I love to play video games. But I think i love more old games like Left 4 Dead1/2, The lord of the rings raising of witch king. 
And if you loves the others I’d like to know about them more from you!

    I listen to pretty much everything -
Dax, XXXTENTACION, Joyner Lucas, K. Lamar, Billie, The Beatles, Asap Rocky, Juice wrld.

I enjoy watching series on Netflix and scary gameplays on YouTube. 

I also enjoy watching movies/shows together while on the phone or voice chat or you name it.

We talked on the phone and i told her i had to cut her out of my life because after 4 years her inability to ""choose me"" was tearing me apart and i couldnt move on if there was any shred of hope that she ever would.

465,goingtothecircus,1590508680,1,"There is something that has been really bothering me that I am not sure how to explain properly but I will try. I'll try to keep it short. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the past few years I have been feeling depressed about the fact I have never been in a relationship before. I'm 26 years old now and almost everybody I know is married or living with their partner and starting families. It makes me feel hurt and more lonely because I want those things too. But it also reminds me of my health and mental issues that would make it difficult if I were to have those things.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger I had this plan to be celibate and live for God as a single woman helping homeless people/doing ministry. I thought that was God's plan for me and I seriously believed it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have bad social anxiety and misophonia and OCD. I also have POTS, possible Lupus and Sjogren's. These conditions would make having a family very hard and I don't want to make someone else's life miserable because of me. I never thought I would want children but ever since I turned 24 I started having that desire, and I worry about that. I don't know if it is an honest desire, or if it is because I feel left out.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with fantasizing a lot. I daydream a lot about having a relationship and my own family. It calms me down and takes me to such a peaceful place. I don't think it is good to do that so much though.  But I use daydreaming to cope with my anxiety a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I felt very lonely. I spent the evening with my sister and her family but it wasn't soul-fulfilling in the sense I felt connection or closeness really. I can't talk to them about stuff and so I have to put on a front to protect myself sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of their neighbors had their first child yesterday morning and they showed me pictures, etc. I tried to be happy for them but deep down it triggered my feelings of being left out. I think their neighbors are my age and they already have progressed so  far in life. Marriage, a house, and now a baby. It makes me feel sad because I want those things too. I want someone to love and take care of. I want a partner. I want stability and friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw how close my sister was with her neighbors and it made me wish I wasn't so shy and socially anxious so I could make friends with the people around me as well. It all just piled up on me and I started feeling really lonely and empty. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came home and cried and told God I wish I could be normal and not have anxiety and health problems and not be afraid of people. I feel like I am wasting my life. I know I need to make change.

528,ScaryPerspective1,1590454442,1,"TL;DR at the end of the post if you can't be bothered.

It's  crazy how far I've gone to try and find that one friend that clicks  with me. To be honest, for the past 5 years every decision I've made was  with making friends in my mind. I only got through high school because I  always thought ""Next year, is going to be the year."". I only joined a  prestigious college because I always thought ""If I make it there, I'll  meet some wonderful people."". Then I decided I wanted to join a  University Project, I loved what they did, and I actually plan on  working in that field, but I know the only reason I wanted to join was  to make some friends. If I learned that was impossible from the getgo  I'd never join. But it turns out I might be in too deep now, from 30  people, me and 2 others were rejected. I like to think I manage to hide  my loneliness pretty well, but I don't have a second opinion, so I'm not  sure, maybe I let something slip on one of the questions for the  interview.

This was big for me,  because I don't drink, so club nights are a no-no to meet new people.  And my university doesn't have any social events aimed towards people  like me, at least not that I know of, all they have are parties filled  with alcohol and music. And this project seemed to have a lot of people  like me, it could be a good excuse to talk and have a nice time.

I'm  waiting for the feedback right now, but this all got me thinking, what  if I try again next year and it turns out I was wrong? What if I keep  trying and studying hard and it doesn't work out like all the other  times it didn't work out? What if I'm slowly losing momentum and chronic  loneliness has finally caught up with me? What is wrong with me? I  sometimes suspect I may have some kind of autism, I just can't seem to  connect with people around me. It's as if we speak different languages.  How will I survive next semester in Uni? It was hard enough getting to  Uni even with my hopefulness, what do I do now? What will I tell my  parents? ""Oh, sorry I got into this awesome university, any parent's  dreams for his/her child, made you spend a lot of money in places for me  to stay, appliances and food, but I just couldn't make it through  because I don't have any friends. Yikes, what a shame."". What a hole  I've gotten myself into.

Sorry I  just wanted to vent, don't have anywhere else I could post this or talk  to anyone about, so I'll probably send this on other friend related  subreddits. Yes, I used a throwaway account, my actual reddit account  has the same name I use in all my profiles, and I want to try again next  year if I make it there, but I'll read and reply to any and all  comments I see, don't have anything better to do anyway.

TL;DR:  I've worked hard all my life because I wanted to find good friends, I  lost one good chance, now I'm doubting I'll ever reach that goal, and  don't know what to do. I'm not sure I can keep pushing forward.",lonely,I lost a good chance now my perspectives are really bad,2020-05-26 10:54:02

So I’m in this predicament where I have an opportunity to get ahead in my life, I just have this one tiny obstacle in the way of great things to come. And it seems one of my options is to reach out to my wealthy estranged father, whom abandoned me before I was born 21 years ago for help. I’ve recently been in contact with him in the last half year, and was told to reach out to him for help if I needed anything. Meeting him for the first time in 20 years I was left with much disappointment. I feel really alone and unsure if I should reach out, I’m very conflicted due to the fact that he didn’t give a rats ass all these years, I don’t want him thinking I need him now.

My contact with people was limited, and lately I've been spending time with the coronavirus practically in complete isolation, and although it seemed fine at first, later I felt even worse than before. I started to write a book, into which I poured all my emotions hidden deep inside me for the last three years. It took me two months. These were two months full of pain, fantasy, sadness, thoughtfulness, loneliness. 

I based the main character on myself. I hated my hero. I hated him because he was me. I wanted to destroy him, trample him, kill him, ask him who he is, why is he and why am I such a worthless piece of trash. I realized that fate directed my writing with my hands so that I could crack down on myself. And it was salutary. 

The result of this work was over fifty thousand words filled with pure madness, dreams, despair and chaos. I would never show it to anyone. I think this book is very bad, talking about all the literary criteria. But it's not important. What matters is that I showed myself that I can do such a thing. I discovered, how does passion feel like again. For the first time in such a long time I feel so much joy, relief and pride. I have turned my fantasies into words, and words have become a reality I have come to terms with so much that I was able to love my characters again... including myself. And I'm so, so happy about that. I want it to stay that way for as long as possible.

I hope you are all well. 

I am a 27-year-old male, I was extremely popular in high school and middle school with tons of friends and always have someone to do plans with. This actually decreased in University when I had my first real girlfriend and I started to lose touch with friendships and being able to make new friends. 

Now fast forward a couple of years now single I am still connected and appreciated by many but on social media such as Instagram Facebook and etc. for example I still get a lot of likes from acquaintances, old friends or just people I know and comments on my photos. From time to time people I know form different countries ask how I am 

 But I realized how lonely I am and how I lack real friendships. I can’t even think of one person I can call and just say let’s hang out or come over or let’s go for a walk. Find it incredible for example how many birthday messages I received just 10 days ago to the point of not having one single true friend. 

I try to initiate conversation and ask people to meet up however it becomes all just talk like yeah sure next week bla bla and we never actually do meet up it has been ages since Someone messaged me to say hey man let’s hang out. I just don’t have  it

Sometimes I even forget how to hang out with friends or like if I do hang out with friends I feel it’s like an amazing thing not just some sort of ordinary thing to do. Last year I suffered from extreme loneliness and deep depression but feeling better now 

But I don’t understand how I ended up having no real friends When I hear people not being able to do anything alone always needing a friend.

I I really do envy people that go for car rides go to the beach together have a group lunch at a restaurant or even coming over and just playing video game or having some drinks I haven’t done any of this in months maybe a year. I sometimes see some posts of my old high school friends hanging out together and I tell myself how I have barely done this in the last 6 years 

Conclusion do any of you have a seemingly popular life on social media with comments likes and attention from people, high school friends acquaintances and more but really inside your real life is lonely and you have really no one to turn to. No one to really share your life with, hang out anytime 

Would love to hear your feedback. Did social media really affect or we live in a real life some of us? Maybe it’s that in your 20’s you lose touch with many friends?

I don't know where to start this is my first time posting to reddit but at this point I feel like I have nowhere and no one else to turn to. I've been going through a pretty rough time lately and I don't even know how to express it. 

I live with my partner but i feel like they don't see me anymore. We can be in the same room and I feel so isolated off from them. I feel like they're happier talking to anyone else but me. Their demeanor towards me feels so cold these days and I'm not even sure why. They don't have much interest at all in going out with me places, but as soon as their friends call, they're ready to leave the house and be out all night. 

I've brought this up so many times, but it only ends in arguments. I'm so isolated here idk what to even do it's been taking a toll on me. I don't have friends where I currently live and i don't have much family either. I'm not really close with them and times I have tried to reach out to them, they pretty much left me hanging. I feel so alone I dont know what to do. I dont get any interaction with anyone and I feel like it's starting to drive me insane. I work at very isolated job as well so I don't talk to anyone all day. 

When my partner gets home all I want is to finally spend time with somebody but as soon as I try they tell me I'm being over bearing and clingy and they need time for themselves which I understand but also all I want is for a 30 minute conversation at this point. I feel so alone and unwanted and I don't know where to turn. I'm always just sitting in my room crying to myself these days. This isn't how I want my life to go but I dont know how to fix it.

I’m 20 and have no clue how to make friends. I mean sometimes I go places (such as the ice rink or a store at the mall) and see someone I might want to talk to but then what? 
What do I do when I see a stranger? How do I not make it awkward?
I really just don’t have any idea how people can go from strangers to acquaintances to friends, or even more than friends.
I know how to say a few topical things to people (no, not stupid small talk like the weather or something super boring and inconsequential, I mean about ice skating or what they have at the mall or something like that.) but how do you keep interacting after that? How do you transition to “big talk” (like about cars, video games, and other interest/hobby type stuff)? How do you make them like talking to you enough that they want to get your phone number or whatever so they can keep talking to you? And how do you manage to get them to want to talk to you and get to know you more until you’re actually friends? And god forbid I want them to be my partner. I just really don’t get it. If someone could just please point me towards some resources for how to make real life friends that give you a detailed road map basically, that would make me really happy. 
And no, I don’t think it’s something you “just figure out”. I never did “just figure it out”.

So all in all, I have nobody who still understands me
All of them love me but none of them can be here for me when I need them most.

My options are to agree with my family's views and have them back. But I know that they are wrong.

On vacation I suffered heavily from anxiety, I was counting the days where college would start and I would see people.

When college started, I was happy, the days felt productive, I was starting to talk to a lot of people, I was even thinking I would be seen as a nice guy who talks with everyone. 

There were two girls I became interested in and soon started to talk to them, they were gorgeous and compatible.

Everything was alright until my last day, 03/18.

I was hopeful it would just take two or three weeks, I couldnt stop thinking about them. Each week I was worsening, becoming more anxious and frustrated. I thought until today that classes would be back 06/08, but it was already the semester's end. Classes will only be back at July now.

I just cried, I am tired of being home my entire life, I am tired of thinking how great it would be to socialize.

592,DyslexicSantaist,1590398607,1,"I loved the same woman for 15 plus years now. She is always kind and sweet but i keep trying. I know i shouldnt. I do respect her. Its just hard to see her date guys who cheat on her and even dump her by text. Like i dont get it. How can i not take that personally? She dates guys like that but not me. It sucks.

Let me make it clear ive been made aware how my behaviour isnt great. Ive been in and out of therapy and am gonna go again after lockdown. She thinks i doesnt respect her. I do. But it hurts me to see.  And she doesnt see that to me shes everything. Im not even interested in other women because to me none ever seem to measure up. She was the perfect person for me, physically (red head and very athletic) but a great kind person. Im also fat so in that sense i understand she wouldnt be attracted. Im trying to lose weight but its slow.

To me the only choices are somehow win her over, which i accept probably wont happen, or be alone forever. My type is so specific and i know thats my fault but i cant help it. And even the very few of those ive known, none are as kind as her or good hearted.

Its making me suicidal. I know im gonna be alone forever because id rather that than date someone just for the sake of it. I know i wouldnt be happy with someone else not as good as her or measure up to her and i dont wanna do that to someone. It would make me resentful and thats not something i wanna do to someone. Id rather be alone than make someone else feel like second best even if they wouldnt know thats how id feel.

Idk what to do. Im starting to feel death is my only way out. Inhave a brother and sister and i dont wanna do that to them. But they are much older and once they are gone i got nobody. I also have learning difficulties too which increases my issues ten fold and depression since i was 15. Ive fought it so hard but i wonder why i keep trying. I just wonder if at some point i miht as well just die and be done fihting.

I dont bother her any more cuz shes truly amazing and i want her to be happy even without me in her life. If that makes her happy im willing to stay away. But my heart is just never healing no matter self help books, and gym, and doing everything im supposed to. I feel like the lonliees man int he world. Theres not many;37 year old virgins out there. I dont even care about sex. Id love to be with her just to cuddle her and hold her hand.

I have two older sibling a who have both always had friends, who are invited to parties, who are both good looking, and basically live ideal lives from my POV. It makes me just feel terrible. They’re both social, and are so successful in making friends and being liked by others. I’m not.

I have zero friends, and when I say zero, I mean zero. I have nobody to call to hang out, and there’s nobody to talk to. It’s not that I don’t know people, it’s just that’s they don’t really see anything in me worth making a relationship out of. My phone doesn’t go off for anything. It’s almost useless. I don’t think anyone has actually called me on it. And social media is just as useless. I don’t meet anyone. I don’t show people how “happy” I am. It’s just a place I go that makes me feel sad.

618,hamartiated,1590374385,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-05-25 12:39:45

623,IndecisiveAutomater,1590370666,1,"The more I think about it, the more it feels as though I only like the idea of finding a friend. That one person I click with and that becomes my ""best friend"" - We have sleepovers and play games, stay up late talking about nonsense, and just overall someone to have fun with.

But I push people away when they get too close. I have a general dislike towards people as well. I have a lot of social anxiety, I'm very opinionated, I'm really introverted and talking for even a few hours a day can drain the life out of me, and my interests seem to have communities full of people that conflict with my other interests. It can be exhausting and difficult to find people because of this. Not to mention how difficult maintaining friendships can be when people very quickly drift or lose interest in me because they move on.

Maybe all I want to do is fantasise about having that ""best friend"" and don't want to go through the painstaking process of having to find (and likely very quickly lose) a potential friend.

I haven’t come here with the idea someone will try and talk me round from this, I’m more curious to know if anyone else ever feels like this and if they do, are there other options ? Sorry for the long post but it feels cathartic to write this all somewhere. Right now it feels theres so much of it in my brain, id rather not be here to have to keep trying to wade through it all. 

I had a boyfriend of 9 years. We loved each other, grew up together from 18-27, we shared so much love for the same things... I felt that we were always supposed to be together. Like a natural force of something...

Anyway, the other thing is he also treated me badly. I knew him well enough to know he loved me and that he was this way because of his own twisted upbringing but he didn’t treat me that way. I guess you could say he was emotionally abusive for maybe 25% of our relationship and it really started to mess me up. He saw me as his family, and I saw him as mine. My need to always please others in the hope I can somehow control the horrendous mess that is life and people and somehow if I do the right thing, everyone will be happy.

So the more I lost the plot after we moved in together and the more I began to cut myself off from him. I never told him, I just kept pretending it was fine like I always do. Then I cheated on him, and I lost him and all of my friends that I built a life with. I hate myself for it.

Meanwhile my sister has anorexia. She nearly died last year and was hospitalised. My mum and dad have driven themselves close to madness with the sheer effort it takes to look after her, and the trauma of how bad things have been in the passed has left terrible emotional scars on all of us. She’s still not well and despite being 20 she requires constant help while she lives at home. I love my sister and my mum and dad very much. I always feel I have to try and look after them because they are marooned on their island of sadness and I live away from them and get to enjoy a happy life while theirs crumbles. I’m at home with them in lockdown now and I hate it. The idea of going back to my flat and leaving them here fills me with guilt and shame. I hate that the family I knew had gone and constantly grieve how we used to be. I miss having a mum and I miss not feeling like I have no one to talk to about how difficult I’m finding life. I care so much about them and I think knowing I feel this way would break them. I could never tell them.  When I leave them after visiting other times, I feel how I used to when I used to drive away from visiting my sister in hospital. I feel like my heart is being pulled out of my body. Sometimes I cry so hard about it it feels like I howl. Thinking of how she’s wasting her life and ruining my family’s too makes my head hurt if I give it any time 

I now have a boyfriend. We’ve been together 6+ months and he’s great. He’s kind, he’s caring, he’s gentle, he cares about me so much and has taught me so much about what is normal in a relationship. And yet I still torture myself with thoughts of my ex. I didn’t used to but now it’s like my brain is back on self destruct mode and that’s all I can do. I feel that I am not worth this person and he deserves someone stable. He tells me that he wants to marry me, and that he loves how positive and steady minded I am. I feel so lost because I don’t feel I can tell him how dark I feel some days. Some days I also feel trapped by this relationship but I’ve made so many awful choices in life that I can’t trust if I am wrong to feel this way about him? What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I just be happy? Or, maybe I’m right to feel this way and I should be alone? 

My best friend abandoned me after I cheated on my ex boyfriend. We’d been best friends since we were 12. She said she thought I was an awful person and that she didn’t think our morals aligned. She said that there were many things over the years she didn’t like about me and listed them in 10s of page long texts. One thing she said is she could never forgive me for the abortion I had or that I drank before I had it. I often think she’s right and I am a hateful person. 

I met up with my ex yesterday to see if he was the answer. I felt like maybe now I’d grown and seeing him would make it all make sense. Maybe he had changed and I had too and that would mean all the problems from before would fade away. For the first time I couldn’t let that horrendous chaotic person take over. Part of me actually wanted to screw everyone else over and run away with him and be happy and I so wanted to be the right person for him too. But when I met him I just realised that all I do is pine for a toxic relationship, and he could never trust me again, and my family would be so disappointed in me, and the gossip mill would turn again. I’d love to trust my “instincts” but I know they’re always wrong and I can’t face anymore hurt. I can’t make anymore victims of anyone. I told him I wanted him to leave after we sat and talked. He’s now so hurt. He says he’s a fool for my love and he again allowed himself to believe I wanted him. I do I just don’t know how I can ever find my way back to him, or if I should. 

So now I’ve made peace. I don’t have him in my life, I need to consider my relationship right now and do everything I can not to hurt him, and I need to be there for my family .... but what’s even next? What is all this fuss for? I don’t want to live this life anymore where I dream of music and fun and being carefree and following my heart - knowing all the while that the person I want to share that with will ruin my life. I just want out. 

I don’t want to feel all this worry anymore, I don’t want to keep on trying to keep up this act I’m fine anymore, I don’t want to keep constantly living in fear of hurting others only to then hurt them. 

People keep saying I’m a good person but I don’t see how. I loved my ex and I cheated on him, I loved my best friend and she left me, I’ve betrayed my wonderful loyal kind soul partner’s trust (whether I acted on it or not is irrelevant, I’m a liar), I add no value to my family despite all of my efforts. 

I tell my friends and they are good at giving advice and listening but really what I want to tell them is “but despite everything I still sometimes think I’d rather not be here”. I can’t because I know exactly what they’ll say and it won’t make even a bit of difference. I know they’d miss me if I was gone but that’s not enough to stop hating my brain and life and how grotesque it is sometimes. If only I could get over the crushing guilt I feel at the thought of what it would do to others, id go ahead and do it.

Sometimes I think that in the weirdest way, my ex would be the only person on this whole planet who would understand why",lonely,I can’t remember the point of any of this anymore and I can’t remember the reason why I should care anymore,2020-05-25 10:30:44

I once made friends with a guy who I thought I had gotten on pretty well with but later on he just stopped talking to me. All the “friendships"" I’ve had are non reciprocal and are always one sided I doubt they even know my last name. 

Every time I try and make a new friend they don’t seem interested. I don’t have a support network no friends I could meet in person I can’t talk to my parent about my issues because they don’t think anything’s wrong with me so I’m alone. 


I feel like I’m destined to be alone like I won’t make any real connection and I’ll live the rest of my life with feeling love without children without true happiness.

That’s why I will never take anything A woman says about romance or friends seriously unless she is blunt, upfront, and knows what she wants. So there is no misconceptions for either party. And I guess that’s why I’ve been having so many issues. I expect a blunt to answer but the woman doesn’t know how to give one or doesn’t care enough to give one.

Anyways, on Eid, we have to ask the elders for forgiveness but I couldn't do it. This man is a shitty father and I resent him too much to ask for his forgiveness. We had a ""talk"" (i.e. him pointing out my flaws) and he threatened me to behave better, saying something along the lines of ""I won't tolerate arrogance and rudeness in this house. You know what I'm capable of"". This led to a panic attack because 1) yes, I do know what he's capable of and 2) it just hit me that I'm living in an emotionally abusive environment, and will probably have to continue living here for the next 8 years, at least. Just for context, I'm a 22 y/o female and in my country, we normally live with our parents till we get married because housing prices here are extremely high. 

By the way, the ""arrogance"" that he's referring to is about me avoiding him after the suicide attempt because of how anxious I get whenever I'm around him. Honestly, I'm not looking to mend my relationship with my dad. I don't think I can ever forgive him for all the shit he put me through. But it's just uncomfortable now for me to be at home and I'm so tired. I don't have a safe space. I don't have someone I feel comfortable enough to confide in. I'm trying to comfort myself with the fact that I've gone through bad shit alone and I can get through this alone too. I feel so envious of people with nice fathers.

However, as much as il throw around this phrase, I don’t actually want to die, as life has so much potential as much as we don’t see it during our darkest times.

Often, people I love the most are just unaware of how important they are to me. Just because I think it's too mushy or cheesy. That has cost me friendships and relationships


I am a good kind person at heart. Maybe too much to a fault. I shower affection and care on friends and even strangers. During these covid Times, I've started a page on insta that spreads good news (me and my business partners) so that we can make people smile, chuckle or just wipe away their frowns. My point here is not altruism but that I have a clean heart that looks out for others

So all I'm saying is that I'm a happy loner with friends who has difficulty expressing hearts true desires. I wanna change that before it's too late and I fall into a downward spiral. And

I wanna start with making meaningful relations here and I hope to find friends with whom I can have a real connect. Even if this thread brings one conversation that turns out to be a friendship, I'll take that as a victory on my sleeve :D 

Btw, you'd have guessed my dating game sucks. But I like to believe I'm a long term player lol
To give you an idea of how bad my dating awareness is:

On the first date of my life, I didn't know it was a date. I realised it after a couple of weeks. I thought I'm meeting her for lunch and that's that. So, it sure is progress now but only you can be the real judge of that :D",lonely,Imperfect 27M looking for an Imperfect F,2020-05-25 02:22:48

I never went to therapy because growing up fucken sucks and its hard.. mind you im slow in my thought processing it just takes me longer....

I stopped working, kept myself in my room, stopped going to my familys buisness on the weekends to escape some false reality that isnt even real....

Now my commection to my family is gone, I missed weddings, events, conmection with old friends, my best friend, my mother, my cousins, my brother, everyone... just because I dont want ti get up and work and because I didnt want them to see me.. they searched for me .. now they just know its not him anymore...

I failed. I let my mother down.. but karma got me.. this is to repay my sober past mistakes which I wont tell you..  

Pre 2016... I was fine.. Just never kept a job.. but never really sat down at a table and talked to family...so there is that..

Pretty much. It's been a couple of days and we did talk quite a bit about normal teenager stuff.

She said ""I don't mind going out with you, but could you give me time to think?"". That was the last she said about anything. 

Good news however. Before the Rona put us all in lockdown, we did agree to go out as friends for some lunch, and I don't think me asking her out affected that. But I think she's going to turn me down. 

Do I regret my decision? Absolutely. Am I hopeful? No. Advice for you guys? Romance is overrated, being alone is much better.

I am so madly in love with my boyfriend and I know he loves me too. But his love for me does not align with the amount of love and care that I have for him. I love him so much and I love everything he does for me. However I crave something deeper than this generic love he has to offer me. Maybe it’s just my insecurities but I feel so very lonely. I seek his comfort sometimes by expressing my insecurities(about myself-not the relationship) but he ignores me... he doesn’t want to hear it, he doesn’t ask me any follow up questions. I feel like whenever I’m sad and seek comfort from him, he ignores it and talks about something else. And for that reason I feel lonely. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. My boyfriend is only present in my happiness and absent in my sorrow. I love him and I’m always searching for something deeper within him but it just isn’t there. I seek the deeper things in life and he seeks only the surface of what life has to offer(money and such). We are so different, and we have such different values, and I’m waiting for something that won’t happen. Yes I have talked about this with him, but I feel like he doesn’t care. I always try to communicate with him, but It doesn’t work out. So here I am. I feel so lonely and I always have even when surrounded by people who love me. What’s wrong with me? I know I should break up with him but I’m so attached and I’ve also lost my virginity to him so it’s even harder. God I feel so ungrateful but I need a deeper connection, a deeper mind, a deeper soul, a deeper love; something he has failed to offer. Am I bad girlfriend for thinking this way?

Please don't take this super seriously, I just don't feel good and need to vent it out. TLDR, I'm afraid I won't have a friend(s) because of how weird person I am, is there any hope left for me?
--------------

 Currently, I don't know anyone from my neighborhood/class/etc. who would I consider as my friend. Like, literally nobody. I no longer go out with people as I did few years ago and I don't chat with my classmates (they only text me when they need some help from me, heh), I only have two internet friends who're sadly from very afar so I can't meet them irl.
When we'l finally return to schools, I'm sure I'l exchange few words with my classmates, then as allways they'l return to their groups and ignore me. It hurts me seeing them happy and not going to lie, I'm quite jealous, yet I sort of accept the fact that I don't share much interests with them, and that I need to get through the school without friends. (Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to dissocialize and I really regularly conversate with them, but it's just sort of a ... ""weather talk""?) And, what then? I'm trying to work on myself, but still, I'm just an introvert who is not that much interesting person to talk to.
I know this sounds super stupid, but the fact that I don't know what lies in front of me in my life really scares me. I want to have a friends like everyone else, somebody to share interests with, to go out like I did before... I don't want to live a lonely life, locked in my house thinking about why nobody likes me, but it feels like this kind of future is 'sucking me in'. Can I really find a good friend(s), even though I act like an idiot? Or are people like me damned to live long, lonesome life?",lonely,Will I have a real friend someday?,2020-05-24 08:17:01

NY to Dallas transplant; moved because I met my boyfriend and 18 months later, boom I'm a Texan now. He's the absolute best, but when he's not around I feel completely alone.

I work a normal job, sleep normal hours, but haven't been able to make any real connections with people here. It's just... different. Sometimes the tone of my voice offends people and it blows me the fuck away. Religion is life here and that's not me. I'm not into guns, trucks, or hunting and I've found that having no interest in those things really narrows the group of people who want/are looking for new friends. Also, families are younger and they're too busy to meet up for with me go a nightly walk, happy hour drink, or Saturday lunch.

BF is from Dallas. He works in restaurants and doesn't have a 9-5. Although he doesn't go out of his way to ""hang out"" with his friends, because he's a big PC gamer he talks to them for hours on end almost every single day. He sleeps during the day and is awake all night. For example, today he went to bed at 12:30 PM (afternoon) and was up all night. He'll wake up around 8-9:00 PM and then the day will basically be over. On the weekends when this happens, I am alone all day sitting on my ass watching TV and all by myself. Maybe I'll clean or do laundry or find a DIY project to do but I'm still alone, all day with no one to talk to. And obviously, quarantine has only magnified this feeling. At least I used to be able to run to the supermarket or go to the store to buy something or walk around but I can't really do that now. Sometimes I stay late at work because at least there are a handful of people there, or if not, at least I have something to do or a task to finish. It's better than going home to an apartment with a sleeping boyfriend where I'll be back on the couch, by myself.

740,_samar_,1590262747,1,"What I've observed in my life is that the older a friendship is, the more stronger it tends to be. Plus the ""real life"" memories that you form together really glue you as friends. They give you something to talk of your own rather than just commenting on general stuff. For instance, the friends you make in college, you can discuss the college life with them as well as your future goals and feelings as well as a talk about the current affairs. Now with the online thing, it is only you who is narrating about his/her life. The other person knows nothing. That person has not experienced anything ""with"" you. And that is where I feel it gets depressing for me. I can say anything and the other person will believe it. I don't mean lying about my age or something. But say for example I had a relationship with someone and if i narrate it to my online friend, would that not be a really one sided story? While if i told the same to my real life friends, then at least they would have seen that person in real and be in a position to have their own judgement rather than relying solely on my narrative. This was just one of the many examples. Of course a person who already has not many friends in real life should not a complaining but honestly it is not a complain. Three years ago, I unwent a life changing experience and were it not for a few kind online strangers, I would not have been in a normal mental health.

The problem here is you can't just wait for it to get better, you also have to put some work into it.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I’m grateful for all that they’ve done, like they provided for me and raised me but I feel like they’ve never really been there for me. My mom and I never really had that close mother daughter type of relationship. She doesn’t believe in mental health or and that I have “real” problems. I’ve tried to tell her how I feel so many times, but she’d always overact and then we would start arguing about it. I feel like she just thinks being a mother is just a chore or job to her. She always compares me to my friends and she says how they’re so much better than me in every possible way. It’s like she’d rather have them as a daughter instead. I know that she probably loves me but I feel like she doesn’t “like” me as a person. My dad on the other hand, I guess he might be a bit more chill but I honestly don’t think I have a relationship with him. We barley talk because he’s always at work and even if we do it’s really short and dry. I remember once my grandma came to visit and she was blaming me for not being close with my dad. I feel like the broken relationship I have with my parents is the reason why I’ve always felt so lonely and felt like no one was ever there for me and the way I make friends with both genders. For girls, I always feel like I rely on them or expect them to be there for me and when they’re not it just leaves a whole in my heart. I barley even have any guy friends because I don’t even know how to communicate with them properly.

Since he moved to another country,i basically had to make new friends in my class.(junior year of high school).It was meh really.During December 2019 and January 2020 i actually managed to go out a lot with my ""friends"".So while i got closer and closer with them,i slowly started to open up to them about my socio-economic status.My family is really well off actually,not rich but we're living better than most.We have 2 pubs and on top of that my dad is a branch manager.So these guys slowly become money-hungry.I start to actually pay always when we went out(yeah i know,i'm a fucking dumbass).So it really got annoying,since these guys started bullying me,even though we went out all the time together.They did some very embarrasing/fucked up shit to me,for which i'm very embarrassed to talk about.It really got to me during the Quarantine,where i got into a very big fight with one of them.Just these 5 months i can't remember how many times i've thought about taking my life.I'm on good terms with i guess a couple guys,but they never invite me to anything really.Hell i even tell them ""Yo,tell me if you're down to hang out"",they tell me ""Sure"" but they don't invite me at all.

778,evolenon,1590220935,1,"Where do I begin?  


I live in my own head, I do what I can be bothered to when I can bring myself to justify the effort, but I never get anywhere. Academics have been a great distraction for my entire life; I'm like a wall socially so without the academic success I have managed there is literally nothing to me. All the things I do are a waste of time and effort because regardless of whether or not I do them nobody cares. Nobody asks me what I'm working on or what I'm interested in and how that is and I don't ask anyone else that because I don't care because I know they don't care to put in a reciprocate effort. Whatever feeling I decide to harbor for another person is inevitably useless and a complete waste of my thoughts and feelings because I'm too scared to act and can't possibly justify risk without any comprehension of or experience with the possible rewards. I won't express vulnerability because I never have and I don't want my friends or parents to realize that despite my constant facades I'm not actually happy. When they ask how I am and I say ""good"" they stop there and I'm not good. It doesn't matter if I try to suppress it, the feelings of uselessness and isolation by my own hand constantly creeps up from behind the distractions I come up with. I won't tell anyone I already know because I don't want to see them react and I don't want to witness that sad realization that I'm not the person they think I have been for so long. I don't want to be silent and I don't want to be solitary and I don't want people to pity me or try to help me because what can they really do? They can't make me do something I would never let myself do; they can't control me to act the ""right"" way; they can't make any difference because the difference is too great to be manageable. The beginning of this academic year; september; the year 2019 I had the worst birthday I can remember, that I spent alone and upset because nobody was there with me to understand what I really wanted. I started that year hopeful that by some means I might just happen to fall into some relationship more meaningful than acquaintance. In this worthless and blind hope I set the object of my inaction to a girl whose demeanor I deluded myself into liking, but whom I could not meaningfully relate to nor understand. The year passed so quickly, and all I remember of it are those moments where, out of my doubts and fears, I glanced at her eyes and she looked back and acknowledged me. Those moments which compounded my hope are all that stand with enough significance to be worth remembering, but they are the object of the greatest waste of my efforts I know. Otherwise I did not speak to her excepting the occasional video chat group study sessions; by some external circumstance her relations to my acquaintances she was brought into them. All along this I maintained facades; the facade of responsibility and quiet to my parents; the facade of humor and quiet to my acquaintances; the facade of academic success and attentiveness to my teachers. In the end, I asked her to prom; as a consequence of my caution, however, she declined only for a prior engagement. The circumstances of the world seem to have rendered this action and outcome completely without meaning; we did not speak of it after, and none but myself and her and my mother, who took the time to convince me to act, are aware of it. Now I find myself completely careless for cancellations of school events and whatever else mocks my failures. I should mention that, in the time between my asking and her response (I could never ask directly), I convinced myself that her delay in responding carried more implication for myself than it did, though it was nothing more than an error. When I leave high school, I will have nothing. No meaningful social connections. No fruitful hobbies (despite my variety of interest and tangible skill development I can never finish a project). No desire but to be free of the few burdens that I still hold; the restrictions of living under another's watch; the future financial burden I will be required to carry by the fatally flawed institutions of these Uncooperative States of America; the burdens of social failure and isolation that I seem to be without means to resolve. There is nothing of meaning I remember from my past. No friends or experiences definitive of my life, just their inevitable departures as I fail to maintain the fabric of my decaying livelihood. What is there I can do when nothing I am capable of doing is of any meaning to myself or anyone else? I can't convince myself that the results of my efforts are still worthwhile even if I am the only one to see them. I just want an actual friend. I want to talk to someone freely, for hours about whatever; to share my progress and to listen to theirs. But I can't; I feel unaware of what I can say or do to understand or act meaningfully. I've never put it in other posts because it always feels wrong to say just as it can to witness and I can't even type it here; too weak and fearful of what people I will never meet and who will never find me will think. What I will think of myself for writing something that doesn't matter. I don't want to message someone because there is not connection in messaging; you send a message then 20 minutes later you get a response. It's not emotional, it's not comprehensive, it just harbors the same isolation that I cannot escape. Still, I sit here with reddit open refreshing to read new posts people make looking for friends, but never reply. It doesn't matter if I do; they respond with whatever they have to say and it continues for a short while and drops. I'm back where I started. Scared of never changing and scared of the consequences and risks of trying to change.   


Thanks for riding my train of thought. It's almost 4 so the driver will be going to bed now. If you think you might be able to somehow give meaning to my life and my efforts, add me on discord (mars#2401), start a chat on reddit (not a direct message), and put your discord tag in the first message of the chat (along with something meaningful and insightful also in the first message so I can see it).

783,OhAshenOne,1590217783,1,"It has nothing to do with quarantine, I wasn't really doing that anyway. I had a run-in with a few really shitty friends who invited me to move halfway across the US and live with them. So I did for a year. Then they all but kicked me out and cut all ties with me when the lease was up for renewal.

To make matters worse the main reason I had to move back was because I'd just been in a really bad car accident (guy ran a red light and t-boned my driver side) and which resulted in my hip being injured for a long ass time. So I'm constantly in pain and drowning in medical bills and debts from having to replace my totaled car. And while all of these bills and debts were piling up my work was cutting my hours because I couldn't stand and sit and deal with customers when my hip was throbbing and driving me crazy. So I finally had an emotional break and moved back in with my parents (where I've been since) and lost contact with all of my old friends. 

To make matters **even** worse I'm not even sure why they cut contact with me. Sure I had a mental breakdown but it wasn't that bad and nobody really had to deal with it. I did it alone in my room. I'm still convinced it was partially because one of them got in trouble on a Discord server I was in or something and she turned the rest of the house against me. I still have no clue. It seems petty but it doesn't seem like it's out of character.

And now we come to this point my life where it's been probably over half a year since I've had regular communication with someone who isn't my parents. I don't work at the moment because I'm battling to get on disability and I have no real reason to go out and do anything because I don't really have any friends here or online anymore. I exchange maybe 3 or 4 messages a month with others. That's it. Other than that I just sit in silence and watch youtube or something now.

When they started seeing each other a year ago I was so happy for her because he seemed to be a really nice guy, better than all of her exs. But as the months went by he began to question her about our friendship, because we were like sisters and we did everything together. I used to sleep at her house or she would sleep at mine almost every weekend and we were always hanging out together. Obviously, because she is my best friend, and I guess that's what best friends do. The problem is that the more he complained about me and her being always together, the more I started to dislike him. I can tell you guys that I even tried to become his friend in order to make things easier for her, but the only 2 times we tried to hang out he wouldnt talk to me unless I awkwardly insisted in random conversations. Anyway, about 6 months ago they had a huge fight (and when I say HUGE I really mean it: he hit her and she hit him and strangers had to stop them from hitting each other in a party) and she broke up with him. I was so angry at him that when she told me she was blocking him on her social medias, I did the same and I thought we would never hear of him again. But two weeks later she told me he came to her asking for apologies and that she was going to give him another chance. Yeah, I know how problematic this is and she and I had many arguments about her decision for days, but at the end I felt like I needed to be there for her despite of anything. Because that is what best friends do, right? Well, the problem is that since this fight he seems to be doing everything to make it up to her, and she is really in love with him again, but ever since we've been seeing each other less, sometimes I feel that she isnt as interest on things we used to do together as she were before, and she seems not to have time for me anymore. She always have something planned with him when I ask her if she wants to go out, and when we finally get to be together, just the two of us, the only thing she does is text him all the time. Our instagrams used to have pics of her and me and now every picture she posts he is with her. I'm getting really annoyed about this whole situation because I dont know if I'm the one being immature and maybe I should just ignore all of this and move on, but I really miss my best friend and everything we used to do together and that she is noe doing those things with him. We've been best friends for 8 years and it only took 1 guy for her to change... And the funniest part is we always promised each other that we wouldnt let any boy ruin our friendship like this. 

So... What would you guys do in my position? Please be nice... It's been hard facing the fact that I might lose her friendship... :(",lonely,Abandoned by my best friend :(,2020-05-23 14:46:16

I have never had a lot of friends and since I am stuck at home because of quarantine just like everyone else I am always in my room. I am either watching youtube or listening to music. I know I am lucky to have some friends and a lot of the posts I see here say they have no friends at all but I still feel like shit. My doctor said I should see a therapist and that didn't and won't ever happen because my parents think I dont need it (I am still a teen) and my substitute for that is music. Every night I end up alone in my dark room blasting music through my earbuds. It's kind of all I do now and I feel useless and feel that I am wasting away my life doing nothing, and if you ask my parents they will say, ""he is just a dramatic teenager."" I just feel like nothing I do will benefit anything. I feel like making this post won't do shit but I am making it because it's all I can do and I feel really guilty because I have stuff in my room but 90% of it is stuff that belongs on a shelf for example I have a lot of model cars and my parents say, ""you should be happy because you have so many things,"" and I am sort of happy its just that I am alone and that loneliness makes me feel like shit. I am trying to make this short but if I allowed myself this would never end and I would just keep bickering.


A shortened version is instead of going to a therapist I listen to music feel like shit, feel really guilty, and feel that I cant do anything to keep it ""under control"".",lonely,The main thing keeping me from completely failing apart is music.,2020-05-23 13:35:43

  It's the replacement for pain, the long term addiction knocking at my door, the only thing I can count on when I'm in need.  It's every ""I love you"" that became ""There's someone else.""  Or every ""I'll never let you go"" that was really ""I can't do this.""

808,notpolitician,1590200089,1,"So I met this girl in a class sophomore year of HS, we were friends for almost 4 years up until last year. Started off just making jokes in class all that then next semester starter and didn’t see her until until junior year started. Snapchatting a lot all that, hanging out a couple times. 

Then my friends and hers would always make jokes about us being together or I’m simping for her whatever. Pretty much stayed close all throughout the rest of HS.

As we got closer we would do favors for each other like she would get me liquor I would give her a ride from a party and we would smoke just hang out.

When it was finally time to graduate my friends would make more and more jokes about us being together and we would both just laugh it off. (She had a bf at the time)

When her and her bf broke up she didn’t tell me (I guess I was too clingy/supportive) but eventually she felt like talking about it outside of her close friend group.

Later on we went to the mall, smoked, went on a long car ride and just talked. And that was the worst mistake I made.

At that point the jokes my/her friends made turned into manipulation. Her best friend told me that she was into me and I should ask her out (ALWAYS SAVE SNAPS LIKE THIS)

Months go by and I started to develop more feelings towards her. So I asked her out (april 2019) and she didn’t respond for a whole day.

Once she replied I knew I was fucked. And that was the beginning of the end. I confronted her best friend about what she said to me and claims she never said that and I can’t even describe how I felt then.

My friends and her best friend slowly said all that for their own entertainment. I told my best friend of 14 years (person who plotted it all) to show up to my house so I can kick his ass for setting it up and telling people.

He never apologized for running his mouth and I never saw him, my friends, her or her friends again.

An ex-boyfriend then messaged me after he heard the news. He told me EVERYTHING.....she wanted to be friends in the beginning but started to get annoyed at me for being “protective” because I cared about her and didn’t want her getting with a douchebag. 

She cared about me at first but as things went on she just wanted to use me to smoke or make herself feel better because I was always there for her when she was down.

Haven’t seen any of them in over a year now (mainly because it’s our 3rd year in college) I’ve gotten texts from some of them asking if I’m alright or asking for favors which I just don’t respond to.

My old friends plan on hanging out in the summer but I don’t plan on getting back in touch, some of them I’ve known for 14 years, 16, 5, 4....

I’ve found entertainment looking up at the stars at 4am listening to music....editing photos....trading stocks......dreaming about living in an atompunk type world, just me and the universe (similar to fallout 4)

844,peachiest_lemon,1590173578,7,"I’m a 32yo single woman.
I’ve struggled with a lot in my life, and many things have feed my depression, and anxiety, but my one constant in all of it, the ache of being alone. 

I’m a bit socially awkward, struggled with weight most my life, and pretty unattractive, and dispute my personality and desire to be better at wardrobe, hair and makeup, I can’t ever seem to look how I want. 

I have an unconventional life that others don’t understand, was homeschooled and didn’t really even develop childhood friendships. Due to anxiety, OCD, and chronic fatigue, and having slight executive functioning disorder, caused by a medical condition, I’m currently in disability and not working. 

I spent a decade volunteering with an organization I eventually recently left for multiple reasons, and having not gone to college, have no idea what I’m doing with my life. 

I’m a Christian, and while I try to stay involved at church, even there I’ve never felt truly seen or excepted.

I’ve never had one friendship, in my entire life (outside my family, and let’s face it, you can’t talk about everything with family.) the kind that you call and text, and share everything with, the kind that is always there to go out and do stuff or just hang, the kind that you don’t have to work to initiate things with, the kind that sees and cares about you, and is mutually invested in you. 

I’m so incredibly lonely, but I’m also so incredibly tired of trying to make friends, and ending up on one sided friendships, I’m tired of being friends to all, but no one seeing and valuing me the same way. And it feels hopeless.

I also have shoved any desire to have romance so far out of my mind, that until recently, didn’t even know it was a desire at all, and I wish it had never surfaced.

On the one hand, in many I feel normal, and intellectually and many other ways, I’m not. I’m not normal, but I’m not like a typical disabled person either. But I feel like people only see and judge me on things that make me different, and a failure. And my life is largely so uneventful, even when I’m at church or with groups of friends, I don’t have much to talk about, and relate about talking about work and such, so it’s hard to make connections.

And while, on some levels, I cant operate at the same level as others, at a full time job, being home, alone full time, is driving me insane. I’m aware it’s not healthy or normal, but I can’t figure out what I want or figure out a way out. 
I struggle with keeping my home and life organized, an in some ways feel I’d be a crappy wife. I’m not independent at all with anything adulting wise, my dad does my finances, pays my expenses. So why would anyone want to be with a 30yo adult child. But selfishly I desire to a wife all the same, I know it wouldn’t fox my problems, but I desire companionship so deeply, and have been so deprived it, sins days its an ache so bad all I do is cry. 

At the same time, I’m not willing able to lower my standards, of what I expect of a man I’m interested in. Partially maybe due to the fact, i feel he’d have to compensate for me. But that’s u realistic, and creates it own barrier as well, as the only guys in interested in, would never be interested in someone like me. (I do say all this, but honestly my standards aren’t that high)

I want to become more independent, I want to figure out some kind of purpose, wish I knew the path to take, and what kind of job would suit me, but I don’t. I try talking to my parents, about taking more steps to being more independent, but it’s impossible to get them on bored, let alone truly hearing what I’m saying. But I feel like with out doing so, I can’t ever realistically expect to find a man.

Anyway, I don’t know what kind of response I’m looking for, nor if anyone will read this, or even if it makes sense, but I just really needed to get it all out.",lonely,The ache that won’t let me go.,2020-05-23 04:52:58

I gained some weight in middle school and after years of getting taunted for my weight, I lost them all in high school. When I went to college, I had to start taking antidepressants and I gained those weights back.

So now I'm 23, slightly overweight, really insecure about how I look and extremely desperate for a romantic relationship. Talking to my friends doesn't feel good. I want something to have sexual feelings for me. I can't shake off this feeling that I'm so bland that I'm basically unlovable and untouchable, these things were implemented in my brain by my friends. This friend I hang out with, he's tall and fairly goodlooking. He's a very good friend but I don't feel like spending time with him because he won't stop talking about how much every girl looks at him tries to hit on him and stuff. In my whole life, not one girl has approached me. I'm funny, well liked among people and have a lot of friends but that doesn't matter to me anymore because I want someone to have sexual feelings for me.

859,EmptyDaydreamer,1590153044,1,"I am an avid fan of mangas. I've encountered this quote when I was reading One Punch Man and it was a long time ago. This quote kinda hit me hard. I hate being lonely and how the quietness is consuming me. It's deafening and maddening. The silence mess me up whenever I am alone. But, when I did read this quote, something flashes on my mind. What if, I turn my loneliness into something useful for me and for the others? I know right? How could be loneliness and suffering be useful? Well, to answer my own question, I believe that quote says that you must learn how to amuse yourself. It's like, thinking that being lonely is not so bad because you can sing, dance and go wild without anyone judging you. Thinking that loneliness is the best and worst feeling in the world because we feel everything then nothing. Loneliness also makes us daydream scenarios in which I believe hones our creativity and imagination. With that said, it helps us to see the world in a better standing.

And yes, whatever you learn from being lonely helps us to understand people more than anyone else. I believe loners are the most compassionate people you can ever encounter. Loneliness makes us wiser and better people... the best to be friends with. I mean, we are all already familiar with the feeling of isolation and abandonment.

It's hard, knowing yourself, hard not being able to self-express (I'm sure many of you are battling with this also). It's the deadliest of poisons and everyone should try to do it, we all should try to get to know ourselveses better, cause YOU ARE ALL YOU HAVE. Respect yourself, love yourself, like you want others to love you.

 Well, now that I'm writing this, maybe I've found my prevalent emotion - feeling of not belonging anywhere. 

People always say about finding community of people who love the same things you do or who feel the same way as you do, but I can't imagine finding it. Well, I guess it's okay, that I'm not imagining at least one part of my nonexisent life.

I'm really confused, because, for example, I love music. I love band Muse, The Pretty Reckless, Lana Del Rey, Halsey, Camila Cabello and many many more. 

But on some days, I have the closest connection with them, and on other days, they feel like strangers and it really upsets me, because I don't understand why, like what is wrong.

Also, i never could participate in fandom discussions, because most of them are not interestin for me, i don't understand them. I just loooovee the music of those artists, their lyrics, really particular love that you feel while listeting to their songs.

So, though I love some things,  I somehow never could relate to people who love them too.

In general, i'm okay with my feeling of not belonging, it's just some days I dig into it, because I think that our mental issues need to be resolved.

But that doesn’t matter to them they just rented me for their needs and throw me away without a second thought and it leaves me in the trash can.

881,thelynnlime,1590124277,1,"Loneliness certainly didn’t start with quarantine, but it’s made it ten times worse.

How is it that I ended up being “that other girl” to every one of my friends? Not having a best friend, always at the periphery of friend groups. Being ignored most of the time, never receiving a response when I want to share something personal. Never confided in, and never able to confide in anybody? I’ve done my best to be a good friend to people. To be there for them when they needed it, to encourage and validate their experiences and accomplishments. Why is there no one to do the same for me? 

I probably have no one to blame but myself. It must be something about my personality, something about my character that just sets people off. Maybe it’s a vicious cycle of my lack of self worth and not being valued by people. Maybe that’s how I ended up a toy to guys who dumped me as soon as they got tired of fucking me.

886,hamartiated,1590116838,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I came to the United States during my freshmen year from Pakistan. I was a smart kid. Always excelled in school, had friends, and never felt lonely. Then I came to the United States with my family. I sat alone my whole sophomore year in the cafeteria and never made any friends. Chatted with kids and hanged out with them too but they were not really friends. It was either for a short time or they just wouldn’t hit me up after some time. I did okay in high school and had a 3.8 GPA. Now fast forward to junior year in college, still haven’t made a single friend except one friend that I met in HS and that is the only person I talk to this day. I’ve completely changed. I went into severe depression two years ago, grades plummeted, and I was never able to recover.

896,white424,1590110203,1,"That's what it appears to be. You can never fully become 100% compatible with anyone. It would literally have to be a clone of you.

You can only be compatible with others for so long, as some incompatibilities and differences are inevitably going to show up.

 The degree of how much you're compatible with others is measured by how long you can be in harmony without any alarms.

But, when it does hit it's your choice to compromise or work through and getting over these obstacles, or you can let the connection just die.

My issue has always been the duration. I've observed that the ""connections"" last longer only of I do hide parts of who I am, keeping my inner world to myself with all or most of what it has without sharing.

It's not putting up a facade, but rather showing a small percentage of who I am, concealing other dimensions of my personality, my essence.

That, my friend, has been proven to be the most unsustainable, unpleasant, unfulfilling thing to do.

It makes no difference, it doesn't fill anything you have missing inside of you. Truth is, it will only drain your energy. 

And when It becomes too unbearable to sustain, I disappear from their lives and just want them gone out of mine.

Then I get hit with:

""Oh jokes on you, you're lonely because you have ridiculously high standards""

""You take yourself very seriously, self centered, and want others to do all the work""

Well, just no. 

All I've ever wanted was to find someone the feels the same way I do about the world, that has a similar lense, a similar mindset.
That can extract from my essence as a person and pull out thoughts, ideas and can actually reflect on them as well.


The just have to keep up intellectually, the don't have to always generate responses, or add anything new to my perspective. But if they can just get me, period. It would be the best experience ever.

""Maybe you haven't tried truly opening up to others!, You haven't given anyone a chance!!""

While I'm very good at observing patterns and forming pretty accurate predictions of the person I'm talking to has substance or lacks any, Yes. i have opened up to multiple people.

If you ask me? Worst thing I ever did, it caused massive internal damage because I felt so robbed.

Here's the thing, most people are these empty boxes. The box can be made of gold on the outside, but it's actually weightless.

These are the people who fool you into thinking they are unique, but they're not. They can fool you into making you think they're compatible with you, but in reality they are just mirroring you on the surface just to get along.

Time goes by, and you eventually realize something is wrong..

I'm not saying I'm the most unique person in the world that better than everyone and can't find company because of it.

But all I'm saying is I don't wanna be an empty box, or associate with any.

I'm sure there's a sub for these type of posts but I don't know that sub.\]

I've been waiting all my life for it to start. I waited when I was 14 and I thought high school was where it's at. I waited when I was 18 and I thought college is where it's at. I'm waiting now, on the other side of my mid 20's, and I don't know where it's at anymore. I still have hope, that maybe next month, next year, my next chapter in life will be the big change I need and I will finally find myself, but with hope comes disappointment.

The older I get, the more irrational my hope becomes, I feel. And you know what, a time will come when it will be too late. I mean, I know it's never too late to make a friend, find love, find happiness, whatever... but it can be too late to be able to let go of the bitterness of previous years of pain and loneliness, too late to undo the damage to your personality. I find myself more and more bitter and regretful, thinking about my teenage years and my college years and how I will never get them back, and my memories from those times will taint my future experiences forever. My loneliness is starting to seriously define me as a person, and being a fundamentally lonely person doesn't lend itself to making new friends and being happy. My time is split between daydreaming of a better future and daydreaming of being able to restart my life and get a re-do, which is obviously impossible and quite harmful to be focusing on.

Still, I can't help but feel so much regret, and it's not even about my actions. It's regret about things well beyond anyone's control, like wishing I was born in a different time, in a different place, with different people around me, with different personality, different body, everything... And I'm horribly envious of people who seem to have had those better experiences. Teens who had friends to hang out after school, have some laughs, grab some food. Who had close friends to have sleepovers with, and talk about their private thoughts, just enjoying the feeling of closeness. College students who moved away from their homes for the first time and had a great experience of living with peers for the first time, socializing, discovering together how to be adults. Hanging out, studying together, traveling together. Like, I can still have a bunch of those experiences in theory... but my time is running out. Soon I will be in my late 20's, then my 30's. Who will have a sleepover with me then, who will have time to spend hours just hanging out doing nothing, who will want to run around town just clowning around.

As a result of my loneliness, I also feel like I've become quite immature for my age. I used to be ""mature for my age"" back then, but now it's the opposite. Not that I behave like a kid, but I have that mindset of still being in my late teens or very early 20s because I'm stuck in that era. My life has had no measurable progress since then and I've had no experiences to grow along with, so that's where I still am mentally, and I refuse to progress with my life until I get to experience the things other 20-something year olds experience. I see some of my peers are starting to ""slow down"" and ""settle down"" and find someone to live a life with after years of crazy fun, and I'm still waiting for the fun part of my life to even begin.

And I guess this will now become my personal venting part of the post unrelated to the rest, but you know what's the ultimate nail in the coffin? That I actually have a ""best friend"", took me years of trying to even make that one single friend. But I'm sure I have more than some people here could say, and I bet some people here would think they would be much more happy and grateful for having what I have. They're probably right. I don't know if it's the years of loneliness, or just my personality, but I can't seem to appreciate the friendship for what it is, and instead I just keep wanting more. It's never enough, the loneliness never fades.

This person I've wanted for so long, a friend, a confidante, I had her, but something changed and now it just hurts somehow, sometimes just as much as it feels good. She changed since we've begun our friendship, and I haven't, not in the way she did. We have different ideas on how often we want to talk now, me being the much more ""needy"" one, and it leads us to argue a lot. Really, when I think about it, us having the arguments we have about how often and the way we communicate with each other, they're kinda fucked up. It doesn't seem like the way a proper friendship should work, I don't think there are any friends who have to negotiate how often they text each other, and yet I truly do feel like she is a friend despite the feeling like it's all fucked up.

Still, I'm pained to admit that I find myself often dreaming of having a new friend, because she's just pulling away from me and we seem to be extremely mis-matched now that's she's so fundamentally changed. I just need to talk to someone, you know? I need that person that she used to be for me. We used to talk every day, talking about ourselves, our days, everything. Now she says she can go on for days without talking to anyone and be perfectly happy. Isn't that exactly what we complain about here? That going on for days of not talking to anyone sends us down the loneliness spiral?

How does she do it? Why doesn't she enjoy talking to me more? Would it be different if I was different? Will she find a better friend than me, and want to talk to them more than me? What's wrong with me, why am I so needy? Is it even needy to want to talk to your best friend multiple times a week? Idk, I feel like it's normal. She says true friends can not speak for months and then finally catch up like no time has passed. While that's true, that's not the only way to be true friends, and it's not the way I want to be friends. Nothing personally against that, but I just don't qualify that as a ""best friend"" kinda friendship. I need that contact, I need to be caught up and present in each other's lives, I need to share my events and thoughts as they happen, and hear theirs in return too. Not just a few times in a year few-hour-conversations. It just not what I want.

But what choice do I have if my best and only friend literally doesn't want to talk to me. She finds it draining, she says it's a burden to force herself to talk to me as often as I want it. She finds it boring and mundane, she quite literally doesn't feel the same need I do. She feels forced to be glued to her phone. I believe her that this is how she feels, I'm sure it is a burden, but it's just salt in the wound that loneliness left in me. It's so humiliating to say, but I've cried so many times, like ugly cried with snot and shit, and contemplated suicide many times, just because I feel so damn lonely despite her, and sometimes because of her. (But no hotline numbers please— I don't need one, I'm good). I still feel like I am happier and less lonely with her rather than without her, but damn does it hurt sometimes, like the eternal mental pain of existence. I'm just waiting to start living my life, one day when I can have what I want and feel happy for once.

The other day spotify randomly recommended me this song, and I think it reflects my fear, that my friend doesn't want to talk to me because of me, not her. That it's not just her personal preference, that if I was a different person, she would want to talk to me more often, she wouldn't find it a chore.

""Give me a dirty look, scream till you’re blue in the face  
Throw punches and tell me you hate me, I’ll handle it all with grace  
But there’s one thing I know to be true, that you can’t deny  
People call who they wanna talk to

People call  
People write  
Near or far  
People try  
It’d be easy I know if I lived on your road"" (David Ramirez - People Call Who They Wanna Talk To)

I'll include a list of some things I hope I get to do one day (hopefully soon) with friend(s), and I hope I can be happy while doing them, like an honest, real happy that will make me forget how it felt to cry from the pain of being alive.

* I want to sit on a rooftop of a building, with a nice cold refreshing drink in hand, watching the sky change hues as the sun goes down and talk about our futures.
* I want to play switch games together online.
* I want to take a walk in my favorite park, just walking hand in hand, and enjoying it, not thinking about anything.
* I want for us to read a book out loud to each other.
* I want to be caught in a surprise downpour, run to find shelter but not before we get absolutely soaked and we feel gross and look ridiculous.
* I want to entrust someone to cut or dye my hair.
* I want to travel to south-east asia, eat food from the street stalls, try all the snacks and dishes I read and always wondered about.
* I want to go to a stand-up show together, laugh our asses off. Or a stage production. Or a drag show.
* I want to go on a spur-of-the-moment bus trip to a different city, just to try some food we heard about there.
* I want to go to whatever amusement park.
* I want to be surprised for a birthday, some other event, or even for no reason.
* I want to go to a party where I actually have fun with the people I know, and when I go home and the sun is just coming up and I lay in my quiet bedroom, I can recall all the good moments that have just happened.
* I want to go to the movies, and see more than one movie in a row.
* I want to host, or be invited to, a dinner where we all cook together in a tiny kitchen and then share it. I'd make a complicated dessert that I would've never made for just one person because it's too much effort.
* I want to stay up the whole night out on the town. Find whatever places are open in the dead of night and visit them all.
* I want to be confided in, and offer my advice/comfort.
* I want to get on a subway/bus to a neighborhood I haven't been to yet, and see what it looks like over there.
* I want to come over to their house/apartment and help put together some furniture, do some renovations, pack/unpack some stuff.
* I want to go on a huge, once in a lifetime road trip.",lonely,I'm still waiting for my life to start,2020-05-22 09:52:34

The zoom sessions, the throwbacks and even visits to each others places. Most of the time I don't feel like talking to anyone but when I scroll through my timeline and come across such posts, an overwhelming feeling of loneliness takes over me. I want to make new friends but I don't even properly contact the people I do have in my life. I want to enjoy life like others but I feel a miserable lack of energy to put any efforts.

904,Forsaken-Inspector,1590103038,1,"It might be odd but the feeling of missing my grandpa is present in any love song where they sing about missing someone or even loving someone deeply. 

He was my person, my everything; my dad, my mom, my friend, even sometimes it felt like he was my child. We had a connection that couldn’t be compared to any other family member or person in general for him and let alone for me. 
He was the only person who could make me feel not lonely and his hugs would fill my heart and soul.

He died a little over a year ago and his 92nd birthday would have been this last Monday. I miss him so much. So much it feels like too much really. I don’t know to not cry whenever i remember him and I do a lot.

I would always tell him that he couldn’t leave me alone and on the last birthday I had with him he was so eager to see me as I was on another city for work and was kind of reluctant to drive home because I was tired. I think that he knew that it was the last, maybe he sensed it bc he pushed me to go home and I’m so happy he did. 

I regret I didn’t take pictures of us that day. I felt gross and ugly as I had gained weight and also tired for the driving but I remember all his sarcastic comments and his face when he payed the bill. He was always complaining about money but he didn’t do it that day.

Until today it feels like a horrible nightmare and that I’ll go home and he will receive me with a hug. 

Everybody says I should be glad I gave him lots of love and attention and that’s what matter but I still need him a lot. I know it might not be fair for him but I wished he would have stayed longer. 10 years longer and that we went away together.

I feel lost without him. I feel like I’ve lost my home. I have no home now.",lonely,Every love song reminds me of grandpa 💔,2020-05-22 09:17:18

906,Nitronicart,1590101136,2,"I've been stuck in the house for about 2 years. I left school, went to sixth form for exactly one day because the anxiety physically hurt me enough to throw me off, went to college for a week or two, left that too because I didn't know what I was doing and I wasn't making any friends and lastly I joined a course that lasted 6 weeks. It was designed to build my confidence and here and there it helped but again, no friends were made and my anxiety only got worse.

My only friends are online but I don't know if we're friends or not. I haven't had true friends since primary school (over a decade and a half ago now) but I'm starting to lose the definition of 'friends'. 
I feel like I do so much for my online friends. I give them art gifts and I've even contributed well over 50+ pieces of art for an RPG one of them is making but in return I don't get much. 
None of them roleplay with me or take much interest in my characters. Only one if them has ever gifted me art in return. Only one of them tries their best to connect with my characters but it's rare. He usually focuses on others. Last time we roleplayed was a few months ago, but every other day he is concentrated on someone else. None of them speak to me in PM to know me better. None of them usually care for what I say. 

I'm confused. 

I don't care much for art or gifts, but the token would be nice, considering how much I've done for them. I always put in my full effort too! I draw their characters more than I draw my own aha. 

May be I'm being a female friend simp. I'm not begging for much, just a little bit of notice and appreciation, that's not bad, right? 

I've been friends with them before I left school but in all of that time nothing has really changed and it likely doesn't help that our timezones are different. 

This entire month I've been more silent and iffy. I feel angry all the time, I want to cry but nothing happens and whenever I try to express this, they don't care. But maybe I complain about loneliness too much. 

I've been in my bedroom for so long, so disconnected that I don't even know who I am. I don't know what I want to do, who I want to be. I don't know how to find purpose, motivation and confidence. I literally can't figure out my own personality and there are times where I want to give up on speaking. I want to turn mute because half of the time not even my family listens to me. My speech has been slacking and slurred lately but that's probably because I'm a buck toothed rabbit :')

I think my physical health is really taking a toll. I never have an appetite, I rarely eat (even though I genuinely do want to put on weight), My hair has turned all broken and wirey, I lack iron but I never so anything to help it, I get out of breath easily, I'm dizzy, my head hurts, I get random pains and aches and my body just seems to... wobble. It feels like I'm 70 years old but here I am at 17. 


I don't know what it means to be me, what it means to have friends and what it means to have purpose. Today wasn't bad. I talked to my online friends after shutting them out for 2 days but as soon as I returned they only cared about talking about the RPG. I have a passion for it too and I love making art and giving ideas for it but I just wish the RPG wasn't the only thing keeping us together. I suddey feel bad again tonight, hence why I'm writing this.

910,kingtorro28,1590097968,3,"Hello fellow adventurer,

The path ahead is winding, troublesome, and full of dangers. Here is a list of equipment you may need for your journey.

Compass - 

Make no mistake you will get lost along the way but it is a bit easier when you have that in mind beforehand. If you are lost, keep moving. Even if you have to fight, climb and crawl your way there, you will find the road again. If you remain in place you will remain lost. Just take a step and then another. It may feel awkward at first but becomes natural overtime. Even if you wander aimlessly for a bit each step is logged and counts toward progression. You have to be bad at things before you can be good at them.

Torch -

You must be able to see where you're going in order to walk the path. It can be scary because there are monsters moving along the tree lines and in the shadows. Many adventurers choose to look at their feet and ignore the monsters. Be courageous. Light your torch and keep your eyes fixed ahead. While it's true that the monsters are scary it is really being seen which they fear. You must look where you least want to look to find what you most want to find. 

Boots - 

You are the only one who can walk your path. If your boots are damaged and muddy you will constantly be tripping over yourself. Clean your boots. Treat yourself like someone you care for. In all situations you are your only guaranteed travel companion. If you are patient and attentive you will realize that you make better company than you think. 

Passport -

There are many adventurers like you roaming the roads on similar yet distinct journeys. You may see the others in passing be sure to give a smile for they share the same burden that you do. Show support to others where you can because it costs nothing and helps them along their path.

Check your backpack. Make sure you have the tools needed for the road ahead. They may need some repair but that's ok. Just fix what you can, do what you can, and know that walking in your own company doesn't have to be such a bad thing. 

Signed with love

911,Vezi_Ordinary,1590096932,1,"I bombed a virtual interview yesterday morning, and I was fine until just an hour ago. Then my mind turned against me and I just broke down in tears. I don't even care about the job, I was just so disappointed in my performance in the interview.

I needed someone to speak to so I thought to call my brother who is probably my closest friend, and I still might but he has a toddler and his own mental health stuff going on. 

Who can I call? Maybe 3 acquaintances I last texted over a month ago. I've even managed to alienate wider family.

I like being social in small doses, but I can never keep friendships and I feel like that will sink me in the end. 

I want to do better, but I never learned the skill of maintaining relationships when you don't have to be physically close to them e.g. school/work friends.

I'm working on a social group platform, designed to help users discover people who have similar interests and experiences, and to see what's going on around you. This way they can meet up in real life and coordinate social interactions. You can think of it as similar Meetup but free, more secure, wide demographic, and many other features. Great for travelers, students, communities &amp; groups of all kinds.

This would be perfect to meet people with in real life doing real activities. Of course after we're in a better situation with our current events!

Features: live map with events and people, a secure encrypted chat, and a discovery feed to meet new people.

Today my boss asked the staff how everyone was holding up and most of them said they were super anxious, going crazy, or are depressed.  But for me a person who lives alone in a tiny apartment, I haven’t minded the lockdown one bit.  

3yrs ago I moved to a new city, and just couldn’t build a social circle out side of work for whatever reasons.  Even though I was never cool or popular per-say growing up, I always had a group of friends with whom I felt I belonged.  But when I moved to this new city on my own for a job after college, I’ve been in solitude for basically the whole duration of my stay, only to socialize every once in a blue moon.

Now in lockdown, it seems like everyone else is experiencing the same pain of isolation I’ve been  dealing with the past 3yrs the thing is, but when they’re feeling all of this fear and anxiety, I feel almost nothing, like I am numb to whole thing.

Because I wont go to school everyday where I meet classmates everyday and it honestly scares me thinking about it. I think that most people meet their lifelong friends somewhere in their school years or in colleges. But the problem is that our colleges and universities are quite different from the ones in the US and the UK for example. We don´t have dorm rooms where we live with other people. As you might expect I don´t have many friends. And the friends i´ve got are very different from myself, and we don´t hang out that often. As I am less than 20 years old right now, it means that i could have 60 years left to live.

I do have some friends now, but I just kinda feel like I don't have a strong connection with them. I know I'm not their first option. They have more friends and that's okay. I've never experienced having a best friend, and sometimes I'm upset about it.

It is hard to me to make some friends. I've always been the quiet kid in the room. All my life I got good grades, but now they're starting to go down. Just like my mood. I joined some groups of people at my high school. It's like I've been rotating through all these friend groups. That's been constant my whole life. I've known a lot of nice people, but we didn't have so much in common, so we stopped talking.

I've tried making friends online so many times I can't even remember. I've downloaded a lot of apps. Every conversation fails. I'm not good at carrying them. Maybe that's the reason why I'm alone.

I have always wondered why this happens to me. I think it's because there's nothing I'm passionate about. I mean, I like some things. Songs, artists, actors, films, video games, whatever...

937,WorthEfficiency2,1590077945,5,"I was about to remove my porn data that took a lot of time to gather. I was going through the data to see what's porn and what's not. Some of the stuff is so amazing that I had to make this post. I want to research if its possible to live virtually basically. Maybe I can live like that? VR headset, big monitors, good headsets? 

This tool I'm typing on, and most things on the title, are designed to give me OPTIMIZED dopamine hits so that I keep using the tool, so the makers and shareholders of the tool can benefit themselves. Trillions of dollars are spent to optimize such tools every decade. Tens of millions of jobs exist to optimize these dopamine hits.

Dopamine inducing activities used to be meaningful, fulfilling and good for me. See a great ass? You go chase it, do whatever necessary to fuck it, then you fuck it. Bam now you have a family and kids. Now you got meaning and fulfillment. I'm making this sound funny but I trust you get the point.

The dopamine inducing activities we are exposed to now are MANMADE. They're optimized to make us dependent on them. They exist at the expense of their users, for the most part. Porn exist by killing certain parts of porn users. ASMR exists by killing certain parts of ASMR users. Same goes for everything in the title, except hobbies depending on what they are. At the very least, they kill their users' existence, aka lives,  aka they waste your time.

Also we're not used to them considering evolution's slow change. Dopamine released from an activity no longer indicates the activity is meaningful, fulfilling or good for us. Its often the opposite. All of the things in the title except maybe hobbies are like that. Most of our brain evolved to chase dopamine because it used to be good for us, but that was before we created tools to artificially give us dopamine hits. So our brain is NOT properly adapted to the world yet. That's why we do dopamine inducing things even if its bad for us in the long term. I can use my frontal cortex and go through pain of discipline, focus and hard work to give myself meaning, fulfillment, etc and remove bad dopamine inducing activities. 

BUT maybe I don't have to. Maybe I can live a life of cheap dopamine hits? Can I realistically live that? My life expenses are paid off from my investments. I technically don't have to do anything difficult until I'm dead. I can surround myself with most hedonistic virtual stuff possible. VR headsets for 360 degrees porn or games, huge monitors, idk stuff like that. 

The damn ass that made me ask this question is just so amazing. It's just magnificent. To have that in real life, I need to work really fucking hard and I may never get it. I'm 99.9% certain I need to completely quit porn and all of the things in the title except hobbies, if I want to have the real versions of what I digitally have now.

I want to get the strongest arguments that support the idea that someone can exist digitally (aka what I described in the title). I want these arguments, so that I can think of them, and reject that path without a second thought if I feel like looking at porn again or order junk food etc (or maybe I'll go down that path idk). I'm completely serious. I really want those arguments.",lonely,"Can someone *realistically* live his life through things like porn, asmr, digital games, hobbies, comfort food, memes, movies, shows and internet?",2020-05-22 02:19:05

The last 2 years of living alone have been great but then corona virus hit in my city, and we're one of the hardest hit cities in the in the globe in NYC. I saw all of my friends leave the area to go home and spend time with their families, but I'm stuck here alone. I tell most people it's because of my pet and not being able to bring her back to my family's home but that's a lie. My mom is staying with someone right now to prepare for buying a home and I can't go there. But what's worse is my father is nearby and has room for me, but his wife is one of the worst women I've ever encountered in my life. We've met TWO times ever because she hates that I exist from his prior marriage. The second time was as an adult and she made me feel like shit and essentially rude for having the audacity to exist. I'm sure she's mentally unwell but functions as a normal person so it's hard to remember that context. My siblings are all home, spending time with each other and my dad and I'm stuck alone in my apartment. This all made me realize my home is where I live, all alone. I really don't have a home to go back to, and that made me feel so so horribly sad especially when I have family members who love me nearby. I feel so lonely hearing about others spending time with their families and having game nights and getting closer with siblings they'd been apart from for work or school. I'm so jealous and it sucks because there's literally nothing I can do. I talked to my dad about it and it really isn't something he can change. He has other children with her and needs to keep her happy for their sake, but he hates the situation as well and has tried his best to fix it. She's too stubborn and unreasonable to budge. I can't talk about it with my sister even though we're close because I know it would make her feel so sad too. I'm stuck here alone because I want my loved ones to have an easier situation than me, but why won't anyone prioritize my feelings or my loneliness? It sucks that I get the short end of the stick and have to spend months in isolation with one friend in town to take walks with, in a world that is so so scary to be in. I hate this so much, and there's literally nothing I can do to fix it. All I'm wishing is to sit on a couch with a loved one and just not be alone, and I can't have that because of this woman.

It’s just insane to me that I really haven’t had any other kind of love interest since then. I thought I’d have been dating plenty and have my life together and have someone else. I’m tired of not having anyone to share things with, someone to check in with, someone I can tell my accomplishments, someone who would be proud of them. Don’t get me wrong, I love myself and the things I’m doing with my life right now, but this lack of social relationships and intimacy in my life is daunting. I still miss her sometimes and think about her smile even all these years later, sometimes I just can’t fathom why she had to leave and ponder why I’m so pathetic that I feel sorry for myself. She moved on while we were still dating, I can’t even move on four years later. Those thoughts haunt me. I don’t really know what I can do to make someone interested in me, it’s like I have no choice but to keep on focusing on myself and just living my own life. It also eats me up the guy she ran to is so much older, in his 40s when we were 21. A very successful guy though, and I kind of doubt he ever had to go through this loneliness for years. I’m sure he always had someone. Just makes me feel pathetic and lonely. 

I wanna feel love again, I want someone to laugh with, smile at, stare at their beauty, cherish and relish moments with, someone to look forward to the future with, someone to talk about life with when it gets difficult and scary.

962,Sakkara1,1590052637,1,"This is the first time I'm ever sharing this story, so please bear with me. Years ago in middle school I was good friends with this one girl. I was an awkward and introverted kid, and she was one of the few people who didn't mind hanging out with me. After middle school though my family moved to another place and I lost contact with her for the entirety of high school. I was also really awkward and socially inept there, while also going through an embarrassing metalhead phase, long hair, band t-shirts and all - I've mellowed out and cut my hair after the final exams.

Anyways, I moved out for university to another city, and by chance I found out that my old friend was also there and met up with her. We started hanging out more and more, I got infatuated with her and eventually in December 2015, after seeing a movie, I got the courage to ask her to be something more than friends. She accepted, but retrospectively I think she wasn't too happy about it.

That relationship was... weird, to say the least. It lasted less than two months. She clearly changed a bit ever since we last saw each other. Our interests didn't align as much as they used to. She wouldn't want to hang out together more than once a week, claiming she had other stuff to do and people to meet - it felt like having an appointment, not being a relationship. She didn't want me to meet her own friends and to this day I don't know why - was she embarrassed of me? Who knows. Her prom was coming up as she was still in the last year of high school, and since someone asked her to go with her before I got together with her, she wouldn't call it off and went with someone else while I was stuck at my dorm. 

I don't want to pin all the blame on her though, I wasn't really a good boyfriend either - I had no clue what to do as I've never been in a relationship before and was pretty much going through the motions of what a relationship should look like. Didn't know where we could go together or what to do, as I was new to the city and didn't have any friends there. 

Eventually Valentines came up, and when I went to visit her with some flowers, something was visibly wrong. The atmosphere was weirdly tense, she wouldn't want to kiss me beyond a quick smooch as a hello, we simply ended up watching a movie in silence and then I left, kicking myself because I've done something wrong and I have no idea what.

A week later I got a call from her that we need to see each other and I already knew what was going to happen, though I meekly clung to the hope that it would be something else. I was still infatuated with her despite all that as she was the only girl who has ever given me attention. But yeap, I went to see her, and she broke up with me during a walk. I don't even remember her words anymore, I think she said that we weren't a good match, we should stop seeing each other, that she still thinks I'm a good person, yada yada. She also said that she already made up her mind a week ago, but didn't want to dump me then as it was Valentine's Day. I was heartbroken. There was some talk about remaining friends, but we ended up not speaking to each other since. I distinctly remember getting on the bus back to my dorm and breaking down crying once she could no longer see me. Nowadays I think she only accepted my confession because she felt pity for me.

It's already been over four years since that incident. I didn't manage to even get close to another girl since, not even a single date, nothing. I'm riddled with some mental problems like depression, insecurity and very low self esteem. I'm trying to work on it, recently I even bought a book on mindfulness and self compassion that my therapist recommended me, but I don't know if I'll ever be ""normal"". It feels like everyone that I know around me - be it from work, university mates or old schoolmates - is in a relationship, some are even getting married already. I'm even renting out an apartment with two other people who both have girlfriends, goddammit. Any talk about women or sex is extremely uncomfortable for me as I have absolutely NOTHING to add, I have no experience and feel ashamed and embarrassed about it. I don't even have many opportunities to meet a girl anymore, as I'm out of university and as an introvert I don't go to bars or clubs - they're not my cup of tea whatsoever. I don't have many friends, either. I feel very lonely, especially now in the time of quarantine. My biggest fear is remaining alone forever and I don't know what to do about it.

966,Corespirit,1590050125,1,"The woman on the other end of the phone spoke lightheartedly of spring and of her 81st birthday the previous week.

“Who did you celebrate with, Beryl?” asked Alison, whose job was to offer a kind ear.

“No one, I…”

And with that, Beryl’s cheer turned to despair.

Her voice began to quaver as she acknowledged that she had been alone at home not just on her birthday, but for days and days. The telephone conversation was the first time she had spoken in more than a week.

About 10,000 similar calls come in weekly to an unassuming office building in this seaside town at the northwest reaches of England, which houses The Silver Line Helpline, a 24-hour call center for older adults seeking to fill a basic need: contact with other people.

Loneliness, which Emily Dickinson described as “the Horror not to be surveyed,” is a quiet devastation. But in Britain, it is increasingly being viewed as something more: a serious public health issue deserving of public funds and national attention.

Working with local governments and the National Health Service, programs aimed at mitigating loneliness have sprung up in dozens of cities and towns. Even fire brigades have been trained to inspect homes not just for fire safety but for signs of social isolation.

“There’s been an explosion of public awareness here, from local authorities to the Department of Health to the media,” said Paul Cann, chief executive of Age UK Oxfordshire and a founder of The Campaign to End Loneliness, a five-year-old group based in London. “Loneliness has to be everybody’s business.”

Researchers have found mounting evidence linking loneliness to physical illness and to functional and cognitive decline. As a predictor of early death, loneliness eclipses obesity.

“The profound effects of loneliness on health and independence are a critical public health problem,” said Dr. Carla M. Perissinotto, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. “It is no longer medically or ethically acceptable to ignore older adults who feel lonely and marginalized.”

In Britain and the United States, roughly one in three people older than 65 live alone, and in the United States, half of those older than 85 live alone. Studies in both countries show the prevalence of loneliness among people older than 60 ranging from 10 percent to 46 percent.

While the public, private and volunteer sectors in Britain are mobilizing to address loneliness, researchers are deepening their understanding of its biological underpinnings. In a paper published earlier this year in the journal Cell, neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology identified a region of the brain they believe generates feelings of loneliness. The region, known as the dorsal raphe nucleus, or D.R.N., is best known for its link to depression.

Kay M. Tye and her colleagues found that when mice were housed together, dopamine neurons in the D.R.N. were relatively inactive. But after the mice were isolated for a short period, the activity in those neurons surged when those mice were reunited with other mice.

967,Xenulordofthesky,1590047589,1,"I had many friends, I was happy and didn't really feel lonely or sad since I had such a big support group. We all did things together, hangout every single day and had fun being stupid together, it literally was the perfect setup. 
Fast forward a couple years and we go into 2016, it was a great year for me since I had an amazing job that paid insanely well. 
Things changed though, I noticed people quit hitting me up, they were getting offended over my jokes I posted on Facebook and I noticed my friends list was shrinking.
I downloaded an app called ""Who Unfriended Me?"" which tells you in real-time the moment someone unfriended you on Facebook, with their full name so you know who it was exactly.
Once I installed that app I got dozens of notifications daily from it saying ""&lt;insert name&gt; has unfriended/ blocked you"". And it was all from the people I thought were my best friends, over the course of about a week or so I had already lost 80+ friends and counting.
The last straw was on my birthday NOBODY wished me a happy birthday, dead silence for the entire day. 
That was what made me decide to deactivate my account and just forget about everyone. I just think back on all the fun I had and I just miss all my friends, its been lonely living life without friends and I wish them all the best.

973,rx9ue,1590041774,1,"To be honest this is one of my realest posts I've done. 

It sucks that my college got shut down due to corona virus. Because I really think I met someone truly special. We had a intermediate studio class for music, one activity I heard her sing something and it immediately caught my attention, the next week we had a exam where it was 1 on 1 with the professor for a mixdown of the music studio console. And I saw her and asked her what she does and she told me she sings and stuff and we were chatting about that then I went back to where I was sitting then she comes up to me and asks about me and what I do, and I was a bit confused becuase no one really asks me stuff like that. Then I told her and we started to talk about random stuff after that was done. And I find out She is a hardcore gamer she has played all the games I  have played even ones I didn't think she knew about and I was like yo this girl is amazing. So one of her friends come up to her when we are talking about music,  and they start to conversate which is 100 percent fine becuase I love music so I joined the convo then after a bit I left to go home and she says ""what no goodbye"" and then proceeds to open her arms and want a hug and I'm not gonna lie I was in heaven when I hugged her it felt real and great. So the next day of class I see her wearing a Kakashi shirt from Naruto and I'm a huge fan of Naruto it's my favorite show and she loves it as well so we start to talk about it. I told her to text me during class becuase talking is kinda disruptive so she asks me for my number and I give it to her and we start text then she asks me if I wanna ditch and go do something... I said HELL YEA. So we both leave and we go hang out. And everyday after class we would hang out and it was honestly such a good time it made me put a smile of my face, a real one. She brightened my day. I could talk to her for hours and she has such a amazing personality not to mention she is really cute and pretty. And it makes real sad that I  haven't heard from her in a while. This is how I feel she was truly special I don't think I met anyone like her before. And I wanna talk to her but she hasn't responded to my texts which is fine but I wish I could go back and re live those moments. It just makes me sad and depressed becuase I really did like her. I miss her....

I don’t even remember the last time I’ve received a notification with someone just checking in to see how I’m doing. My 21st birthday is coming up soon, and I just know deep down that even if everything was open, I’d probably just go to work, come home, and go to bed like any other day. It’s pathetic but it’s not like I’d have many other options.

I just want someone to laugh with, who cares enough to ask how I’m doing, who doesn’t view me as a burden.

I am writing these letters with no intention of actually sending them to you. I hope one day that we reconnect in a way where it will be appropriate to show you my consistent feelings for you. 

We last spoke only two days ago but I haven't been able to call you mine for about a month now. I am currently not doing well with it and have been grasping at straws to find anyone to listen. 

I know that I hurt you internally and this is exactly what I've deserved and no less. I was not a good man to you and I've hardly been a man at all. There are no excuses for my behaviors but I hope that you do not judge me solely on my worst decisions. If I could build a time machine, than I know exactly where I would choose to replay history from. (Next time Hitler)

I have always said that some people need to hit rock bottom to actually see that a change in their lifestyle is necessary but i did not realize that i was one of those people until it was too late. 

I have loved you since the first days we met when we would stay up until the sun rose just talking. We hadn't even kissed yet and I would dance as i walked home from the pure elation of meeting you. Unfortunately, that round wasn't our time and we spent over a year apart where I tried to move on and forget about you. I never did. Although I dated other women, I always held you in my mind and in my music. When we stumbled back into each other's lives, I teared up when I began to tell you that I had missed you. I continued to tear up every time I expressed my feelings towards you. 

You were still hesitant towards me and I began to self-destruct. I made poor choices when I faced a reality that I was harboring love that was not accepted. Choices that I will always regret. If I could have known what the future held than I would have played it out differently. Its hard to face rejection for that long but I should have been stronger. 

Once you gave me your all, I continued with my self destructive behaviorsand I don't even know why.. maybe because I didn't think I deserved happiness after the last year of self-deprecation. I put others feeling ahead of yours and over stepped boundaries where I knew better. Worst of all though was that I was dishonest with you and began omitting truths to protect myself. 

Honestly, I was just afraid. I loved you for so long and although the relationship was just beginning for you, I had spent so much energy thinking of you for so long that I was scared to lose it. ""What makes this situation different?"" You are probably asking. I am going to remain loyal, abstinent and dedicated to you since we were last together even if you aren't here. I may not be able to call you mine but I will never stop being yours. I hope one day that you see my true devotion to you. 

I will continue to write to you as the days go by, ********. Always with you on my mind. 

I love you always,

So just a little background.
I’m 15 my parents broke up when I was 11~12. They decided that shared custody(I’m not sure if it’s the right word but google translate says so) would be better for us. Everything was fine until my mother found a boyfriend. They’re together since November and even though I didn’t really like him I could endure him like I would only see him 2~3 days per week. But when coronavirus started to get big where I live my dad decided to stop doing share custody for a moment. So I was 7 weeks with my mom. We had several fights we cried a lot I said mean stuff she said mean stuff and since then our relationship is...tense. Maybe I’m just a salty teenager but I think of my mom would had never meet her boyfriend our relation would still be good.Sometimes I don’t talk to her for a day or 2(I work a lot so I’m not home often). Now the more “lonely” stuff. In life I have only 3 “real friends” and one of them lives like a thousand km away because she loved this summer. And the other 2 it’s kinda awkward since a couple of month. So my only last friend was my mom. But now as u can probably know I’m not really friend with her anymore. So I just feel alone and lonely constantly. I have coworkers but they’re just coworkers I’ll never hang out with them or anything. I’m assuming that everyone has seen titanic so u must know how rose felt at the beginning. Well I feel just like her and like she said “I feel like I’m standing in the middle of a crowded room screaming on the top of my lungs and no one even looks up”almost everyday someone asks me how I’m doing and I always say fine ok good or correct. I wish I could say that I always want to cry for no particular reason. But I’ve always felt lonely and never really expressed my emotions so I’m used to it. Honestly I don’t know how they can think that I’m happy like I never smile laugh or just have a happy face in general. That psy was more about sadness than loneliness but of u read all of that thank u very much.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

One of them never invites me to anything and now never talks to me unless they need help with math. At this point I’ve given up as I feel I make them uncomfortable when I try to talk to them and they clearly don’t want to hang out with me.

The other actually talked to me, but I now realize that’s because they didn’t know anyone at their college. Now that they have time to hang out with people they actually know I’m the last person they think about.

Monday I asked one of them if they wanted to go biking and they said they were busy. I asked if they were busy on Tuesday, and they were. Today I figured I’d ask again cause why not. I thought I’d rather hang out with someone who doesn’t really care about me rather than be alone. I no longer feel that way. They said they were busy and couldn’t go biking, and then some time later posted a video biking with a friend they actually care about.

So yeah, I’m done with friends. I always try to be a good friend and be supportive but I’m starting to feel I’m just fundamentally meant to be alone.

1002,auhsoo,1590021915,1,"It was only until recently that I've realized I have serious commitment issues. 

I've tried making and forming relationships but I always get that anxious feeling, like I struck out on luck and I'm just a huge burden. Whether it's a potential friend or partner, I get cold feet and run away. I ignore them. I stop talking. I stop interacting. 

All so I can protect myself and save myself the inevitable heartache of them either realizing they're too good for me or I'm bothersome or boring. 

I just don't want to disappoint anyone. I hate having to always be on high energy, to always entertain. I'm constantly putting on a show, somewhat of an exaggeration of a character just so I appear witty and fun and interesting. As soon as it gets exhausting, I start to cripple and feel guilty. Why was I even trying?? I felt like a liar. So I just let myself blend into the background like a switch.

In short, I'm so quick to extend my heart to people but just as quick to take it, run, and never look back.

It's such a terrible personality trait I have. Why am I like this? These people don't deserve it. They deserve friends/partners who will stick by them. Someone that'll maintain their relationship. 

But for my entire life I've never been able to do that. As much as I want to free myself of loneliness and be a normal person with normal relationships, I'm too coward and too much of a shitty person to put myself out there and STAY.

Sure, I have good qualities, but I can never truly call myself a ""good person"" when I have such commitment issues. And it's moments like these, when I'm in my room alone hopping around different apps on my phone trying to distract myself from terrible thoughts, is when I feel like I 100% deserve to suffer this way.

When I say our class was close, it means I literally cannot imagine making new friends, or even how to do it, or how I am suppose to act like some dudes I met in college for a semester are on the same level as guys I’ve known since I was 2. 

Thankfully God has taken care of my female classmates, most are married or successful,  it they have all moved away and we’ve lost contact. 

Joined the army reserve out of high school. Deployed right after my first year of college. All of the dudes I was getting to know dropped out or moved away. 

Now as I’m gettin ready to come back from deployment I literally have nothing to come back to, just a bank account full of money and no plan.

I have tried multiple ways of meeting people by joining clubs at schools and participating, sports, work, the few parties ive been invited to, the gym, etc. but no one seems to be interested in being more than very surface level ""friendship"". The few girls I have managed to have sex with and sorta have relationships with were from summer jobs and I realized too late I was the rebound, so I was dropped quickly and  left heart broken. I have tried apps for dating but the results were lukewarm as it seemed most people just wanted the attention. I have never had a date in my life and I feel sad and envious when people mention such and such date theyve had and what they did and how they were going to have another that very same week. Id like to know how one  even feels like...

I just dont understand it because I am fit, interesting, well read, playful, artsy, ive been told im charming, some people have even said im confident, good at talking to people, funny and ive even 
been told i was fun to be around. So I have sat almost every weekend in my room alone while people were out partying or with friends. I just dont get why I just seem to be a persona non grata.

To make matters worse if we can say that, I am a crossdresser (hence why im posting with this account, NSFW pictures youve been warned) but I do not require a partner to participate just that they be understanding and accepting. I  am someone who values honesty and so I would 100% tell a girl i was seeing but i feel it would turn off most women and end the relationship rather quickly. But its not like its an issue anyway since I cant seem to meet anyone. I just often doubt ill find someone honestly

I have had to lie in the past about what I did on the weekends to my coworkers and pretended I had friends. It honestly feels like a knife to the back knowing I have wasted years of my life at home and not even having a single person to hang out with or to talk to. I also get really sad when I overhear conversations of stories that happened to people OR when my parents remind me they used to go out and have so much fun and how they already had had many relationships at my age. As much as i dislike my job, it was my only social time and now that there is a quarantine, the weight of loneliness is hitting me HARD.

Florida’s wonderful school curriculum. Where we stress you out all year for a state standardized test that means nothing. Usually garbage teachers. because they are underpaid to sit and watch kids all day so you don’t learn anything.

I failed 7th grade because of bullying. Didn’t want to go to school. When I was 4 I was diagnosed with chronic migraines and with school it was daily pain and stress migraines. The bus being loud and hot. The cafeteria’s smells and loudness , disgusting bathrooms that had shit on the walls and ceiling  (Yes the fucking ceiling) and smelled like shit and deodorant. To the locker rooms which smelled like shitty dollar store cologne and sweat while also being loud as shit and hot as fuck. 

School was horrible. After being hospitalized 2 times for migraines lasting days at a time I failed 7th grade and started homeschool. Being inside a retirement community there were barely any other kids my age. Lonely is the one word I can put it. I haven’t talked to somebody my age in over a year now. And it hurts.

School was/is horrible for me. Even now I’m homeschooled and extremely behind. Probably going to fail this year as well and probably fail life. I sometimes wonder if maybe I was meant to be lonely.

The only thing going for me right now is my brother and my one friend on Xbox. I’m not an attention whore. I’m not big on groups or parties. At this point I’m probably going to grow socially awkward.

It gets me so pissed when I see people post things like “ oh my God I have no friends~” when they’ll have people to talk and text to and get notifications from multiple social media platforms on a daily basis. I can barely handle having one mutual friend. 

I really distanced myself a lot in high school. I didn’t really mind it at the time because I just figured everyone had their own stuff going on so why would they bother hearing about what I had to deal with. People would end up coming over to me out of pity and talking to me when I didn’t really care. It got to the point where it was so annoying when people would come to talk to me because they felt that I was so lonely when in actuality I just didn’t want to be with them because they seem to have better friends already that were better than me.

1082,lightwings64,1589945464,1,"Long story short, I've been struggling to cope with the quarantine loneliness.

A few months ago, just a couple weeks before the quarantines started, I moved 700 miles away from home for the first time to chase my dreams of becoming a pilot. Given my extremely busy schedule, I have virtually no opportunities to socialize and make friends, and living alone obviously doesn't help any either. Moving away has also made me realize who my true ""friends"" really were - my call's weren't getting returned, my texts not answered, and my parents became the only people who consistently reached out to me. 

So, as you might've guessed, I've gotten extremely lonely.

In my workplace, everyone else is either working from home, or just as busy as myself with no time to socialize. Tried dating apps, but I'm convinced that I have a cursed relationship with the algorithms that run those apps - no use in swiping for hours on end just to get no matches over the course of several months. Everything is closed, everyone is staying inside, social gatherings are prohibited, and I didn't get the chance to explore much of my new city while life was still normal. 

I try my best to stay positive and push away the want for human interaction, but you can only do that for so long. Just not sure what to do at this point, other than to share my thoughts on the internet to take my mind off of things. 

And yes, I did succeed in picking the absolute worst possible time to relocate myself from all friends and family in an unfamiliar city.",lonely,Trying to cope,2020-05-20 13:31:04

2016: August
it was 2016 and i've been talking to this girl 3 years younger than me, i always tried my best to have some courage and ask her out but always had something to do

I gave up until she texted a few months later asking me if I wanted to see Blair's witch 2016 with her i was like ""no way this has to be a joke"" i replied yes she even askwd when what day I was free 

we meet up go to the bus station but on the way some guy starts calling her she ignores him and said ""dont listen to him"" we go to the movies laugh at how bad the movie is wanted to grab some popcorn and she sticks her hand to touch mine i had a semi heart attack and started sweating a bit and keep watching the movie like nothing ever happened , when it ended no one was there and started throwing popcorn at eachother and laughed everything was good we even took a picture together until we parted ways...


I got an instagram notification saying she uploaded a new photo and turns out she was with this guy she used to train taekwondo and got lost in confusion ""why did she upload that photo?who is that guy?"" (he'll turn into a recurrent character in the later season) my head was full of questions i couldnt sleep until next day comes and she still didnt upload the photo but i turned off the phone and started gaming i didnt want to think about that photo

But i was so weak 8 hours later i turn it on and asked her why she didnt upload the photo she was like ""you want me to upload it?"" i said yes if she was ok with it 
a few days pass and ask her out again and the excuses came back ,for my birthday she said she was gonna come over but she never showed up and I had suspicions she was with that guy and stopped talking to her until her birthday was coming up.

2017: January
i was just starting on this new office job and got a reminder that her birthday was coming up and she invited me , deep down i knew this guy was gonna be there and stayed at the bus stop deciding if i was gonna go or not and went there only to see these 2 did have been hanging out and i just wanted to leave as soon as i saw him but had to stay then I invented some excuse that i had to take my little brother to a football game or something. When I got home i started crying and punched the wall until my knuckles started to bleed , made a mess of my bed and laid down in the floor and cried until I fall asleep

next day my mom found me on the ground asking what happened and told her everything she said i shouldnt worry about her since she knew she was up to no good ,that was the day I decided to stop texting her or asking her out it was. waste of time.

mid 2017:

At work i met this girl 5 years older than me (i was 22 she was 27) and started hanging out and had lots of fun after work and she always wanted me to to bus stop with her because she was scared , the very first time we did this she hugged me so hard and all i did was wait for the bus with her but nontheless it felt good

*Season 2*
late 2017:
My work schedule changed so i had to cancel our date, when I got on the bus it was rush hour and in the middle of I see *HER* but i didnt want to make eye contact with her just listen to music but she had no better idea that elbow me in the ribs (in a friendly way...i hope) and started talking I asked where she was getting off she said ""near the ice cream shop"" i lied and said ""oh yeah i get off there too"" my brain was like (YOU IDIOT) and she said ""ooh now I have some company"".

after we bought ice cream she said ""we should hang out again"" and i replied ""yeah totally!"" i felt like an idiot for saying that

when I asked her out we went to the playground since there were no kids (it was a cloudy day) she told me this guy cheated on her (yeah u know who).

it was getting late and wanted to tell her what i felt for her but couldnt , i had to text her and she friendzoned me... i literally felt like a was falling into a bottomless pit , i locked myself in my room and didnt even eat that rainy night , it took some weeks and hard mental work but i got over it.

during my mopey days the girl from work was gonna hang out with some of her friends at a bar and asked me if i wanted to go to I said yes , she had 2 female friends and one nerdy guy (too much into Lol it seemed) when we were waiting for order she sat pretty close to me i didnt bother at all it was a good night for once

April 2018: 
my schedule changed again and couldnt see her for a few weeks , one night she asks me by texting if i wanted to spend the night at her house because she was scared someone might be following her , i said yes and meet up , I even bought some condoms , we go to the bar nearby had some drinks and took a cab to her house
later I was getting ready because...i thought i was gonna lose my virginity...turns out she was tired and wanted to sleep , i tried to excite her but nothing ans couldnt sleep 

morning after she makes breakfast watch some weird comedy show about potheads and while waiting for the bus on the rain I told her ""look i really thought we were gonna...you know..."" she was speechless she said ""no...thats now i wanted..."" the bus arrived and got on... the most depressing trip back home of my life..

 ita january 2019 and i havent talked to her since that horrible day , i heard she quit the job idk what she is doing now and all i think about is the  horrible impression of me saying that.

May 2019 : we got a new girl at the office , she is my boss' niece , short 21 years old and kind of quiet (kinda like me) i got this weird feeling someone was looking at me nd caugh her on sight didnt say anything just waved at her like normal. During slow days when nothing happens she always sits right next to me , we talk and all and my co-workers say dumb stuff like ""there is something up between these 2"" i laughed on the outside but on the inside i got upset.

I told my mom about this girl , she told to me give her a chance  I said "" the last time i did I ended up badly"", ""i dont wanna go through it again "" 

I got jealous because all my friends had gf's but i was the only one without one and the only one virgin.

Being a 23 year old virgin with no gf in the country I live is the worst everyone thinks you are a psycho or gay im not into guys (i dont have anything against gay people)  it just gets annoying , so I decided to pay an escort to ""show me"" how-to-u-know I didnt know this was gonna turn into an addiction now every friday after work i meet up with a different escort because its the easiest way for me to have sex , i no longer wish for a gf or to get married and have kids i just wanna live my life my way.

Now with covid-19 i got to stay home and my mom always tell me ""you have to get a gf someday then a few years get married and some kids "" I'd rather die to be honest , all these years seemed to have embittered me into what I am now...

1088,hamartiated,1589942993,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-05-20 12:49:53

Normally I'm used to this crippling loneliness that affects me every night and day, but tonight I feel like crying and there ain't a soul in the world I can tell besides a bunch of strangers on the internet. Hope you like stories, because I feel like a little is important here... 




When I was in high school, my friend texted me : ""Hey, can you install an app and talk to this girl for me? I'm shy."" It was out of character for a guy like him to be shy, but I did because we were good friends. In doing so, I may have accidentally opened the biggest can of worms in my life.. Her name was Abbie, and even though she lived three states away from me, she was one of the most important people in my life. Never have I ever felt such a stronger connection with someone. Over the course of five years of talking to her as friends (and then eventually staying up till 2 AM with her in video calls every night), I felt an overwhelming passion for a girl I hadn't even met yet.




I know, I know : ""cAtFiSH!!onE1!!!"" It didn't matter - she never wanted to meet. We were kids, it made sense... But it still hurt that she never even made the effort. 





I'm getting off-topic though.. She was all I'd ever think about for well over four years after our ""relationship"" fell though. Whatever you wanna call it... 




Every so often I'll get to thinking about her and how she's doing, but I know I can't text her ever again. Every time I do, it always ends up about how great her life is with her new boyfriend. I'd like to say I'm happy for her, but I don't even know if I can be anymore 





I used to dedicate all these songs to her, and naturally that means Youtube knows when I'm feeling sad and throws a few in while I'm listening to an auto-generated playlist tonight. Some of them I never even showed her, but I can almost hear her voice in the lead female's lyrics... It's torture





Matter of fact, almost every day up until then has been torture. Waiting for night to hit, almost expecting dreams of her so vivid I can almost reach out and put my hand on her face... Waking up every morning to see a face that I hate, knowing how things ended between her and I and how it'd be a cold day in hell before I found someone else... It's eating me alive




And please don't hit me with that ""THeRE'S SOmEOnE for eVERYonE"" nonsense. There isn't...",lonely,Hindsight is always 20/20,2020-05-20 12:18:33

1102,Wybierz_nazwe_uzytko,1589932064,1,"It's been on my mind for a while now; to me all relations are bound to end at some point, usually when they stop being convenient, because I stop sharing an activity with someone (like after moving to a different school). The idea of having a deep friendship with someone just appears impossible to me, because I can't possibly accept that it can last and won't try to make it survive (or will distance myself) so it ends eventually.

This extends to love too, I can't imagine ever accepting a proposal, because it's not like I can spend life with someone, we will just fall apart after some time.

I also feel like having someone who would try to keep a friendship with me would be something I am not worthy of. If I can't possibly care about them and will distance myself eventually, how can I deserve someone trying to keep me around? In fact I would abandon the person that would try to become close friends with me just to avoid hurting them later.

I don't want to hurt somebody, so I won't even try to make friends. I just know a brief contact is all I am capable of.

I have basically three theories where it can come from: 

1. Something you might relate to; years of loneliness. Maybe I am just very defensive and broken by not having anyone for years. I can't call anyone a real friend ever since primary school and that was like 10 years ago. Do you think it can be the cause?

2. Maybe it actually is a thing, maybe some people can't feel attachment to someone. Like there are asexual and aromantic people, so maybe? Has anyone heard of that, inability to form any bonds?

3. Well... It's not exactly hard to notice I am transgender, a pre transition one. So either it's some cliche bs of ""they can't be friends with me if I am not myself"" or definitely more likely scenario: a result of gender dysphoria (if you don't know, not living according to your gender causes a huge variety of negative effects and it's really not unlikely it can be one of them).

1109,zalmalt,1589927352,1,"I’m pretty sure that if you met me you would think I’m pretty quite and unemotional, well I used to be able to express my emotions much easier until my dad remarried when I was ten and I quickly learned that expressing your emotions was very strongly looked down upon by my stepmom and 13 year old stepbrother. It felt like every time they could hear some strong emotion in my voice they made fun of me so I lost the ability to express emotions completely with the exception of crying although that was looked down upon the most and I always without fail got made fun of if they so much as caught me quietly whimpering so it is very difficult for me to do so now especially around other people. Another reason I’m bad at expressing myself through speech is because I’ve been so alone for so long and I haven’t had anyone who I’m comfortable being open with for a very long time. I repress all my emotions but I don’t feel any internalized emotions inside of myself except sadness. My theory for that is that my brain somehow knows that I can only outwardly express sadness so all my repressed emotions inside of me get turned into sadness. Everything that I’ve talked about in regards to not being able to express myself completely disappears when I’m writing and I think that’s due to at least two things. First, I have a wide vocabulary so it’s easy to choose the words that best fit my meaning and 2nd, inflection on paper is implied so instead of actually having to physically vibrate my vocal chords and move my mouth to communicate emotion i just have to pick the right words.",lonely,I am unable to properly express my emotions due to a poor upbringing,2020-05-20 08:29:12

Because it was an online class, I had to watch these short interview segments with different students. The way they would talk would say things like, “everyone has someone”, or “relationships are just things everyone go through”. All it did was make me feel like shit for not being in a relationship and there was nothing to affirm that it was okay for me to not be in a relationship. Even the text that wasn’t a student but instead the class itself would say things like, “everyone has friends to go and talk to”.

I thought college would let me go away from all those troubles from high school but it’s no different.

1127,RoosterBoy69,1589916309,1,"So I've been feeling this way for quite a while now. Probably the last 2.5 years since I moved out of home for college. Which I dropped out of a few months ago🙈 

So, hi guys my name's Conor and I'm from Limerick in Ireland. I'm 22 and I have absolutely no friends whatsoever. I was studying economics and politics in college, however I dropped out. This was due to having to repeat a module and having just got fed up of college. I have no family, no friends. I have housemates who are lovely but due to the Covid-19 pandemic only two of them have stayed down here in Limerick and they keep to themselves mainly. I work in a Dominos so we're under strict social distancing rules. I'm also a keen cyclist with dreams of a professional career some day(however distant that may be). So with all that in mind, I'll start from the beginning when my life began to change.

I lived with my dad and step mother until I was 15. My step mother left and my dad who had been fairly abusive up to this point, both physically and mentally, assaulted me to the point I was hospitalized for a week. I had never had any friends, was quite intelligent but had very poor social skills. I was then put into foster care a few months later. I lived with a foster family for a year and a half, during which time I met maternal relatives who I had never met. At this time, I was borderline close to being expelled from school due to discipline issues in school. I did quite badly in my junior cert(average but considering the lack of focus and study I should have been an A student. My Sigma T exam results in primary school were among the top 8% in Ireland.) So eventually I had to knuckle down and prove to everyone I could pass my leaving Cert and get into college. Which I did. A lot of that, was down to cycling which I got into after my junior Cert. It helped my calm down and focus on study and only study. And this is where my problems really began. I never experienced going out or having fun. I either trained, studied or worked. I never had friends so I've never developed that ability to connect with people or be confident in social settings and be able to let go and have fun. All throughout college I focused on training and drinking and going out got in the way of that so I lost scores of potential friendships that way. I remember I lived with a group of people who I met through a mutual friend. I scrolled back through their Instagrams and bam. I was nowhere to be found. Mainly because I was concerned with sleeping or training. So in short...

I'm on my own, I've no friends, tinder has been an absolute miserable failure, all I can get are crappy one night stands. I hate it so much. I'm stuck in my job trying to pay off debts trying to chase my dreams. I don't know what I want to do with my life, no idea of my sense of self, buckets of self loathing, and absolutely no idea what to do. I'm not giving up training, not one bit. I just want to know how to become more confident and gain the ability to have something to say and be interesting to hang out with and actually stop feeling so fucking miserable every day. I've got caught up in crashes in races at 60 km/hr and I swear they feel less painful than typing this 😢",lonely,So kinda fed up of my life right now...,2020-05-20 05:25:09

1129,Swordspirit2,1589914086,1,"But right now I'm working on a book, which basically talks about ""evolution"" and handling life in general... I'll get some of that motivation and use it here.

I see many people here feeling lost... Without knowing what exactly to do to stop suffering. While I can't give you an exact answer, I can help you find it, especially because only you can find your own specific answer.

I know it's not easy to handle existence. It's hard as hell. It's even harder if you want something more out of it... If you want something out of the ordinary and feel there's something wrong with this beaten routine we see out there everyday. I'm betting many of you are not zombies like most and still haven't sold your souls to the system.

Anyway, the first thing I have to share with you is the painful truth 99.99% of people are just as fucked or even worse than you are right now. The only difference between you and most out there smiling and interacting and that you don't have any attachments to make you feel safe. You're fucked, but you know it. Most out there are just the same, but they don't know it because they have emotional outlets. And I'm saying this to try to show you others can't help you. Only you can truly help yourself. Knowing you're fucked and not having temporary illusions to make you feel safe can be used in your favor. Other people are only waiting to see the storm. They'll have to go through it too sooner or later when they lose their safety. Trust me on that.

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing I have to share with you is that your physiology affects everything. Happiness depends on both physical and mental health. You can't be happy if you're unhealthy. And health depends on doing the basics, like eating well, physical activity, and so on. Yes, I know it is not easy to try to do stuff when your mind is chemically ruined. I know it's one of the shittiest pieces of advice. But please bear with me. There are easier ways to improve your situation. Even eating more vegetables and fruits or starting very simple activity like jumping jacks or jumping rope will create a bit of momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been very close to suicide. I know what it's like. And I can tell you, you don't need to try and be ""better"" for ""traditional"" ""good"" reasons. In my case, only tons of hatred ever fueled my evolution. And when I started turning my sadness into hatred because I finally saw noone could help me and the few that could just WOULDN'T, then everything started changing. It was hatred that fueled my learning to cook, and cooking well even started bringing more money and people towards me. The same hatred got me into lifting weights and physical strength does wonders for self-esteem and calming the mind. The same hatred got me into herbalism and making my own natural medicine for when stuff goes bad. Having healthy doses of dopamine regulating tinctures lets me handle problems better.

Because that's what it is, even if you get stronger, life will still be hard. It just won't be so excruciatingly hard and painful, but being stronger lets you handle stuff way better. Don't get me wrong, I don't feel less lonely. I don't even know if I'll ever feel any different, but I know something most don't, and that is you can transmute the curse into fuel. Some people are their best version when they're happy. I'm my best version when I'm full of hatred, sadness, and insanity... since that is now fuel, now I'm able to spend it and not accumulate it.

That's my two cents... I hope it helps.",lonely,I've been thinking about writing this for way too long now.,2020-05-20 04:48:06

So let's start from the beginning - My parents are unfair and aggressive, people at school make fun of me, Teachers don't like me either. I'm so lonely I started Imagining myself being loved... Since I was 8 (That's a problem, isn't it?). 

When I'm sad I often hug my pillow really hard and pretend it's a real person hugging me back. I'm an introvert with huge social anxiety. I wouldn't call myself depressed. I would use term low self esteem. You know how I'm trying build it up? I laugh at my own jokes that I make in my head and I feel pathetic about it.

I'd love to have someone that will always be there for me, care about me, and just love me as a human being. But most importantly I would love to have someone that I can love back. Someone who won't walk away from me. Someone who won't hate me.

Let's be real here - That's not something I'll experience soon (or ever). My expectations are way too high. Basic relationship is out of my budget.

I've been feeling really down lately, normally I don't let that feeling reaches me but right now I feel totaly vulnerable to it, I feel as all my efforts for improving are just useless.  


It started to feel this way when I started college, didn't matter with whom I was talking to, how many persons were around me, or even if I was with classmates/friends, I felt so empty, so lonely, like no one could understand how I felt.   


There have been times when I make a genuine connection with another person but it starts to fade away slowly and ends with no talking, no communication at all. ([another song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiRiBDn1DNo))  


I'm really tired of that, I never had someone I could call my best friend, I never had female friends until college(mostly bc I was introvert and shy), I never had someone to talk about my problems without feeling I'm a bother, I just want to feel that warmt feeling of acceptance, someone that really needs me, that hears me, I long for someone to express how I feel without feeling I'm talking to someone with automatic responses.  


I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know how to cope with this feeling, I feel like I'm breaking apart slowly, I just want to be loved as a friend, someone reliable and called a true friend.

1150,YeetDatNeet,1589883971,1,"Let me be clear, I would say being alone is being on your own physically whereas being lonely is the feeling of not having anyone or not being understood by anyone so you feel isolated even when surrounded by people. 

Everyday I feel like I have no privacy or space of my own because I'm stuck at home with my family. I want to be alone but not lonely. 

During the day time I manage to survive knowing that I can talk to a friend if I'm struggling with anything, but, at night time, it gets so much worse when everyone's asleep and I know I'm on my own. Night time is when I have to actually face my own problems by myself. If nobody can help me, I wish I could atleast be alone so that I could actually be myself and not cover my emotional struggles for my family.

I don't want to be around my family because they can never actually help me with whatever I'm struggling with, they just give ""advice"" which they think will make me feel better but does the opposite.

TLDR; My family can't help me so I wish they wouldn't be around just to see me suffer.",lonely,Tired of feeling lonely,2020-05-19 20:26:11

1170,DashingNative,1589861814,1,"First time posting here, I mainly lurked this sub because of the relatable posts but I feel like I should say my own piece. So, sorry if I somehow go off-topic. I'll just let myself flow while I write this. I do have family, but it feels as though it's an obligation to be close to them. I feel more like a failure if I can't make friends with who I don't have any relation. Because it feels more special to be close to someone like family, but isn't. If that makes sense.

At this point, I've given up on anything romantic. I'll just let it become nothing more than lust and desire which I can easily fulfill with the obvious sources. It'd be nice to grow old with someone, making a family, and sharing life experiences with them. But if I find it hard to make friends, I might as well ditch anything romantic. Hell, if by an extremely off chance someone finds me attractive or falls for me, I'll outright reject them because I want to leave it behind. Besides, realistically it'll be nothing more than a fling and that'll be my only experience in anything ""romantic"". And that would be sadder than having no experience at all. Pathetic really.

As I become older, my family is as well. And once they are gone, I'll have nothing. I wouldn't find myself going to such a dark point where I'll off myself. It seems pointless and if my life allows me to become older, I'd rather ride out life until I can embrace whatever is at the end. That is where I pose the question.

Has anyone tried to embrace the loneliness? It seems like it'll be the only thing that is willing to be with us if you think about it. Sure, you may have grown accustomed to the solitude of not worrying about others or having such blissful days of no one bugging you. I feel like we at some point have enjoyed being with ourselves than with others. But the thing is, we are social creatures. We'll have to feed that need talking with someone. I just wish we didn't need it. And we'd genuinely be happy and content on our own.

I don't know. I just wish we'd outgrow the need of wanting to talk to someone, being connected, and suffering from something that is truly beautiful. And that's being together. How could something so wonderful be so harmful as well? I wish we can direct it towards loneliness. Embracing what's willing to embrace us. But it's hard, and it doesn't feel the same.

1177,hamartiated,1589855712,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-05-19 12:35:12

it’s not their fault. they didn’t do anything wrong. it just sort of reminds you like, *oh yeah, i forgot. you have a completely functional life without me, haha. i’m completely alone every morning and night, but you still have plenty of people on your end who give and receive your love and attention. whoops, my bad.*

This is the second time one of my best friends has started messing around and dating one of the guys I messed around with. I am very honest about how promiscuous I am and in the past I have been. But me and this guy were close for a really long time but he started being weird when we started doing stuff (as in like expecting stuff from me) so I cut it off and we proceeded to just remain friends, in the same friend group. My best friend and I hung out with him a lot and we all joked about it and she and I always kind of third wheeled him when we hung out, and many best friends do when with other people. Since quarantine started she has been hanging out with him 10x more than me because she just broke up with her bf. and ofc they have been getting so close they pretty much are dating. So once again I find myself watching it happening from the outside and I really don’t know why I’m so hurt by it. Probably just because I always am the backup so when she comes around to the guy they hop on her without a second thought. I want to be happy with her because I have absolutely no feelings for him anymore, but I can’t help but feeling hurt. Sorry this was a quickly typed and probably unclear story 😂.

I even got hit on by a guy for the first time ever. But then corona happened and I had to move back home. I realized my “friends” from college were not really my friends, and this guy and I don’t talk anymore because I overthought our relationship too much. Now I am truly alone. I feel so hopeless.

Honestly I just wish that I knew a cool, quiet girl somewhat like myself. I'm 24 and I've never kissed a girl before, I definitely had some chances but I've always been too insecure about how I look. I'm honestly paranoid people will judge me if they see a girl I'm with and they don't think she's pretty. I'm not attracted to people in ""my league"" and can't meet anyone other than on tinder, which let's be real... is a fucking joke. What I really hate is that I can't really have fun around girls like I can with guys. Like being even remotely attracted to someone just makes everything forced... And awkward.. and honestly unfun for everyone involved. 

People always tell me I act super different around girls and I need to be myself, but I physically can't.. My face tightens up and I get easily embarrassed, I can hardly smile and if I do I look uncomfortable. My friends' girlfriends even ask me why I don't have a girlfriend. Honestly I just don't know how to fix myself. Other than when I'm around close friends, I absolutely hate social situations. I actually get really drained, then eventually end up feeling sad if I go to concerts and activities with lots of people. I just want to be alone with a nice cute girl who gets my humor and likes being around me. Someone I can make laugh and enjoy spending time with. 

It really sucks because the older I get, the more I come to hate the world I live in. There's definitely a lot of good in it, but God damn I hate how fake people are to each other.. I hate how addicted everyone is to social media, all the bullshit pretending about how happy they are when in reality they're just dopamine junkies fishing for likes. I hate how stupid people can be, blindly following a cause or a charismatic leader without thinking for themselves. I can't even imagine how bitter I'm going to be if and when I make it to 50 years old. At this point I want to just ghost everything in my life and go live in Alaska to get away from all this bullshit people call life. Real relationships seem so fake and selfish to me nowadays and with droves of people always looking for a new ""upgrade"". You can be cringy as hell but girls will still flock to you if you look good enough, and I'm honestly so jealous of those people. Idk maybe I need to get a therapist I can't afford to work through things with. I need to get a fucking dog.

1205,CosmicxWanderer,1589834187,1,"I don’t even know what I’m doing here honestly; I’ve been experiencing loneliness for quite a few years now. This pandemic has ruined the chances of ever meeting someone organically. 

I often spend my days reading, writing in my journal or meditating and focusing on my breath. I’m unemployed thanks to COVID and I can feel myself becoming socially inept.

I just want someone I can be there for. I want someone to be there for me. I want friendship, I want companionship — I just want someone to connect with. I try not to waste time on video games as much anyone because I’ve been doing that for the last 10 years. 

I’ve spent the duration of unemployment and quarantine cultivating new hobbies and interests. I took up Acrylic painting (I have more canvases on the way) as a way to relax and get in touch with my creative side. I’ve been experiencing brain fog and writers block so I’ve taken time to really read books in hopes of honing my vocabulary.

I don’t waste time on streaming services and Reddit is my only form of social media. I was watching a documentary on YouTube about how women are leaning more towards becoming content creators for OnlyFans and consumers are buying into these products. The documentary goes into detail about how sites like OnlyFans and people who pay money to men/women for pics and streams are essentially cultivating a society that thrives off loneliness.

I miss social interactions. I wasn’t always confident with women or people for that matter. But as time goes on I find myself seeking something deeper — someone to connect with mentally and emotionally. Someone who enjoys talking, venting, listening to music - just as much as I do.

1223,spiceism,1589813634,1,"(I am so sorry, this seems a bit long) 

This is my first reddit post, and I’m worried that once I start writing it out, my problem is going to seem too trivial to be here. 

I have always been very intense when it comes to getting attached to people I haven’t known very long, especially when they show the tiniest spout of interest or commitment. Most recently, for about a month or two, I have been speaking to this guy (I am gay) who would love talking to me every day - we’d voice chat a lot in the evenings etc. 

It got to a stage in Covid lockdown where we really wanted to meet but obviously couldn’t, and we would even end up saying ‘I love you’/‘you’re definitely the first person I’m going to meet’ etc. We’d think about things we were gonna do, how it would feel, how we’d spend our free time and the general good life once the pandemic had settled. This was not of course without mentioning how we were still speaking to other people. But no matter any of it, and unhealthy as it might’ve been, it began to feel like we were together... 

We both knew this was all very soon, especially him having been in a relationship 6 months prior - it was a rush. 

Now things have toned down, and he has pulled it back so much we are virtually not talking (though he knows exactly how I feel). 

It almost sounds like a joke when I write it out, yet I’m sat here feeling incredibly anxious and unhappy, thinking about how nothing I’m doing or am going to do in lockdown is going to make me happy because I don’t even know if we’re ever going to meet, or when we will speak for the final time.

We both acknowledged that things have changed now, but I feel like it hurts me and not him. He doesn’t show the distress, even when we’d talk in detail about it. Speaking to him about it doesn’t seem to make it better - just ends up with apologies and a dead end. 

I know this issue is probably rooted deeper in me than just ‘I’m going to miss this guy that I haven’t even met’, but once someone says they love you, it’s hard to shake off. Especially when in the gay community it can be hard to find someone who appears that they want something like this as much as you do WHILST being your perfect type (he’s bi/not stereotypically camp etc - just your average man kinda thing). I don’t say I have a type (it’s nice to keep open), but if there’s an ‘optimum’ - this was it. 

And I think back to the string of guys I have been involved in similar situations with (apart from ‘I love you - that hasn’t happened in a long time) and I’m always in the same position. Hurting and feeling like I’ve lost my end game. 

I haven’t fully lost my virginity - just done odd bits and bobs. I know society makes it out to be so much more, but sometimes you can’t help but feel left behind. I know I’m 18 and this shouldn’t even be a worry of mine nor anyone’s... still bothers me. 

So why does this drain me. All well enough to say lockdown doesn’t help, but this happened even when the world was ‘normal’. I would get up feeling useless and drained, fall behind on uni work, not want to talk to friends or family and essentially reject the idea of normality, as if I need to be loved by a particular person in order to function. This annoys me as I feel selfish, being that my life outside of love/dating is comfortable and relaxed. 

I want to be happy in my own skin, but I forever seek the validation of someone I find attractive and loving. (Even when he’d tell me that I wasn’t ugly, I still feel ugly). I have a lot of insecurities about my body/the way I look which doesn’t help. 

I wish I didn’t latch onto people like I do, but I guess I just feel empty from not having had a real or lasting relationship in my life - where there are relationships everywhere you look. Everyone seems to have had a ‘girlfriend’ or ‘boyfriend’ and I am in waiting. 

Friends or not. I feel lonely. It’s almost 4pm now and I have no energy to lift myself from my bed or face my family. I’d rather disappear. 

Though I’m glad to at least have got this off of my chest and down somewhere, and I’m sorry if it seems long for something trivial. It’s all so exhausting and I want to feel free, without dependence or validation regarding another human.

1231,nunuhoho,1589806800,1,"I’m making good progress in my career and financially stable

I’ve a happy home and family

But I still feel so damn lonely. 

I used to think that my stress and feelings of despair used to come from growing to hate my (old) job, going through a late parent divorce (they were in their 60s and I handled every single thing from start to end; multiple meetings to the divorce centre, lawyer, court and the likes spanning over one year), and subsequently went thru another year-Long journey of home ownership because of the divorce (again, all responsibility is on me alone as I’m the only child and is well versed in English. My mum doesn’t speak the language). 

But all these are completed and over, and I’ve safely moved in and decorated the place. Finally home truly feels like home. 

Despite all these, I still feel terribly lonely. I’ve friends and ghosted them too because I wanted them to reach out when I was struggling with the house issue but all of them decided that their lives (they have a family with plenty of kids) are more important and connections are sporadic and superficial at best. 

I’ve recently lost an online friend. We talked almost Everyday for 3 years but she broke it off. It’s a pretty weird dynamics where she is Super clingy and I enjoyed it but it got too much so I kept ghosting her and apologised. This continued for a couple of times until she’s had enough of my shit and called it quits. I didn’t know it’d hit me pretty bad. It still lingers. A part of me feels relieved (she was very controlling of my activities on twt and who I talk to) but I miss it. She’s probably the only one who really cared. At least. I’m half sorry that it happened but she drove me crazy especially her high expectations of my communication style. I often wonder why can’t she accept me for who I am, accept that I’ll appear and disappear and that doesn’t mean I like her less.

Been single for 10 years too but I keep pushing people away (emotional baggage; got cheated on in my first rship) because I couldn’t get over feeling lazy in getting to know people. It feels like a chore but honestly, I am a very affectionate person inside and recently I found myself yearning for a partner, the connection, someone to love and to be loved. Someone who is my best friend and a lover at the same time. There’s an empty space in my heart and I just Long for the feeling again. 

Throughout my parents divorce process, many of my aunts and uncles told me to “take care of my mum” and I sure am doing it the best that I can (it’s only the two of us and I’m the sole breadwinner so u get my drift) but one day I had the thought that choked me up inside; “people asked me to take care of my mum but who will take care of me?” I’m human and I need that too, someone I can run to during happy and difficult times. Someone who can just listen to me whine and then hug me as we lie in each other’s arms. 

So now I’m just on reddit hoping for some kind of connection. 

Or a listening ear. 

Or someone who can tell me what to do. 

Idk. I’m just feeling terribly lonely despite, in my own standards, having my life on track.

1232,Roxas358xion,1589805586,1,"So this is going to be a long post (sorry about any grammar mistakes) just a way for me to kind of get some worries and problems of my chest, you don't have to read it if you don't want too.

So to start of with I am a bi 26 male and I've never been with a women just one guy, I'm not particularly ugly, but definitely nothing that would turn heads, I'm pretty slender and only weigh 140ish. 
There are a few reasons why I don't have anyone to hold, I'm to nervous to try to flirt with anyone, I don't even know what to say to someone I might have a crush on. It's funny if I don't have any attraction for someone I can talk to them just fine, at least as good as someone that was homeschooled their whole life and now has limited social skills because of that. I moved to a new state when I was 15 and had to leave some neighborhood friends behind, up to that point they we're how I learned most of my social skills, but after them it took me years to even make one friend. Because of that I would just stay locked in my room playing games and watching tv. The first chance I had at getting a girlfriend was when my family and I moved to our new state, we ended up staying with a lady from my parents church until we could find a place to move into, the church lady had a neighbor who's daughter she would baby sit from time to time, and we would watch tv together (of course both of our younger siblings where always in the room). I think she was probably only one of the two people I've ever met that found me attractive, I knew she liked me because her little brother told me she said that to the church lady. Which I liked her back as well but never did anything, there was more than enough time alone to where I could've told her how I felt, but I was scared to ask her out even though I knew she would've said yes. Probably about a two years later, I told her how I had felt and still felt, but by that point she had lost interest because I waited so long.
I tried for the next few years to find someone when I was twenty I went over to a girls house but ended up chickening out because I was nervous , and when I was 21 I got a job at a fast food restaurant, and the second and last person to find me attractive, started about a month after I did. At this point I hadn't come out as bi, but we ended up going to the movies and out to eat and I came out to him and we ended up dating. I guess my confidence went up slightly, but we we're only together for four months and I ended up breaking up with for various reasons. After that probably about half a year later, at the same job a new girl started and after a few weeks I opened up to her and started flirting, she wasn't into me at first but eventually we went on a date, which really it wasn't we just hungout and watched Netflix. after we were done I asked her if I could kiss her ( my roommate had told me girls like being asked) she said didn't know, stupidly I leaned in and she turned away, I was super embarrassed and ashamed, but we ended up going out two more times. On our third date we went to an arcade, we bowled and played mini golf, everything was going good, after a few hours I drove her back home, and said goodnight she was lingering for a bit I kept thinking I should kiss her (I'm pretty sure that what she was expecting) but I never did and after that, I never brought up going out somewhere again, I think I was just to scared to go any farther in a relationship,
And she was the last person I ever went out with.
Probably about a year later I got a crush one another girl, and we would talk and laugh and I thought she liked me, but than she slept with my roommate. My roommate knew that I had a thing for her, and that really hurt me because I had thought we were becoming good friends. After a while they broke up and and I tried again with her, and she kept playing with me, like she would make it seem like she was interested in me and flirt, but every time I would ask to do something she'd either come up with an excuse or stand me up. She's the main reason I lost all of my confidence, I can deal with rejection just fine, but keeping on the hook like that  instead of just saying she wasn't interested really hurt my self-esteem and took away my motivation for finding someone new. 
Now I'm 26 and have absolutely no confidence or any social skills and just come across as very weird and stupid. I at least have one friend, but he's another reason I tried to look other than having no confidence, he suffers from depression and anxiety, and in the past had attempted suicide, so I spend most of my free time with, trying to make sure he's happy and safe, I love him like a brother and don't want anything bad to happen to him. He has a very strong personality and will insult my looks and intelligence, I know he's just joking because that's how are friendship (we're constantly ripping on each other) but I feel like the jokes he's making are half serious, and I wasn't worried about his well-being I would probably stop hanging out with him as much and maybe try to find someone, but honestly it really seems pointless to try now that my confidence is a zero. 
I'm just tired of all this bullshit and want to be happy and have someone, but I think I just gotta except that I will always be alone.

1253,Key-Trade,1589781774,1,"I've got to be the biggest dating failure I've ever known. I don't blame women for this either, I don't blame anyone else. I know it's all my fault and the result of my own shortcomings. I just wish I understood what it is I have to do though, and what success and not feeling chronically embarrassed even feels like, because the most I've managed is being able to be with someone (who I did like a lot!) for a few weeks before she (kindly) left me for someone else. I've tried cold approaches, I've tried going to multiple dating/speed dating events, I've tried going out by myself or with what few friends I've been able to get, I've tried getting numbers and calling them, I work out, I shower, I dress nice when I go out, I use cologne and gum, I try to put forth a cheery and optimistic demeanor, I do music and have my own projects, I have a career, I plan out dates with interesting things based on what they like, I've even (especially in recent lockdown times) tried online dating with professional photos and high-effort profiles and kind, detailed messages based on what's actually on their profiles and what reputable dating guides say I should do when messaging...but I just end up being ignored or ghosted or passed over or not called/messaged back, over and over and over and over again. I'm 27 and I've read lots of guides and I keep trying and failing and I just want to fucking die. I hate myself for not knowing how to just...Be human and properly socialize and connect with people, and the dating failures are the pinnacle of this. I've been having recurring vivid dreams lately of being with someone and having a special moment only to wake up, and today I got ghosted by someone right after she texted me basically saying she wanted me to come over. As years pass I feel more like I'll be a loveless, sexless loser with no lasting deep friendship forever.

Of course, now with quarantine I have even less avenues, but it hurts me still to be hitting it off with matches on Tinder and sometimes even get asked my number so they can text me, only for them to suddenly go silent when things seem to be going somewhere, even after I accepted an offer that sometimes *they* gave *me* to meet up. This has happened several times now, and I hate how weirdly addicted I am to the thought of, ""Maybe this time it's for real!"" only to be let down once more (and keep in mind I'm ok looking and in decent shape).

And please, I know it takes multiple tries to get this stuff. I don't expect to just win right out of the gate. But the problem is that I don't succeed at all, even after various serious efforts. It's not just multiple tries with me, it's countless times over several years with such tiny and fleeting (if any) progress. Real, functional human beings don't take over a quarter century to figure out this stuff. My life is passing me by and at times I'll be out and see people as young as teenagers walking around holding hands, or I'll hear about people signing up on Tinder and getting dates or even just casual encounters left and right, and I'm glad for them but it's just jsust;kasjd;falksdjhl bajsdohlgksaf;dhjbaoihulsdfhcjoklwds WHY AM I SO PATHETIC! I feel strongly like I would be able and willing to put in a lot of effort, care, and patience into a relationship because it'd be very important to me, but that doesn't really matter when I can almost never get started, let alone make it beyond the early dating stages.

I feel like I'm in a Catch-22 because the whole ""being yourself"" thing hasn't worked out for me (probably because I'm weird and apparently not socially calibrated), but trying to uphold an acceptable persona doesn't work either because it's unnatural and probably transparent, and I think I just come off as being boring and unexciting that way anyway. I don't know how much having Asperger's may have to do with this problem, but it seems I have no way of truly understanding what right things to say or do to land all the right steps in the process of getting somebody. I sure feel like an undesirable wretch when I'm not able to succeed as me \*or\* as someone else. And what makes it worse is the fact that people always say you can't find love if you don't love yourself, or that you'll be less attractive if you're down about failure in dating because people will be able to somehow smell the desperation or unhappiness on you and thus feel repelled by, but how am I supposed to stop feeling bad when I just keep failing over and over and over for years on end? I used to be happy and love myself, but that was before this kept happening and I started to realize what a failure I am. So now it's like I'm in a vicious cycle I can't break of feeling bad because I can't be with someone because I feel bad because I can't be with someone. It's like that thing of not being able to get a job because you don't have experience, only worse; and I feel this constant sense of panic and pressure like my time is running out and I really need to get this fixed but don't know what to do.

Maybe it's pointless to write all this, because I don't particularly expect anyone can help me, and maybe it doesn't make that much difference whether someone else here has similar problems -- in a way, I *don't* want other people to feel like this. Maybe I just wanted to vent, because I almost never talk to anyone about this, and certainly not to the extent I have here -- I'm *embarrassed* about it. Believe it or not, I actually posted my Tinder profile to feedback threads on the Tinder Reddit page for weeks every time such a thread showed up to see how people thought I could improve it, but even *those* posts just got ignored. Between the above and my ongoing general failures in finding and sustaining general friendship, I just feel like I may never get to know real mutual connection or understanding with anybody, and it makes me feel like a bad person and non-functioning, constantly behind human who should just be put down like a sick animal.

I'm 27 and I've read lots of guides and I keep trying and failing and I just want to fucking die. I hate myself for not knowing how to just...Be human and properly socialize and connect with people, and the dating failures are the pinnacle of this. I've been having recurring vivid dreams lately of being with someone and having a special moment only to wake up, and today I got ghosted by someone right after she texted me basically saying she wanted me to come over. As years pass I feel more like I'll be a loveless, sexless loser with no lasting deep friendship forever.

Of course, now with quarantine I have even less avenues, but it hurts me still to be hitting it off with matches on Tinder and sometimes even get asked my number so they can text me, only for them to suddenly go silent when things seem to be going somewhere, even after I accepted an offer that sometimes *they* gave *me* to meet up. This has happened several times now, and I hate how weirdly addicted I am to the thought of, ""Maybe this time it's for real!"" only to be let down once more (and keep in mind I'm ok looking and in decent shape).

And please, I know it takes multiple tries to get this stuff. I don't expect to just win right out of the gate. But the problem is that I don't succeed at all, even after various serious efforts. It's not just multiple tries with me, it's countless times over several years with such tiny and fleeting (if any) progress. Real, functional human beings don't take over a quarter century to figure out this stuff. My life is passing me by and at times I'll be out and see people as young as teenagers walking around holding hands, or I'll hear about people signing up on Tinder and getting dates or even just casual encounters left and right, and I'm glad for them but it's just jsust;kasjd;falksdjhl bajsdohlgksaf;dhjbaoihulsdfhcjoklwds WHY AM I SO PATHETIC! I feel strongly like I would be able and willing to put in a lot of effort, care, and patience into a relationship because it'd be very important to me, but that doesn't really matter when I can almost never get started, let alone make it beyond the early dating stages.

I feel like I'm in a Catch-22 because the whole ""being yourself"" thing hasn't worked out for me (probably because I'm weird and apparently not socially calibrated), but trying to uphold an acceptable persona doesn't work either because it's unnatural and probably transparent, and I think I just come off as being boring and unexciting that way anyway. I don't know how much having Asperger's may have to do with this problem, but it seems I have no way of truly understanding what right things to say or do to land all the right steps in the process of getting somebody. I sure feel like an undesirable wretch when I'm not able to succeed as me \*or\* as someone else. And what makes it worse is the fact that people always say you can't find love if you don't love yourself, or that you'll be less attractive if you're down about failure in dating because people will be able to somehow smell the desperation or unhappiness on you and thus feel repelled by, but how am I supposed to stop feeling bad when I just keep failing over and over and over for years on end? I used to be happy and love myself, but that was before this kept happening and I started to realize what a failure I am. So now it's like I'm in a vicious cycle I can't break of feeling bad because I can't be with someone because I feel bad because I can't be with someone. It's like that thing of not being able to get a job because you don't have experience, only worse; and I feel this constant sense of panic and pressure like my time is running out and I really need to get this fixed but don't know what to do.

Maybe it's pointless to write all this, because I don't particularly expect anyone can help me, and maybe it doesn't make that much difference whether someone else here has similar problems -- in a way, I *don't* want other people to feel like this. Maybe I just wanted to vent, because I almost never talk to anyone about this, and certainly not to the extent I have here -- I'm *embarrassed* about it. Believe it or not, I actually posted my Tinder profile to feedback threads on the Tinder Reddit page for weeks every time such a thread showed up to see how people thought I could improve it, but even *those* posts just got ignored. Between the above and my ongoing general failures in finding and sustaining general friendship, I just feel like I may never get to know real mutual connection or understanding with anybody, and it makes me feel like a bad person and non-functioning, constantly behind human who should just be put down like a sick animal.

1263,Anonymous9u6r3q,1589772514,1,"My boyfriend and I just broke up and it's really fucking with me. We weren't together very long (5 months) but we were very into each other at the beginning. Quarantine came and we realized during it we were different people, and we didn't make sense. So we mutually decided, this doesn't work, we have to break up, we are not happy around each other.

That was last week. I spent the week reading books, speaking virtually to friends, doing meditation, reading Reddit to help with breakup pain. I was feeling really confident and ok with the decision and what we had to do. It made sense.

He came over and we exchanged stuff, and then he stayed and talked. We had a really honest and good conversation. I wish he had communicated like that while we were together. It doesn't change that we are different people, but I finally felt like I was seeing the vulnerability that had gone missing for the past 6 weeks. It made me feel close to him. We left it on good terms, he left, and I completely broke down. 

He has always lived in this town, so he has friends he can distract himself with. He has a car and can drive anywhere. It's his town - so there is comfortability there. I moved here for a job 2 years ago and don't know anyone outside of work, and I can't see anyone from there anyways bc of quarantine, plus as management, I don't think I should really be socializing with them (and cannot create friendships). Prior to quarantine I worked such insane hours there wasn't a chance to meet new people. I have a weird schedule and weird days off, and it makes it difficult to socialize at normal times. Plus work is really exhausting so I usually spend my first day off sleeping just to recuperate. 

After my ex left I realized I am SO alone here. My parents are on the other side of the country, my friends are spread around but no one is here. I literally do not have a single person to call and speak to here. To even see in person when restrictions are lifted. I watched the sunset to remind myself to put things in perspective, and it was so beautiful. And there wasn't anyone I could text that to. My friends have kids and are busy - no one has time to respond or share in the moment.

One of the meditations I did earlier this week was like, talk to your significant other, spend time with the family in your house to reduce anxiety! And I thought - but I am literally and completely alone. Hug who? Talk to who? Play a card game with who?

I am just feeling super low. I couldn't stop crying after he left realizing he goes back to a full social life in his town, and I go back to... nothing. There is not a soul in this town I can hangout with or call. And the aching loneliness is incredibly soul crushing. It starts to feel like I'm watching life pass me by, and watching people go on walks with their significant other, or riding bikes with their kids... and I'm sitting here alone with not a person on the horizon.

No dis-respect to you or what's going on for you, it's just to different.

So now getting to the point. I currently live in the SF Bay Area. I'm from India, moved to the US for school (not in California), and then moved here for work. High School and college were terrible for me. I was the ignored one in high school. I was dating a girl who was in a different school for the last 2 years (continued into college but that's for later) and because of that I had someone who got me but I walked to lunch alone, did everything in school alone and just didn't really do anything with my friends. So when it came time for college I was super excited to get away and be able to start off fresh.

So I left my family and the girl I loved and adored and went to college literally on the other side of the world. I made some good friends and they were all other Indians so we had a big group of Indian friends. I had a best friend and everything was going great. Sophomore year all hell breaks loose and my ""best friend"" and I have a fight. Within hours all our friends have an exaggerated story that explains her side. No one bothered to check on me or ask me to explain. So within a couple of days I lost all my friends. Weeks after this my girlfriend broke up with me. So now I end my sophomore year, in the same boat as I ended high school.

I go to another state for my internship, but everyone else interning at that company are locals or have friends or family from the area so I'm once again stuck all alone after work and during the weekends. I got pulled into a couple things with the other interns but that's another 3 months of being by myself, watching reruns of Forensic Files and wishing I had someone to hug or watch a movie with or just get lunch with.

Junior year starts, I make myself even busier. Lots of work and jobs and classes so that I'm distracted and it helps. Except one quarter I just have the worst breakdown ever and cannot leave my bed for a full week. I survive on the little water and snacks that are accessible from my bed and manage to get a co-worker to call the mental health office for me and get me an appointment. Of course I was depressed and anxious and it was so bad I had to drop out of school for the quarter.

But I push through, find a club that I can relate to, make friends who are different from the friends I've had in the past but all goes well and we're great friends, try dating (At this point I'm still a virgin and haven't kissed anyone except the one ex). I'm constantly rejected by girls, ghosted to a point that my therapist asked me to stop dating because it was making my anxiety worse, and desperate for someone to cuddle me. I was still going for lunches and dinners alone because I was still not even close to an important part of the friend group from the club. Luckily I met a couple people at work who became good friends. One of them is now my best friend (let's call her B) and another one is a very good friend (A).

Internship once again, same story except a tad better. But not really. So I'll save us a paragraph.

Senior year. The job search starts before I start the year and I get lucky with the job search (no complaints and I am very grateful). But as the year continues I have issues with the friends from the club. They get closer and then distance themselves from me. I have my first relationship and lose my virginity, and the entire club pushes me away because they think I took advantage of the girl (even though she told them all that I didn't) and she was in the club before me so they obviously gave her the benefit of the doubt. This causes a lot of issues and we break up. Then my grandfather suddenly passed away. I wake up to a call from my mom and this is the second time this has happened in college. Lost my great-grandfather in Junior year and now this. I call A and B and ask them to split the day with them because I don't want to be alone. They're great about it and are there for me (thank you). I couldn't even go back to see him because by the time I would reach it would be too late and the ceremonies would've been completed.

I take the weekend to grieve but jump back into work and classes to distract myself. But as graduation comes closer I realize that I have literally no one to invite to graduation. My parents are coming from India but I have no friends to invite. A is also graduating but B has to work that day. So not only do I sit in graduation alone, I don't get to take pictures with friends.

I get over it, go home for a bit and then get to California to start work. Luckily A is also working in the SF bay area so I'm not all alone. However work is stressful and they have high expectations. I work hard and slowly start adapting. But I still make no friends. I end up going to movies alone (as always), getting dinner at home so I don't have to ask for a table for one, crying myself to sleep (a lot) and just wishing I wasn't alone. A has a job that she says exhausts her everyday so we should hang out over the weekends. Any suggestion to hang out during the week is dismissed as a ""no I can't do that after work."" However, following a pattern I have experienced from almost everyone, everytime someone else suggests something during the week, she jumps on it right away. Last weekend we were going to do something and then we couldn't so we decided to simply do it this weekend (yes we will follow social distancing and not come within 6 ft of each other). But when I checked in for this week, 2 other plans had ""come up"" and we'd have to push off for another week.

As for B. I love her. I love her very very much. But she's distant and isn't there for me. I try to text her saying ""hey it's been a rough day so I'd appreciate it if you could just text me a bit today just so I'm not all alone."" No reply for 5 days but the entire time she's posting on snapchat and instagram and twitter, wishing people for their birthday, etc. 5 days later I get a text ""I'm sorry I literally didn't touch my phone for 5 days hope you're feeling better."" I love her but as my best friend is it too much to ask for support when I'm feeling like shit? A couple weeks back we talked about something and she said ""ugh too much to text I should just call you to tell you this"" and I naturally said yes call me whenever. Literally any day anytime. Well, I still haven't gotten a call (and don't suggest calling her because she doesn't like getting calls).

So yeah here I am, stuck in an apartment all by myself, forced to live with my brother because he has no other place to live because his college closed the campus, hating it because he has no respect for my space, my things or the fact that he's a guest, unable to text any friends because well I have none, too scared to even try online dating because I'm not exactly the most attractive guy and don't like taking pictures and am awkward with first interactions, and just wishing I had someone who could be there for me and just tell me that I am atleast a half-decent guy.

Honestly all I want is a girl who loves me the way I love her. And I get that I'm going to meet people who aren't right for me and make friends who don't stick around and lose people who were important to me. But I am tired of having no one. I can't even talk to my therapist because my brother doesn't respect my privacy and I can't kick him out because he has literally no where else to go and I cannot put my parents through that in the middle of a pandemic where they are already struggling.

Throughout highschool and college, people became friends with me when it was beneficial to them. They'd be amazing ""friends"" when we were in a class together so that they had someone to help them out when they needed. But the second we no longer had a class together I never heard from them. They'd ignore me when we crossed each other on campus. Not even the obligatory chin jerk. And I get it. People make short term friends, but I also know when someone is ignoring me because they no longer have a use for me.

I spent 4 years in college without going to a party, without getting drunk, without being invited to a party, without having a fun story to tell, without playing party games, and without making any memories.

I've joined kik groups, tried to make friends on reddit, tried fetlife to see if that's a way I can find people who are similar, tried tinder and bumble and okcupid, coffee meets bagel, and feeld and everything. But there's obviously something about me that makes people wanna stay away. And I guess that's how it's going to be forever and I can accept it. But I just wish I had people somewhere in some part of my life who called me on my birthday to wish me. Who remembered my birthday (A hasn't ever wished me and B sent a text at 10:00pm last year). And this year I'm going to celebrate my birthday stuck inside my apartment, cleaning up after my brother who has not once cleaned any mess he has made despite living with me for over a month now (nearly 2).

I spend every free moment on reddit looking at r4r subs, on fetlife trying to find someone who kinda is what I'm looking for, swiping right on literally everyone on tinder and bumble, considering drugs, considering selling my body, downloading a new ""meet random strangers"" app everyday and just trying to find a way to not spend the entire day alone. I've even considered paying for company and hiring escorts which is just disappointing :(

Plus as if this wasn't difficult enough, I am questing my gender identity but also know that whatever happens I can never come out as anything to my family because they will never ever understand it. My brother came out as gay and that was crazy despite them knowing what being gay means. They aren't homophobic, they just think that ""they'd know"" if they ""son"" was \_\_\_. And obviously I can't talk to anyone about it so I'm stuck in a weird space not knowing who I am, not being able to talk about it, not being able to be part of a community that can help me, not able to find a friend who can be there as I try to make sense of this, or just having someone to text when something happens.

I'm so grateful that I am working and healthy and safe but I just wish I'd be able to hug someone and just cry in their arms.

I'm sorry this is long. If you're still reading this I'm sorry and thank you. I know this seems like a load of bullshit and me just ranting about unrelated silly things that I should get over, but I'm literally in tears right now and I've barely even started to scrape the surface. Maybe I'll post again here, maybe somewhere else, maybe I won't. But thank you for caring enough to read.

A couple of my good friends were in it, and then some others who I grew to become better friends with. We would watch movies, play video games, etc a lot, and it helped get through this tough time.

As things do, the group chat grew quieter as we got closer to finals (we’re college students), and now the group still chats, but we don’t do nearly as much as we used to. I still talk to my closer friends and hang out online w/ them, but I still feel really lonely.

Anyways, almost all my life, I've had this feeling inside of me. I just feel so empty and lonely. When I'm with my family, boyfriend, friends, or here in this group home. I feel like no one truly understands me; I feel like the odd one out. I've tried to fit in before, but it didn't end well.

This emptiness will never go away. All I've ever wanted in life was a friend, close to my age (under 19) who likes Rush. Yes, the band. Or at least other rock genres. It won't make the emptiness go away, but at least chatting with people numbs it. For me at least.

I walked into university a few months back and was actually really eager to make new friends and start on a clean slate. Halfway through it was a tough realisation that the university culture (where I study) for relationships is just social climbing in nature and very rarely genuine friendships. It's not like I was expecting people to be that open or embracing but most I've came across were downright standoffish, cold and completely closed-off. I'm not sure if this is more of a university thing or an ""age"" thing - but this is the first time I feel surrounded by so many fakes and it's honestly draining. The second they see you as ""not cool enough"" or ""not useful enough"" they withdraw coldly and ignore you. It's a really dejecting feeling to go through and I'm just tired of experiencing it. I didn't have a close group of friends prior to university and it was where I expected to finally find my people, but so far this is one of the loneliest times I've been through.

I try all the time to use dating apps, I think I've tried all of them at least once, but they've never amounted to anything more than 1 or 2 dates with like 2 people. I've never even been in a serious relationship in my life and the more I think about it I'm struggling to think of anybody I've ever had more than a passing crush on. I'm not asexual or aromantic or anything like that. I'm just realizing that my heart is pretty empty. I think this is extending to my friendships too, I've never been super extroverted so I never had a ton of friends and the ones I do have I've been falling out of contact with because at a certain point i dont really know how much i have in common with them. Whenever I do see my friends or talk to them I dont feel like I'm connecting very well with them or I always say the wrong thing.

1340,awaiting456,1589726455,1,"Some back-story about me, I know this doesn't really look like it belongs in r/lonely

A little over 6 months back I started going back to therapy. I had just had a nasty breakup several months prior to my first session and had spent the months after that breakup completely isolated (I moved into a new area right before the breakup).

About 3 weeks after that first session I was diagnosed with borderline anti-social personality disorder (sociopathy). My therapist told me that he doesn't really like to give out diagnoses to his patients, but as a more educated person I pushed to get one. Shortly after that I stopped going. Something about the idea that I was so messed up that I was incapable of feeling empathy or guilt made me want to forget about the whole situation.

He was right however, quickly it became clear to me that my ""friendly nature"" and ""incredible charm"" were byproducts of the condition. I thought back to my younger years and found that time and again I was able to get what I wanted by appealing other peoples emotions - and even worse that I was looking back at these memories fondly. I mean, I even managed to convince my therapist to give it to me straight, *and he knew at the time what I am.* I decided to keep the diagnosis to myself, but it's started to weight on my soul. I worry that if my loved ones find out who I am and what I am capable of they will cease to trust me - despite the fact that I still want to help my family and friends. 

\-----

I stumbled across this sub-reddit today and cried for the first time in a year while reading all of your posts. First off, thank you. You all are amazing people who are so full of emotion and passion. Despite what I am, it was the countless posts in this thread that lead me to feel something real again in over 12 months, and for the first time since my diagnosis I've started to wonder if that word ""borderline"" is actually something to focus on.

\-----

Just like most of you, I'm not sure I'll ever find someone to spend my life with. I'm not awkward or introverted like many of you, in fact I come off as quite the opposite. I struggle with understanding that sometimes what people need is a shoulder to cry on, not a solution to their problem. My situation may be the antithesis of many of yours, yet I do understand what many of you feel - a lack of real connections, a sense of guilt in past decisions and relationships, and maybe most potent of all a complete apathy for life.

I see a lot of replies to posts along the lines of ""just tell \[him/her\] how you feel"", and I think it's time for me to take that advice. My family and friends should know who I really am, and that despite the fact that I am not considered ""normal"" by society - that doesn't mean I can't still be a good person, or that I can't love and be loved. I guess I'm just like many of you after all, awaiting the right person to come along.

1341,hamartiated,1589726046,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

1343,canary_quinn,1589724388,1,"I've been in a LDR for 5 years now. He lives over 1,000 miles away from me.

It started off online on this silly multiplayer game. It was basically a pretend relationship at first, but we actually fell for each other later on. We began texting, sending each other pictures, and eventually talking and video chatting (the first time he called me was on a Christmas Eve years ago, and it was perfect).

He's everything to me, but this kind of relationship is riddled with challenges. For one, we have an age gap–he's 20 and I'm 17. We always knew that the gap would become an issue once he turned 18, but I guess we didn't want to acknowledge it. To be fair, it's not like we're being physically intimate or anything, but it still ended up being an issue when my mom found out. My dad... Well, I'll have to break all of this to him eventually.

To make a long story short, she was very upset and forbade me from speaking to him until I turn 18–which is all the way in December. For his sake and mine, we have to wait. We've never gone this long without communication, and it's definitely been hard on both of us.

I know I should live in the present, but I wake up and go to bed every day and night dreaming of finally meeting him in person. I write about him all the time. It's hard to see other couples together. I was already lonely even when we were talking because he still wasn't here beside me then, but now it's just depressing.

This guy is my first love and has been there for me for so long, even when I was at my worst. We've been a crutch for each other. We tell each other everything, things we've never told anyone else. Now I don't really have that, and life has been kind of crazy for me lately.

I do any and everything I can to feel closer to him. I look at Snap Map on Snapchat to see when he was last online and make sure he's okay, I look at his Instagram and Twitter posts, I even made a few tracings of photos of him.

1344,juan_onebutwithajota,1589724307,1,"Assuming you finish primary school on 6th grade, 7th grade is the 1st year of Junior High, thus you've already taken a massive leap in the educational scales. Also, most people will begin puberty around that year, and with that, they will start developing sexual attraction and life questions.

Up until 6th grade, usually, (yes, with MANY exceptions, but as a generalizatio), everyone has, more or less, the same life;

Wake up - school - hanging out with kids on lunch - going home - studying - playing with the neighbours - sleep - repeat.

Even Elliot Rodger had an ok life until that time.

Then, once you get to 7th grade, you will notice;

Some people go on to seeming popular, are more outgoing, have many friends and opposite sex members being attracted to them, they also start going out on dates and kiss/make out (usually, nothing more sexual than that at this point, however, they gain the experience that will set them up and make everything easier when they start exploring sexual stuff)

Others will continue a normal lifestyle, they are less outgoing but not loners either, have fewer friendships and go on far less dates, but still get to experience things like that.

While others become complete loners, they have no (or 1-2 AT MOST) friends, NEVER go out with anyone and never kiss/make out.

This may seem like oh not a big deal at first, it's their choice and it's too early.

Well, if it is their choice, sure. What if it isn't? Then something's wrong. And it's not as early as you think. Yes, people lose their virginities typically at.. 16-17? However before doing so, most go through the start kissing/making out path at 13-14, then start doing things like fingering and oral sex at 14-15-16, and ultimately lose their virginities.

Someone who gets no experience early on gets a severe disadvantage, as even if something was to happen, they would be too inexperienced to handle it.

And the thing is, things usually stay like that, until college, too. It is very unlikely that 7th grade's loner will become popular, outgoing and have a sex life in high school, just as it is that 7th grade's popular kid will become an absolute loner in high school.

If you disagree, let's have a debate in a civilized manner. I just thought about it today. I evaluated my life since birth to now, that I've finished university, and I realized that, even if I was a little more socially awkward, up until 6th grade, I had the exact same life, and I was in the exact same group of friends with all those kids who ended up becoming popular and outgoing later on.

I'm pretty sure that, if instead of locking myself on my room scrolling through forums, had gone to parties and out with them in that year, I would be as normal as they are.

Why didn't I?

Besides me being stupid? I was separated from them ALL during junior high (I went to another one), plus I had shitty eyebrows (I am literally so embarrassed writing this, but it's true. My eyebrows were united (Idk how else I can explain it), and my mom would get in the way when I mentioned fixing them. Love yourself and all that shit. MOM I DIDN'T ASK FOR A PLASTIC SURGERY.

I know I just haven’t met the right people yet, and it’s good that I have shut out these toxic people in my life. But now I feel incredibly isolated. I have no one to talk to.

my head is in the gutter because i’m back home living with my parents, my boyfriend is miles away. i haven’t been able to be around anyone my age in months, did u forget to mention since january i’ve been completing my spring semester online.... at home. i did this in hope to achieve more. i had plans to save money and ultimately improve my gpa. now im unemployed and doing even worse in school. all of sorority sisters have chosen to disassociate themselves with me because of my unwillingness to give up my lease for another girl, aka resulting in me not having a place to live the upcoming year when i return to campus. 

I can see now that this has became much of a rant, i’m just screaming into this bottomless internet, subreddit void in hopes it’ll make me feel better. i don’t have a bad life, i’m thankful for how comfortable i’m living especially in times like this. i just don’t feel motivated anymore, i don’t know what i want to do with my life, i just want to give up. ive struggled for a long time with self harm and anxiety attacks. ive been in denial about being depressed and have purposely missed all my appointments in hopes my mood will just get better. i think it’s time i seriously see a professional though. i’m failing as a daughter, a girlfriend, a sister and in so unhappy with who i am. does it get better? i’m just laying on my bed typing this all out and i’m sorry if it doesn’t even make sense but i really do feel better. i’ll be okay but i just want to get to the point in my life where i’m wanted. i have about 5 close friends, i try not to confide in any of them when it comes to my problems. i feel annoying and dependent. sometimes my bf won’t talk to me all day and then i know he won’t want to talk to me when i try talking to him and i honestly just really fucking need a shoulder to cry on. 

im just going to end here. i feel somewhat better, i guess this just made it clear that even the girl who seems to have her life together is so lonely.",lonely,i’m not sure where my life is going and quite frankly i’m not sure how much more fulfilling it’ll turn out to be.,2020-05-17 17:20:05

I'm just looking for the basics, somebody to love. *cue Freddie Mercury*.
I want to find that person who goes over the my friends places and sits on my lap, laughs with my friends, asks me if I want to go inside and eat yet.

1369,NickNickNick256,1589694833,1,"The Phases of reddit

Phase 1: (painful conversation) simple small talk.

Phase 2: (a burst of hope?) switching to discord or another platform

Phase 3: (the deciding factor) either that person is fine with voice calling and you make it phase 4 or they aren’t and you skip to phase 5

Phase 4: (attachment) You’ve finally found someone who actually wants to talk and treats you like a human.  They make you happy and you talk constantly for a few days. 

Phase 5: (abandonment) they slowly start to fade, putting less and less thought and effort into the conversation until eventually you can’t even have one because of the 30 minute response delay for a simple one word response.

Phase 6: (revival or so you thought) After not talking for 1-3 days you text them since they don’t text you and ask if they wanna talk on the phone. They some how tell you no. Whether that be ignoring you or a simple idk/excuse. 

Phase 7: (the crash) all hope is lost and you give up for a while so you go to YouTube and just watch away feeling empty. 

Phase 8: (getting back on the horse) you run through the cycle a few more times and get the same outcome. 

Phase 9: (being realistic) you realize that eventually you will be left or it’ll be a mutual leaving in every friendship you’ve had and so you give up entirely. 

Phase 10: (am I worthless?) you question as to if you even have value but don’t answer it yet. You question as to what you’re doing wrong compared to people with boyfriends or girlfriends. You realize you can’t figure out the answer to that second question so you answer the first one. No you don’t have value. You are worthless you tell yourself.

The final phase: (locking away any hope) you’re tired of being hurt so you slowly attempt to lock away any bit of hope that you will ever find anyone who will care about you in anyway. You unfortunately realize the only piece of hope you can’t lock away is the hope that someone will come walking through your door and give you a big hug and hold you in their arms. That they want you to cry on their shoulder and let out all the pain and darkness inside of you. You soon realize that you’re stupid and that no one will want you. All you are is damaged.

1370,GWDota,1589694817,1,"By ""just"" I mean literally. It's my birthday. I was born at about 5:30am I think so as of about an hour ago I've been in this world for 30 years.

I've had one relationship, it was long distance and iirc lasted about 8 months. The latter half (if not more) of that relationship was fearing the next time her anxiety issues would surface and cause her to try and block me on all social media because she thought she didn't deserve me. Or feeling scared to break up with her because of how off the deep end that might send her.

Since then I've not really come close to anything else. The last girl I had a crush on was at a job - we didn't get to talk much due to how variable shift patterns were and how rarely ours synced up - but she was a very nice person and we just seemed to get along instantly.

A few months into knowing her I found out she had a boyfriend so I did my best to just be a friend and not a creep while quietly hoping the relationship wouldn't last due to how little she ever talked about him.

Well I got my wish because that relationship did indeed end - when the girl came to terms with her sexuality and came out as gay.

Since then I've moved to a new place (for unrelated reasons) and had just started a new job when corona hit, which I had to leave as the risk of exposing my mom (who's in the ""high risk"" category) to the virus was too high. As a result ive not really had the chance to make any new friends here yet.

The end result of all this is; I'm a guy now entering his 3rd decade having never even kissed anyone. And I don't know when that will change. I feel like most women around my age are going to be so much further along in their lives, and ready for much more serious relationships than I am ready for.

I feel like I need to ""catch up"" and have some of those early 20s passionate-but-ultimately-not-right romances to figure out who I am and what I want but the older a guy gets the creepier it is to be attracted to girls who are younger than him, in society's eyes.
And the difference between being 29 and 30 is cavernous in this regard.

Me and my girlfriend broke up almost a year ago, and it was all my fault. I got mad over petty stuff and I took what we had for granted.

I didn’t get hurt this time, but this whole time, I was hurting my ex without realizing it. After me and the hoe broke up AGAIN, I started talking to my ex that I still had feelings for AGAIN. This time, I thought I would finally shoot my shot, and so I did and confessed that I still had feelings for her. She responded saying that she just wants to stay friends because I had hurt her too much. This whole thing is all my fault and I literally hate myself for it.

With those friends we used to go road cycling, cinema, meet up and chill watch TV play computer games etc. But now in the city I live I'm not kidding when I say I have ZERO people I can do this with. 

They always say things like, hope to meet up some time etc etc and things but then when I say a few weeks later or so let's meet up, I hardly ever get a response. When I talk to people, it's weird but I can feel like they're distracted or starting to yawn and I cut the convo short like I'm boring them or something. 

People are always very polite to me and seem to be happy in my company at work etc but nobody ever really wants to link up or do the kind of things I'm interested in. I have over 1000 Facebook ""friends"" and tons of ""friends"" I talk to over WhatsApp etc but literally zero people that I hang out with.

I have a wife and 2 kids so that's awesome. But it's not the same as having some ""buds"" that you can chill with and rely on.

I honestly don't know what has happened.

I signed up for this account to involve myself in taking actions and building a different type of online community than I have had previously in my life. Just got out of the significant relationship of all my life and time has passed and Im picking myself back up again. Never really done much on reddit before this.

Im way over feeling sad about my loneliness now. I spent a lot of my years feeling bad and sorry and misunderstood by others. I felt entitled. That entitlement caused me to burning bridges. When my world flipped upside down there was not a lot of people there. There weren't there because I chased them all away.

An entitled asshole I was. I had to hit bottom. I had to repeat a few shitty cycles. I had to almost get into a relationship with a mirror image of my abusive ex. I stopped expecting other people to help me or be there for me to help me be happier. I had to decide to start over and be grateful for the opportunity to actually take the time to work and change myself and my values and virtue list and go to counselling. I took this chance to be better for myself. I have never had any substance abuse problems or violence problems but I have had an entitled asshole problem.

This post is a signal to anyone who needs it that you can feel shitty and feel hopeful that things will get better. You can work at being better when things get so sad and empty because no matter what... life is gonna kick your ass. It doesn't matter how many times you get hit. Its how many times you pick yourself back up that matter.

Feeling shitty is normal and cyclical. It happens a lot in our lifetimes. As I type I see 263 people online right now. [Seems Im not alone in feeling alone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbXWrmQW-OE)

I’ve always been a loner, and I’m still pretty lonely, only left with one friend that I know for 7 years. Since we left our toxic group of friends we started to spent so much time together and we are extremely close. For a while now I’ve started to see her true colours. 

She’s manipulative; she usually tries to manipulate me into making a choice that I don’t wanna make to benefit her. 
She’s possessive; I have no free time from her . I have to be there 24/7 on her call and when I don’t want to she gets mad.
She’s selfish/arrogant; she doesn’t care about my interests. She always talks about herself and won’t listen to me. She has no respect for me; she knows I can’t defend myself and I’m weak. She shouts at me and treats me like trash. When I defend myself she won’t speak to me until I apologise and I really don’t want to be alone because she’s the only way for me to have a social life.
She even fucking steals from me and makes me feel shit all the time.

Yeah so with a little bit of background, I basically have a toxic friend. Ever since gradually seeing her for who she really is, I feel lonely. It’s like she doesn’t even matter because that’s not what a friend is, a friend isn’t supposed to make you feel lonely. I’m not even invested in that friendship anymore because I know she will leave me soon, and why would I if she’s so fake. I have literally no one. Every time I speak to her I fake it. I fake everything, my enthusiasm, my laugh and my happiness. I’m not scared to stand up for myself, I’m scared of being completely alone because once when I had no soul to talk to I almost killed myself. It was a really dark time, I’m just really scared of being alone. With my poor social skills I will be alone forever. It really hurts, having people around you that doesn’t really see you.

So I’ve tried to date and put myself out there, but i either got shot down or just get left feeling totally humiliated. I don’t think i need to tell anyone here how hard that sucks. You get straight up laughed at or stiffed on a date, or get the “oh but we make way better friends.” Now I’m not an arrogant prick, I’m like ok in the looks department and i really try to be respectful. I’m not one of these crazy “oh your a simp” guys and I’m sure as Christ on a cross not a Doormat. 

So for the past few months i analyzed my life and I realized that maybe I’m one of those people who will die alone. Like if you compare people to boats. Some boats are built to hold families and some like mine are just a one person boat. If you try to force people onto the one person boat, or if you try to swim to another boat you will just drown angry and confused. You are literally forced to either improve your boat for yourself or chase an unreachable goal and suffer because of it. Now i know that sounds like a bad mindset to be in, and that’s where I’m confused. Because i think I’ve accepted that ill die alone and I’m ok with it?

This crazy thing happened where instead of chasing these impossible goals of getting into a healthy relationship i started working on myself. I cut alcohol out %100, i shaved my stupid long beard and focused on my college workload and i banged out two A+’s and a B+ on a hard as heck law and policy class. My confidence grew ten fold to the point where I’m airing this out on reddit. I found that by cutting out the unobtainable i opened more doors for myself. I even work out like every day. I never did that. Like never. I’m losing weight faster than i ever thought i could and I don’t eat junk food anymore like ice cream and chips. And even video games that i once lost interest in are really fun for me now.

i guess what I’m asking is am i wrong for choosing this lifestyle and adopting the mentality that I’m just stuck in a one person life?

So basically I don't have a lot of friends, which is okay, worse part is that I am not really close to anyone. I had a best friend for around a year, in fact our friendship was amazing but sadly with frequent misunderstandings and a totally dysfunctional dynamic. I was the one who ""wanted more"" or as my former best friend says ""expect too much and put her too high"". I never had any romantic feelings but I genuinely care about her. After reuniting she ended the friendship again and I needed serious psychological attention because of my suicidal thoughts and intentions. I always tried my best to be supportive and I always took care of her, if she was sad, sick, need a ride, hungry or whatever. 

Trying to get over the second best friend breakup my true best friend, my Cat Dreamer got really sick and eventually passed away despite all my efforts to heal him. I became friends with the woman who sold me Dreamer and she was very supportive through the whole thing. Eventually she ended the friendship with me too, she got involved into conspiracy theories, which I adressed my concerns and doubts to. Again I was the one who put in more effort into the friendship with listening to her problems and providing emotional support and advice (the dynamic was better in this case though)


My other couple of friends are more like acquaintances, everyone who left me so far is doing better now without me.

My family is okay but occasionally they show that they're kinda tired of me as well and I felt hurt when my father said ""we should have had an abortion"" a couple of weeks ago.

I'm 18 years old, I have a bunch of great friends. Everytime I have tried a relationship, it has just ended badly; for either one of us or both of us. I don't really feel like my friends care about me. When I'm in school, we're all having fun and stuff, but when I try contacting them at home, they don't want to talk, or it's just like meaningless empty conversations. My best friend is going through what seems to me like a depressive episode and they keep assuring me they're fine, but I doubt it. Anyway, he doesn't wanna talk at all atm. I'm getting pretty lonely lately. At night I usually just sit in my bed being sad until I fall asleep. Sometimes I just break out crying suddenly, at any time of day. I feel like I'll never actually feel genuine love. Idk what to do. So, how do you deal with these feelings?",lonely,Combatting extreme loneliness?,2020-05-17 05:33:49

I haven’t been invited to anything. I have a bf I barely talk to because he’s always working or the time difference means one of us is sleeping. I barely talk to him anymore (hard to count memes every other hour as spending time with someone).

I talk to my mom here and there but she’s also very busy and working from home. I’m working from home too but my job has slowed way way down. So I just sit in front of a laptop all day because I have to. 

But even if I wasn’t ‘working’. Even if we weren’t in quarantine. I wouldn’t be doing anything different. But overthinking about how I don’t have friends anymore. And how I don’t have hobbies because I’m too scared to start any. And even if I had hobbies I’d be too scared and socially awkward to meet people. I don’t want to meet new people.

They have their own lives and other people who that deeply care about. I’m an afterthought, really. And sometimes I feel like I take up too much of their time and effort. 

They say that I can always go to them for help. A part of me believes that. But another can’t bring myself to call them when I’m need. I willfully shut them out. And I don’t hesitate to do that. 

When I tell them that I’m doing good, I lie. Most do that to save face in casual conversation. But these are the people I know I should be honest with. 

Yet I easily put up a front. If I break, I quickly build myself up and pretend everything is okay. I lie. I distract myself. I convince myself that I am okay.

1455,cassie_to_heart,1589629818,1,"Hi guys, 

I'm Cassie (well, you can call me that... it's the name I chose for myself). I'm posting again since I haven't got any messages (maybe this one is the charm?), though some levels of support 

Unfortunately, for many young people like me, I'm one of the souls not into anime, Pokemon, Animal Crossing, watching Netflix, share memes, ""looking for a deep convo"" etc. that I find often in many posts... especially for a Gen Z'er born a year before Y2K. And it's hard to talking to any females with my level of interest since we probably don't align at all. So feeling like an outcast can certainly be very sobering, and certainly I feel no stranger to it. I've felt one near my whole life. Didn't and don't have a place to belong. Not one reddit community (maybe this is an exception), nor discord, nor any other social groups out there.

Not everyone will fill in what I'm looking for in terms of the specific person/s (especially given reddit demographics and a small part of politics plays into it), but if allowing, the outcome can be greatly rewarding. I'm not going to downgrade the types of people to connect with despite outside reservations and judgments (has happened before), as this is my own path and desires I'm carving for myself and not anyone else's.

With that in mind, I'm looking for quality friendships (not the one to ghost each other after days of sharing correspondence). Where we slowly and gradually share our vulnerabilities, our needs and desires are unashamed...become best friends with a correspondence halfway around the world. One where I could trust you and hopefully vice versa. Unvarnished honesty, kindness, trust and understanding is what I want. Yes, I get that this sub is for lonely peeps but I just want to let you know I'm making myself vulnerable right now, and spending time to make this post... time I'm not going to get back. I myself thought about scrapping it together especially if it's not well-received but I wonder if there is a guy out there who could make me feel I'm not talking to a brick wall... maybe fits the bill together. 

A deep-rooted friendship at the core of it (and if I were to humor you on a possible relationship, I haven't started transitioning yet so I'm settling for 'less' instead). Whom am I extending this olive branch to you're wondering?

These are specific people, in environments and career that are able to get on my level, and for me to get on theirs ideally but open to others. So it'd be great if you're a **US LEO (cop)/military (Army, Navy, Marines, AF etc.)** considering some if not many, interests of mine are US law enforcement or military focused. Yep, I wasn't lying if my interests were so niche and specific it's hard to find someone to relate that with. Or just a cop or military, doesn't have to be US, in general.

Concerning the latter... why US military still? Well, certainly there isn't a lot of military folks around my area , it's no big military town and given my nation is an ally of you, why not? Certainly my country isn't always receptive to US troops (looking at your current commander-in-chief and Iraq war history) but nonetheless, there is always the possibility of strong leadership to be in command. After all, if Gen. 'Mad Dog' Mattis is held in high regard by marines, maybe there is hope that there could be someone capable of such good leadership. That's my hope anyways, and it could mean frak. Maybe I'm just someone with a keen interest in anything US military.

Not to mention I'm partial to (US) Navy. So, if you're a military guy and want to have a little friendly feud about which is the best sibling branch there is (go Navy), I welcome that as well. Maybe I'll get flak in saying that the Coast Guard is a real branch too... see what I mean? There's not too many people whom could get the inside joke... And I guess I'm strange that I'm not military myself.... so what does that make me? I have no clue myself tbh. Maybe someone who watches too much Michael Bay pro-American films.

I'm also interested in hearing any stories or the routine of your day... even combat stories if you have any. Maybe you're stationed at Rota to Bagram, or simply at home from Pendleton all the way to Pensacola NAS, in the barracks hoping tomorrow doesn't become a dreaded Chinese field day. 

**About me:** Asian-Australian, doing Nursing in my 2nd year (i.e. student nurse), looking to become a flight nurse (interest in ER, ICU to an extent, nursing at a VA hospital), liberal-leaning (yes you've heard that right).

**Dislikes:** bureaucracy, psychology and platitudes.

People find me weird but often, they hesitate to tell me that they find it charming, and I run around, thinking that people don’t like me.

Schoolwork and homework always loom over my head, even though I don’t want it to.

All of my friends have either lost their virginity or they are not as fucked up as I am.

I hung around boys who were toxic and prevented me from exploring my sexuality and gender identity, and now, even though I detest it, I run around with this subconscious notion that I’m not able to talk to women, or that I have to do something special with them. 

My addiction to sexting is largely because I feel like through sexting, I will somehow get a glimmer of what people experience when they have physical sex.

I also watch a lot of pornography.

I’m not ugly. People have expressed interest in me.

I just feel so socially disconnected from everything that, even when I try to be myself, I can’t really do it. 

I hate that in middle school and high school, I was too nervous to make decisions that I wanted to make, I was too eager to make decisions that I didn’t want to make.

Talked to lady colleagues of different ages, and even the pretty ones was talkable. Things happened in my life and at work and I suddenly found myself studying (civ ing) at a university in another town. That was at first very lonely since I was not a party guy. Bit then I happened to sit beside a guy at a lecture that had the same ridiculous sense of humour as me amd we became friends. He was a Casanova at the same time as a nerd, and he kind of took me under his wings. Had me starting workour, had me going to the best hair salon in town and getting fashion clothes. And even if I hated it I went to parties. I was extremely awkward but managed somehow to find a way around. Managed to ask girls to dance, flirt a little. 

And it paid off. After a few years I approached every girl I found beautiful, an did after a while never get dissed. Of course they were suspicious first, people are, but I became involved with girls I couldnt have dreamed of talking to just a few years later. I actually had to turn girls down(which I did not do well first, somethI am deeply ashamed of). In my last year at university i met the girl that is now my wife. I still found it hard with all social gatherings and preferred that we should be alone and i needed time on my own. This was kind of hard for her, being very outgoing. 

We married, got gds and stuff but this social thing was ever a problem. I was terrible to my family after parties and so. I thought I had social anxiety so aI went to a shrink. She did a good job and could say “you jave no anxiety”. It is a part of me, being lonely. This was a big relief. Now I seldom go to parties, I sped a lot of time alone (like writing here🙂) but since I have a family I am not alone. I am in a very good place even if i have very few friends.

So - Being lonely is surrounded by a lot of taboos. One is supposed to be outgoing. But it can be ok. And if you are lonely and want to get in contact with girls(boys) you can do it, even if it does require a lot of blood, sweart and tears.

1461,burntstrawberrytoast,1589623241,1,"My dad I and don't have the best communication, so when he sits to chat with me, I cling to his every word. Sadly, my dad isn't the best person to give advice, and I guess I'm none the wiser for following them. He told me one day that I should never let people close to me because I will eventually get hurt. He said that friends, no matter the situation, will one day betray you. And I have lived to those words so far.

After a while, I realized how wrong my dad was. But by then, I had developed a fear of letting go of my thoughts. When I speak is to bring entertainment to those who surround me, always trying my best to bring laughter. Never do I  speak of myself, nor the things I like or the way I feel. At first, it was normal, I was following what my dad had told me to do, yet at some point, when I felt troubled and alone, I was afraid to appear as needy or a victim to my friends, and thus I never went to them for help. What my dad had once told me evolved into insecurity, fear of rejection and betrayal, and immense loneliness. The kind that you create and consumes you whole.

I spent nights wishing to have someone to call and fall asleep to, just talking about everything and nothing. Not in the romantic way (those are too feeble and unpredictable to hold onto), but a friend who knows you and accepts you as you are. I guess all I want is someone who listens and trusts me enough to speak their troubles with me.  

And the problem isn't my friends- they are amazing people, and I love every single one- the issue is me. I can't help but feel I'm a burden to them, that if I were to stop contact with them, nothing would change. Like I'm not really there. And those thoughts only drown me further down my loneliness. 

I have lost many friends because of this, and I still do it. I fear I will lose my new friends too, no matter how much I love them and they say to love me too. I just can't seem to break these walls I have around me, and whenever they try, I close myself even deeper.

Someone who could help me make the right choices and think optimistically for me at my hardest times. I needed a friend I knew I could always count on. And so I made him in my head during one depressing car ride home two years back.

He'd be there whenever I call for him in my head. As if, he's really there with me in the room. Sometimes I'd have mental conversations with him in my head, or I'd write to him in my journal and he would write to me back. He would always help guide me and encourage me at my lowest. He'd give me the kind of advice I needed in situations, and he has helped me bring myself back to reality multiple times. 

I know that his replies and actions are all just my own. Me planting the kind of person I want to be and have in my life into a figment of my imagination.

My life pretty much has been a downhill, being wanted but never needed. I was abandoned by the frd who i gave the ""best frd"" tittle,it took a while i realised everyone in life temporary,No one gives a fuck, sure they think u are fun to be around u. But after the moment is over,we all live on our seperate life, that part scares me to my bone,still does. But since i had been craving for a connection from the opposite sex, its been a living hell,I thought i was a catch,most of them i tried with said so as well, but no one wanted to be with me, there was always another guy and i always end up with the short straw. I got a mountain of rejections and not even one of those found me attractive or they did, But just didn't need me.
Personally If it were upto me I would rather be alone, after every rejection i get i go to this deep dark hole of pain and solitude, my life will be numb but liveable ,but living in that dark hole, I heal and come back up craving for that connection again,this has been an infinite loop, the loneliness kills and i get back to find that special someone and every single time i choose the wrong person, I am tired of this, I wanna be alone and be okey with it, accept the fact that no one will love me and Iam gonna die alone, How do i kill the optimist in me and let the pessimist take over rather than they taking the wheel on their own accord when the feel like it?

I've made so many throwaway accounts, hopeful that maybe one of them will snag a few people's attention so I feel a little less alone- often times, it sits at 1 upvote for days and then I sink even farther down the hole I'm in. but whatever. 

i have nobody aside from my immediate family. nobody who cares. nobody who loves me. nobody who would miss me if I die. i have no friends. like, literally- zero.

i thought i had one friend, but he's toxic and abusive as hell. though i keep crawling back because I just want someone to talk to during all of this.

i can't handle online relationships very well. i struggle a lot because of past trauma with talking to new people over the internet. i end up ghosting everyone who tries to talk to me, and get more depressed

my way of coping used to be driving, and exploring, and going out in nature. but now i can't. my license was suspended because i had a seizure due to stress and dehydration. i may never get it back.

that was all i had. all i had was my camera, and my car, and my love for nature. nature was my friend- i loved the birds, and the trees, and the desert sand.

now i have nothing.

i don't want to keep going any more.

i keep creating these scenes in my head where i'm happy down the road living in a van and finding someone who loves me and fills this hole in my heart.

but it's never going to happen.

i like to imagine all these scenes of having friends around me. i like to imagine finding love. i like to imagine all the little things. sitting around a campfire with friends, for example. something so small i wish i could do one day that'll never happen.

i've been sober for a month now and i'm trying so hard to keep myself from relapsing but i'm losing this fight, goddamnit.

i have nothing worth fighting for. i have so many dreams, but i'm losing hope.

hope was all that kept me going, and now it's starting to dwindle.

i'm closer to suicide than i've ever been, and I'm worried about my safety

but it's okay. it's not like the world would stop if I died. 

people only pay attention when someone important dies. someone who a lot of people love.

but for somebody who doesn't have that- the world will just keep on turning, nobody's gonna bat an eye.

i bet that, aside from my mom and my sister, not one person would notice i died.

i guess that's the only reason i havent done it yet. i don't want to put her through that. i lost someone to suicide and i still fucking hate myself to date for not being there for her.

i just want someone to hug me and hold me and tell me that they care and that it'll be okay, even though i probably wouldn't believe it- maybe it would help to see someone in person.

1473,sunnybee_19,1589612771,1,"It's nearly 2 am and I just finished watching a show. It was fine, I enjoyed it, but then I sat there thinking about what to do next. Who to talk to. And my mind went blank. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have all these friends, but I can never find anything worth saying. 

I've tried reaching out. I always try reaching out, and it goes nowhere. Nobody wants to talk to me, even after they come to me for advice and claim they love me. They'll post about how great &amp; important I am on my birthday, and then I won't hear from them unless they want to brag about something good or ask me for help.

I don't remember the last time anyone checked up on me. I do everything I can to check up on people and support them and be there for them, but I literally cannot think of a time recently where anyone cared enough to simply ask how I was. And usually that's fine, I don't pay much attention to it. But tonight I'm not fucking fine.

I feel like a failure in so many aspects. I'm a 19 year old girl and I've never lived. I was so busy burying my trauma &amp; emotional abuse &amp; neglect &amp; my fucked up problems by spending all my time being involved in theatre &amp; trying not to piss off my parents because I was terrified of them, that I never really did anything. I feel like I never got to experience being a teenager. 

I wanted to go to college. So bad. But I can't afford it. I didn't get enough in financial aid/scholarships &amp; neither me or my family has the means otherwise. I was a good student in school, but just not good enough. And I disappointed not only my parents, but myself. It's my dream to get my doctorate &amp; work with animals &amp; their behavior. I'm still trying to a figure out a plan to get it done but until then I'm stuck working 2 jobs and trying to find a roommate so I can get my own space and just breathe. 

I'm also a little afraid that I'll never find love. Silly, I know, but I have bad luck. I hate myself. Truly. I try to love myself &amp; I try to improve my self image but it's hard when your own reflection disgusts you. But regardless, I try to act confident because I constantly read about how no one will find you attractive if you're not confident, so fake it til you make it, y'know? 

It's not just my self image, though. I have commitment issues, which is something I've come to find out as I dealt with some buried trauma. I think no one could ever love me, but when it comes close I freak out and push them away. I'm scared of getting too invested in something that could come crashing down. There's more to it, but you get the idea. I'm working on it.

I don't know, guys. I'm trying my best. I try to be a good friend, daughter, person. I try to recognize my faults &amp; fix them. I try to stay positive and be kind and only have love for people. I try to be confident and love myself, and I try to be content with my life, and usually I'm pretty good at believing it, but it gets so lonely. 

Everyone I love looks so much happier without me involved. They seem to be having so much fun, and finding themselves. And I know they're just as lost as I am half of the time, but they have a support system. I don't have anyone. When I try to open up to someone I get shut down just so they can open up to me instead. Which is okay, I want to be there for them. 

It's just exhausting to deal with everything bad alone. My grandma's death? Dealt with it alone. Aunt's death? Dealt with it alone. Sexually assaulted? Dealt with it alone. Eating disorder? Dealt with it alone. Depression, anxiety, injuries, news that I tested positive for a disease that could kill me before I'm 50, getting accepted to my dream school only to find out I can't go, everything I deal with alone. 

I try to reach out for help and nobody hears me. And most days I can accept that, take a breath, and move on. But I'm just so lonely tonight. And I'm afraid I'll feel this way forever.",lonely,I can't keep ignoring my loneliness,2020-05-16 17:06:11

Don’t you worry though because I will always be ready to hear what’s bothering you. I’ll always be ready for you to run back and complain about your other friends. You say you hate them, can’t stand them, but you go back every damn time. So really what am I to you? Because I can sure as hell say you’re not my best friend.

He offered some loose advice and genuinely cared about me and tried to boost my self esteem. 

Now that he's not around anymore, I feel like I lost a really important person and there was so much value in our conversations. I never took him for granted, I knew he was an amazing friend the whole time, I just didn't expect us to stop being friends. We drifted, and each time I tried to reconnect, it seemed like he didn't want to. Or, I saw he was happy, or busy, and he didn't respond like he did before, so I decided that he was happy without me. 

I have another guy friend who has been supportive. We've had one deeper conversation about my mental health and he was super caring and was there for me. But I feel insecure talking to him. He has a gf, so I don't want to take up so much of his time or have him worry about me just cause I'm a close friend. Also, he doesn't know much about depression, so we don't connect as much. He's still caring though and tried really hard to help, which I'm very grateful for. 

I miss the guy who left me behind, and when I see him liking a picture on an account we both follow, I obsess over it a bit. The post had ""I miss you"" on it, and I wonder who he's missing, because I really miss him.. 

As for the other guy, I really want to open up more but I'm just not sure how to because we usually don't talk about deep things and I don't want to bother him with my nonsense.

If you're still reading this, you may have noticed that I'm a girl, but I only talk to guys about my feelings. Why? Because girls (at least the ones I know) are really judgy and not understanding and not trustworthy at all. I know, I've tried. 

Yes, I have friends that are girls, but I will stay closed off a bit from them because of those reasons. Maybe that contributes to my loneliness, but I don't want to open up to them and have them betray me.",lonely,"It's not that I don't have any friends, I just can't have that deep conversation with any of them.",2020-05-16 14:40:03

With the friend group everyone was online most of the time, when I was up late and wanted to talk to someone I'd be able to, If I was sad late at night also I'd get the support quickly because of time zones, etc. Not that I'm ungrateful for my real life friends however they aren't very active, when I'm sad late at night I'm screwed because I can't get the support due to them being asleep and so on. I couldn't imagine a life without them because I knew I'd be lonely and because I live in that nightmare now I am. There's a ton of things my online friends had to offer that my irl friends cannot and I don't have that now.

Also I'm feeling lonely because no one I go to for support understands me and doesn't understand the importance of the online friend group I had it's just dismissed as ""Oh they aren't REAL friends because they're behind a screen and it's nothing like physical friends"" like I get what they're saying but like they've helped me so much and really cared about me that's still a friendship and no one like gets that and I just feel hopeless trying to explain that over and over again because they can't understand.

And lastly I feel lonely because without the online friendships that I had I have this hole in my heart that can't be filled that's because of the first thing and I see myself having that hole as long as I don't have online friendships.

1505,FlatPassenger6,1589585207,1,"I don't really know where to start with this, Really I kinda tripped and fell into this sub by pure coincidence.  


Recently broke up with my long-term girlfriend of 7 years, am disabled and our lives were pretty intertwined/I was pretty dependent on her for a lot of things for about half the time we were together. I'll spare strangers the grizzly emotional details, but I think the long and the short of it is we kind of slammed into each other way too young and became different people laboring under the weight of different circumstances, that led us to different ways of coping where communication between us broke down.  


Going forward after quarantine will be hard (We live together). I initiated the breakup , but in the quieter moments, I panic. Mainly because I have to plan for the future on my own, and I suck at it. On some level these days, I'm moving through the world in a state of what I saw another redditor describe as ""Please Hold Me"" it's the kind of existential panic where you wind yourself up enough to the point where you can feel your insides almost vibrating.  


Falling out of love was just as painfully isolating and disillusioning as being physically alone or physically isolated from people for a long stretch. In fact, I would argue being surrounded by someone you can't relate to anymore is more soul-crushing than actually being alone. In all honesty, I don't think I would mind the former so much if the reality of my disability, and needing to be dependent on others to an extent wasn't such a hard fact of my reality. I think practicality tends to hang over my imagination and wilder instincts like this all-consuming shadow. I've often said if I could disappear for at least a year and not have anyone who knows me now know of my whereabouts, I'd abandon everything I own, and just be some kind of transient moving up and down a coast for a time.

&amp;#x200B;

But I also don't want to be that way forever, if that makes sense?  I genuinely enjoyed the companionship aspect of the LTR, but I can't see myself letting down my guard like I had to the first time again. I'm aware that I'm kind of my own worst enemy when it comes to loneliness in the long-term. I struggle with a lot of human interaction, I don't really care for a lot of banal chit-chat, and when I'm surrounded by people if I go out, I kind of feel like I have one of those cake covers over me that prevents me from making any meaningful connections. I wouldn't blame it on my disability, I think I'm just more of a natural wallflower that tends to blend into places. Which for someone in a wheelchair, is kind of bizarre.

Okay so this took me a lot of courage to write this here but I feel bad (and because I’m bored ‘cause.....quarantine) that I’m done with my first year in uni and I couldn’t make any friends there.
Most of the people in my uni are very respectful and nice so I’m not gonna make any excuses that they didn’t welcome me or I didn’t fit in. It’s just that, I’m socially awkward and I have a hard time talking to people because I don’t know what to talk about (I’m pretty good at texting tho).
Since we’re already done with one year, everyone now has their own groups so it’s hard for me to introduce myself or talk to people. 
I may come off as a shy person but once I open up, I’m pretty chill. 
I also choose to believe that I’m very loyal to the people I’m friends with. 
I have some close friends from school but that’s pretty much it. We talk a lot but seeing their Instagram stories or then talking about their college friends hurts a little. Is that even normal lol?

Now especially with the quarantine and being stuck at home alone every day I catch myself constantly daydreaming about how life would be if I had a girlfriend. Like last night I was about to make dinner but then I realized the dish I needed was dirty. So I had this little conversation in my head with my invisible girlfriend about how one of us could start dinner while the other did the dishes...it honestly feels so pitiful. I have little conversations in my head like that a lot, conversations I would have if I had a girlfriend.

I'm overall happy being alone but I wish being in a relationship wasn't constantly on my mind.

I've always avoided going out anywhere. I don't like parties, dancing, or sports. So I don't get out a lot, aside from occasionally going out for debate tournaments. But that's kind of all stopped. With this covid thing I'm sitting at home all day (I get that isn't really my fault) but I've realized that this is so much easier than talking to people. I don't have to worry about being awkward and giving myself another reason to hate me, and I don't need to worry about getting hurt by someone I like.

Life sucks. I hate being alone. I hate not having someone to laugh or talk with, someone who I care about and who actually cares about me, someone to just hug. I've never been a fan of hugs and haven't had one in ages, but man I could really use one. I've always enjoyed stuff more on my own (like music, videogames, movies, etc) but just to have someone to listen to my favorite song with would mean the world to me.

We talk for hours - usually at night - about poetry and existence and stories and all kinds of unimportant stuff, we just like talking, we just feel *good* talking to each other, we just feel *good* with each other. Then we save up money and it's hard but not too hard because we have each other, and then we go on a trip somewhere weird and far way - maybe India, maybe Japan, I don't know - and it's crazy but not too crazy because we have each other.

I've not been on a vacation with my parents since 2012. My father has never taken me to any place on holidays. They don't even wish me on my birthday. I've never experienced cutting cakes at 12 o clock. I usually go out and eat in a restaurant by myself on my birthdays. A day which should be special for everyone, is just another day for me.

Since I reside in suburban type of place and my friends were in the city, I never went out with them during the four years of my college life.
But, I love reading. Books keep me alive. In these times when I can't go out even once in a week, which I used to do before this lockdown, I read books most of the time. I got a Kindle recently and have been reading from it since. They are like my friends, who don't backstab you. If it weren't for books, I'd be dead by now. I've lost a few good friends in my life.

I know I’m not for everyone and everyone’s not for me but I though I would find at least one person to start a conversation with and so far nothin.

1563,hamartiated,1589514697,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Lockdown, I think, hasn't been helping.

My parents weren't as forgiving as they may seem as they tried to keep me from killing myself  (which i still consider sometimes) by saying ""what about me? Do you love me?"" Or ""you know if you do that you go to hell"". My parents tried their best with faith based therapy but it hasn't worked out how they thought it would. So i turned to philosophy, specifically Buddhism and Stoicism. My parents were pissed as they thought that i worshipped Buddha and kowtow to idols.

1591,blowiepart18,1589487456,2,"I’m going to be 22 in June and I feel like time is just going faster now that I’m an adult. I’ve never been in a relationship before and it’s the part of loneliness that feels the worst for me. I can deal with not having more than one friend, yeah it gets lonely af when he’s busy with all his other friends but I just wish I had a person that I could share a special type of intimacy with. It comes in waves where sometimes I’m okay with being single but then other times it kills me and I just yearn for a partner. It destroys my already brittle self confidence because I start doubting my looks and question if that’s the reason nobody wants to date me. It’s just a mixture of really bad feelings that pushes me lower into my depression.

Being single is the most predominant part of of my depression because it’s the one that makes everything feel so much worse. Deep down I understand that it’s because of my inability to speak to others and form bonds so instead I’m always doing my own thing and people take this as I’m either ignorant or don’t really care about them. I wish I was different and I wish I could be like everyone else. I know being different is admired but realistically I’m a boring person who has no stories to tell other than what I do in my own room. 

Being lonely forced me to turn to alcohol and seek methods of trying to improve my confidence. I would drink just to talk to people, I would drink in class and drink every single day. One point in my life where I thought everything was getting better was my first year at college when I started talking to this girl I liked. Long story short she ended up getting with my so called friend which dropped me back in this hole. Now I don’t really care about that but it really didn’t help me and just put me back to square one with my loneliness. 

It doesn’t help that my brother is 24 and in the same position. I feel like maybe I’ll be just like him in all this and maybe we’ll never find an attachment which really hurts. I’ve tried online dating but it’s just not for me. I don’t have enough confidence to speak to people online or even go on a date. One date on tinder got me nowhere anyway so I just don’t see the point. 

It’s all me though I can’t really blame anyone or my situation. I could break out my own barrier and try to communicate but it just feels too difficult at times and I had relied on alcohol for so long that I haven’t gotten anywhere since. The anger with myself builds up so much that I even have thoughts of suicide which is the worst part to all this. Not looking for sympathy either, I know all the responses towards suicide. I just want this to end and I want to change myself. I just want someone and to see what it’s like to be with another person. I know it’s like bargaining at this point but I feel like people like myself are really missing out on one of the more important things in life. What’s the point of anything I have now when nothing makes me happy because I’m isolated from everyone.

1605,dn13373315102411,1589476100,1,"Hi everyone.. looking for any advice or people who relate. Having a hard time right now. 

So.. I was in therapy briefly and didn't get anything out of it. I wasn't facing the same issues then. I was hospitalized in January due to obsessive intrusive thoughts that scared me. They started me on Zoloft there, and I'm currently taking 125 mgs of that. It has really helped so far with OCD. But the last couple days I've had a really bad spike in anxiety and depression.

It's hard to explain what's going on in my head but I'll try. I'm 19, and I've lived the last 5 years pretty much in isolation, in a tiny cottage with just my parents. Ever since we moved here 5 years ago, I've dropped out of high school due to the intense mental health issues. I have no friends, no job, no education, no license. Having autism, OCD and severe social anxiety makes getting out there and doing these things feel impossible. I don't know how to talk to people and I have no clue what I want to do with my life, I feel like my options are incredibly limited because of my challenges, which is the main source of my depression.

To compensate for having no life, I daydream and fantasize constantly. I imagine I'm a thin, funny, attractive, outgoing person and that I'm living my dream job with a group of friends. Due to my autism and OCD, I've always had an obsessive personality and I develop intense special interests in certain people/things. There are 2 (somewhat) famous people who I'm currently obsessed with. Normally daydreaming is my coping mechanism, it gives me an escape. But my feelings surrounding these 2 people have become so intense, they're all I think about. Normally this makes me happy, but the other day I had the realization that I obviously will never know these people, and that my daydreams and fantasy world will never live up to the sad, lonely life I'm living now. This made me anxious and sent me into a panic and horrible depression.

 I started thinking.. What is the point of living if I can't do anything in my daydreams? I can't possibly do any of these things for real, I'll never know or be friends with these people. How will my pathetic real life ever compete with that? What if I'll be miserable for ever? Now I feel such an intense need to meet these 2 people, like my life depends on it. I know how insane and creepy and pathetic that sounds, but I'm not some weirdo stalker and would never violate boundaries like that. And now I feel anxious seeing any content of them, because it brings on all these negative feelings. That's what's bothering me more than anything. I desperately want to go back to thinking of them as a happy escape.

I've spent so long living in my head and escaping reality by living in my fantasy world, it's always been a great coping mechanism and made me feel happy. But now I fear I've been living in my head so long that I don't know how to get out.. and in real life I'm lost, scared, and feel trapped and inadequate. My parents always tells me that I just have to try and go out and do these things, but I feel it's impossible due to my circumstances and that I'm ""destined"" to live this sad, pathetic life I'm living now, forever.

This was my latest post here. But it won't stop hurting. How can your friend you spent x many years with just cease communication with you and start hanging out and drink and party and travel with so many other people?

1616,nadakan1986,1589460832,1,"I am lonely today, but I have always been lonely. I just didn't realise it...and it would explain a hell of a lot.

I was lonely growing up in a domestic violent household and lonely at school because I was bullied a lot. I had few friends in the neighbourhood which was nice and often went into the park and built hideouts. I loved nature. I still do. 

My 20's was characterised by chaos. I moved from one place to another and I was almost homeless 3 times. I have never had a relationship based on love, just dependency. I had a series of generic, low paid jobs. My last job was the highest paid - it was an administration job.  

My 30's have got better. I've stabilised. I've just completed a degree I didn't like, but I did it. I'm more hopeful about love and my body and gender dysphoria are gone.

But, the chaos ensues a bit much. I feel I've missed out on so much and life has become very urgent. I've made it urgent. I'm 34. 18 year olds have experienced more positive life moments than myself. I still talk to myself incessantly when lonely like this. Quarantine has made it hard and today is not a good day. My digestive system doesn't function properly when stressed and low, meaning that anything I eat doesn't get processed right and thus affects me mentally. 

The way I dress (dark colours, especially grey), how hyper-vigilant I am over myself, how my social anxiety quietly persuades me to step aside from social events, how uninvolved I feel in the fabric of the society, how I find it so hard to connect to my passions - this all comes from loneliness. 

But I'm glad I finally realise that loneliness is the cause. I don't have to sit and philosophise incessantly to try and find answers. The answers are out there. I need to integrate. I also realise that I'm much more social than I think. I love being around people. Sure, I need rest but good people fuel life into me. I feel like I am running on empty, plus I have no family in this country. 

My mother didn't realise she was lonely. She ended up a paranoid, clinically depressed woman who chain-smoked and reckoned that she was so extraordinarily intelligent that no would understand her. She believed people was jealous of her. I remember once she said that I would be lonely because people wouldn't understand me and that I was an oddball. It took about a decade to know that this wasn't my truth. 

I'm just having a down day. Jobless during Covid-19 is not fun. 

My daily walk in the park does help, even if my anxiety makes me worried that I will be hurt by some mad person. I really should start tai-chi one day soon.",lonely,I've just recently realised that loneliness has a lot to answer for.,2020-05-14 22:53:52

1624,sxhmoop,1589447389,1,"This feeling all started from an experienced I had 2 years ago. Basically I met this girl and we were talking all the time. Now that I think of it, probably the first person I loved. She seemed to be very into me and I was into her. This went on for 5 months when suddenly she told me she never liked me from the start.

When I got that text I didn’t even know what to say... all the memories and things we shared... meant nothing to her at all? I was fooled for that long? I want to be mad at her but really how couldn’t I have noticed? After that I basically went antisocial mode and barely hung out with anyone I used to, stopped participating in any activities I enjoyed, and just stopped trying to talk to girls and make friends. 

My self esteem basically dropped to zero. I’ve always had a messed up nose and it’s bothered me for so long to the point where I basically don’t want to interact with anyone because of it. I’m so afraid of people commenting on it that I don’t do things I want to.

Because of this, if a girl complements my looks I’ll show so much interest back that the friendship ends up lasting a week because I get the wrong idea on how they feel. A simple compliment doesn’t mean someone wants to date but that’s how my brain sees it as. 

I have no interests other than collecting funko pops which are cool but all I want in life is for someone to notice me and love me. I see my buddies with there girlfriends and how they’ve been together for years. It’s not like I’m jealous at all because it’s my fault, I don’t put my self out there because I’m too self conscious. 

Life is just so empty, nothing to do, no one who cares about me, no one to talk to. I have no close friends that are there for me. I’m not suicidal at all, just so sad sometimes where I just don’t want to wake up the next morning. It’s like I have no purpose.

For so many years now I've been dealing with people who go on and on and talk for the sake of talking but don't care to hear me as well. Just approval of their choices, acknowledgement of their struggles, concern for their hurts, here for their voice to be heard. I feel like a journal, some sort of trash can to dump on. But it's nice to notice my words get interrupted mid sentence and I let myself shut down without a sound. If I dare say more I'm actually led to an automated message of ""damn, that's crazy."" 

I've gone through so much lately and I find myself unsure.. I don't know how to express myself anymore. I just catch myself.. sitting here. It feels like I'm out of words. I Have no one. No one to call, no one to write to. No one to confide in. No one to talk with about this weight I carry now. I have this guy here whom is now passed out on my feet, but he's been through his own shit as well. I guess he and I are lucky enough to have each other. But I find it amazing and sad that he and j both have no one. Literally no one at all. If I die, he's alone in this world and vise versa.

Is this life now? Are we [he and I] alone here? Are most lonely people on the same boat as us? Is it wrong that sometimes I see it as a good thing because I can cope unlike the others who need someone to dump on? Or is that me coping?",lonely,A midnight sigh,2020-05-14 14:16:29

1652,hamartiated,1589428059,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

The kids there were pretentious as all hell (b/c they would afford a private school?) and the teachers enabled them to be assholes. Growing in settings like this, I was indoctrinated and forced to conform. These children became all I knew, and I maintained the same general friend group since Kindergarten. This has left me extremely underdeveloped socially.

Having awoken, realizing religion is not real, I publicly left the church as a young adult (18). I have since been shunned from my family and childhood friends.

1657,ThereShallBeNothing,1589424242,1,"I have isolated myself from the social world for almost a decade, and I have never had any friends since my early childhood for the nineteen years I've drawn breath into this shell of an existence. I've made myself invisible to common eyes for most of my life. I just don't see the point, I feel so insignificant, so small, so useless... I am and have always been a ""shut in"" outside my responsibilities. I am normal, I am not scary or unique looking, I don't suffer from any mental disabilities or something like that. I just want to be seen, to be heard, and to be understood. Yet whenever I scream into the valley darkness for help, I only hear the emptiness my own miserable &amp; shallow voice echo to me in return. A part of me enjoys the suffering and loneliness, it gives me a twisted form of purpose, but I know what kinds of reapings those sowings could bear. 

Forcing myself to be alone for seven years, has left it's scars echoing through my conscience, making me feel guilty or insecure of the slightest mishavings. Any failure in the present reminds me of my pathetic and empty past. I think of everyone I used to know, many following careers, some enjoying their lives with the friends they have made, some going through their own battles, their lives are in motion, moving forward, or moving backwards--at least they are moving. I don't fit in that picture. I am frozen, left behind, and forgotten. All I see is darkness, all my good memories bring regret, It hurts to know I exist, I am so full of hate, for myself, and the world. I don't know what to do. I wish I had someone to talk to. I'm tired of being lost in this void, suffering in plain sight, and nobody sees. Like a campfire that fell to the shadow of the night---it's cold unforgiving winds scattering fragments of my embers across the quicksands of time---only to be forgotten underneath it's unforgiving pressure, within the vast expanse of endless abyss of forest. 

I remember during my early teens, how I was ""that guy"" the majority collective chose to ignore, or just never noticed. I was always stuck in my thoughts, in my own dimension, giving myself advice and motivation to fill in a black hole of lack of group care. I tried for so long, even until now, to be my own friend. I went to the extent of adopting social constructs like the Abrahamic God, to be my opium and hence heal the feeling of painful alienation from society and lack of understanding from others. However, I was never integrated into a social group, of any kind. As far as I can remember I have been alone since birth, with no one to relate to. I haven't ""experienced"" what most have. People to me, are like pixilated characters, or contrasted personalities in stories. I can see them, and read them, but they do not see me, or read me. It is like a one-sided glass, and behind that glass is an enchanted painting called ""life"", of which I am the solitary observer, in the empty museum.

There is no point to anything I do anymore. Everything becomes duller everyday. Living is suffering, my motive for surviving has become to understand that suffering. I wish I was not invisible in plain sight, because it makes me feel like I shouldn't exist. It is the worst feeling, walking in crowds, because that is where I see everything that tortures me. Friends enjoying themselves together, a gleeful family, a romantic couple, and the priceless happiness and laughter of children, all reminding me of things I once had, and never had at all. All of this, while I feel death's nihilistic finger on my shoulder, mocking my lonely dim existence. 

I am stuck in my own alienated version of hell, where my evaporated and unseen halo of tears could fill an ocean. I am in a shadowy prison cell, missing a fragment of my soul, awaiting the end of my world. I wish it were different, that I could be reborn, or time-travel. But this universe, seems it is just so unforgiving to the ego... I don't know what keeps me going. It is that curiosity that keeps me alive. It is the fact I don't see the point in almost anything, that keeps me from dying, it keeps me from ""living"" as well.

I've heard it said many times, that my suffering shall cease, and I will be free... But at what cost? By then, there would be a scar etched in my soul forever. There is no light at the end of the tunnel, only suffering.",lonely,"Death's cradle seems inviting, when you have nowhere else to go.",2020-05-14 12:44:02

I was lonely for a while as a child but had good friends in high school. Then we sort of drifted apart and my life long loneliness began, yet I didn't feel lonely like I do today.

I remember the first time I felt truly lonely.

It was something like 20 years ago, when the chat client MSN was just getting popular. Chat previous to that was an ICQ or chatroom thing and not popular at all.

I was at the house of a friend from high school, having graduated the year before. My friend was online and I noticed he had MSN running and they had this group chat with tons of people. I asked what he was doing and he explained that he was in these group chats with people he knew.

It hit me like a punch in the gut.

I was not in any group chats. I didn't even know they existed. 

Before group chats, you might be lonely, but you wouldn't really know how lonely you were, because other people's social life was not everywhere at all times.

As bad as that was, the final torturous nail in the coffin for the lonely, was Facebook and Instagram, because now, not only would you be **constantly reminded on what you're missing out on, you now also broadcast just how lonely and sad you are to the rest of the world**.

I just don't know how to deal with that anymore. My birthday is coming up and every year I dread it. Only a few people will wish me happy birthday and yet another year will be go by with everyone seeing my pathetic existence. I want to delete it all, but then I will lose contact with the few friends and family I still have :(

Have you ever had a dream where you fall asleep, and all of sudden you're greeted with genuine friends with people who actually care about you? You’d feel like you're on top of the world, there is a ray of hope, you start believing in yourself. But as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. You wake up, and it's gone. You're back in your ordinary bed, with your ordinary life, doing the same 9 to 5 job you have done for the past 20 years. And then you try so hard to fall back asleep just so you can escape for even one more minute, but no matter how hard you try, you just fail each and every time. In these alternate realities, you can be whatever you want, no rules, no boundaries, no restrictions. Where happiness can come in all different kinds of flavours. Happiness. That's what they are.

1693,teatastesgross,1589386565,1,"I think a lot of us have probably had the thought that we'll take practically anyone (within reason) that would want to be with us. In my darkest moments when I thought I'd die alone and just wanted to die in general, that's what I thought.

I almost began the first steps of a cold meaningless relationship with someone I'm not very attracted to just because she wants me, and I feel empowered knowing I'm not nearly as desperate as I thought I was and that I still have some amount of value to myself.  You can't be in a romantic relationship with someone you're not attracted to; that's called friendship. I would have been absolutely miserable if I went through with that. I could picture our life if we were together and it made me prefer being single.

I opted instead to take my chances with someone at work I've become much more closer to during the quarantine. Everyone's situation is very complicated right now and I'm not able to figure out with absolute certainty what's going on with this one. But we've talked literally every day for almost two months. In the past week it's escalated into meetups at the supermarket to help her shop (lack of anything else to do right now) and then we went to her apartment and got stoned with her roommates.  This is unprecedented for me. 

There's a chance she just thinks of me as a friend and I'll completely strike out and ""miss"" the first one. But I don't care about that anymore. I feel like I deserve someone special to me, I just hope she or someone else someday thinks I'm special for them too. If I didn't take a stab at the second one and took the sure thing of the first one I would never ever forgive myself.

1705,foreveryoung3,1589375681,1,"I guess I've been pretty lonely my entire life. I mean, it wasn't as obvious when I was a young kid, since I was mostly normal, a bit shy at first and a tomboy, but happy. I remembering noticing to myself as a very young kid that I couldn't get people to like me as much as other people could. I felt different but could never put my finger on what was wrong with me.

As the years went on, I gradually started to drift away from people and revert inwards towards myself. I stopped raising my hand in class and I purposely started to sit alone at lunch and play by myself during recess. I was still somewhat sociable back then, so I would sometimes hang out with people around me out of the blue. This started around 5th grade and it continued on until high school. I don't know why I started to do this, maybe all the raging hormones since I was going through puberty at this time. Anyways, no one really cared and I didn't want anyone to, so it was a win-win for me, or so I thought.

As you've probably guessed, I lost almost all of my friends (not that I can blame them) when I started drifting away. Throughout middle school I pretty much only had one friend. I could have made a bunch of friends since there were tons of new people, and I could have gotten a new start. But I was too scared and too stupid to get out there and mingle with all the new kids. That was 6 years ago, and not much has changed.

I'm about to graduate high school. As of now, we're still having a commencement ceremony (if the stay at home order doesn't get extended). I signed up to say a speech for the ceremony. I never heard back from them, so I don't know if I got it or they rejected me. I hope I get it though, because I want to have a way to share my ideas and hopefully inspire people. Something that I was never able to do because I was too scared and stupid to not take advantage of all the opportunities that were given to me.

I remember my mom telling me 6 years ago that I should try and make friends and I wouldn't listen to her. I kept telling her how I didn't want to be around other people. I only realized now that she was trying to help me. 

I did attempt to try and make friends in 11th and 12th grade when I finally realized that I actually wanted friends, but I just didn't know how to make anyone like me. Because of all the years I spent locked away from others and sitting alone, my ability to carry on a conversation and make friends was very rusty. I did manage to make a couple of friends during these two years. I wouldn't say that I was really close to any of them except maybe 2-3 of them. They all had their own friend groups, and I was just along for the ride. Honestly though, if I died the next day they probably wouldn't even bat an eye. But, I did have some bright memories with them. I even went to Homecoming with one of my friends and her group, which was something that I never thought would happen. 

However, the stay at home order really did make it obvious that, other than my immediate family, I have no one from the outside world to rely on. I guess it's a good thing that I have a really close and strong family bond. Otherwise, I would have no one. While part of me is sad that the rest of school was cancelled (prom, etc.), a part of me is relieved because I didn't have anyone to go to prom with and I would feel jealous and sad if I didn't go and everyone else went. Also, I no longer have to deal with the anxiety of not having people to talk to during school.

I think I've pretty much given up on the idea that I'll ever have a normal social life. I realized that I actually don't mind being alone, as long as no one else notices that I have no friends. I'm going to college. I know that I'm probably not going to make friends there since I'm commuting, and I'm okay with that. Will I try and talk to people and make myself known? Yeah, I'll try, but I won't attach my self worth to whether or not I can make friends like I did in high school.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that sometimes being lonely isn't a bad thing or something that you have to cure. It's something that you learn to come to terms with and make peace with.",lonely,I just need a place to get my thoughts out....,2020-05-13 23:14:41

My name is Gordo and I'm 25 and from the UK. Im passionate about music, comic books, movies, politics, art and wrestling.

In my spare time (which right now is obviously, all the time) I write and am at the moment working on a comic book and a movie that I want to start production on once the dust settles on everything that's been happening. I peform stand up comedy as well. Which is a thing.

I don't have an awful lot of friends or people I talk to regularly at all and I think now is the perfect time to reach out and try make some friends. I'm politically liberal but am more than open to healthy discussions and stuff around anything with disagree with.

I stayed for the characters and the storyline, of course, not the whole premise of the game, which is an otome. An otome, for those who aren't familiar with the term, is a dating sim...so I basically downloaded a dating sim as a joke because they're corny. I'm into girls, so I don't look at the cast of characters in a romantic or sexual way. Obviously. ANYWAY. The comfort character's name is Asmodeus and his birthday is coming up on Friday (the fifteenth). While I really do want to make something for his birthday because he's one of my comfort characters and I think his design is neat, his birthdate itself hurts me in a way that only a few people would understand.

I know that the developers didn't make his birthday May 15th with any ill intentions, but the date that it falls on is a very painful day for me. That's all. I know they didn't mean to. I would never blame them. They don't even know who I am. How could I get upset with someone who doesn't even know me for something like this? It's just a birthdate for a fictional character, for crying out loud.

The reason why that day is so painful for me is because it's the day I lost my mom. This Friday will be ten years that I haven't had my mom with me. I'm still not over it. I'll probably never be completely over it. Y'know, despite trying my best to cope with it and keep myself together most of the time. The day I found out that she died is this Saturday, and what would have been her forty-eighth birthday is coming up this Sunday. The only day that I'm really looking forward to is my cat's birthday, which is on the eighteenth. She's turning ten years old.

And the worst part about the 15th, 16th, and 17th is that I'm scheduled to work those days. I'll try my best to tough it out though. I would ask for at least one of those days off, but I don't want to be a burden over something stupid like that. Plus, I need something to do so I can distract myself. Anything to keep up the façade for a little bit longer so nobody asks what's wrong with me. It's what I have to do.

My mind never stops playing through everything, it never stops thinking, doesn't ever give me a moment to collect myself.   I know I have friends and family who love me, however they never even take a moment to ask about me. They'll say how worried they are, but never stop to ask me why I have been how I am, which ultimately just makes it feel like condemnation. 

Sometimes I ask myself if I'm really alive, I haven't felt like it in a long time, and the drinking doesn't numb like it used to. I feel so far from everyone, and everything around me; it's like gravity was shut off, now I'm just floating into an abyss I'm not really sure how to escape from. I try to grasp onto things but it all seems to fall away like snow melting through my hands, but without even the grace of making me feel cold.  How are we supposed to deal with that feeling? Even more so a complete lack of feeling. Laughing and joy seem so temporary and are gone before I can register them much of the time.  

I keep dreaming of packing some bags, and heading out. I don't really know where I'd go, what I'd want to find, or how far I'd get.  I just can't shake the feeling that somewhere different than here would be where I want to be. Maybe I'll sit on the beach and let the spray and foam of the ocean land in my hair, and gaze out at the waves Maybe I'll just lay in the grass beneath a tree in a city I've never been to before, and listen to the bustle of everything going on.  Maybe I'll just end up hungry in someplace I don't know, far away from anyone whose ever known me, far away from all I've ever really had. 

Perhaps then I could find peace. In all likelihood I doubt I would. A kindly soul could offer their hand out to help, but I don't think I'd realistically be able to travel like that. I'm not happy here either though.  I won't be young forever, and I feel like if I don't make some sort of change now, I may never actually do it.

In that time, i have gone from ""too many friend's to organize time with all of them"" down to ""Alone with my empty, useless thoughts""

I'm unsure when it started exactly, but i think it was a gradual process. After high school people went their own ways had kids, stuck with school and bettered themselves (unlike what I've done)
Fast forward a few years where I've become antisocial, severely depressed and constantly anxious with what would be a handful of people i would call Friends.

Again the same thing people live their lives, and the number drops to 1. A friend i would see once a year, we would talk and play games online alot. As time goes on its once a year and less talking less gaming.

[2010-2016]
Meet people over gaming that eventually dissolve into just gaming friends/acquaintances. 

[2017]
Met one guy on a game few years ago, found out he lived few hours away. Through him met a group of people (similar distance some closer) and I've gamed, hung out, and even traveled with.

2020 rolls by after few years of great times, and they start to become distant, and to the point of ignoring me and avoiding me. I was unsure what had happened, but one of them told me how i acted, and was perceived. It was a real eye opener and im glad he told me (this was 5 hours ago). 
I had become a very clingy, needy person ""expecting people to be there for me or always around.""
Idk why my brain decided that, i'm not in my early 20s anymore and i should've realized that just like before; These people have lives of their own and more responsibility then they ever have til this point in life.

I'm the asshole, that assumed people would be available to talk, play games and have no real life like i do. Of all my issues with Depression, and anxiety, they accepted me and due to becoming more cynical over the years, i have mistreated them and they have shunned me. I don't think i deserve friends, or people in my life. Ever since i was 17 i just wished my life would end and the older i got the more difficult that wish would be. If i was strong enough i would end it. Preferably in a month if i were able to, it would be ideal (family would be situated with their new house, hopefully they'd have no debt worries after other place sells) and i could just go.

I don't have friends- I mean I have people who would call themselves ""friends"", but they never call or text or want to hang out. Last time I decided to join them they pretty much ignored me. If I tried to talk they either talked over me or started talking to someone else. This was even when they asked a question and I started to answer. I get the since they don't really want me around but feel obligated because they know me. The loneliness is a bit too much to bear now.

So I thought ""I'll do it on my birthday"", but then ""why wait?"". There are things I wish I would have done. Like visit France. I've been trying to learn french so I could get around and maybe talk to people. Let me tell you it is not easy. I would have liked to kayak more too. Only kayaked once. I was so lost in my own world that I didn't realize how far ahead of everyone else I was. I love theater, but I haven't seen a play in over ten years. I love animals. I get as giddy as a school girl at sight of a litter of kittens. High pitched voice and baby talk. The whole nine.

But I know I'll never do these things. Never go to France or learn the language. Never kayak again. Never see another play or pet a litter of kittens. No. I'll work. Buy some smokes and booze. Sleep and repeat. The life I want to live is in my head. A life unlived.

Anyways beginning of lockdown I moved back in with my family to not be alone ( I suffer from depression ) brought my cat with me and it's been nothing but hell since I got there. Complaints and cruel remarks from my dad whenever he gets the chance. Now understand something here, last year my gf of 4 years left to go overseas and we broke up. This happened in December, the feelings are still fresh and worsened my depression. My family knows about all of this, so my dad proceeds to tell me something to the effect of you gf left you because she knew you wouldn't amount to anything. I didn't know what to say, walked away crying my ass off, packed up all my shit, put my cat in her carrier and sat in my room for awhile. So just before leaving I told him "" You're going to be the reason I kill myself and i hope nobody ever forgives you for that "". Which I really don't regret saying at this point.

So I haven't spoken to him since nor have I responded to any of my other family members. Because well none of them told him shit when he went off on me. So I can't be bothered with people that tolerate that sort of behaviour,i mean to be honest he's been pushing me towards that side and this is the first time ever in my whole life that I've had enticing suicidal thoughts. Idk, it's difficult for me to think about all of this, haven't been sleeping much and all that.

So why I'm mentioning all of this is because I've been alone now in my flat with my cat. The only person I had was my gf which she's gone, I moved home to be around people during lockdown but that clearly backfired.

this has probably been posted here lots of times, but does anyone else feel like a “disposable friend?”

people like you when they have you around, but they never make an effort to look for you when you’re not. you’re considered “nice” and “friendly” but are never part of any “friend groups.” you try to go out there and hang out with other people, but after that one night/hangout, even though you feel like everyone loved having you around, it’s like they’ve forgotten about you all over again. 

anyway, this had been my life for some years now, and it gets so lonely. it’s not like people aren’t willing to listen. it’s more like no one’s asking and i don’t want to suddenly impose my sadness on them out of nowhere.

Now here we are, in my new city, I made no friends because was too focused on work and being depressed in my personal life to let myself socialize. I will say the only reason I went out as much as I did with my SO is because they're the extrovert. Who knows... But the point is, they have all their friends (since they live in their hometown) and I have no one. I've been pretty much isolated socially since August and now it's mandatory and I haven't seen my SO in 3 months. 

I'm probably going crazy but I am feeling too much negativity and I'm too depressed and a alcoholic to really help myself until I move. Missing them is not my only problem either but being burnt out at work since I'm essential too. And feeling unappreciated by management since we get daily critique emails about how we don't do our job effectively enough. Which I don't take personally because I actually have confidence in my job, but it's exhausting always advocating for myself due to the overall image of my department.

I'm gonna be moving in with SO in a couple months anyway, so it'll improve on that front. I still have a lot of shit to sort out personally too that is way deeper than everything I've said so far.

I swear they all share a hive-mind, and it's specifically geared to reject me on certain days.

But today, one of the people in the group (who isn't even from our dorm, just happened to befriend people in the group) posted a series of throwback photos about college.

I’ve got friends, like I get people come sit with me in class or invite me out with them or even try to say hi to me when I walk by or even call me for hours.

The problem is I think I’m likeable but just only. I feel like, I’m in a crowded place and everyone is trying to talk and since I usually am the one that listens, people have just learnt to talk and never listen to me. 

Side effect my friends share meaningful moments of their lives with me and I’m excited / sad / anxious for them, basically I’m almost as invested in them as they are in themselves. But I feel like when I wanna talk they let me say a few words so it isn’t a one sided conversation but never quite listen. 

During this covid 2 month break I’ve had calls almost everyday with my friends. I taught myself how to code php and basic html(css/je/Jauery) I have built 2 websites already that I am proud of and I really wanna call someone and share this with them. I’ve sent the links to my sites with all my friends and only my ex really cared , she  actually uses one regularly to stream videos and makes fun of how rough it is which is good.

1769,jonyx66,1589324177,1,"I have been going through a rough time lately, I got broken up with and am hyper procrastinating with my studies, my routine is completely messed up. Before the relationship I would rarely express my feelings or dig into feelings of loneliness whenever they were around. I wasn't even aware at the time. 

All I would have to do to avoid this feeling of loneliness was to 1. hang out with people, whether it was friends, family, strangers, classmates.. I didn't care, I just didn't want to be alone. 2. Any other form of escape (mostly pornography)

When I was in the relationship these feelings of loneliness were gone, I never felt the slightest bit of loneliness. 

Sometimes I still fall back into the old mindset and keep trying to escape in some way or another, but at some point I just can't fucking take it anymore and think to myself: why not just accept the feeling and dive into it, although it's hard to do at times, you always feel better in the end. 

The more I escape, the less focused I am. When I feel lonely and have been trying to escape the feeling and finally try and accept it or talk about it, it's so fucking hard. My thoughts are like in a sea and they're all floating around vs. when I'm aware and have been doing well the past couple of days, I can follow my thoughts so much more consistently. It's like pen on paper while the other just feels like complete chaos.

I'm 27 now, those friends I thought I had weren't such good friends. I've watched them meet partners, get married, have children; and I'm happy for them -- truly, I am, but I'm left feeling discarded. And friendless.

The job I had, well, I was let go. It's been about 4 years of countless job applications and rejection letters, and ""we'll keep you on file, good luck or the future."" It gets to a person. Am I lacking in some magical skill that somehow makes me unemployable? All savings I had has been slowly drained, and I'm so thankful that my parents are loving and understanding of this. But, I just feel like I've failed them. Failed myself.

Relationships.. Ahh, that's a whole other mess. I'm shy and introverted, and I've had a string of shitty experiences, which makes it rather difficult to not be slightly guarded. Ok, very guarded. I've had one guy (other than my father) tell me I'm beautiful and that they love me; which is more than some people, I know. But sometimes intrusive dark thoughts sap any and all positivity from me, and I just feel like I'm more of a burden to them. I don't know what's wrong with me.

I gave up on love a while ago I'm 28 years old and I've just had unsuccessful relationship after unsuccessful relationship. I guess my flaw was I tried to see the good in people but it just went downhill, my last relationship had me at my lowest point. I found out the girl I was seeing was having an affair behind my back and when I confronted her about it she had lied to the police and said that I hit her and had me arrested, luckily for me the case was thrown out a year later due to lack of evidence but in that time frame I had lost my job due to the case and I fell into a deep depression that I thought alcohol could cure but it didn't. 

Fast forward 2 years to my current 28 year old self, I feel like I've just given up on finding a relationship, everyone keeps telling me to get back out there and not everyone It's going to do to me what my ex did but that fear still comes up because I really don't want to get burned again like that. I don't plan on becoming Meninist or MGTOW anytime soon but I did look at those groups at one point because I thought they were groups of guys who were talking about business ventures and new cars that they bought and awesome fishing trip stories etc, nope... Just a bunch of incels bitching about women. I don't know if I will find love again (though I doubt I will) or if I ever really want to, guess the best thing I can do for my life right now is just focus on me and focus on my future and career.

This is the end of the quarantine in France. I'm happy but as a college student, I'm still stuck at home and the exams take place online, and to be honest, during this quarantine I took solace in the fact we were all stuck inside together. Like, what they called quarantine has always been my life routine (because I don't have a lot of friends and I have nowhere to go, so I spend most of my time alone). But now the people are free and they're blissful af, they can gather, go have a drink, go out again, all the things I never do (because I don't have many friends to hang out with and my life is boring af, it's just being stuck at home all the time and wandering in the streets of my hometown once a day to take a breath). So now people are happy to get back to ""normal life"" but for me it's still quarantine and it has always been quarantine even before the Corona :D So I don't know how to feel, tbh, the summer is always hard for me because I don't go on holiday, I have no one to hang out with and nothing to do (no school) and I'm thinking of the gangs of friends out there who are enjoying the sun, the beach, the parties together, and I can't help but think of all the things I miss while I'm home alone :D It's like : I'm home alone and can't go out because of all the reasons I explained, but I feel happy because I know everyone else is stuck home too so we're all in the same boat and there are not people out there who are having the time of their life in the sun with their friends :D",lonely,End of the lockdown in France : strange feeling,2020-05-13 04:53:03

1799,Riverside63,1589298962,1,"*So it goes like this, sorry I am 66 and a good guy and always been on the other side of that saying, """" TREAT PEOPLE NICE AND YOU WILL BE BETTER FOR IT """".  Well I have been alone for most of my life but nobody really knows me ? Maybe I don't even truly know myself. But life went on and you got to keep trying and survive. Especially when your doing it on your own and as time has passed your even more alone in the crowd looking mostly and talking well maybe superficially . Doesn't mean your weird or not normal or anything like that , your social, smart in some ways, intelligent in others, have a lot of interests, and love beautiful women for themselves as individuals. Careers have come and gone, had several opportunities relationship wise and had a few but ended up alone as always. So I am not perfect but never really went off the deep end with addictions or rebellion. Remember I grew up in a time when there were attempts by younger folks to change the world, music/ sex/ drugs/ rock &amp; roll( the Beatles) / so I am not an innocent but kept control for the most part. Lonely was always there? big city crowds, schooling , concerts, sports, made acquaintances but very few friends, had rejections like most but took it in stride. History of me is just that lonely and following life into more lonely. Now still trying to have a life of happiness but realizing  the things I have missed or how all the beautiful women are so young and all the older women are trying to make up for lives they feel they have missed out on while they were living the lives they had. Some I understand raising families and then remembering you were once a person with visions not commitments.  I have a good grasp on the world but the vision well it has changed, and the loneliness remains in every aspect of my life, I drifted into a career to see more but now believe it isn't about where you are because many  lives are being lived for all the same reasons all over the world and mainly , Canada &amp; USA, where I have seen head on big city/ small town/ wealthy &amp; poor&amp; in between. Seems all the toys and material doesn't really make for happiness in the heart and mind of many. Maybe on the outside but on the inside there is a big hole wanting to be filled. My loneliness grows on me now, I see beauty and yearn so bad but expressing it well would probably get me laughed at or pity even worse. Old men cannot express admiration of young beauty or be considered pigs or pervs. This life doesn't seem to change for me, sites like this show so much ? but what is the reality? everyone has a long list of perceived attributes that their happiness requires? where is the love and learning of life with a soulmate? Maybe I am wrong or just have a mental problem who is to say?  I am in one of those lower class jobs that permits me to travel across our countries right now and life has changed, and maybe is never going to be the same, and maybe is a kick in the butt to say we were not heading our society and lives down a good path?  But my life and my loneliness goes on and grows as I try to find someone to share a vision with. I have been alone so long I cannot open up or find a solution without seeing just more of the same, I hear of extreme things happening and kind of understand why. Faced with the future the result of actions is no longer a deterrent. Making up for a life lost isn't going to happen and the alternatives of continued loneliness they depress any positive motivations I think exist. Knowing what is real is becoming a problem. Just so tired of being nothing .*

1812,hamartiated,1589291558,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-05-12 23:52:38

Im not that picky but just like everyone i do have some nono's and some yesyes's/ things about me ill list them here so people know what i look for haha

I can be ""flirty"" im not saying its like my full personality, but if i click really well with someone ill sometimes ""flirt"" because i just feel very comfy around the person and i open up, so if your okay with that we can chat, its not really flirting but its easier to just call it that instead of explaining

I dont like people who keep bringing up nsfw stuff, i have had this friend who all of a sudden started talking about how he met this girl and they did a voice call and it turned nsfw, thats something i dont need to know 

Im sensitive, emotionally mentally psychically, i like dark jokes just not when im like seriously talking about something bad that happened

I love people who are just so understanding, because i always try to be understanding, im an open book with some things, if your willing to listen to me i wont mind listening to you aswell

I have some serious mental issues, so if i seem distant or upset im probably just thinking about stuff, and ill be fine later on

I love talking, i talk too much, but i dont really do voice calls because i have major anxiety but ofcourse like everything you can build that up, so if im really comfy with you i can try to voice call with you

I dont need someone telling me ""not everyone is like that"" when i talk about something, if i open up please be respectful and dont just go ""it will be okay"" or ""im not like that"" thats not what anyone deserves to get after opening up

I also would like to talk to only 17+ also preferably someone thats a woman or non-binary but then again im pan i dont mind. Im just a bit more scared around cis males because of some things in my past

I have discord, shoot me a message if you wanna talk, you can tell me something about yourself and tell me your discord and ill add you on discord and we can start a lovely friendship, cant wait to get messages ill reply to every single one (as long as you dont have pics exposing yourself nsfw wise)

1819,good_-username,1589281080,1,"So my situation is kinda weird.
I'm a really introvert and shy person, probably like most of the people on this sub.
Since I am very used to what loneliness feels like, I try my best to befriend people who seems lonely too.
You know, like those considered to be the weird guys of the class, those with a passion for anime or underground music and stuff like that.

I'd like to consider myself as someone who really cares about a friend. I'd literally do anything I can to help someone I consider special.

So, every time, I successfully become ""friend"" with the person I wanted to. We joke and mess around for quite a few time. I always get kinda attached to them, and I'm really, really happy when I see that person know other people, opening up with them. They eventually become part of a group. I'm never part of any of those groups, because the popular guys always ignore me.

It's a win for them, but a loss for me. They've got more friends than before, but all of a sudden they act like they don't know me. They'll completely ignore me, except during those times when we are forced to talk, like during work projects.

I'm getting slowly killed by these situations.

I've got nobody to talk to, nobody to tell my thoughts to. Nobody I can send a random picture of what I'm doing without feeling judged, nobody I can ask to hang out, nobody who cares.

I'm not even begging for friends. I don't ever really care anymore. If everything keeps happening the same way, then there mustn't be something wrong with people. I'm probably the one who sucks.

I'm boring, I haven't got popular hobbies, I'm the least fun person I know, I'm really bad at talking and expressing my thoughts.
Tbh I can't blame my ex-friends for ignoring me.
Hell, I wouldn't be friend with myself too, if I were another person.

Today, she decides to text me for whatever reason and says we should phone call. We start catching up about life and in this point of my life, I feel incredibly lonely. I’ve distanced myself from most friends and when it came to social distancing guidelines and not going out, it didn’t affect me much. 

Anyways, she’s asking me about what’s been going on in my life and it’s a normal conversation. But then she says something very odd. I was talking about how I’ve been doing, trying to learn new things and she cuts me off, hasn’t responded to anything I said up to this point and says, “ugh, this shirt doesn’t smell like him anymore and I’m sad, it’s all fine, but continue”.

Like two days ago, she posted on her private account how this guy gave her a shirt and she liked how much it smelled like him.

Then it happened again. I think this time we were talking about politics and the virus and she interrupts me again and says, “ugh, I forgot to mark that I had sex today in my calendar, I hate when I forget that to mark it!”.

First of all, who even does that lol. And again, she’s just saying this to get a rise out of me. I’ve told her how frustrated I am when it comes to dating and making friends and all she wants to do is basically passively aggressively by interrupting me try and make fun of me for it.

It probably doesn’t sound that bad but her ghosting made me second guess myself so much it made me think people were gonna leave me at any time and it really effected my mental health. I think the reason I felt so hurt was because she left me when I was going through such a hard time of course it’s not her responsibility or her fault at the time for what I was experiencing however she could of dealt with thing in a way that weren’t so hurtful to me.

I just want that person that I can do absolutely anything and everything with. I want to tell them everything about me, and I want to hear everything about them. I want to know their deepest and darkest secrets and I want to share mine. I want to do things that I couldn’t do with anyone else but that person. But, I haven’t found that person. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m too young for Tinder, I can’t drive due to epilepsy, I’ve been enrolled in online school for over a year, and working takes up a fair amount of my time. How can I go about socializing and finding that person to really be everything I am with?",lonely,17M with a loneliness problem.,2020-05-12 09:25:23

So I’m feeling really lonely lately (like obviously a lot of you) and I’m missing a friend in my life I can talk to, have random conversations with, support each other and so on. Someone that has your back and the other way around of course. 
I’m a friendly open guy, currently living in Germany. My interests are technical stuff but also art and music, gaming. I’m always open for any other interests though. Love to talk and to learn about something new. 

What I’m dealing with lately is depression and anxieties I can’t control anymore. I think that quarantine and isolation made me weak so all that stuff that bothered me years ago came out again. This might one reason why I feel even more lonely. I’m always afraid to annoy people with my stuff. However that makes it easier for me to listen and handle concerns of others.

If you like to talk to me and get to know me more I would be super happy if you contact me. Everyone is welcome (LGBTQ) (I’m bisexual myself)

Sorry this is a bit of a rant...

So I'm a student studying in the UK but I live abroad. ""Lucky me"", because of lockdown, I have had so many problems regarding my trip back that I've lost a lot of money and never actually got home. In the end though, I stopped trying because my friend Paul (not his real name) was all on his own living in his uni accommodation, and told me he could really use some company (he has had severe depression and I worry about him). He's english and doesn't live far but he won't go home because of family problems. He told me he would be staying there all summer and that he'd possibly go and see his gf, Lucy (who's also a friend of mine and my housemate) for 4-5days max if lockdown was to loosen up a little.

Anyways so over a month ago I moved into his flat and it's been good, we've kept each other company and all that. Except this morning, Lucy sent me a message telling me how Paul was going to stay with her and her family now for about two months or so, meaning that I'm gonna be alone. I genuinely don't know how I could cope spending that much time on my own so I'm going to try and go home once again at the end of May if I'm allowed. 

It's stupid because a lot of people are in much worse situations than I am and maybe my reaction to all this is a bit childish, I don't know. It's just that I'm so frustrated because I'd do anything to be home right now and see my parents I haven't seen since last summer but I purposely came back to stay with him to make sure he had company and now I've just been left behind really. I have such a hard time being on my own, even when it's just for a week or so, I get in such a dark place that I don't how how I'm going to manage...",lonely,alone during lockdown,2020-05-12 05:30:37

My boyfriend isn’t the best either. He makes a lot of excuses not to call me or text me and then the one time he did call me, I was in the bathroom and missed it. I asked him to call me back and he said “In 20 minutes” and then an hour and a half later, he just says “oh my phone won’t let me call you” or some bullshit excuse (and I know it’s bs cause it’s every single time I ask).

1903,tttttthrouuawayyyyyy,1589210481,15,"19M here! As the title says, I just lost a friend this morning and I'm completely heart broken. We both met online around 6 months ago, shared numbers and became really good friends! I don't have any other friends, he was my only friend till today and he was my best friend! Today he messaged me saying that he's staying away from social media to focus on his career and he's not gonna be able to talk to me for an entire year until he finishes his studies. I respected his choice, told him that I'll support him always and wished him luck and success and said goodbye. Although I'm really happy for him, I still feel really bad and heartbroken that I lost a friend. My friend meter went from 1️⃣ to 0️⃣. Now I'm lonely and have absolutely nobody to talk to, so I made this new account on reddit in hope of finding new friends! Now I'm not trying to find a replacement (he is irreplaceable), I'm also not here looking for sympathy, I'm just trying to talk to new people and make new friends, and I know you're a great person, so LET'S BE FRIENDS!!

About myself : I'm really scared to make new friends, the main reason is that they'll leave me. I've had friends who have engaged me in conversation for an entire day and vanished the next day. I mean, being friends for one day... Is it even a thing? I really don't know, please educate me if it is. Now, the thing is, when I become friends with somebody, I start to really like them (not in a creepy way) and I form a special kind of ""friendship bond"" with them, and if they break that bond all of a sudden and leave me, it's gonna really hurt, so I'm trying to look for a friend who won't ghost me after a day or a week.

Now I would really like to be honest with you all, so I'll tell you this beforehand just if that's something you'd want to know about me before being my friend. I'm suffering from depression, so I'm not really an expert in having great conversations. I'm sure I'll be really awkward at first, but I promise to try my best and make my best attempts in having a decent conversation. I might not make you laugh, I might be a little awkward, but I'll be the most loyal person in your life! (Second most loyal if you have a pet in your life already). Once we're friends, I'm always going to be there for you no matter what and I'm never going to leave you! I mean, unless you push me and run away of course (oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I sometimes make bad jokes).

So I've said everything about me, now I'm looking to find new people and make new friends! Now I've heard from many people in this subreddit that I would get more friends if I was a girl, but I'm not, so I might get less responses, but I'm still going to try! No matter who you are, from which country you are, male or female, please DM me without thinking twice! Who knows, we might become really great friends! I love you and I want to be friends with you!

If you read this till the end (or even if you didn't) -- HAVE A NICE DAY !! YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL PERSON !!",lonely,19M - I just lost my best friend (and my only friend). I'm now extremely lonely and depressed. Looking to find new people and make new friends!,2020-05-12 01:21:21

1934,CozyMelon9,1589176426,1,"I’m a , and I’m kind of new to reddit so I’m sorry if I mess some things up. At the start of quarantine, I was doing just fine with my friends and talked with them all the time. My friend group all spoke in this group chat on Discord where we would send memes, jokes, or just have a conversation. But all of a sudden about two weeks ago, I went to go send a meme into the group chat and found out I was banned. I asked my friend who I’ll call A (for privacy reasons) what was up and he didn’t respond. I then called up my closest friend who I’ll call B to ask A if we could meet up at the intersection where all of us live (there aren’t any cars normally, and we stayed 6 ft apart) so I could speak with them and they agreed but canceled the literal second I stepped foot at the meeting place. I then asked if we could just postpone to the next day instead of cancel. They agreed but then cancelled again. This process repeated itself for an entire week. Eventually I confronted A and B to ask if they even cared to which they didn’t respond. I then confronted my friends C, D, E, F, G, H, and I (who were the rest of the group) and asked if they knew what was going on. They didn’t respond. I then tested to see if my signal was good enough to write people, and it was. Because of this my anxiety and stress all of a sudden started to topple over on me and my mind filled with questions about my friends. Questions asking if they care, is this a prank, am I too much of a doormat, and if they’re really my friends. I don’t remember much of what happened after that and it all feels like a big blur. I then went to confront all the friends individually in their own respective pms, letting them know I was tired of them ghosting me and not contributing anything to the friendship. It eventually ended in me pulling the plug that is my entire social life. 

That night (last night) I had an amazing dream about the quarantine not existing and I had at least one really amazing friend. It was probably the happiest I have ever felt since I was a toddler. But when I realized it was a dream, I immediately made myself wake up. Once I did however, it hurt excruciatingly bad thinking that what I had dreamt about was ONLY a dream and nothing else.

It hurts really bad to not have a way to make friends in quarantine. My parents keep an extremely close eye on me to make sure that I don’t encounter any online friends because of the risk of online predators. So because of this I can’t make friends online or in real life because of quarantine and my parents. I do use VrChat, but I’m a mute there because I’m self conscious of my voice so that doesn’t help.

I am moving in two months though to a gated neighborhood in Florida and I REALLY hope that I can make at least one friend while I’m in quarantine there.

I am stuck and not even sure I want out because of the ""comforts"" around me. I'm generally an introvert so the covid isn't too taxing.

I try to serve...I try to lift...I try to coach. My entire life I bottle emotions, take on others pain as my own through empathy and sympathy combined... it's draining physically and emotionally. 

Maybe I'm doing this because I just needed to type it out for someone to ""hear""... maybe I'm secretly hoping there is a magic action. I don't want to ""lay this"" on any if my 3-ish friends because it's a heavy burden... so I post to a random internet group.

I've been feeling depressed for the past couple years (actually more than that, but it was really bad since about 3 years ago). I find it harder and harder to make friends, and easier and easier to lose the ""friends"" I did have. So basically, I'm all alone except for my long-distance girlfriend who doesn't text/call me that much either.

I reflect back on my life **a lot** to try to figure out why all these people I've met, didn't want me in their life. Why they wouldn't invite me anywhere, why they would awkwardly brush me off if I ever tried asking them to hang out, like ""Oh sorry DFR2, I'm busy..."" etc. It really fucking sucks, and I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. 

I thought I was autistic, but I don't think I am. I do have a tentative diagnosis of inattentive ADHD, but lots of people with ADHD have close friends.

This has lead me to being depressed/suicidal since I was 15 and I knew about 4 months ago if something didn't change I would kill myself sooner rather than later. So I got up and started doing shit got my license, started working out, tried to get confidence to be more extroverted and got my resume ready for some jobs in my local mall

Literally two weeks into me going to the gym and 2 days before going to the mall to apply for jobs lockdown began. Now I can't go the gym, socialize with anyone in person, or apply for a job. I feel so angry but depressed now, like SERIOUSLY THIS COULDN'T O F HAPPENED ANY POINT IN THE FIRST 18 YEARS OF MY LIFE!?!?!!? NOOOOOOO IT HAD TO HAPPEN WHEN MY LIFE FINALLY STARTED LOOKING HAPPY.

If you are new to gaming or are not interested by it, *please* give it a chance as it has great powers to connect people. Think of it as simply the application process to friends.

 - 1) Pick an online game that seems interesting to you. One that you wouldn't normally consider playing. 

 - 2) Join a discord server (official, or a guild/clan, etc) for this game. 

 - 3) Join a channel and say hi, you're new and are trying to find a good guild/gaming group.

 - 4) Go back in every day or two, repeat steps 1-3 if you want to re-roll your potential friends! 

 - 5) You have a group of friends now!

The types of people you will find will vary greatly by type of game you play. Twitch has tons of streamers playing games with low viewer numbers that will interact with you if you type in chat. Streaming platforms have games of all types and the streamers of each will give you a rough idea of what the player base is like. I suggest avoiding more competitive games with higher rates of toxicity, as you might have a rough time.

Sometimes having the right questions to ask people will point you in the right direction, but just asking to join a guild or group for community and chill casual play can land you with a really nice group of people! 

I am extroverted but often have felt not included in my life, as people have friends they hang out with every day. I've never had this for very long, but I see it everywhere and often I don't get why I don't have that. Through gaming I can choose who I talk to and meet, and once you get past just asking questions you will realise it's so simple to find people! Good luck out there, and don't forget that there are tons of groups looking for more people to join them!",lonely,Steps for isolated people looking for friends.,2020-05-11 07:39:36

After much struggle, the Halloween decoration infographic helped me tie the noose and attach it to the ceiling. I put my neck into the noose for the first time. 

I felt very scared, as the chair was not very sturdy; I felt like it could break with any slight movement. I tried to talk myself into kicking the chair, but I am still just much too scared. Things appear to be moving in the right direction, at least. I think I will keep putting my neck into the noose, until I become more comfortable with taking the last step.

Hey everyone, so I’ve dealt with feeling a bit lonely for a long time now, but I think it’s gotten worse since getting married and having a baby. I love my husband and we’ve been together for almost 10 years, but the longer we’ve been together, the less and less he ever wants to try and get out and do anything, and when I try to go out alone to meet up with girls, I can tell he isn’t exactly thrilled. He used to have so many fiends before he met me (and I used to have them before I met him) and now it’s just us, and he tells me that’s all he wants, he’s content that way. I don’t know if I am though...

We live in a city where everyone knows everyone, and even if you don’t know them, you know someone who does. Here there’s  this crowd of kids all our age that all know each other and run together. They all seem to have fun, go to the same events, support the same local business, they’re just this big group of hipsters. There’s probably about 50 of them. Some of them have kids too. My husband used to be around until his crowd weather he realized it or not. I’ve always wanted to be friends with some of these people and get out more and do more (even if it’s as a family all together,) but my husband has NO interest in it. He says me and our baby are all he needs and he’s content in life. He just seems so bitter about the idea of letting other people than family in our lives. On top of it, the hobbies he does have are very polarizing and there really isn’t much of a crowd there to hang with. 

I think what this really stems from is my wanting friends again, I’m almost 30 and I haven’t had any REAL friends (aside of my husband) since high school. My husband takes it personally and thinks that I just don’t want to be around him or that he isn’t a good enough friend. I understand that if that’s not what he’s looking for, that’s okay, but it hurts me and makes me feel pretty aimless outside of work and home. My life feels very one dimensional. My only real outlet is social media to feel like I’m close to all these people even though, at the end of the day, we all know I’m not.

I DEFINITELY don’t think he’s purposefully trying to control me or be rude or emotionally or mentally abusive or even controlling. I choose not to pursue real life friendships with me people not because he makes me say no, but because I chose to respect his opinion and at the end of the day, he’s who I love. I know it all stems of his lack of self esteem and views he has of himself. I just don’t know what’s left for me in life then if I live this way...",lonely,Where do I go from here...?,2020-05-11 06:44:54

Today’s Mother’s Day and I’m done faking relationships and ab to likely be done with this life where I was gifted with being too aware for my own good. (Wish I didn’t have a conscious) my parents divorced when I was 6 and I have a sister who’s 10 years older. Based on what I’ve heard I was basically a baby to try and save the marriage. After this my parents traded me every week until ab 7, I stopped going to my moms for whatever reason and she only brought me food for an occasional like lunch maybe twice a month, growing up in a well off community as my dad was able to keep us here was fine and all but I quickly noticed other parents being involved with their kids and mine weren’t. My father works all the time and growing up until this current day the answer I got when I wanted to do something is he doesn’t have time. Mom came around whenever she wanted and when I would ask to spend the night or come to her house I was always given an excuse every time. I’m now 20 and recognize what happened and I now suffer with depression and I can’t seem to get the thought into my head that I’m allowed to be loved.

Some days I'll watch a beautiful film, or read poetry, or listen to certain music, and be overcome with a feeling of being in love, but with no one in particular. Saudade, I think. Yearning and nostalgia for someone that doesn't exist, but happiness for being able to feel that way. Then it hits me that I have no one to give my love to anyway. I have no one to spend my life with. 

Seeking love is hard in real life. I don't want to look for love (Tinder etc.) because I'm desperate and tired of feeling lonely. It just feels insincere, it's not who I am. It's not a realistic perspective to take, because I know love starts more ordinarily, and happens when you are more proactive about it, but I still wait and daydream about great love and romance in my life. 

I want a beautiful, organic love story. It's too bad that I'm now a little too old to keep believing in that.

It's not hard to see why especially in these trying times. This film captures the beauty of a life once lived. Being able to witness New York basking in all its Autumn glory. The choice to wile away the day with a latte in a café, to wander in a book store or just to browse the supermarket aisle without any sense of urgency. 

But what's most heartbreaking for me today is watching two people fall in love. Why? I am a romantic at heart. I LOVE love stories and my favourite part of these tales is always how someone connects with another person. How they see beyond this meeting as a chance encounter but a opportunity to unravel this whole person's existence, to build on that connection.

I think this is it and it's right there in this film as well.  No matter how much you try, how much you try to forge a connection, it is an act which is hard to mimic and conjure. We are offered all these means of staying connected, ways to hold on to this semblance of a human connection. Through these methods, it should be easier than ever to stay connected but here I am feeling more alone. But what really saddens me is I could use this pandemic as an excuse but I know I can't.

We met, hung out for just shy of an hour, which is incredibly short for a date in my experience... we hugged when we met and when we parted, he asked if he could talk to me later, I agreed, and I ended up messaging him first saying it was great to meet. He responded that it was good to finally meet and then poof. Gone. I haven't heard from him since.

I dated a guy back then, he was my first 'serious' relationship and he immediately pressured me into having sex. I was young, I was naive. I know I was at fault as well because I said yes but I just wish he didn't mock me 'you just have no guts to do it, right?' and just leave it when I refused the first time.

I ended up pregnant. I was 19 and decided I couldn't keep the baby. I dropped out of college and moved out to another city. I was still talking to him because I felt so depressed and lonely, while he cheated on me with a lot of girls. He even dated two of them for more than a year and I didn't know before they told me. At the end he left me to marry someone else because he wants a partner that could support him financially as well.

This guy changed my life. I kinda regret my decision to be with him because it drove me away from the life I used to have. I lost my friends, I lost my youth. Now people are knowing me as ""emotionally detached, cold, robotic"" person. I used to be so warm and funny and it hurts.

It constantly distracts me. I can't even focus while meditating. Had to cancel after 3 minutes. Yesterday I performed badly in an important game due to brain fog and tilt, where one likely caused the other or something. This constant anxiety annoys me. I constantly have it in social situations because I actively think what I'll do in them. Likely don't have enough social exposure. And then this constant need in my mind to look to our neighbors window. Why? Idk to be honest. One motivator is probably the feeling that I'm being watched from every angle in every situation with many people/windows. Another is the loneliness again. Seems difficult in my current position to deal with it by 'finding friends' (easier said than done). I think I've read somewhere that you can basically keep loneliness at a minimum and can also completely eliminate it, because you have yourself, you are your own best friend and you should learn to love yourself. And along the way of doing so, other people ill come naturally. I should probably begin by starting meditation practices again, and then by focusing more on productivity in school/university, and spending fewer hours a day on YouTube and other platforms.

Hello reddit. My name is Adam and I’m 18yo guy. I would like to share with you my latest feelings from my life. I was never a confident or talkative kid. I was very shy. We were moving with my family from town to town very often, like 6 times. Now I live in small village (around 200 people) close to the state borders with oder country. There is a really big state minority, so they speak different language as I and most of the time they don’t speak mine language. It’s like if you are American and you are living in china town, I don’t understand shit and mostly they also don’t understand. I don’t have any friends. I have only classmates who are not really my friends. I think friend is someone you can talk to when you are down, they call you to go out and have fun, they help you, etc. I never ever had a real friend. Just forced kids to be my friends from my mothers friends. I had 3 GFs but all of them was for only a week or 2. When I asked them why they broke up with me, they just always said that they didn’t feel the same as I. And now I feel like lost in my own life l without real friends. I don’t know what to do with my free time alone. I would like to have a real girlfriend that would love me and I would like to go with her to the cinema for example. I would like to have friends that would care about me and go out with me to have fun. I’m really sad and I don’t know what to do, what to change to have real friends and fun in my life.

2025,insane_taco,1589094720,1,"So the other day I realized something kinda depressing. The thing that I want the most~ I’ll probably never get. I just want to feel like someone chose me for once... that they chose me because they wanted to, not because the alternative was worse. 

This year I just wanted to celebrate with some friends for a one year anniversary. (Not romantic, it just marked an important time in my life .)That’s all I wanted. Just my friends and I- then me in my room- listening to music. However, I don’t know if someone else can relate, I got a feeling in my gut. The feeling that tells you it’s not going to happen. It didn’t, due to the pandemic. It bummed me out. It’s like.... every option I could do to make myself feel less lonely gets taken away by life. I know that the pandemic sucks for a lot of people... but I still feel bad about this day being taken away from me. It was supposed to replace a bunch of birthdays full of heartache. This day was supposed to serve as my “first birthday.” The first day I truly lived....

Anyways, I’m very grateful that I have true friends. I know I am. Sometimes I feel as though these friends are closer to each other than they are with me. I can’t really blame them~ and I know they care for me to an extent. Moments like these, at night, I remember a specific pair of old ones. They meant the world to me. But life separated us. The circumstances weren’t too tragic... it was just a painful misunderstanding. But it cost us a decade long friendship. I tried my best to continue our friendship, to tell them that change is good especially when finding yourself... but I was too much of a coward to say that. I still tried to be their friend... but we never got closure. We never even talked about it. We just stopped talking in general. It was like a switch was flipped after I found out about how they truly felt and one day was all it took. One day to be a complete stranger...

Then there’s my family. I’m pretty sure my father is narcissistic. He’s an asshole. Always belittling - always guilt tripping- always playing the victim- and always gaslighting. My extended family is not bad... but they’ll never stick up for me against him. They have that “older is wiser” mentality.  Sometimes I feel as though my extended family doesn’t like me like they like the other people in my family in my age group. They talk to them and ask about their days and hug them. With me the vibe is different. The room goes silent when I walk in. The air is tense. I think it’s due to my nature. I’m not very emotionally expressive or affectionate... but how can I be in a family like this? I’m always treated different and blamed for things. Not just by them... but by my father no less... a father who says he never wanted me and that I ruined his life because he had to look after me. I would have preferred he didn’t. I wish he had left. As far as I’m concerned I never want to see him again. He’s so different with my younger brother.  Right now I’m struggling with my feelings. This is because an extended family member is going through a veryyy rough time. I know that they deserve all the support they’re getting. I support them too . The thing that makes me feel sad is that I’ve been struggling for quite awhile to just get out of bed or with my father and I don’t get any support. Our situations are vastly different... I most likely don’t hurt nearly as much as they do, but I still hurt a great deal. Sometimes I feel selfish for feeling sad about them having a support system. But I know that I’m not selfish. I just want to feel loved too.

My mom ... she’s the best woman alive (imo, don’t kill me redditors). She’s obviously not perfect but she tries to stick up for me and she tries her best to be a good mother. For that I really appreciate her. However... it does hurt that she chose my father over me. We had the chance to leave. And we did... but life brought us back to him. And then we stayed. Not because of me but because of her. Sometimes I feel that she doesn’t quite take me seriously when I speak. But I know that she means well and tries to listen when she’s not tired from working. But I stand by my position. She’s all I have. I know she does love me. My mother is my world. Aside from her I guess I truly am alone. 

I have a younger brother, but he doesn’t exactly understand me. I get unfairly frustrated by him sometimes... and this cause my family to dislike me. I don’t mean to hurt his feelings. I genuinely apologize. When they hurt his feelings it’s forgiven because they didn’t “mean it”. Even if they provoked my brother to act the way he did~ they “didn’t mean it”, so it’s forgiven if they “accidentally” hurt his feelings. If I make a mistake like that and say something to hurt his feelings... that’s unacceptable. I’m told that I’m the worst. I don’t blame my brother though. Half the time it’s not his fault and it’s just me being an ass, I’ll admit it, I’m not proud of it. The other half it may be understandable as to why I hurt his feelings on accident (like frustration at him for calling me an asshole out of nowhere and then laughing), but I don’t blame him since my brother is young and doesn’t quite know why I’m upset. 

 I also have a dog, and I adore that dog. I think he likes my mom more... but I don’t really care, in a good way. Because I know that my dog does genuinely appreciate me. I want to be better for him and my brother. I want my brother to have a role model. But sometimes... I feel as though history is doomed to repeat itself and that I’ll turn into my father. The way my father treats my brother... he has stated multiple times that I’m the odd one out. He wanted my brother, not me. It makes me feel like shit. He’s also an asshole to my brother though. He puts him against me and then pretends to care about him for five seconds when we get out of an argument that he (my father) caused. I want my brother to know what it feels to have a male role model that truly loves him. I’m just sad that I may not be that model. Even if I am... who do I have to serve as that male model for me? No one. I want to be this person for him... but I can barely get out of my miserable hole of a bed. My dog is well taken care of... but I want to care for him more. I want to be the best for them... but I fear that isolation is making me numb and without motivation to do anything. Atletas my extended family loved my brother- he is the youngest. At least he doesn’t have to deal with being looked at differently from them.

I also have this rare enough medical condition that prevents me from doing exercise until I get a certain surgery. It’s made me sad that my friends can join cool club sports teams or just go for a run whenever they feel like it... and that Im stuck watching until I get that surgery. The pandemic has pushed this date back to another year. I feel left out. I’m never going to get my youth back. I’ve been like this for about 3 years now. It sucks to see that my family in my age group can get fit and appreciate themselves, while I’m stuck, frustrated that life has given me these cards and called lazy despite having a medical condition. 

I don’t know. I guess I’m just sad and lonely. I want to live my life. I just want anyone to know that I stare at the sky at night and think about life as an adult. I think about moving to Japan for a bit and maybe permanently- South Korea too. China is also on my list but I fear the police there, and I don’t want to risk it. No offense. Japan makes this all worth it. I also stare at the sky at night and wonder if anyone else is looking and feels as lonely as I do. If you do- know that I feel the same way- and that we’re trying. One day this will all be worth it. 

For me maybe I don’t get someone to prioritize me for once... but maybe I’ll make peace with it. Maybe I’ll find something better like inner happiness. I don’t know if I’m being contradictory here, because I’m inclined to believe in the worst and hope for the best. Just please know- one day things will change. 

Im sorry if this post was long- but I feel like quarantine is driving me insane, and I just wanted to let it out somewhere. If this isn’t appropriate for this sub, please redirect me to where I can post this. 

TLDR; I feel lonely because no one has ever truly prioritized me. Father’s narcissistic and hates me, extended family doesn’t like me much, feel kinda left out of my friend group, old best friends decided I wasn’t worth it, my mom chose my father over me but I know she loves me, and I have a rare medical condition that prevents me from enjoying even a simple run in life- and prevents me from joining sports teams. This makes me feel like I’ll never truly experience what it’s like to be young.  ;_)",lonely,Don’t know if anyone will see this but...why is life so difficult?,2020-05-10 17:12:00

2027,g33rtu,1589094209,1,"Hi,

A few months ago I read some posts on this channel, just to prove to myself I am not alone in feeling very lonely. I was stupid enough to believe that someone elses misery would make me feel better. The fact is, it doesn't. 

so, Somewhere round september 2018, at the age of 36, I fell in love for very first time in my life. Since then, my life will never be what is was before.

She was one of my colleagues. Whn she got a job at the company I worked for at the time, I worked there for over 9 years. She was without any doubt the best we had in years. She was motivated, helpfull , brought ambiance in our lab, and she smiled all the time.

The feelings weren't mutual.I had to watch all day, the only thing in life that could make me happy, but for her life is just going on, telling stories about tinderfailures or that she's despereate that she's not going to find someone ...

A few months later I asked her if she could adapt her behavior about the subject she's talking about when I'm around, because it still hurts like hell. I even cried when I asked her. The next day I was invited to have a chat with my two bosses.They told me I crossed a line, apparently you can't ask someone to adapt their behaviour.

Best part is, that my bosses did this without her asking for it. They did it because ""she was not able to do her job anymore that day after I asked her"" . They told me, that if it happened again, I would be sanctioned. 

2 months later I left my job, 4 of my colleagues cried because I left, and as far as I remember none of my colleagues agreed with how my two bosses handled the situation.

Since I left my job, I didn't receive any unenploymentbenefits for 3 months. I followed a course that would make me a web developer in 7 months. the course is a disaster, luckily I already a lot of background-knowledge in web-development .

Nothing has changed for me in the last 1,5 year. I talked to 3 shrinks, took 2 types of antidepressants. So far, all of them without success. since December 11 2018 there haven't been 10 days without tears.

On my last day at my job I left a letter on her desk. An ex-colleague told me she read it out loud to other colleagues . Not that I am ashamed of what I wrote to her, I wrote the truth.

In a few months I will be 38 . I will never find someone, simply because I don't believe I will, it took me 20 years longer than a ""normal"" person to fall in love and now people tell me, ""that's how love is, it can happen again tomorrow"".

Off all the people I talked to, I never had the idea that one of them understands what i'm feeling. It's like they think that ""20 years of waiting"" is not important in this story.

In order to find new love, I have to forget her but I simply can't. How can I forget the only person in my life that I truly love. I would do almost anything for her. Most of my friends ignore me now, they thought I would already have ""accepted"" the reality.  

And even if I ever fall in love again, which is impossible I think, then what? Who wants a virgin that almost 40?

So, I'm lonely, and I probably will be for the rest of my life because I can't get her out of mind. I miss her smile, her voice, the scent of her perfume,.... There is no one who loves her more than me.",lonely,I am a failure that will never find love,2020-05-10 17:03:29

First choice would be South Korea, if not maybe Thailand or Indonesia. Japan's out of my budget. Just really want to start over really and take a break from school. At the moment the only major thing holding me back is money. It's like, I'm alone where I am now. So what difference does it make whether I'm here or someplace new?

2037,pulptension,1589088522,1,"I’m a 23 y/o female. I was raised solely by my mother. No contact with my father at all really. He never cared and my mother didn’t have any friends as she is extremely religious and would do nothing but continuously go to church. She is beyond a zealot so much so that people would never get to know her mainly because she does not know herself. She believed in spiritual warfare and would often wake me up in the middle of the night because she believed she “sensed” something. usually  she thought she “sensed” I was doing something she would disapprove of in my daily life and would drill me about it and punish me either physically or mentally. I am and never have been like her. I love to read Whitman, Poe, Xenophon, Dos Passos, etc. she would often throw my books away if they were not christian based. I am a musician by trade, I engineer and produce my own music but I’m also EXTREMELY logical and left brain... also I’m genuinely a Taoist. My entire life people have ignored me and discarded me because I’m really different and somehow they could feel the PTSD on me before I even knew I had it... I would be extremely subservient and have a really hard time standing up for myself although I have very string opinions. When I was in middle school I came out to my mom as a lesbian. She beat me and grounded me for 4 months. Really I was grounded forever since the day I came out. I had to hide who I was so much but it only made me more sure of who I was. I had to figure it all out privately and quietly. No one ever asked if I was ok at home. I was quite popular but people just thought I had a chip on my shoulder, in truth I remained distant from others on a personal level to protect myself and I wouldn’t hang out after school because I wasn’t allowed to. I never even acted superior but kids assumed because I didn’t engage much. The social mystery around me and my string presence and knowledge on the rare occasion I did express my thoughts as well as being known as very artistic and involved in school activities made me popular but a complete mystery. So people liked me because they DIDN’T know me and that killed me so much. It hurt that no one ever cared or wanted to care. Meanwhile at home my mom would ransack my room, I wasn’t allowed to have friends, she would accuse me of doing all sorts of things she was afraid I was doing and I actually wasn’t AT ALL. I was treated like a criminal in my own home my entire life and worse she would go to large churches seeking positions of power and use me her “gay” daughter as a way to gain sympathy and ultimately turn people against me. Because I was a child they believed her and never talked to me about any of it and I would always wonder why leadership looked at me the way they did. There’s more she’s done and it gets so much deeper and worse but it’s not pertinent to what I’m getting at today and this really really hurts so I’ll get to the point: When I turned 16 I took control of my life, got a job, started mapping out my dreams, etc never relied on my mom at all. Even when I was a kid she never really cooked for me or took care of me. She wanted me to show her affection and used me in a very emotionally incestuous way but would constantly physically and emotionally abuse me and get anyone she could to join in. My mom got married a few years before I turned 16 to a guy she could easily control. Once I turned 18 I was enrolled in college and looking to move forward in my life. At that point my mom realized she didn’t have to keep me in her home, said demons were attacking her in her sleep and she kicked me out for being gay. This was not the first time. When I was around 16 my mom told me to get the mail as soon as she came home, I went outside to get it and she locked the door behind me. I had no shoes on and nothing with me. I walked down our upper middle class neighborhood streets crying my eyes out uncontrollably, a man noticed and gave me his shoes. I proceeded to walk looking for the front of the neighborhood(a very long walk. We lived in Walden a neighborhood in the suburbs of Houston. Very large) as I kept walking apparently the guy who gave me shoes called the cops trying to help me. I had no idea, they got there, I was so jaded I guess I didn’t seem young or sad enough for them to really feel the intensity of how sad I was. I was bad at explaining my plight and defending myself. Still am. They told my mom to never do it again and she must take care of me until 18. She told them I was gay, a taoist, etc. tried to say I was worthless basically a bad kid for that and told me as soon as they left that they told her she has to keep me around until 18. This isn’t the first time she’s kicked someone out. She had a friend in the military recently honorably discharged who needed to stay with us. After a week my mom found out she was a muslim and kicked her out 3weeks in. The woman was a high school friend of hers. She tried to foster children at a time (she was gung ho when she found out she’d be paid) and when the 15 year old girl started liking boys as one usually would and my mom saw she wasn’t religious(she was honestly a really decent kid, boy crazy but in a very very normal way. Not even sexual) my mom talked to her social worker during a checkup, expressed that she was religious and so did the social worker- very usual for people to bond over religion, but when my mom heard that she instinctively though the woman must be like her and said she felt demons on the girl. A day later she was removed from the home along with a baby in her care and my mother was never allowed to foster again, however no one check to see if I was ok... that’s fine though because I’d take my childhood over the system. When my mom kicked me out at 18 I stayed in my car for 3 months, eventually worked my way into a successful job in Austin then transferred to New York. That’s where I screwed up. In New York my mental health declined as all of my unresolved trauma came back in a flood and the loneliness of having no friends and no family haunted me to a point of wanting to commit suicide. I am an empath surrounded by millions of people seeing everyone and feeling so unseen. I eventually moved in with my grandmother back in Houston who was VERY happy to have me and I didn’t find out later that it was because she had no one and needed someone to take care of her. She is a genuine narcissist and wanted someone around so she had someone to take care of her in the event she fell ill- normal right? Except she felt no love and would pretend to care for me and manipulate me into thinking she loved me for her own personal and financial gain. No one in my family talks to my mother or grandmother. Now I know why. Turns out my grandmother is a diagnosed narcissist. No one has ever told her or me that, to my knowledge, mainly because telling a narc they are a narc doesn’t bode well. So. Now I’m living with a narcissist and triggered by her trying me manipulate me into thinking she loves me and I know she doesn’t. It kicks me while I’m down because as far as I know no one has ever loved me my entire life. I am not being dramatic. This is not a game. This is my real life and I don’t want to live anymore. I’m so tired. So emotionally weak. I’m genuinely in so much f*cking pain and I can’t stand it anymore. I can’t bear it or hold it anymore I just want out. I just want this to stop. It’s one kick to the face after another. My mom moved me around so much as a kid. I’ve never had a family. I have video and picture proof of my abuse if anyone tries to diminish it and will send to any accusers... maybe there won’t be. My mind is so used to the immediate thought that people won’t believe me when I speak my truth because invalidating me and my feelings was sooo freaking routine in my childhood. I’n hurting more than words can say. I have no one. I just want to live my life, start to heal. I just want a normal life where my sole purpose isn’t to be used or abused by another person. I’m so freaking tired",lonely,Truly isolated seeking understanding,2020-05-10 15:28:42

&amp;#x200B;

She has locked my father out of the house everyday for the last month, and for the last 3 years, locked him out at least once a week (since I was born they have been fighting everyday).

My brother is coming back home, and hates my dad for fighting with my mom constantly and being aggressive towards her (although my mom is emotionally abusive and has hit him multiple times).

&amp;#x200B;

So I have little contact with my brother, who tells me to constantly give up on my dream of becoming a prof or researcher in neuroscience, or a neurologist doctor. But he is a great brother and shares a deep bond with me.

But my mom hates my father and me, insulting us everyday, and insults me for everything, even when I help her for hours a day.

My father supports me, but is rarely home due to being locked out, and my mom screaming if she sees him.

My father hates only my mother, but is depressed for teh last 10 years after loosing his job which made him a multimillionaire (but he had to spend 1/3 of his money of my brother's college + grad school, mom's and my health care, and mortagage. Now im in school).

I didn’t and to some extent still don’t even feel like I’m a human. I had my first existential crisis when I was probably 3-4 and I’ve been struggling with life ever since. I’ve honestly wanted to die since I was 11. For whatever reason though I’m still here. I’m 19 now and out of my whole life id say I’ve been happy for a year total maybe 2. No one likes me. I used to think when I was younger that it was because I was ugly but it is definitely not. I’m not ugly, not at all and I’m not really even weird or anything. The only time anyone shows any interest in me is when they want to fuck me. No one ever wants to be my friend. I’m so nice to everyone but they still always treat me like shit. In my whole life I’ve had maybe 2 or 3 really good friends but they’ve all moved away or something like that. I have no childhood friends due to the isolation and I have essentially no family. I’m all alone. Sometimes I think that I’m secretly retarded or something and no ones telling me but I know I’m not. I’m way too competent. I’m seriously struggling and have no idea what to do.

People I call or have called my friends never talk to me or check up on me.

I made a solid group of really good friends about a year and some change ago. No real problems, healthy adult friendships and I couldn't be happier with them. The problem started about a week ago, there was chat between me and one of those friends. Admittedly I was on an edible maybe that's why I acted so thirsty. Usually I flirt with him and it's just light and kind of a joke but that night I feel like I was really pushing for something more and I kept laying down all these clues of some romantic/sexual intrest and nothing really happened he had to go to bed all of a sudden but I thought okay it was 1am he's probably tired. I'm so used to guys being really thirsty towards me so I was kind of in denial about the signs that he wasn't intrested and it's been uncomfortable to be around him since and it's all my fault and it just feels like I made him too uncomfortable and he'll suddenly drop of a group call as soon as there's a chance we would be alone and it just hurts and I really hope I'm just projecting here because the quarantine is just fucking with my brain and my birthday was yesterday so I've been depressed about that and I just dont really know what to do with myself atm should I say something? should I wait? How can i make things not worse.

I mean I like him and wish he lived closer and clearly I wouldn't mind hooking up but at this point I expected some sort of move should have been made at this point I've made it obvious enough I think so it's just a matter of moving on at this point i guess it just makes me really sad because he's one of the kindest men I've ever met in my life and I'm really looking for something like him. I understand I'm not exactly 10 but I'm not exactly trash and I feel like we're in the same ball game he's a handsome guy to me and I get along well and my track record is very gr8 in the relationship department and he knows that I feel I maybe scared him from anything more because of it honestly I wouldn't want to be with me either I don't know why I keep trying or kidding myself maybe I really am a complete zero and should just accept it and stop trying to date good guys",lonely,Birthday Blues,2020-05-10 13:00:32

2079,Jamie030398,1589068201,1,"Last year i had about good 12 people i hung out with.

I had my fair share of romantic relationships

I was a genuine and exciting person.
I was also very good at singing and playing so i was always that guy with the guitar.


Then after some of my friends got toxic i decided to cut them off.

I went down to a group of 5 close friends, which i kept very close.

I thought nothing could go wrong, i loved these people.

I was being dumb, nothing gets in the way of a good life like mental illnesses.

Due to dissociation, i had a fallout with the closest one in the group.
After that one hit me hard, it started a chain reaction.

I dissociated further, and managed to push the rest away.
All my relationships fell apart and my girlfriend left because i was a god awful simp.

Now, we jump into present day, the rain is pouring down and I'm sitting near a window. I'm playing a shitty acoustic cover of Crawling.
Much like my life in this year, instead of my Brash and confident singing, came out a whimper of a deathly ill dog trying to find it's resting place.

And now I'm back here, a place i would never imagine revisiting.





Guys and Gals, please stay strong.
I hope things get better for you.",lonely,My fall from grace,2020-05-10 09:50:01

2084,YoiDesune,1589063184,1,"So, where do I begin?  and i am currently studying for the entrance exams that are coming up pretty soon that are required if you want to enter university. One thing I should mention is that I really like anime and I have watched many shows but I have stopped really watching them because I have to study. So one day while I was scrolling down the home page I saw a video about Hunter x Hunter ( a very popular anime show) and  decided to click on it because I was always curious about the show. As you can expect I watched the whole 20 minute video and I found it so interesting that an hour later I decided to watch the anime myself. The first couple of episodes where surely a bit boring having only been the start of it but I got excited and continued watching. The anime  basically tells the story of two friends,(the main protagonist and his best friend), who meet at the “Hunter exam” and quickly become best friends. Throughout the 148 episodes they face many hardships wich they must overcome in order to survive. The protagonist is a very kind and caring boy, (12 y/o), and often expresses his feelings to the other protagonist,(his best friend), but the latter,(same age), having been raised in a family of assassins is a bit cold hearted at the beginning and only later does he realize how much he values his friendship,(being an assassin he wasn’t  advised to have friends), and he even questions if he is even enough for his friend,(his name is Killua and his friend’s name is Gon). So, despite my supposed lack of time due to the exams, I have managed to watch almost the entire thing and I must say that there were many times when I could barely hold my tears. Their friendship was so incredibly strong wich I was happy for but jealous at the same time. To say that I don’t have friends would be an insult to them but I can not say that any of my friendships so far have even approached the level of these two boys. I have always wondered since then if  will ever come a time when I will appreciate and love,(as a best friend), someone that much. For almost two years now I have been alone, I have my friends that I talk to at school but when I come home I don’t have anyone that I could share my interests with and the most absurd thing is that I have three sisters!!! But I can assure you that they share almost none of them. I am in serious need of (new) friends because the ones I have now  seem to not care much  and it has really been a long time since I have talked with them seriously.The case has never been my appearance or my external attitude, but I am always having a hard time making new friends. Anyway, sorry you do not have any idea about anime and I bored you to death in the first half. I just wanted to express myself in some way because I don’t have anyone else to talk to about that. Here I hope that someone can share their thoughts on the things I have to say. It’s been a long time since I could do that.",lonely,Hunter x Hunter,2020-05-10 08:26:24
2085,imemethereforeiexist,1589062783,1,"So I kinda stumbled on this sub reddit and I don’t know why but after reading a few posts I decided to post this. I’ve never really felt like I could turn to anyway even tho I have a few friends ik, so why not strangers. I’m a 22 M just about finished up with college and I’ve never been in a relationship in my life. Not so much as a hug or a handshake. Tho this was my choice in hs as I believed getting into a relationship was more than just sex. It was also because I’m kinda traumatized of relationships because my family has had very poor ones including my parents. So it’s not that I think I’m ugly, tho I suffer depression/anxiety so I often think myself inferior, especially because of my height as I’m 5’5 and a guy. Before being alone never really bothered me, but recently I’ve realized that I do in fact want a relationship, but I’ve been so turned off from them that I find it difficult to even try. I also believe I can be a bit of a prick at times, even without realizing it. Added together, I’ve kinda resigned myself to my fate of being alone. I’m the black sheep of my family so I don’t really rely on them too much, but I do have a couple friends around me at least; though at times I hate myself for feeling like they aren’t enough.

This is a self reflection of a 27 year old me &amp; my struggles of dating &amp; the not so successful dating endeavors. I always viewed myself as someone worthy of a girl's attention &amp; always hoped growing up through my teens that I'd not end up alone. School was difficult as I was ridiculed tremendously &amp; so was HS. I thought college &amp; grad school would change that for me but I was wrong, very very wrong. If at all anything happened was the fact that I realized it's actually not them or their fault for ridiculing me but it was entirely me. Admit all this school &amp; college &amp; grad school, all I ever wanted was that someone who would pull pull me out of this mess &amp; help me feel that maybe I'm not as bad as everyone thinks about me &amp; be there for me emotionally, physically &amp; in every supportive sense possible. Boy was I wrong.
  
IRL never worked for me so I thought I'd give OLD a chance &amp; signed up on tinder in 2014 &amp; many others subsequently. This was another bad idea &amp; 6 years strong on various dating sites, I met a grand total of zero girls interested in me. In the meanwhile, I was being slapped left &amp; right with rejections &amp; friend zones which killed every last bit of myself while the 2-3 friends i had were happy finding girls, going on dates &amp; enjoying every bit of happiness the teens &amp; early 20s had to offer. I just sat on the sidelines while truly being happy for them &amp; their incredible success in dating. I admit, I was jealous of them, I still am. After all I'm a human being too but if you ask me, I'm asking for moons &amp; stars for myself.(incredibly stupid comparison, i know) while I thought what was i lacking that these guys had to offer that I don't until I had to sit back &amp; relax &amp; give it a thought.

6 + years of trying incredibly hard, just wanting to be loved &amp; have my feelings reciprocated &amp; signing on every dating site there is, it finally hit me why I was rejected mercilessly &amp; friend zoned even after giving all of me (or so I thought), I've realized, I have nothing to offer. How can a dry well quench thirst when it itself is dry!!
  
I don't want relationships anymore nor am I looking for one. Who's an idiot to be with a guy like me who has nothing to offer but despair &amp; regret of being with me!! Even though I don't want what others have anymore but I'm having a hard time convincing my heart not to feel jealous everyone it sees a couple because that basted doesn't understand, it has nothing to offer.
  
No love, no adventures, no empathy. I'm just a guy with an aching heart with everything I have but nothing to offer &amp; no one to offer nothing. Just a dark lonely room, a white sheet of blank paper &amp; a pen to pretend i may have something to offer but I know deep down within myself, I don't .",lonely,"A lonely guy's self reflection, my struggles with dating &amp; why I hope I won't ever date",2020-05-10 07:51:38

I had a party planned at our house, and obviously that isn’t going to happen anymore. My family from far away was going to be joining us, but that’s not an option now. I’m super bummed out about it. I was looking so forward to it. It was something I had been looking forward to for a long time. 

My mum &amp; boyfriend aren’t able to do anything special for me due to lack of funds &amp; self-isolation. I completely understand, I’m just kinda sad about it. Gifts aren’t a big deal to me, but they definitely help to make the day special. I feel selfish, and spoiled writing this ... but I also just feel sad and lonely.

2090,Karakoima,1589059850,1,"This is maybe a bit awkward to ask, but since I was very much helped by it i dare to. Thing is, I had  very few friends in my teens and was deeply disturbed by this fact. When I later went to university I also had a very hard time making friends, and hated much of the student social life. I learned how to take care of my looks and I learned how to talk to women, so I was rather successful in that area, to the extent that I married a girl, now my wife for a long time.

But I had no friends of my own, we only saw her friends and I absolutely hated it. All social gettogethers. We got children, they grew up, and everytime there were social things I was terrible afterwards, yelling and being awful to my family.

I was deeply depressed by this, and by not having friends of my own so I seeked help for social anxiety. Cost a fortune but I got a good therapist. And after maybe 20 sessions she said
- you have no phobia, no anxiety. And it was true. I am never nervous before a party. I can go there with anticipation. But - it does not work. I always end up being deeply distressed. So - I had a look at Aspergers, took a “test session” by a guy who diagnose people and he was like - you are very far from adiagnose, but you have some traits in that spectrum. So there it is. My brain is simply not constructed for social stuff. Its not an attitude thing, people are not mean or anything. My brain is simply not friend friendly. This was a really big relief for me. Now I am not ashamed of spending a lot of time by myself. I have no friends outside my family and I am not ashamed of it. It causes problems, my wife is really outgoing but it can be handled and our family life is much better. This is no problem in work life. I have no e whatsoever problem leading projects, helping customers, being a manager. But i make no friends.

So - even though Ihave a family I am very much on my own. Am I lonely? Yes. Did I suffer from it. Immensely. Do I now? No.

This might sound like an insult to a lot of you, the heart of this subreddit is in people feeling lonley and wanting friends and/or a loved one. And for a lot of you, thats it, and my heart bleeds for you. But still, I suppose there are one or two like me. People that have the IDEA that they should have friends and suffer from that(no cultures worships loneliness) - more than actually being lonely. Its kind of hard for me to admit to myself that I can be on my own for a week w/o saying a single word. But now have accepted it, even embraced it and my life is so much better.

So what I ask you guys is just to consider the possibility.  That your loneliess might have a component of a personality trait in you. Again, I am not saying it is, there are different reasons for being lonely. But if all the coffee breaks really don’t give you anything, if you always get fatigued by social gettogethers, even since childhood - please consider the possibility that you actually might LIKE being lonely - when the shame of it is removed.

If not, go to next post, this was not for you. But if you recognize some of this - your life will be easier if you accept it. And you can learn how to make friends and meet a partne - the loner way.",lonely,Are you konely partly because you are a loner?,2020-05-10 07:30:50

2095,Unrealisticromantic,1589055822,1,"All my life, I've been a dreamer. When other kids were playing outside, I preferred my books, movies, my computer. I didn't have many friends, I was shy.

I suffered from depression a lot, even then. I never felt pretty or smart or wanted. My mom always said I was just her sensitive one.

I never really got out of that dreaming, the fantasy worlds. I think I sought there what I didn't find in real life, love. When I was twenty, my mom had passed away and my stepdad hadn't paid the bills so we got kicked out. I met my now ex in a crisis centre. I was alone, he was nice, outgoing, he looked out for me, and an alcoholic. We were together for 8 years, mainly because I was afraid to be alone. I finally got the confidance to break up with him but for now we'll have to live together.

The thing is, I never stopped the dreaming, I'm a 29 year old woman who still spends most of her time making up stories in her head, mostly involving actors/singers I find interesting, just to keep the dark clouds at bay, but damn is it hard. My ex is the only one who ever really loved me, even if it was a broken kind of love.

So much of my depression is caused just by this deep seated loneliness inside. I KNOW it's unrealistic and I know all I've ever wanted in life is that feeling of being head of heels with someone, and them feeling the same, building a life together.

 I know that doesn't last, but the idea that no one in real life will actually make me feel the way I do when I watch a Jeff Goldblum movie, or listen to a Bowie or Alice Cooper song, and that no one will ever feel that way about me, THAT is what hurts the most.

Without it, nothing in life feels worth it. I go through the motions but I have no big aspirations. I take care of my pets, I read, I watch some movies, youtube, twitch streams, anything to keep my mind occupied so that I can't dwell on that emptiness I feel inside.",lonely,Dreaming only makes it worse,2020-05-10 06:23:42

It would be one thing if I thought this would change but I'm almost positive my life will continue on like this. I've never had a girl interested in me and nobody ever approaches me to be my friend. I don't see why that would ever change.

It would also help if I could be numb to this pain, but I just can't. It hurts too bad feeling like so much of life's joys are missing for me. It hurts too bad knowing I'll probably never have anyone to go through life with.

2097,I-already-redd-it-,1589055566,1,"Does anyone else feel this way? I generally have never liked the idea of favoritism and I don’t think it should exist, but as human beings it is an idea that is embedded into ourselves, so just when I try to think if I am anyone’s favorite person in the world, no one comes to mind. Sure, I may have some family that cares for me in the fact that I am family, but no one ever seems to care about how I feel or checks up on me, I’m not even sure if anyone thinks that I am feeling the way I am. I struggle to even find out why I am so sad most of the time and I know it’s tied to not having any friends but even having friends right now seems like it wouldn’t be fulfilling enough to get me out of my slump, but maybe it will, I honestly don’t know. I dislike it so much the amount of emotional adaptation that humans have, at least that’s the name that I have given it, the fact that we can enjoy a new friendship or item/toy we have gotten for only a little while, then soon we start to take it for granted and get bored of whatever we had, and leave it behind. This thought is discouraging to me because no matter what I obtain, it will never make me forever happy, I don’t know if this is a thought that anyone else has but just wanted to share it. I’ve wanted to get some friends to game with for a while now but I’m so conflicted because I’ve always felt bad for playing games because the people around me have always but such a bad name on them and I honestly don’t think I could get the same amount of enjoyment out of them that I used to, about a month ago I got a job for the sole reason of building a desktop so that I could hang out with my friends and enjoy gaming with more (I was planning on trying to apply during the summer anyway because it is a good job, but I got it earlier so that I could work towards the PC), and I have obtained the money at this point but have come to the realization that none of my friends really care for hanging out with me too much and I’m still so conflicted because I have about a month left to decide if I want to buy it and I’m not too interested in building one anymore but I honestly don’t want all that time and effort to go to waste and I may want it in a couple months and I will have regretted not getting, so, I don’t know really, it’s just stressing me out. I’m so hesitant on making online friends because most of the friendships seem to be so fickle but I honestly can’t see myself finding a real friendship in my small town so I’m just stuck. I recently saw a post here about someone wanting someone else with no friends so that they could be each other’s only friend, which I couldn’t agree with more, it may seem clingy but I just a friend relationship where we are loyal, it’s a strange thing to ask from a friend but Im just tired of friends leaving for other things that have peaked their interest. Other teenagers around me always end up swearing and doing, in my eyes, “immoral” things and I just can’t seem to form a connection to anyone, I’m not religious, but I just don’t like grotesque language. So overall, I’m just feeling unmotivated and lonely  

Well, that was a little longer than it should have been, and this just became a rant of things I needed to get off my mind these past couple years, I’ve just tried to keep all the bad feelings in because I don’t really like it when others complain about their lives, but that is exactly what I am doing right now so I can’t really talk haha. If anyone actually read through this whole thing, I really do appreciate it, this was more or less just something I wanted to get off my mind.

And he sometimes randomly talked about his ex which also made me feel like he would rather want her back than stay with me.
So one drunk night I told him how I felt and he actually just confirmed every pessimistic thought I've  had for weeks.
Basically I never was good enough for him, he was in love with his ex even tho he ended up hating her, he didn't quite feel it with me... 

So all I think about now is how much I hate his ex girlfriend(even tho I don't know her), sometimes even hate him for not loving me which I know is stupid, in general I feel fucking frustrated and I don't think that anyone will EVER be able to like or love me more than their fucking ex I don't think I can be good enough to be better for someone than ANY other girl

Also at the moment I only have one friend that lives in my my city and I don't have any other people I could hang out with. I don't even know how to meet new people so I could at least try to find someone. At the moment it's just not possible and I'm crumbling inside knowing that I can't do shit about it.",lonely,I feel like I will never find anyone that could have any feelings for me,2020-05-10 04:49:27
2106,RandomCupcakezzz,1589050095,1,"Hi there!

So.... I am not entirely sure how to do this, but here goes nothing...

So for the past couple of months, (maybe even a year) I have been feeling pretty lonely, despite being surrounded by people/""friends"", I've just always had some sort of emptiness inside.

Recently I broke up with my girlfriend, which I was together with for over 2.5years. We hadn't really been on the best terms for quite a while now and been fighting and breaking up several times already until just recently I decided, that it is the time to move on for both of us.

Even when I was in a relationship I always had a feeling that something's just not right, and I was always feeling empty. Lack of accomplishment, friends, and social interaction. Maybe routine was the reason why I was feeling so down? So many questions, but no answers to be found. 

For over a year I was living almost like a robot. 9:00 - 19:00 job -&gt; Gym -&gt; Home back to sleep. I was sticking with the same routine for such a long time, that I almost forgot that there's more to life than just sitting by the PC and working out. For over 365 days I was talking to just 2-3 people in real life, which at that time was my gf, aunt, and the nice cashier which I was getting my water from. 

Ever since things have gone south, I feel kinda lost.

Lately, I've been trying to find some gaming buddies on Reddit, which could possibly help me have some good time online, and possibly find some friends, but unfortunately, it wasn't the case, as, for the most part, we lost our contact after just a day or two. Maybe I just wasn't good enough, or funny enough for them to enjoy my company... I don't know. For some reason, it just wasn't working out.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is all of this for? Honestly, I have no f\*\*\*\*\*\* idea what am I doing here. Been trying to figure things out for quite a while now, but the emptiness just wouldn't go away. 

I'm just an average 24 years old guy from Eastern Europe, and I would appreciate someone to talk to bout everything and anything, really...

My discord is: Cupcake#0002

In case you are using any other communication channels, or prefer to stick with reddit, that's fine too. Feel free to DM me at any time in case you wanna just talk.",lonely,Not sure what to put here... Just an empty person from EU.,2020-05-10 04:48:15
2107,juniperismeowd,1589047322,1,"It's really difficult, being the only one with a wandering soul. I'm surrounded by people, but can never rely on any of them. I reach out only to have strings cut.
I've had to learn to like things on my own. Eating by myself, hiking by myself, shows by myself, adventures by myself. But, Fuck. It gets lonely as fuck. To even talk to someone would be a delight. To connect with someone.

The last I remember any semblance of talking and connecting, I was at a bar with a friend, giving him advice about something. But we both shared secrets, admitted it to not only each other but ourselves. I didn't cry, but I did tear up when I said it's very lonely never really having anyone there for me.

I called my best friend the next day, and he said I was just a wandering soul. That even my S.O couldn't keep up with me.

I feel like I'm destined to be alone at this point. Some days I feel worthless, others I feel like they don't deserve me. But seeing it that way never solves anything.

I should probably start Journaling again, maybe help clear my headspace. But it will never feel like I belong in my current life. I've been held back by those I love. Being a people-pleaser has always been my biggest downfall.
I know someday I'll have to put my big girl pants on, be the BBEG to everyone and start saying no. I have too much heart and a yearning for uprooting.

My very close kindergarden friend left me last year cause of my promiscuous behaviour. This caused me losing plenty of people cause they were our mutual friends. We had beautiful friendship and we used to go everywhere. 

I havent met any friends on college cause i have social anxiety. I only met one girl which i believed she is gonna be my friend but she left me cause my parents didnt let me go on summer vacation with her and i didnt have money to pay for arrangement she already reserved. Then i met other girl that is totally using me so she wont be alone at the college but she never invited me anywhere. 

Then i had some really good friends back in middle school and they totally forgot about me but they hang out regularly. I was really close to them but they stopped hanging out with me when i was in high school. 

I used to attend dance classes and there were also beautiful and nice people but i didnt save any friendship and people that i was close to also hang out regularly.

I had two male friends in the place where im spending summer and one year they found bunch of new people that didnt accept me (especially girls) so it was the end of our friendship too. 

I only have threefriends that still didnt left me: my best friend that i mentioned before, but we dont hang out very much cause she’s busy and lazy, my other friend which is constantly busy, and my third friend which lives far away from me. 

People come and go and that’s okay but how is it possible that i couldnt save any of mentioned people and they are all still hanging out but everybody without me? Will i ever find any friends?

When I did find someone to marry, he was abusive and neglectful, and I lost a lot in that transaction when it ended.  Havent had a substantial relationship in almost a decade.

I have a good work ethic, but I've struggled many years of my adult life financially - and the thought of helping my mother terrifies me.   I know that at some point, she will have to live with me - and I can barely figure out how to pay for my own space some months, as I am still a renter.  That is not what frightens me, per se...

I've got music playing semi-loudly filling the empty,

a smoke with a sweet smell to it.

I've got lots of clothes on, because its cold outside. 

So cold I feel it on the inside.

I try to remain happy, and content with my life and where I am. 

I mean, I don't have the answers I would like to have, like where I want to live, what I want to do, and who I want to do it with.  I don't think a lot of people have these things figured out, and those who do, are fortunate. 

I am also fortunate, in other ways. I have been able to travel the world, at least parts of it. 

Its a big place, you know.

But I am traveling alone. If you want to run, and no else does, I guess you have to do it alone.

As I am writing this,  I am pretty much as far away as i can physically be from the place i call home. As far away as possible from the people I care about. From the people that know me better than anyone else. Sometimes I feel like no one understands me,

i know its those.

I keep having the urge to self harm and I’ve resisted the urge to do so. But today the urge just seems overwhelming. I haven’t really spoken to anyone cos of this lockdown but tbh even if someone talked to me, I don’t really seem to have much energy to sustain a long convo with anyone. It seems that there’s only one person I really want to talk to. 

He’s someone I got to know through an online game and we got really close for a few months. I think I really fell hard for him. I never realised I was lonely till he came into my life cos I was just busy living each day by working non stop. I didn’t realise that I looked forward to chatting with him daily and he became my emotional support... my everything.

Everything went well for a few months but things changed when he fell ill and my depression spiralled out of control, with me doing something to hurt him. I thought things would eventually get better for us after he recovered and I became better but somehow life circumstances just drove us apart. 

He became so distant in the past month and now he has stopped talking with me for 3 weeks. I know he’s struggling again with finances (lost his job) and his survival cos of the lockdown. I just feel so lonely and sad that he shut me out and I can’t help him in anyway.

2137,zorawonderwall,1589020112,1,"to set things straight beforehand, lemme just gonna say one thing: 

**im not good with words**, and im going to pretend i am but i wanted to get this off my chest because ive held it in for so so long and i can slowly begin to feel it destroying my whole fucking life and everything ive ever enjoyed so if you have the time to read, id really appreciate it.

so i was having a conversation with my mom yesterday about some of my personal problems and the kinds of stuff that ive never shared with anybody and have instead kept bottled up all my life. we mainly just talked about my persisting fears of judgement, low self-esteem, anxiety, guilt, you get the gist. but this was really the first time ive ever really opened up to anybody in my life and i was honestly quite surprised as to how smooth the conversation was going for the most part regardless of the fact that i had trouble spitting some of it out at first. it wasn't until towards the end of the conversation where i began to hold things back in and restrain my thoughts once more mainly because i was afraid of what she may have thought of me or that she simply wouldn't *""get it.""*

now just so you get an idea of me, this is how ive been practically my entire life up til this point: afraid of expressing myself to people in fear of how they may perceive me afterwards or that they'd simply just not understand. ive always been so quick to make assumptions on people and how theyd react to my situations because i was just afraid. afraid of what? i dont fucking know... expressing myself maybe??

anyways, so we were reaching the end of the conversation and i was struggling to put my thoughts into words until i finally told her something like *""i just feel that nobody understands me""* until i went into a complete emotional meltdown and began crying like a fucking baby. i remember going to my room feeling pathetic for breaking down in front of my mom and after putting some more thought into it, i just fell asleep.

 this was truly the first time ive ever actually cried in a long ass time let alone actually had a meaningful conversation with really anyone in my whole life and it truly meant a lot to me while it lasted. it was almost strange, like i was expressing a side of myself to someone that i had never shown anyone.

my only problem is that i cant seem to pinpoint one particular trigger as to why i broke down last night and even thinking about it now im drawing a complete blank but this is the kind of stuff that pisses me off .... i just feel like a fucking mess.

ive always known that i was a bit strange ever since i was a kid, in fact my teachers would often send emails home to my parents along the lines of ""your child doesn't have any friends"" or ""your child doesn't speak at all"" etc etc, and to be honest these things dont bother me too much since ive come to terms with the fact that this is just who i am. 

i also felt that despite the fact that it felt good to get things off my chest for once, a lot of what i wanted to say i didnt get to say either because i couldnt put them into words or because i was afraid of what my mom would think of me. i could write an entire fucking blog about my problems right now and i still probably wouldnt feel even remotely satisfied and id just end up angering myself even more because id just stir it up with all my other emotions only giving me more to hide.

what i want to know is whether or not it is normal to just break down and start crying in the middle of a conversation like that or if i need genuine help.

again, i dont expect everyone to understand, but to those who think they might have an idea as to why what happened last night happened, if it's not too much to ask, please let me know because i have no fucking idea and ive truly never felt any more alone in my life than i have over the past weeks.

the world can be very cruel and unwelcoming but ive always tried to stay optimistic no matter what challenges ive had to or may have to face in years to come and i hope that you all feel the same way and continue to push forward. *if you ever need someone, ill be here.*

2140,offwhite-g,1589017245,1,"I’m 24 and asexual; I’ve never really been interested in romance, but I’d really like a friend. I’m conventionally successful — I have a graduate degree, a good job, and I’m decently attractive— but I’ve never had a close friend. I’ve done therapy to figure out what’s wrong, I’ve worked on my social skills, I’ve even been evaluated for adult autism — nothing makes a difference. Inside, I’m a caring person and I just want a friendship where we can make each other happy. But on the outside, I come across as awkward and intimidating. 

I feel like I’m missing a key “line of code,” so to speak. I was raised in a cult, and I wasn’t exposed to the secular world until university. In my parents’ subculture, women are basically worthless and born to bear children. I was always too tall, too loud, and too argumentative. My parents always discouraged close friendships, and I wasn’t allowed to go to school. 

I’m just feeling absolutely broken. There is a girl at my office who has been pushing me around and spreading gossip about me. I just tune her out — I’m of the mind that if you wrestle with pigs, you’ll just get dirty. But my boss told me that this girl had been talking about me with everyone who will listen, and she apparently says I’m “scary and intimidating.” 

This cut me to the core. I desperately want to be liked, and I go out of my way to be kind to my coworkers. I have no clue what else I can do to seem less strange and intimidating. I just feel stupid for getting my hopes up that I could make friends in the workplace, and that being kind to everyone would make up for my RBF.

I am regularly in touch with friends who live far away, and the lockdown is making impossible to get in touch with the people I know here... But it's incredibly difficult. Despite my avoidance for social situations, I miss a human physical connection.

All my ""demons"" and insecurities have popped up again. I am quite shy... In normal circumstances I would have found difficult to meet new people... for friendship or a relationship... But now I see that everything has turned black... 

I have the feeling that I will be alone forever, and nobody will ever be interested of me because I am ugly and mediocre.

I try to keep myself busy with chores, work, DIY... But actually is not enough to turn down my feelings of low self-esteem.

2142,writingnights,1589014157,1,"i can’t believe i’m posting about my life on reddit but this has been on my mind for a while and it would be nice to express it, even if it’s just to the void 

i’m turning 23 in a few weeks and i can’t believe how surprisingly alone i feel. and how much i feel like a loser. 

when i was a kid, i was extremely shy and awkward and socially anxious. i come from an abusive parenting household and even when i was a child, i felt wildly depressed all the time. as i got older i grew more into myself at school by becoming more extroverted, and then eventually becoming a social butterfly. in high school and college i had tons of friends, and i was super active on social media, especially on instagram. i lived two double lives, one person at home that was always demure and silent and generally just trying to stay in her room and not interact with her very religious parents that punished her for everything. the other girl was manic and the complete opposite, and used the school bathroom to change into short skirts, do her makeup, and then cut class to smoke weed with friends, or in college, going out to a bar nearly every night. and used social media to do what she thought was expressing herself.

i had so many friends. where did they go? my life seemed to be filled with people- i had an on and off boyfriend for three years, college friends, friends from high school, tons of people I’d hang out with all over the city. then, last year, my senior year of college, my mental health became nearly unbearable because of my alcohol problem. i would secretly drink in my room all the time, just to numb the pain i was feeling about my life. i was so depressed i would just cry on the train every morning. i stopped taking care of myself. i didn’t buy a single new article of clothing that whole year, which is unlikely of the old me. i wanted to go to therapy but i couldn’t, because i was still under my parents insurance and they forbade me. i couldn’t sneak and do it because they would see it on their bill.
then, i started having bad health issues (unrelated to the alcohol problem) and i couldn’t recognize myself anymore. many visits to the hospital, and finals, and living in delusion, it was all too much. i became a total shell of a person. i was so stressed, even my hair started falling out and i gained a bit of weight. i couldn’t look in the mirror anymore just because i didn’t know who that was that looked so sad all the time. my boyfriend and i broke up that spring, and it’s still hard. but we grew so apart while i dealt with my health issues. he stopped seeing me. when we would hang out rarely he wouldn’t even look at me and always made sure to leave early to go see his friends. it really hurt, because this was someone who wouldn’t be able to take his eyes off me and would say “i love you” in my ear all the time. i had my fair share of faults, with distancing away from him throughout my deep issues and having horrible communication skills resulting in big fights. so yeah, we broke up. and i graduated college. i completely stopped drinking alcohol. 
and then it was my birthday last spring, and i realized that when i was going through my problems, suddenly all my friends were gone. now that i was wearing sweats and hoodies every single day, no makeup, always looking depressed, never went to bars or clubs , almost everyone left. i felt so alone. i had about four friends left who were extremely kind to me, and we grew close. they were really, really there for me. usually for my birthday, i have a huge party. but last year, i just invited the four girls to my house and we had a quiet little celebration. 
as the summer went by i started to shed a bit of that deep depression, especially because my health got much, much better. i was still depressed, but didn’t feel suicidal anymore. i missed my ex a lot, and felt horrible about the way we ended things when he meant so much to me. i contacted him and at first he told me to leave me alone and that he never wants to hear from me again in his life and that i didn’t do anything for him, wasn’t compatible for him, and that he wants to move on. i said sorry, and left him alone. then he contacted me telling me he apologizes and that he misses me so much that he doesn’t know what to do, and that he would love to meet up to hook up. i excitedly agreed. 
we made the plans to see each other after eight whole months. neither of us could stop talking about it for a week. 
he showed up late. and as soon as he got there, he said he had to leave by 7 to go meet people. i started yelling because he had promised me on the phone that he would be with me until midnight. he got angry and yelled back. then we both sad down, and he put his arm around me. i said we should get up and get some wine, because i knew it would make us feel more comfortable. (at this point, i hadn’t drank for 7 months. just a month ago i started having one glass a week, and found it to be extremely easy. i never even craved more than one glass anymore. and my ex? well all his friends ever posted was stories of all of them getting shitfaced at a club or hotboxing a party.)
he went berserk. seriously, i’ve never seen anything like it. he started crying and screaming and saying that he doesn’t like me and doesn’t care about me anymore and that he made a huge mistake seeing me. i kept asking him what was wrong and he just kept saying that we’re different people now. he got more worked up the more i asked him what’s wrong, so then  i sat down quietly. he then calmed down, and spent a lot of time texting on his phone. then he said “do you mind if i roll up my weed in here?” i choked up and just told him to leave. i expected one measly text that would at least say, “sorry about that. take care.” but nothing. nothing at all. the next day i sent him a wrong regrettable essay about how sad i was that he didn’t even apologize and how much he’s gonna regret losing someone as amazing as me. i know you guys, so fucking cringe. i feel embarrassed about that entire situation at least once a day. he left that message on seen, and we haven’t spoken since. i still miss him all the time. 
so i didn’t have him, and i didn’t have most of my “friends”. just those four girls, now dwindled into two, that i’d bother to hang out with. and no more instagram. 
i was very bored. my ultimate dream since i was a kid is to become a writer one day, for both short fiction and screenplays. i really love comedy, and in college i wrote pieces for satire sites. my senior year of college when i was depressed, i started writing more serious fiction about my childhood and family and actually won a few awards at my college (i spent the money on using seamless for a month straight). i wanted to try something new, so i signed up for sketch and improv classes 
i was so socially anxious it’s indescribable. i could barely introduce myself in front of people. 
but slowly, i started being myself. and i was having too much fun. and all these people, who i would have otherwise never ever met in real life, started begging me to hang out with them and telling me i was hilarious and smart and a wonderful person to be around. i felt guarded, and didn’t want to open myself up. i hung out with one group after class one day and had a blast though. and one of them i started briefly dating for like a month. 
and i applied for my MFA in creative writing. i don’t know why. i’m crazy? and i got in. i started my first semester this January. and it’s hard. and i’m staying up all the time these days because of my final term papers + fiction manuscript and screenplay due in the next week. i don’t know what i’m doing.
i really don’t know what i’m doing. and because of the pandemic, i think i have truly lost every friend. people are busy, i think. it’s a hard time right now. but i went from texting ten friends a day and texting my boyfriend who loved me and making posts on instagram and twitter. now? i wake up to zero texts and go to sleep with zero texts. i don’t have instagram or twitter anymore. i deleted instagram because so many people followed me but no one ever texted me and asked me how i was even though i checked up on them often, and my ex’s friends kept posting all of them at strip clubs etc and it was becoming too painful to see. most of my life, i’ve felt very insecure if i wasn’t dating somebody because it gave me a sense of safety. now? i don’t actively look for/talk to guys at all, even the ones from school and places that get my number and try to talk to me. i spend my days watching hours and hours of films and television, reading books, doing schoolwork, working remotely, or trying to take care of myself. skincare, doing my nails, making myself some tea etc.

i feel so alone. turns out 99% of my friendships were fake and they did not know the real me or anything i’ve been through. and turns out the person i loved has likely forgotten my existence or hates me. i don’t have social media but sometimes i’ll look at their twitter pages and everyone (before the pandemic) was just partying all the time or going to brunch together. and they looked stunning, and their makeup was one and their dresses were beautiful. i feel so ugly from just having plain black clothes now, after throwing out all of my clothes last spring during my mental breakdown. 

and every day, i feel physical anxiety from the thought of becoming a failure. the thought of never making enough money to be able to leave my family and live alone, the thought of never knowing if i’m actually talented, the thought of never achieving my dreams. that really keeps me up all night. the thought of writing, and no one ever seeing it. no one ever caring, because i’m irrelevant or maybe just not good enough. that no one will ever publish my stories, that i will never meet anyone that can help me find a job in the tv and film writing industry. the thought of my parents growing old and me not having the means to financially support them. the thought of just being a total failure as a daughter of immigrants. 

i feel weird, and alone, and scared. i am so afraid i’m going to be nobody, and unloved, and invisible. i want to feel confident again, i want to feel like myself. i don’t know what’s going on with me. 

i’m sorry if you read this whole thing. thank you, and i’m sorry. it feels like a weight has been letting, typing out all these things i’ve never told anybody. i know i’ll be so embarrassed of this post in an hour or something and delete it. i’m sorry if i have wasted your time making you read this. have a wonderful day.",lonely,4 am thoughts of a 23 year old (almost) jar of mustard,2020-05-09 18:49:17

2148,DudeImHonestlySad,1589005796,1,"So today was probably the 2nd to last time I’ll see a majority of the people at my school. I’ve never been very close with anyone there, except for one person who I’ll probably never forget. She’s more than just my first kiss, she’s the closest thing I’ve ever had to someone who cares about me as more than just another person they know. She made me feel like I mattered to someone, but I guess I didn’t. I really don’t even know anymore. 

The three of us (me, her, and her friend) went to reunite with our peers for what will probably be one of the last times ever. And that’s alright, it was fun. I felt content with how it went. Now, I wasn’t really there for my schoolmates, I was there to have some fun driving around and feeling like I had friends.

Once they had socialized and met up every which way they pleased, we decided to get a little snack and start going home. All was well. I dropped her friend first, then we drove to her place and talked a little on the way. I dropped her off, hugged her, and left.

She used to wait to see me leave to make sure I was safe or whatever... I never actually knew why she did it, but nevertheless it felt natural and kind. She didn’t wait. She got what she wanted, she was gone. It was then when I realized that things were back to the way they used to be, back when I felt like I was unlikeable and pointless.

It feels like each time my heart sinks and I realize how miserable I am, it hits a little harder. Like each time I patch the hole that was left, it eventually breaks even more, and it hurts even more too. And with someone like me, it makes me feel even lower than most, considering how high those that surround me are. Lawyers, Doctors, white, rich, happy. And then there’s me, who can’t even find himself a friend. Just one fucking friend. Is it really so hard? I don’t think it should be but hey, I guess that’s how it is for me.

The bottom line is I keep trying to convince myself that I’m happy, and each time I catch myself in that lie and realize that I’m fucking miserable, it hurts even more. And I’m just scared that one day I’m gonna feel that way and never recover.

I also understand how many people out there are beating their head against the bushes just trying to remain productive. Sometimes you can’t, and that’s okay. 
I understand how important it is being reminded that you are loved and it never hurts to just check in.

Some of them respond a day or 2 later explaining they got busy.

It’s like I’m in this bottom of a pit, and every time I scream out “I love you.” More mud fell on me. And muffles my sound. 
And day by day the mud covers me up, covers the pit. And there I was, 6 feet under, still saying. “I love you.” 
It didn’t make me feel great, it was suppose to.

Im also introverted and i always feel like im left out of the group if i ever go out.
Also ive been single for 4 years. 
I was just recently seeing somone for about 3 months it made me happy because i liked her and i thought we would lead into somthing serious. Anyways randomly she just ignored my text and went COLD for 2 weeks i msged her and she told me her ex called her and she wants to get back with him . 
So i guess she played me and strung me along till things worked out with her ex and she just dropped me i even asked if we can meet and talk about it and she said no . My feelings didnt matter obviously only hers and what she wanted , she never mentioned no ex and she liaf about when they broke up so she cn get the best of both worlds i guess. 
Anyways so she dropped me . And i feel so much worse about my life it hurts. Especially during lockdown i dont even leave the house. 
Im not really seeking any answers im just venting because i have no1 to tell my feelings too. 
I wish i could have friends and a realationship and fill up this lonely feeling ive had for years now. 
I wish she didnt lead me on i wish after the first date she didnt ask to see me again because then i wouldn't of caught feelings.  
This sucks . I really liked her anf thought she was decent . I did notice some red flags and i guess this explains it , she was probably seeing her ex the whole time and now he wants her back so she drops me like a bag of sh#t and i no longer exist to her.  Im anoyyed because i thought finally i met a nice decent girl. But no she just played me . I thought about teling her off but theres no point .

I'm (28m) not alone by any means, I have fantastic friends and family and people who care but even with all that I'm lonely to an almost soul crushing level. I crave intimacy so much and so badly but I can't do anything about it. I'm terrible at explaining things so I'm sorry if none of this m akes sense or if I'm doing this wrong.

I'm not great at socialising and terrible at flirting. Irl i can't ask for what i need for several reasons,  including depression and anxiety. I need someone to show me they care and actually love me for a change  instead of being used or led on. I just don't know what to do to feel better and try to improve my lifestyle and health and well being...

He never introduced me to his friends or took me anywhere, but I figured he just wasn’t the show-off type. He ended things because he “wasn’t a relationship guy”. Two months later, he’s in a committed relationship with some freshman. All his friends have met her. I would give anything to be in her shoes but it’s not meant to be.

Currently I have a few friends I talk to every now and then, but every time, some event pops up, they end up doing something with their other friends. Some of those friends are people who I have also spoken to, met and been to parties with.

Last new years eve, I ended up alone all of my friends went to the same party with people I’ve met, partied with and played video games with. I asked my friends what he was doing new years eve, he said: “He was going to some friends” and so did another one of my friends. They asked me what I was doing and I said: “Nothing”.  Later new years eve they posted a snapchat each, from the same balcony, of fireworks. That was the moment I realized they might not want me to be a part of the friend group, or at least I felt that way.

I wish I could have explain my life story so I could get some guidance, but I’ll try to explain it in a short way. It’s not bad and I’ve lived a very fortunate life but I feel like I’m missing some things. I wish I could trade all the designer bags I have for better friends and just good times. I grateful for the big roof over my head and the clothes I’m wearing and the masses amount of food I have but I just want to go to sleep knowing that I’m happy with everything. I have a twin sister and we share the same friends but I feel/know that they gravitate more towards her. I know my best friend is closer to her then me. I try to make an effort with everyone, i constantly text people and reach out to them. But nobody does the same to me. Literally nobody. My best friend has maybe once or twice since the 3 years of our friendship actually sent me the first text and when she does it’s just me talking and her not telling me anything, why do I have to always ask her you know why can’t she just tell me. Like if she breaks up with her boyfriend she won’t tell me or reach out to me at all. She just texts me very blandly. But she and my sister always text. Me and my twin have suffered bullying so I know that my sister tend to be nicer/ suck up to people more. But I know that I don’t want to be friends with toxic people. My friend isn’t a bad person but she pushes me and sometimes even my twin to the side for other people (who aren’t even that close to her). But I don’t feel this way just because of her. I feel like I have no friends like why doesn’t anyone reach out to me, why do I always have to make the effort. I don’t fit in here I feel like. I feel like nobody in my family understands ( I know my mum tries to help but she can’t really I feel like). I just want to be lucky enough to have some friends who make an effort with me, text me and ask me to hang out. I’m sick of being placed last. I want more but not in a materialistic way but more of a life if that makes sense. This isn’t just about having no friends or maybe it is I don’t know. 

I feel like I’m not smart. I worry that I won’t get good a levels grades or get into uni. I’m really scared. I’m trying but I know I’m not studying hard enough but it’s really hard and I just feel so stupid. 

I wish I didn’t have to cry in my bedroom alone. I hate that when I’m sad I have nobody to go to. No friends to texts like my siblings or twin. I feel like not one of my siblings see me as their ‘favourite’ siblings so I feel like I can’t turn or talk to them. I just can’t go to my mum. She means well but she just doesn’t get it even after I explain how I feel.  

I wish I didn’t have to fear being alone either because nobody likes me because of my appearance or personality. I don’t want to change for anymore (change in a bad way) 

People keep saying you have to be patience and good things will come your way or that you make your life friends at uni. But why do I have to wait. I’ve lived almost 17 years and I have to wait even longer? It suck seeing people that I’m friends with have amazing friendship groups 

I used to live in another country when I was younger and I loved the people and the lifestyle because I fit in and people were similar to me. Here in England people are cold and I haven’t really met people similar to me. 

I don’t to wait years and years for happiness that might not even come. 

I know I feel more but this is at the top of my head at the moment. 

I haven’t been diagnosed with depression, I’ve just been having a rough day and I just thought of this. Sometimes I think I’m depressed but I’m not a doctor. Obviously I don’t want to be depressed but I know a lot of people my age have these sorts of issues. My older sister thinks I have anxiety but I get scared that when I go to uni I still won’t find any friends or fit in. I just feel like this because it’s been a Whitty situation for so long and I know good things happen to those who wait but I’m so sick of waiting, I feel like it’s just never going to happen.

It has taken years for me to locate a cure to my anxiety. Cure might be a strong word, but at the very least, its an effective distraction from it. I need medicine, but I also need to \*talk\*. Breathing, thinking, listening, communicating... its comforting. When you're actually having a conversation, a meaningful one, the person on the other side values you. You're worth the time. Your words and thoughts are worth consideration. Your presence isn't annoying to them. Even if they're giving up on something else, they're giving it up for \*you\*. Its the most encouraging thing to me, to have someone be present.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's so hard to shake the "" maybe she will be different"" "" maybe she wont ignore/ block/ reject me"".

My problem is is that I am just so deprived of interaction,  that by the time I actually do meet up with a girl, I get to excited, or let my personal feelings get in the way, or compliment her to much, or be to sincere,  Its so hard for me to hold back  how I feel because...I know if I dont, then she may not want to see/talk to me again...and that would just destroy me even more.
So, I think that's why I express myself to truthfully, because I just want someone to like me for who I really am.

Today, we were in class and we had an assignment to do, although I'm in a new school and a lot of months have passed, still got no friends. I already finished my assignment (with all the others) so the teacher told us to help our friends. We had a special group for that lesson and everyone was like ""yeah I'm with u"" n stuff to each other.



I tried texting my friend and not surprisingly he ignored me. like all my other ""friends"". This was the 5th time people were trying to ignore me. It doesn't matter if it's in real-life or online...People were ignoring me...



Now before you guys type ""maybe u have the problem"" or ""check yourself first"".I tried. I tried to give them space and talk to them while they are in the mood, I lied in bed thinking ""Am ı annoying?"" ""Am ı a bad person"" ""Why?"".



I couldn't find answers to my questions because only humans I talk to are my family and my cousin and they are all like ""oh you are wonderful"" you know, Typical family stuff. But if you have some friends that annoy you or be to close sometimes...Just tell them! And if they cannot deal with that just don't be friends with them because believe me, ignoring them will hurt them more than the truth.

I had a great little gang for a few years but we slowly drifted as we started university. They were the only people I ever felt were my actual friends. We've all argued and fallen out since then so theres no getting them back.

I started a job recently and made a (what I thought) awesome group of friends. Turns out they were just fake people; bitching about people then being all friendly and lovely to them online and in person. I am the only friend that says when I don't like someone I wont give that person any of my time. Why act all friendly to people you were just bitching about? Gross.

But even though ive got my pride, I've got no friends. These people don't even talk to me. Ive got my family sure but they don't really talk to me, theyre so busy all the time.

She was super nice to me and him and she kept on telling me that she really likes my friend and wants to try getting with him (we verified that she wasn’t a catfish). She had an amazing personality, she was funny and kind, an amazing person. But I started to feel anger and jealousy. Not only was my friend suddenly getting messaged by an amazing person, I was also slowly being pushed away.

So I decided to convince my friend that she was weird, and just not a trustworthy person. After a few days he agreed and we decided to tell her that we don’t want to be her friend. We didn’t think it was serious, but when we told her, she basically started crying trough her camera. She didn’t understand why we were leaving her, she kept on repeating how she thought we were her friends and how she trusted us, but we just left.

And after all of that, I find out that out of my only 3 best friends, 2 of them are changing schools, and the last one changed friend groups.

This past year, I’ve moved 7 hours away to go to school and met so many people and had so many friends. Now I’m second guessing if they were actually friends or just people I talked to from time to time. I also met my boyfriend and we just celebrated 7 months Sunday. There I was never alone, it was the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire life. 

Mid March I moved home because of the coronavirus. Probably the worst couple weeks of my life, going from practically living with my boyfriend to not being able to see each other at all. I see him every now and then because he only lives about 1.5 hours from my home town but it’s not the same as living in the dorms.

I’ve barely left my room since coming home. I spend all day everyday trying to distract myself, just wishing it were August and I could move back to school. 

I haven’t been reached out by anyone from my university at all besides my former roommate every now and then, and my boyfriend. I try to spark conversations with people I thought I was friends with back at uni, but they just quickly die. I just feel like I’m doing something wrong or I’m just a very boring person to talk to.

I just don’t understand why it’s so difficult for me to make friends or communicate. But I’ve just been feeling very lonely the past couple of days. Today has been especially bad which made me slightly motivated to make this post because someone may comment on it it or something, I don’t know. 

I’m afraid to reach out to anyone anymore and I’m just suffering being alone right now.",lonely,"When I’m alone, away from everyone, I spiral. I don’t know how I coped with this for 3 years",2020-05-08 18:06:46
2238,hopefulredditor69,1588924891,1,"Dear r/lonely,

I've been lonely for awhile, honestly. Although, I guess I didn't realize how lonely I was until recently.

I only have one friend. I'm not exaggerating, I really only have one friend. He's not a very good friend; he treats me like shit, but I'm sticking with him because I have nobody else. I don't think he'd bat an eye if I killed myself- but hey, at least I can play games with him during this quarentine.

Me and my ex-girlfriend broke up in July, around the middle of the month. At first, it was mostly her hurting, and I was actually happy because it was unhealthy. Recently, roles reversed, and I realized how much I miss her. Miss having someone, maybe- or maybe it was the feeling of being hugged, or loved, or that someone in this godforsaken world gives a crap about you. We actually started talking, called a few times to support her when she was in the dumps, and I think I fucked that up when I mentioned how lonely I was. I guess sometimes, the healer doesn't get healed. She hasn't talked to me since. 

I constantly get reminders of how fucking lonely I am everywhere I go. In the hospital, when I was rushed in, the first thing I realized is there was nobody next to my bed with me. I started tearing up. When I'm driving and I stumble across a field, I picture me and the love of my life staring off into the sunrise. The roads might be a little less lonely with a hand in mine, and it gets unbearable to drive. I used to love cinematography, but I've been longing for an assistant and friend to accompany me to the point where every time I turn the camera on, my smile fades and I promptly shut it off again. Every night I lie in bed, picturing all the things I would love to do one day- hiking, exploring the outdoors, buying a house with a lot of rural land, campfires, beach parties and bonfires, cruising, just hanging the hell out inside and playing videogames. It's a shame that I have nobody to do any of these things with. Honestly, not even a girlfriend- a friend. I just want a friend.

I'm a 17 year old guy who has very few memories throughout my childhood with friends. I always spent time online, doing things on my own- occasionally I'd talk to someone for a few months and then never again. Actually, I had a lot of friends online in 8th grade- our friend group deteriorated when one of us decided not to keep fighting and gave in to the darkness. It hurts to this day, I wish I could've saved her. I was the last person she talked to. Fucks sake.

I never had nerf gun wars with friends. I never went to a friend's house to play games. Never had sleepovers. Never ran around in the woods. Never did the things kids do. Never got to grow old with the same friend group. Never been to a god damn party. Only had one real relationship- I made a lot of mistakes.

I just want to end this loneliness. I can't take it anymore. I lay in bed for hours looking around and just imagining all the happy memories I could make if I had friends, or a partner. All the experiences we could share. All the moments I would cherish. But, I don't know if that'll ever truly happen. It feels like this loneliness will never end.

A few things that I've dreamed about (either in actual dreams or daydreamed) recently, maybe some of these sound cool to some of you guys:

\-renting a cabin for a few days with friends in a forest/in the woods, looking up at the stars as we sit around a campfire until past midnight, nobody else around- just us, and maybe a few deer  
\-going on a roadtrip with a full car of people to the deserts, or mountains, or any fucking where far from the city, listening to songs and singing along and telling stories as the road stretches on and on  
\-anybody ever explored a sewer tunnel? those seem dope as hell. i've always wanted to find a few friends to explore with.  
\-i kinda already said this, but sunrise. any sunrise. ANY FUCKING WHERE. just watching the sun rise, maybe at a waterfall, or a big field, the top of a mountain- fuck it, rooftop. i love sunrises  
\-for some reason, midwest breakfast restaurants early in the morning sound dope as fuck to me.  
\-also exploring small towns, like a fishing town. taking a boat onto the water and meeting some fishermen. cooking our own damn food, because why the hell not  
\-honestly playing videogames with a few people all night long sounds fun. or maybe a movie night. or anything. popcorn, mnm's, hot chocolate. bonus points if we all leave at 3am to go on a walk around town. Walking is dope as hell.  


I wonder, if I will ever escape this loneliness... if I'll ever find the right girl for me, the girl of my dreams. Someone who loves nature as much as I do, if not more. Someone who holds true to herself, and always works at her aspirations. Someone who loves cameras too, and maybe we could start a youtube channel. Someone obsessed with meeting new people and making friends and memories, and maybe we could make a bucket list together. Someone who would just say yes, even if it's a bit daunting, like skydiving. Someone who I would eventually grow old with and have kids and raise them to follow their dreams and tell them about my amazing memories I made. Someone who has been to hell and back yet always has a positive mindset. heh, the kind of girl to ask where the souvenir shop in hell is, and laugh it off while everyone is staring at her. Someone with a damn bold personality that loves herself and, of course, me.

I wonder if I'll ever find a friend. Maybe two, or three, or four. Virtual is cool and all, but someone in person. Someone who's got my fucking back, even if they don't agree with me. Someone who's always down to try new things and experiment and travel and take goofy photos with me. Someone who would always listen, and support. Someone who cares. A group I feel at home with.

I don't know if that makes sense. I don't know if anyone will read this. If you did, thank you. I'll end it now. I'm going to go on google maps and explore small towns, something I love doing. If anyone else loves small towns, or traveling, or nature, or I'd love to talk about them- or anything, honestly. I love talking to people.

I hope you have a nice evening.

With love,

It all started it 10th grade, when I accidentally pushed a younger black girl, but from that point on, I was seen as the ""crazy abusive black guy"" for the rest of HS, and it only fizzled out during my final year there, during which I was practically on autopilot.

See, I'm what you'd call a big black guy, but I'm only 5'8. I have broad shoulders, and am generally heavyset, but I'd never hurt anyone on purpose. But because of this one incident, I ended up hating the place. Compounding this was my Mild Autism, which made everyone see me as a joke. Nobody even dined to get my side of the story either; they just thought of me as someone crazy and insane. Hell, the most of the black girls there ran away from me because of this. It's because of this I feel no attraction towards black women in the present day.

Now when I got to college, I shed most of the things I did in HS, but I did want some sort of girlfriend. After 3 years of college, one of those being in a college town, I haven't had any meaningful friendship, and all the friends and women in my life have either left me, or just stop contacting me. The only people I'm in contact with are my family.

This quarantine, I've taken to reflecting on those days, and, from childhood, I was told, ""God is good, all the time,"" so on and so forth. Well if that's true, WHY DID HE MAKE ME SUFFER THOUGH 4 YEARS OF BULLSHIT?! And that's just it, right? It's bullshit. There's no force above that can reward people for being good, or punish people for being bad. If they had, those heartless people would have understood the real me, not what some perpetrated image based on one incident did.

2245,StarSpangledHuck,1588919915,1,"For as long as I can remember I’ve had RBF; even in the very few baby photos of me I’ve seen I’m only smiling in one of them. This was only compounded by the fact I had jacked up teeth for most of my young life which caused me to smile even less. Because of all of this I never developed a good smile. Whenever I smile my eyes, which are small to begin with, look like they’re closed and my cheeks puff up and get real big and it looks grotesque. Normally come school picture time I would turn in my proofs the next day without even showing them to my parents; now they don’t have any of my school pictures and I feel bad for it. Then my senior year of high school all I wanted was for all of my senior pictures to look good.  I would sit for hours fixing my hair just perfect and smiling at myself in the mirror trying to memorize how it felt so that way I’d look normal when I got my picture taken. It all went downhill when we got our band pictures taken. I was in drum line so we got our pictures taken last, and of course we were being yelled at and rushed through our pictures even though the photo company were the ones who had showed up nearly an hour late. The photographer every year would mess with my hair even though I had spent so much time trying to keep it the way I wanted it, and he always would spend so much time trying to get me to smile with my teeth. I figured I’d try to smile with my teeth the way I had practiced and it only bit me in the ass. When my band director passed out our pictures the next week I started crying a little, I’m an ugly crier so I try my best to not cry in public. I gave them to my mom anyways because it was my senior year and I felt bad for not taking my pictures home before. Later in the school year I had prom pictures made by the photographer the school had hired to take pictures at prom. I thought I had finally got a break and had a good picture taken of me, but because of my braces that I couldn’t get off until after prom I look toothless. Finally someone had taken a perfectly good picture of my only for it to be ruined once again. I’ve been out of high school for years but it all still makes me mad. 

I still have the same problems today. I get up and get ready for the day and I look perfectly fine in the mirror, but whenever a picture gets taken of me I look horrible. I’ve been trying to push my jaw forward a little bit to override my overbite, because in the mirror it makes my jawline more prominant and my double chin not as noticeable. Turns out it just makes me look like an inbred. My boss made me go with her to get our picture taken for some PR stuff for the company we work for a few months ago, and I’m still scared to look at them. Everyone around me tells me I look fine in all of my photos and it makes me wonder if I really look as bad in real life as I think I do in photos. Maybe everyone else thinks I look fine because those pictures just look like normal old me to them.

2250,why-henlo-there,1588916841,1,"(Throwaway account)

I met one of my friends about four years ago (our freshman year of high school). I really valued our friendship a lot, and I naively thought we were going to be best friends throughout all four years of high school.

Fast forward to the beginning of our sophomore year. While we're talking, she brings up about how she has a crush on this guy. I tease her about it, and she goes something along the lines of, ""Oh, but he's never going to notice me... It's just nice to like someone, you know?"" 

A month goes by, and we're a little more distant, since we didn't have any classes together. I find out that her crush asked her to the Homecoming dance, so they're going together. 

As happy as I was for her, I was also going through a lot of personal stuff myself around the same time. I was in a really dark place at the time (intense flashbacks, thoughts of self-harm, a constant physical feeling of what felt like a layer of frost around my heart). 

I was desperate for someone to talk to, and I didn't want to feel like I was burdening my friend while she was on Cloud 9. So I never told her what I was going through. In retrospect, it was on me for not telling her what I was going through, but I still can't help but feel betrayed that she wasn't there for me when I needed a friend the most.

Time passed, they eventually became official, and I slowly recovered from my depression. We both started drifted apart, hanging out with different people. We still talked occasionally, as I still acknowledge our friendship.

Knowing the type of person that her boyfriend was, I knew that he wasn't good for her. But I never commented on their relationship because she was head-over-heels for him. In fact, she became good friends with all of his friends and joined most of the extracurriculars that he was in. She unintentionally yet noticeably started ignoring me. Because of this, I developed a growing secret resentment for her, feeling betrayed.

Fast forward to junior year. We're definitely not as close as we used to be, but we catch up one day. I tell her that I've developed feelings for a guy who seemed to like me back. She tells me that she recently broke up with her (now ex-)boyfriend. I give her my sympathy, as it seemed like she was going through a really rough patch.

We both move on with our high school lives, she slowly got over her breakup, and I slowly lose feelings for the guy I liked. 

Senior year rolls around. We're hardly talking at all, but I still remember our friendship. She doesn't seem to remember it at all; I'm almost invisible to her. Eventually I find out that she's started dating again. Guess who it was? The guy that I used to like. Even though I didn't have feelings for him anymore, it stung a lot, knowing that she had forgotten all about me.

That was when I realized how little she cared about me. In retrospect, she hasn't been a good friend to me at all. There's a lot of stuff I've left out, but personality-wise, I now realize how shallow and toxic she is and that she doesn't deserve my friendship. 

I'm not sure how much of my perspective I got across, but I just really needed to vent. Thanks.

TL;DR: 
Throughout high school, 
- a ""friend"" of mine ignores me after she gets a boyfriend, 
- I feel abandoned and alone during a time when I needed a friend the most, and
- my ""friend"" starts dating the guy she knew I liked.",lonely,It sucks when a friend turns their back on you without even realizing it.,2020-05-08 15:47:21

2265,conaw05,1588908021,1,"          Hello,  and a boy. For the past 2 years at school I have been told by many people I look like a school shooter, even though I am a nice person and I would never do anything even close to harming anyone. I have social anxiety so it's making it worse. I have talked to adults but my school didnt do shit, my parents called the police for advice but the school still didnt do anything. I'm always called ugly, people laugh because I've never had a girlfriend. I've started weightlifting but I'm still skinny so I'm not ready for a fight. I have hobbies that I enjoy like helping my dad work on our car but none of that matters, my parents both look average if not above average so why am I ugly/look like a school shooter? I have tried to just ignore it but it's impossible when people send me messages asking if they should come to school. I have had friends say they are my friend ""just in case"". I dont want to homeschool at all because I enjoy school and I dont want to take the easy way in life but I just dont know what to do. I was excited today because I'm getting a new TV and exhaust for my car but now I'm just sad that people are continuing to say this stuff, I try to have confidence and at one point I was happy with myself but this just shat all that away. Thank you.",lonely,I'm always told I look like a school shooter.,2020-05-08 13:20:21

We have so many things in common, we both struggle with depression and can enjoy each other presence. We've engaged in sexual acts but my depression has taken whatever sex drive I had left and I'm not able to have sex with her because of that and it's been over two weeks since we've done anything sexual. She took so long to clarify what we are and wants me to be in the middle of her and whoever she wants to have sex with but remain while giving her love, attention and emotional support as I've been doing. I feel that she's intentionally keeping me in the dark so can I keep on coming back to her but I am so emotionally exhausted and hurt, she's aware but I don't think she truly cares at the end of the day, This past saturday she had sex with her boxing coach and last night she spent night at his place and hasn't been back since. Tuesday morning I saw the hickies on her and that broke me and I haven't really spoken to her since then. She demands or at least expects me to be there for her regardless of me hurting and is pissed at me for not wanting to do that. I get that she wants to have meaningless sex but I've been transparent with how I feel and what I want. I told her to take her time but practically insists that I stick around. I would rather be alone and lonely rather than to be with her as she pleases whilst feeling hurt and alone. Shouldn't relationships be a two way street?

Here goes..

I’m a 28M gay married that recently left my entire life, family, job and little circle of close friends behind to move to Paris with my french husband together because of his work. It was easy for me when we left because partly i spent 4 years working in a job that an acquaintance that became my then best friend introduced. Long story short, we couldn’t be friends anymore after four years because he changed alot after breaking up with his boyfriend and work became a very toxic environment with alot of petty &amp; toxic co-workers drama sorts. I just ended up having fewer friends over the years because i’m constantly disappointed by people with the amount of effort they put in to maintain friendships (i’m a very loyal friend) Perhaps this reason also made me feel disconnected with people.

Its been 6 months since we left my home country and recently after my birthday have passed, i received almost no news from my “friends” that made me realize i am truly utterly alone in a new city where no ones speak English as their first language. I am friends with my husband’s friends here in Paris but i don’t feel connected or relate to them even though i knew them for couple years. I spoke alot to my husband about how we both feels and he understands what i’m going through but i don’t think he can truly and fully relate what i’m going through.
I began to slowly find my own comfort in being alone, i deactivated my social medias for the sake of my own mental health, my husband works alot and most of these days we probably have like 2 hours of interactions before we go to bed and the cycle repeats. Since I’m still not a fluent french speaker, i can’t find a job in Paris (they couldn’t care less i am bilingual in English and Mandarin) in a luxury brand if i can’t interact in french. Most of my days i feel like i’m stuck in a timeloop since with the quarantine, i just play Animal Crossing and some games, some reading and wait for my husband to return from work which is usually late (8-9pm).

These six months in Paris made me realize i have no one that can relate how i feel to talk about. I don’t regret leaving my country since i always hated it, there was too many bad experiences growing up living there. I speak with my two other close friends and my family from time to time, i do miss being home where these people are also the anchor of my life. 

Would love to hear and know some people here that left their entire live to move into a foreign country for their partner and still trying to find their own person and place.",lonely,"I’m not okay, and that’s okay.",2020-05-08 07:05:36

2303,SDphotoshoot,1588870282,2,"Raise of hands: how many of you have ever felt so lonely that you post something on social media just to feel a connection? I know I have. I believe it's one big motivating factor why I have used social media. And I don't think I'm alone.

I have a theory that much of what people post on social media -- whether it's a selfie on instagram, a political opinion on Twitter, or a post you share on Facebook -- is intrinsically related to the desire to feel connected and validated. Someone likes your post, therefore they validate your existence/presence. 

Of course, seeking validation is NOT the only reason why people post on social media, but I think it's a big one. Viral content is a manifestation of a widely shared emotion whether it's anger, frustration, compassion, sense of humor, etc. A big reason why something goes viral on social media is because a lot of people share the same point of view or experience. So, as someone who has had their own post/tweet go viral, I can attest to the feeling of being validated. My post went viral therefore my thoughts and feelings were validated by a large number of people; therefore my thoughts and feelings are real and relevant.

I think validation and acceptance and understanding are necessary for a healthy self-esteem. But often times posting negativity on social media can mean validating negative feelings that don't need to be reinforced. Social media isn't specifically designed to bring out the best in us; it's designed to reverberate the stuff that we share in common -- whether it's a mutual hate for something or a mutual love for something. 

I have no hope for social media -- I think social media platforms will continue to evolve into tools of oppression -- but I do have hope for humanity and people's capacity to seek and validate the best in each other, whether it's liking a post or letting someone know that they are not alone.",lonely,Validation in social media,2020-05-08 02:51:22

Everyone likes me. They think I’m funny and that makes want to make my classmates laugh even more. They all say they think I’m cool.

But I only have one person in my entire school I consider my friend. I had more but they dropped our friend group and left and now I just hang out with my one friend. I just don’t understand. People say they want to be closer to me but when I make attempts they just don’t really do anything about it. It’s the last year everyone has their cliques already.

I have so little friends. It’s so hard to find people to talk to. I talk to my cousins and my DND group. And that’s it. (And even then I’m kinda the odd one out of the rpg group, everyone else is neighbors with each other and knew each other before hand).

Why does everyone in my class say they love me but never want to actually hang out with me? I’ve tried. My class jokes about me as being the sarcastic introvert that hates everyone because that’s how I came across freshman year. God that’s so far from the truth. I’m extroverted and want to talk to people. I want to be friends with everyone and love my classmates. But no one believes me when I tell them that. They don’t believe me when I say I would absolutely hang out with them after school. I just can’t drive and it’s hard for me to go places.

My friends would consider me the ""therapist"" of the friend group because they think I'm good at advice and am usually mentally stable. Last night was different for some reason. quarantine has been pretty good so far until yesterday. I'm one of those introverted extroverts, I love to be social but it takes a lot out of me sometimes. Anyway, I was pretty down for some reason so I texted my friends to play a game of fortnite. They said they were down, but I got busy while working out and missed a text from my friend to hop online. 30 minutes later I called them to play and my friend said to me, ""my schedule doesn't revolve around you"" and ended the call. I had done nothing wrong, but this was typical of my guy friends. My girl ALWAYS comes thru, so I texted her. I told her about the guys and she was being dry because she had told me she was watching a show on Netflix. So I told her straight up, ""I feel like a burden and no one wants to talk to me"". At this point, I expected her to call me and talk it out because that's our thing. I had a rude awakening apparently... she told me to ""embrace the loneliness"" and to get busy with youtube or something. I felt teary-eyed. Was it really that hard to get one friend to just talk to me? For the rest of the night, I was just left with my thoughts until one of my other girls came through. One who isn't even as close to me was the one to call and check-up. The next morning I woke up and my best friend texts me about something stupid and my blood began to boil. I told her I was frustrated and she apologized genuinely. Why do I still feel resentful and hurt? Why am I crying writing this?

I'm fairly new to Reddit other than the pewdiepie submissions thread but here I am, just a 16-year-old girl venting about life so here I go. 

I'm someone who takes school super seriously, and I have a tight group of friends that are the same. Most days during quarantine I'm doing homework from the moment i wake up until 4, and then i call my friends and we play fortnite together or I go for a bike ride or smg. Honestly, quarantine has been good for me mentally until last night. I'm one of those ""introverted extroverts"", I love being social but sometimes it takes a lot out of me. I have a really good family life thank god but sometimes I just need someone to talk to that isn't my mom or sister. So around 5 pm yesterday I texted my friend group's GC asking to play fortnite later that night. everyone replies and says that sounds good, so I carry on with work and whatever until the night. I got a little busy working out around 9 and missed a text from my guy friend asking me to hop on. I text back and let him know I got busy but I'm ready to play now, so I call him and my other friend. They answer, and the moment I even have the chance to start a conversation with them they're telling me they ""can't play fortnite"" and I was like what do you mean 30 minutes ago you were online. He told me "" I don't care my schedule doesn't revolve around you"" and they both leave me as if I did something awful. At this point, I was feeling really down and so so lonely. why did they have to ditch me like that after working so hard all day to talk to them at night? I guess that's what I get for talking to the guy friends, is what I told myself. My girlfriend ALWAYS comes through so I texted her. I told her what the guys said to me and she was being so dry about it so I was just getting more and more hurt as it went on until I told her how I was feeling.

I even have a girlfriend, sort of. 

Together six years now.

Its been amazing but its been hard. We have been long distance the entire time only seeing each other a few times a year. 

A half decade of struggling would always be worth it knowing that once we could close the distance, everything would make sense. 

However, I am not okay. That is hard to admit. I have not been for some time now. 

I live alone, hundreds of miles away from anyone that is more than an acquaintance. I hardly speak to family and friends and I certainly do not tell them how I have been deteriorating for years now. 

Its simply not as easy as just speak your truths. It’s not. 

I have told her everything so many times and if she doesn’t realize it then how will anyone else?

The past several months have become impossibly desperate. 

My girlfriend and I, we are complete strangers at this point. At least in my opinion. 

I have invested my entire adult life into a future with her and when I need her the most, I feel like she has vanished. 

We talk sometimes, an hour, maybe two or three a week. That’s when I beg and plead, but I have begged myself into a mental drought with no remaining energy. 

While doing so I have also managed to push her another arm’s length away. 

I don’t dare tell the few friends I trust and talk to regularly. I feel like none of them care enough to ever even ask so how much genuine care would they have after being told. 

These days my life is spiraling extremely quickly. 

I spend all my days waiting to get a text back from her or maybe even a call.

I have forsaken my schoolwork; I will undoubtedly fail every class this semester. 

I never went to work so I got fired. 

My apartment is a complete disaster and probably a health concern.

I cannot focus on anything anymore, except for how alone I truly am. 

I feel like my world is ending because I’m missing one person, the one I care for most. It has left me in such a lonely place I cannot even describe it. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t even understand how to exist or who or what I have become. 

I had everything going for me and now I cannot even imagine what tomorrow will be. 

I do not know what went wrong, why I am so alone every second even when I play games with a friend.

Mid twenties living alone in a metropolitan city, family is in another country (we were never close anyways, I’ve never really been around them for long even as a child so culturally we are so different).

my closest friends are people who I knew in high school and college who are they themselves mostly focusing on their own lives, they’ve got kids and girlfriends and for 3 years now since i left school I can count on my hands the number of times we hang out and none of them weren’t proposed by me. They aren’t bad people they just have their own things going and can’t be expected to drop it to make me feel less lonely, in that time I have tried (without success) to build a new social life, I’ve made some friends here and there but no one I can say is a consistent friend I hang out with. 

Admittedly I haven’t been the best at putting my social life at front as center of my life and a for at least the first two years I was mostly concerned with my job because failing that / losing it literally means homelessness because I don’t just have a family I can go to and try figure things out.

Another thing I’ve failed miserably at has been dating,I can’t even begin to get into that but trust me it’s nothing you haven’t heard of before but to try be a bit more specific it’s not out of luck of working on myself. I gym regularly and all that.

The point of this post(sorry you had to read so much), a few days ago I had this huge fight with someone I’d been trying to date but things didn’t work out then we were trying to be friends but essentially I expressed my loneliness (big mistake it’s never a good move) and her response can’t pretty much be summed up to: 

I put so too much energy into wanting a gf(and it’s really unattractive), There is “more to life”..

Lots of thoughts sprung off of this but after days of contemplation i think the one thing I need to figure out first is what’s “more to life”

So I’m gonna throw in a few ideas and you tell me if I’m maybe missing something:

I have a degree and don’t intend on studying more
I have a stable enough job that pays me well enough to live a very comfortable life
I have a big passion for art (I now draw at least 3 hours a day) 
I play a lot of games (playing Persona 5 right now good)
I’m in the beginning stages of starting a gaming company with an old friend of mine (basically my closest friend, we don’t hang out too much but we’ve known each other forever).
I have a bookshelf full of books
I also have a keen interest in film and spend a lot of time watching movies and whatnot
I exercises regularly and take care of my body and my image /presentation 


So because of all this I’ve never felt like I’m lacking in terms of life goals and passions and hobbies and interests. I’m never bored, I never have nothing to do, I’m not lost in life.

But is that just what I’m telling myself? Maybe there’s “more to life” means aspects I’ve never thought of? What what will make me stop checking my phone for msgs only to be disappointed? What will make me turn away in sadness when I see couples? 

What are people doing to not feel lonely?",lonely,What’s this “more to life” that’s supposed to make me feel less lonely?,2020-05-07 14:19:46

Next down the line is Tu the God of War, like Tangaroa, Tu had agreed to the separation of his parents and had much more influence on the creation of the world then Uru, Whiro and Tawhiri did, when the Sky father and earth mother were finally forced apart and Tawhiri launched his war of vengeance upon his brothers, all the gods fled to their own independent realms and hid away, all except Tu, Who stood firmly against the Storms of his older brother Tawhiri, he repelled them so fiercely that when Tawhiri finally left he alone stood on the battle. So infuriated by the cowardice of his Siblings who fled from the fight Tu sought to teach them a lesson that they would never forget. He tore the trees of Tane the god of the forest apart to make weapons of war as well as  spears and traps so that he could hunt and slay Tane's bird like progeny, he wove nets and fishing lines to catch and eat all of Tangaroa's children, he made baskets and built gardening tools to assault his Youngest brothers Rongo the god of cultivated foods and Haumie the God of wild foods, he harvested their plant like children before devouring them on mass.

Like I am not exaggerating when we were texting all day and it seemed very natural and easygoing. In fact, she even said, ""I love our conversations."" We showed each other our childhood photos and laughed, learned how to pronounce each other's names, I mean it was natural. We connected on a deep level and generally had the very same thought process...or so I thought. Like it was a wholesome conversation until this morning. We talked for a bit, then I got left on read on text...then we snapped, I got left on read on snap...and basically any other app we were having conversations on.

2355,Clayseus,1588820037,1,"Some bad things: I'm a damn loser. I've pissed away high school. I'm apathetic, a procrastinator, socially awkward and isolated, neurotic, play too many video games, have 0 skills (see the last thing), I hate my damn stupid ass voice (I sound differently than I do in my head), and I'm so fucking angry. 

Some good things: I'm active, pretty naturally smart, good-looking (at least from what my parents tell me b/c hell will freeze over before anyone else does), and I stick to my morals.

I think the whole having friends things happened when I wasn't looking and everyone had already gotten into their own cliques. I went to a private school with a class size of about 50ish kids, so I had to spend k-8th grade being pretty isolated. Sure I talked to people. I got enough social interaction in a day as to not go insane, but I didn't really have many friends. I did have ONE. He transferred to my school in 8th grade and we got pretty close, but then high school came along and we drifted apart (mostly because he was smarter than me so he took higher level classes and he joined theater which I will never be brave enough to do something like that). 

So life goes on. Freshman year I did cross country and track so I got some decent social interaction during the summer because of training. If it wasn't for summer training I'd have been a mess going insane about having to show up to a school with a freshman class size 5 times the size of mine. Once again, cliques formed almost immediately and I was left by myself. At this point, I didn't realize how truly lonely I was. I didn't have very good social skills. You know, the ones normal kids develop in grade school. I was terrified of embarrassing myself. I spent weekends by myself. I never went to sports games because I hated watching sports (mostly because all the guys are damn meatheads. I mean if I liked them and they were cool guys then I'd go, but most of them were arrogant chads who get all the girls and who got laid at the age of 10). 

The first couple years of high school were pretty bleak for me. I gave up on everyone. I didn't care anymore. If I were to be alone, then so be it. One of my classmates was in Newspaper and he did a web show (he was actually pretty good. He's a dick though. Somehow, someway he gets whatever he wants even if he breaks rules and everyone is fooled. they absolutely adore him. Anyway, he kept asking me to be on his video and I decline time and time again. This was mostly due to me being vindictive (If I had something he wanted, then I wouldn't give it to him for the reasons I mentioned previously). I realize I was being kind of a dick and I felt bad for him sometimes, but I doubled down. This experience made me realize that I push people away. I think I do that because I don't want them to get over the walls I've built for myself. I'm safe in my walls. I feel like if anyone does get through, then they won't want to be with me anymore because I don't have much to provide in the way of friendship.

Oh and confidence doesn't really emanate from me. My biggest source of confidence came from running because I'm decent at it, so I kinda obsess over it. 

The coronavirus really demasked everything for me. School switched to e-learning, so I'm at home all the time. I don't talk to anyone outside my family. I've realized that I've been stuck in my own head for so damn long. I just want someone I can speak my mind to and they wouldn't freak out or think differently of me. I want to go beyond small talk, but I'm so damn anxious. I try sometimes, but I get discouraged and give up easily. Trying to get social skills later in life is extremely difficult. I get nervous and sweaty when I talk to people. 

Sometimes, I'll meet someone new and a thing that I really fucking hate happens (this happened mostly during freshman year). For example, a girl comes up to me (I naturally get nervous and sweaty and avoid eye contact). I struggle through the small talk (""hey, what's up, how are you, what's your name, what classes do you have,"" etc, etc.). Then It gets quiet. I can't maintain the conversation. And she had the most disappointed look on her face. Like ""wow this guy's a loser."" I think the disappointment comes from my appearance because I'm 5'8 (I realize that's not tall, but it's taller than most girls so cut me some slack), skinny, and not ugly. The point still stands that that look on her face absolutely destroys my soul. 

That concludes my vent. I could say much more, but I feel a little better now and things are a little clearer. If only I could say all this face to face to someone. May or may not actually post this, but I think I'll save a copy for the future idk.",lonely,"18 yo, lonely, high functioning depression [vent]",2020-05-07 12:53:57

Not knowing what to say and not being confident in my appearance, I reluctantly kept driving. I looked in my rear view mirror and I saw him look back. I wonder if he felt something too. 

I’m probably just being too lonely and too hopelessly romantic.

Anyway, it's really hard on me right now being in the food industry. I'm in a position where I receive bi-weekly sales quotes on a bunch of different meats, but for this it's about beef. 
Now, last week It's up to me to not only calculate how much I'm cutting off to make sure I can cut steaks and still make a profit, but I also have to be the one to tell our marketing lady that we have to increase prices and then do so... And then this week  beef went up again even more this time and we had to increase our prices even more. It's insane I feel so bad the cost of our beef is up 35-40%. 
My wife works in the same place as me so she gets it, but i can't rant to her about this kind of stuff... And I don't really have anyone that I can talk to about this so I just wanted to put this out there--that I do feel really bad all the time about this. 
Since the covid pandemic started I've had to work more and more and sales keep going up and up, so we're busier and busier.  I've been fortunate to not have gotten sick being in retail but every single day I wake up early, I play Animal Crossing for 30 minutes to an hour before I have to get ready to go to work again...and every time I just wish I had gotten sick just so I didn't have to go in even for a day...
We're open 7 days a week now and I technically get 2 days off a week but either I have to go in for a meeting on my day off or I have to make sure the shipment I ordered gets in alright so we can catch up on keeping the front of the store stocked with meat and I'm just so tired... And lonely all the time.
I never feel like doing anything when I get off my anywhere from 8 to 11 hour shift and my wife craves attention when I just want to sleep and then she wakes me up at night from her snoring and I usually have to get up and move to another room or something just to get more rest instead of being completely sleep deprived.

Usually most guys don't check on each other I get that but, when I was first diagnosed they would always check in on me always be there for me and let me vent... 

Another thing that prob contributes to me feeling lonely all the time was because I've dated 3 girls so far and I've been cheated on by two of them. My dad always said be there for your girlfriends and support them, which I did. I would always make them brownies and bring some to school and give it to them if they had a break down and such.... I know I may sound like a nice guy here but like I do all this shit, and I get my heart fucking stabbed like the fuck.    I just feel so God damn lonely, I miss cuddling and watching movies, and just doing shitt. I just miss having someone who cares about me and having someone to care about it's driving me crazy.

And yes, we know, the name is ridiculous, that's the point.

**What Do We Do?**

We are a mainly voice-active community, so we spend most of our time chatting together while we play games or go about our day. We run weekly movie and music nights, occasional game nights, Minecraft server, and other seasonal events. There’s plenty of text and media channels to share your interests as well as a variety of voice channels for larger or smaller conversations, watching movies, or playing video games together.

**Should You Join?**

The Glory Hole has provided us with genuine and long-lasting friendships, and we would love to provide this opportunity to others such as yourself.

2426,coreyp2,1588756742,1,"I’ve been battling with depression and suicidal thoughts for about 2 years now. The main reason for these thoughts is that I choose to distance myself from my alcoholic father, he was such a great dad and always super supportive.

I am now living with my mom and younger sister, my moms side of the family is just my grandparents and my Unkle, I’ve lost all my family connections and I’m really in pain. I’m living with so much constant regret and self hate, everyday is a real struggle. I’ve also recently lost my bf from an overdose, the whole situation is a living nightmare! The amount of fakeness in this world makes me sick to my stomach, everyone around me is acting like they were always there for my bf when they really weren’t. I’ve recently lost weight when I had no weight to loose and I’ve now lost fat under and next to both of my eyes which has just made me want to kill myself even more. Nothing in this cruel world makes me happy or to continue going through all this pain. I know how much pain and sadness my family would feel if I were to harm myself and that’s the only thing that’s keeping me alive rn.

Ever since I was 15 and had my first boyfriend being in a loving and caring relationship is always the only thing on my mind. 

Now I’m 24 years old, I have a few friends but none that are closer than anyone else. I have never had a job, I don’t have further education. I can’t drive. And I’m a full time, single, stay at home mum. I find it really hard to talk to people because I don’t have anything good to actually talk about. When I meet new people somehow all my conversations end up discussing the toxic relationships I’ve had and all my bad experiences. People seem disinterested in the one thing that actual has brought me great joy in  life which was the day I gave birth to my boy. I can’t seem to stand on the line being overly enthusiastic and boring. 

More than anything I still just want to be with someone that cares about us who won’t leave. I have a big fear of rejection closely rivalled with my fear of being alone. I’ve never had a close relationship with anyone except for my mother. Friends, family, partners they all tend to part ways or leave without much warning.

It’s really starting to have a big impact on every thought and everyday. I feel so lonely and hurt all the time. So much so I’m posting this crap on the internet when I otherwise wouldn’t. But I feel I’ve said it so many times to people that just have heard it too many times to care anymore.

I'm 27. I grew up in a hyper religious environment. Sex was always something not talked about, or shamed. Sexual desires were absolutely something not talked about. If you had them you wern't suppose to enjoy them  unless you were married. 

Well, Now I'm an adult with very little sexual experience, and even less actually discussing it. Basically I just want to get to know a woman who is comfortable with her sexuality and doesn't hide it. In my mind a part of me still struggles to believe that yes, women really do also like sex, talk about it, and arn't ashamed of it. (I know some are but I'm speaking about those that arn't).

One of the best ways to get over prejudices is to get to know people the prejudice was against. I'm not saying I have a crazy prejudice against people who are sexually active, even extremly casually. Mentally I don't think there is anything wrong with it, but there is still this little emotional hangup somtimes. I know from other things in my life that the solution is to just get to know people.

2448,hamartiated,1588735446,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-05-06 13:24:06

I guess the only real reason motivating me to go through with this is to find others like me and start a friendship. And maybe save myself   from constantly deteriorating my mind or worse, I don’t know. Anyways, my name is Jordan. I am a 17 year old dude in high school from Massachusetts. Just like many other mentally unfit people, I constantly have mood shifts, constantly tear myself down, constantly overthink, constantly get irritated, etc. Life’s almost always miserable for ME. The little moments that are joyful dont last, they never do for ME atleast.  Every night before I go to bed I wish I wouldn’t wake up the next morning and when I do, I just sigh.  The reason I emphasized “me” is because I don’t think life is miserable in general. I think some people are a great match for this world, this society and deserve to prosper. In the same sense, I also believe the “little guy”, the “weak” aren’t “strong” enough to thrive. I consider myself the weak. Not physically  but mentally. Think about it in a survival of the fittest sense. Its much deeper than being physically stronger and bigger than the next guy, it’s more than that in today’s world. Maybe this thought process will change in the future (doubt it)  but I believe I don’t serve a purpose in the world and would better off not existing. I mean that in a realist way, not a depressed way. Im taking up space, resources, time, etc. I used to think differently when I was younger. My family was together and I had support all around me. Then the divorce, then the moving, then the custody, then the blah blah blah everyone goes through that. But what makes this situation different is the religion I was brought up in. It fucked me up no doubt. I don’t feel comfortable saying the name of it publicly but some call it a cult. Let’s just say I’m beginning to cry just talking about it. On the surface, it looks like an incredibly loving organization but don’t let it trick you, dont let it pull you in. I was one of the lucky ones to break out of its grasp. The organization and its “elders” have the power to destroy families. Absolutely shreds them apart. It Brainwashes people into thinking narrowly and in premodern ways. My dad is the only one I’m my immediate family to have left as well but it took him 40 years. I’ve been away since I was about 13. I don’t want to make this any longer than it needs to be but if anyone wants to know more then we can talk privately about it. Just know that was a huge part of my life that has fucked me up in unimaginable ways. Fundamentalist religion is dangerous I’ve seen I first hand. I don’t necessarily believe god DOESNT exist but I don’t have enough evidence to conclude that god does exist IN THE WAY THAT MANY RELIGIONS PORTRAY HIM. I believe there is a higher power, maybe a simulation? I don’t know. Im always looking for an answer and I don’t think I will ever find one but it’s ok. If anyone ever tells you they have the answer to life, to god, take that as a red flag. Open mindedness— I’m always open to listen to anyone or organization INCLUDING this fundamentalist religion I was apart of as a child, HOWEVER I’m not going to be told what to think or how to think. I believe you should go where evidence leads. The only evidence I have leads me to believe this is the only life we have we die for good after it. I will not spend my life slaving away for a religion to prepare for after life when there is no logical evidence to support that. As you can probably tell I’m enthusiastic about this topic. It’s because it has mentally raped me multiple times. This post is already all over the place and it’ll continue to be that way. I’m not very organized with my thoughts. Here’s some context to my current point in life as we speak. I live alone above my grandparents complex since I was 16. My dad lives in Canada/ Boston, MA (he is on his third marriage to a good women who lives in Canada but also has family in the US which he comes back bi weekly to see, LOTS of traveling, he also works for top universities as an IT consultant and specialist, he has helped me through a lot and has always supported me ), My mom lives in North Carolina with my stepdad (She is still part of the religion and she is l extremely fucked up mentally but she doesn’t realize it’s because of the religion because they brainwash their members, it’s sad, I’ve tried to break her out but she is too deep in, id love to talk about this “too deep in” concept if anyone would like to talk about it). My mom is a good women as heart but she has many issues that make me slightly resent her but I know she needs help but won’t accept it. She wanted me to come to NC with her but my life is here (in Mass) so I stayed. My two older sisters are in the same city as me in their own apartments and are still part of the religion. One is deeply indoctrinated and one thinks just like me (very logically, evidence based) EXEPT when it comes to the religion which is absolutely mind boggling to me. She says things that completely contradict the religion but is very deep in the organization. Once again, the power of fundamentalist religion and the brainwashing tactics they use. (Once again starting to tear up, it hurts seeing your family suffer because of the organization yet it’s not even a option to be the root of their pain to them because of the indoctrination they’ve been subjected to which leads to to constantly be playing a game of cat and mouse with their emotions in which they will play until their death, WHICH IVE SEEN MULTIPLE TIMES as recent as my other grandfathers death. COGNITIVE DISSONANCE. Look it up, remember it. It hurts, it doesn’t go away, it’s really painful man. Evil. I constantly feel like someone is watching me. I always feel uneasy. I make sudden jerk movements without even realizing it to check if someone with I’ll intent is behind me. Even in public places. But you would never know about any of this if you were to see me in public. I look Normal, I’m fit, always have a smile on my face, I have a lot of “friends” in school, was an A student (grades slowly slipping), had lots of hobbies (whoops lost interest due to my issues thus losing my potential as a person because these hobbies were supposed to be my career). Except it’s a mask, as usual right? You’ve heard that before. But we’re not done. I don’t even think I’ve scratched the surface. We’ll see how far I go with this, I don’t know how far it’ll be. Behind my plethora of issues, I always want to find someone who will share the same intellectually immersed ideas and thoughts as me if that even makes sense. Whether it be a girlfriend who is more of a friend, or a life long friend, or a true friend in general. I don’t care. I yearn for it, I need to know there are other people who think about what I think about. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to talk about EVERYTHING on my mind to anyone but I’d like to get close it to. Thats my only reason to live left, to find a reason to live, that reason being a person— someone else to share my thoughts with on an incredibly deep level. That will probably fade though. Just like all my other reasons to live have died. I have everything I need in my life, everything I need to live. I have necessities, I have a car, I buy the things I want with my own money. The issues don’t stem from anything I don’t have. It’s all mental. Mental games. I lose them often. I used to be so motivated, I used to win these mental games. At the age of 9 I had my own business. I flipped things on Craigslist and made my own money. I bough and ordered ANYTHING I wanted. If I wanted an Xbox I’ve set my mind on selling a certain amount of things and I would always pull through. I then started an online ebay store from things i didn’t want anymore and things I would flip for profit. At 9, 10, 11 fucking years old. That kind of drive, incredible! Incredible feeling it was to be the only kid within miles who had his own salary and got everything and anything he wanted with his own damn money. It was my way out I guess. Because that religion and that divorce was affecting me then too.  Fast forward to present day again, my current “way out” it weight lifting. It is the only thing that temporarily takes the pain away and you know why? Because it substitutes mentally pain for physical pain. Can’t think about your crippling depressive thoughts when you’re maxing out on the bench lol. Oh yea music helps too. Rap, country, rock, 80s, 90s, electro, funk, reggae, jazz, alternative, blues, I love it all if it sounds good or portrays a certain energy to me that I like, the vibe you could say. I’m glad to say that I don’t use alcohol or drugs to cope... anymore. Used to drink most nights before I went to bed, and I went through a period of about 3 months where I smoked a lot of weed. I don’t have anything against weed but I just don’t really see the need for it for ME personally. Back to my mom, she once finally took the advice of a doctor and was prescribed Xanax for anxiety. Yea I took some of those to help me. It did but then I told myself to stop before it was too late. Thankfully I didn’t become dependent. Ive has codeine which was actually prescribed for me because of a surgery, and a few other pills. The reasoning would be either not caring anymore or trying to make it feel better or something i dont know. But now occasionally I take cbd oil to calm me which doesn’t even work so I stopped a few weeks back. And I still have a stash of alcohol which I can’t even drink because I will vomit up the massive amount of food I eat( I eat 3500 calories a day for my weight lifting, tryna get yolked Lol). Leading off of that another massive self esteem fucker was when I was super super skinny. I’m tall or at least was for my age going into high school (5’10” which I still am now) and I had long skinny arms and legs. I would wear sweatshirts and long sleeves in the summer because I hated how I looked and people would comment on the skinniness hence some “pasta” jokes. I’m glad to say I can wear t shirts now and I feel comfortable in my now filled in body for the most part. I weigh about 165-170lbs at 5’10” when I weighed about 130 before at the same height. It is the only thing I’m actually proud of myself for. I stuck with it for 2 years up to this point and gained over 30 lbs of some muscles and some fat. Not even my good grades or early entrepreneurial success makes me proud. I now can’t stop working out because I know that there’s no way in hell im going to lose my progress that I worked over 2 years for. It hurts and there’s times I don’t want to do it but the only way I can temporarily escape my mental pain is to hurt myself physically in the gym (as in maxing out and and muscle break down). Unfortunately, the bad overcomes to good for me and I don’t know how much longer I can go with this unsustainable and inconsistent life or fighting myself and trying to be a certain way for certain people. It all just keeps coming back to the pointless life we live which is ok for a lot of people! It’s ok to accept that the earth and humans MAY or MAY NOT have any purpose. There’s two types of purposes in my opinion. Earthly purpose and grand scheme purpose. They speak for themselves. Those with earthly purposes should disregard the fact that in the grand scheme of things humans probably don’t mean jack shit and they should just live their life to the best of their ability. It hard for people like me to get around this idea which results in the conclusion that there isn’t actually point so why should I continue to suffer AND be meaningless? I mean if you’re not suffering then there’s mindsets to get into that will benefit you in this world. But there seems to be minimal mindsets for me and they all point to cynical ways of thinking. And I can’t get out. I don’t know why but I can’t. I used to be able to but now it feels like it’s getting harder and harder to get out as the days go on. Damn there’s times where I really wanna live and get the that day where it actually means something even if it’s a stupid little human idea of meaningfulness. But i cannot keep going through this cycle of Up down up Down up down up DOWn uP DOwn. It takes a toll on you in every way. I’ve dated 3 people, one was a good person but we never got deep with each other, we ended peacefully. One was a decent person but we don’t agree on a lot, we are still on good terms todsy though. And one is immersed in the game of sheep where she did what she had to to seem cool and to get attention. Not going to like that last one I got with was because I wanted sex. Obviously there’s more to enjoy in a relationship than sex but it’s hard when you badly want to receive some form of affection and give some back to calm your mind and connect with someone intimately. Everyone wants it and we drop our standards, morals, whatever the fuck you want to call it, just to get a “taste” of what it feels like to be purposeful and to be loved by someone else. The tension builds up man. But I’m done with these Instagram model wannabe, clout chasing, fake life living people. And I’ve been done for a while actually I don’t even consider dating anyone at my school except a couple people who don’t even know. I have no problem with someone who likes to hook up. But if you looking for an actual relationship and you start entertaining other people at the same time then I lose respect for that person. I don’t judge, I understand why people hook up and I would do it, I crave intimacy that much. But I want a real relationship so so so much more than I want to just hook up(I’m just imagining in my head how fuckin lost that one person who decided to read this far is lmao). I talk to myself a lot to. Most of the time in my head. My head is super noisy all the time. But since I live alone, I also say what I’m feeling out loud. Often yelling it. I actually think there’s someone there listening but then I realize I’m a fuckin crazy bastard and I have issues that need to be addressed lol. Well that’s about as far as I want to go for tonight. My head hurts and I’m tired. Not sure why exactly I’m actually posting this but doesn’t matter anymore does it. Good night.",lonely,"Yea, Life is meaningless",2020-05-06 12:37:12

Every time I see a tiktok couple bouncing around doing a dance I always skip past them because they make me feel so alone. Being alone is actually became who I am, for sure. And probably some of yall as well. Alone is not just a word. It's a feeling. People dont understand what being truly alone feels like. They just get everyone and everything because of there looks and the way they just are. And I know I will never amount to that. When people who get everything feels like they are losing everything and making big drama around it because they know they will get support, it lowkey sickens me. I know if I post a sad post on social media no one will comment, like, share because I dont feel like I'm losing everything due to the fact I've never had anything in the first place. A lot of people dont know true loneliness. When your sitting in your room and your mom asks you why your always in the dark and you dont have a choice but to say ""I dont know"" just for the simple fact you know they wont understand. No one understands. Isolation is a prime example for true loneliness. You dont need anybody because you never had anybody to begin with. My voice is so lost that my ears dont even hear it anymore. People are feeling lonely because of corona but at the end of the day I was lonely way before this virus. And now people in the house can actually look at you for a change they think your not ok. They begin to question if quarantine us getting in your head, but they dont understand it's more than that. So you shut them out. I've come accustom to shutting people out because I've never had anyone to really count on or trust for a matter of fact. Everyone has there own monsters they are facing but loneliness isn't one of them. Loneliness is just a personality trait if you've ever been truly lonely and that trait will one day built you up instead if weighing you down. Loneliness isn't a monster it's just something you grown to control and tame because it's what makes you you.

2468,VillainNice,1588716242,1,"I'm going to be a senior in college next year and I am 20 years old. Just less than a year ago I was in a relationship with a girl who I loved more than anyone else (even though the relationship was toxic). I had a close group of friends that I lived with and hung out with. It got to the point where I felt so safe with my friend group and my relationship that I never branched out or cared to talk to anyone else.

But then me and my girl broke up and it was a really bad breakup. For a while we both still badly missed each other and wanted to go back but by late February she moved on with some other guy. When I found that out I was just depressed and I felt lonely. I took multiple drugs and would start drinking daily during that time period because I could not cope. But what's worse is because of this I got into a fight with my friends/roommates who then kicked me out of the friend group. I made some reckless decisions in my horrid state and they did not want to deal with me anymore. They never want to even speak to me again.

I miss this girl so much even though she does not miss me at all. I miss her beyond words even. She really meant the world to me. I know things were toxic but she was my only ever relationship and it was the first time anybody ever saw me as their number 1. For all the bad moments I always remember the downright amazing ones. Like when we went to the beach last summer or when I took her to the Met, her favorite museum. Nobody ever loved me as much or in the way she did. She used to beg me to stay up with her at her place even though I had to go back. And I loved her just as much maybe even more. But it hurts me to think that she doesn't love me anymore. She doesn't think about me anymore. She doesn't care about me anymore. And she's moved on and loves someone else. All the while I still miss her. 

And losing my friends was just the final nail in the coffin. I'm no longer living with them next semester and it hurts me to think that I no longer will have the closest friends I have made in college. We have had 3 years of wild and crazy memories and I can't forget them. I miss them too. 

I am now living with 3 people I don't really know and they have their own established friend groups. That's what makes me the saddest right now. I'm going into my senior year with no friends. With no person who cares about me. The friends I did have are gone. I still miss my ex so badly. I feel like everybody else is already in their established friend groups by sophomore/junior year so I don't even know if I'll be able to make new friends. I'm just going to be a sad, lonely, depressed person my senior year of college. And even scarier is that I heard it is even harder to make friends after college.

I wasn’t built for love, I was never raised up to learn how to be in romantic relationship. Sure it seems nice, but my entire personality is one unto myself. It wouldn’t be fair to another person for me to be in a relationship with them, at least, what relationship would it be. I can’t fulfill anything anyone wants in a partner, frankly because it’s not who I am.

I do what I want, though I don’t want to hurt anybody. I’m impulsive and spontaneous, I have always thrived when I’m working by myself, and usually if I am working with someone else on something, I eventually branch off and do my own thing at my efficient pace.

I can’t seem to believe I’ll ever have “chemistry” with another person. Sure, in my life  I’ll find people attractive, and people will find me attractive, but that doesn’t stop the fact that I’m not relationship material as it were.

My entire life, no one really had gotten me, understood me, been able to be my teammate. My life has always been better single, in most aspects. Even if I am relying on someone for something, our relationship is always rotten to the core, disgusting. I move at different speeds, make decisions at different speeds, talk at different speeds, think at different speeds... some of these faster and some slower than the average person.

The person already had a partner of interest, but they weren’t exclusive yet so we playfully flirted often. I thought it was super cool to have met someone during this time, especially since I’m away from everyone and I don’t ever really talk to my real life friends. I opened up to them about a lot of things, there’s just something different about talking with someone from the internet. It was nice to rely on someone like that. We made real plans to meet up after quarantine is over to hang out/party. One night, when it was just the two of us in a video chat, the interaction unexpectedly turned very sexual. I wish it didn’t.  We continued this for a little while.. I knew that eventually they were going to become serious with their partner so I knew it had to come to an end at some point. I didn’t think I would be that affected by it, since I really just enjoyed their company as a good friend. I didn’t think about the other consequences. Today, they requested for the sexual exchange to end (which I 100% respect) and now I feel more lonely than I was before I met them. They explained that I would no longer be able to visit when quarantine is over, which is very understandable, but really sucks. I KNOW that the friendship will die off soon, and I’m simply in a terrible mood about it. I have been single for a very long time, so it’s as if that person opened a door to something that I forgot I needed. None of my real life friends know that I had this connection with a random person from the internet and I don’t feel comfortable venting my feelings to them. I never developed romantic feelings for this person, but somehow I’m still sad.

I haven't been in a romantic situation for so long, that at this point I'm more attached to romantic character pairings than to any of the people I could be romantically involved with in real life. Whenever a show has a pairing I like, I'll bingewatch a show unhealthily fast, the downside to that is me losing interest quickly, when the couple i support doesn't appear to happen. When characters don't have romantic scenes or the person that they're interested in, doesn't feel the same way, I feel like I can relate to them and it makes me feel even worse for myself and I literally can't take my mind off of that.  

This has now influenced my show-watching experience to a degree where, if a show takes two characters, that I like as a pairing out of the show or just breaks them up, I literally can't keep watching the show no matter how good the plot is. 

i.e. i just recently started watching Altered Carbon (SPOILERS!) and really liked the romantic idea of Kristin and Takeshi. When I heard that for Season 2 Takeshi got a new sleeve and Kristin wasn't even part of the show anymore, i couldn't get myself to watch the show any further.

2502,___kb__,1588690257,1,"Is this a Covid Suicide Note ?

Some say that the lockdown is a marketing for 5G . The so called digital transformation that some countries feared and yet under these extraordinary times of Covid , Google and Microsoft has claimed that Digital transformation that should have taken 2 years ,has taken place in 20 days.

Some say that its a way of Chinese suppression of the hong kong protest , which we don't hear about now a days , as if its gone extinct .

Some say that its a pharma Medical War , involving Vaccines with surveillance nanochips slide into the bodies of the entire 7 billion world population by Bill gates or by many other companies , as we see Bill Gates so much involved in all these vaccines. 

Some say that its a Chinese bioweapon gone rogue , that's why chinese have denied access for the international probe.

Some say that its the Chinese way of staying ahead of the US in terms of economy , because Chinese are far ahead in terms of covid timeline which gives them a jumpstart , as they resume operations when countries like India shuts down .

Some say that its the US way of planting its own virus in china , in order to create a global hate , which in some sense has been achieved and inorder to disrupt the foreign economies , by taking advantage of other countries . Take for example : Facebook's investment in India , rise in Bezozs Wealth , Google domination , Microsoft pills. 

Some say that its a show of supremacy like if America shuts down , so will the entire world go down . 

Some say that Capitalism has brought this inorder to show that You are born and dead just to contribute your part in the overflated economy . Because we can see so many people telling how economies will kill more people than Covid .

Some say that Modiji has a political motive behind national wide lockdown , while he could have given states the power to do as they pleased with centre's guidance because we can see his approval ratings has risen more than Uri effect . People are now lighting lamps , clapping hands if he tells. Well I guess that he is really Smart.

Some experts say 60 million ICU beds would have been required if this lockdown wasn't imposed that will take atleast 15 normal years of medicial infrastructure growth to facilitate that . Because we know that India lacks in medical infrastructure .

Some says that its the nature's way of reacting to man made pollutions , as we all  see now the ozone layer fixing itself and the pollution coming all down.


Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm....



All of these thoughts were like from yesterday...

Or is it my mistake that all these thoughts broke out. 

Yet I still don't know the truth , I was a simple guy then.
.
.
.
.
.
After knowing this much , I continue to stare at the only mirror in my room , in which I have been locked down for 40 years. 

I don't smile , I don't cry , I don't have any emotions 

Its 2041 now , I guess , I don't know

Its just me and my face on the mirror , I don't know what is happening on the outside world , I don't know how are my parents are holding up physically , in the other rooms . They don't speak with each other too.. Probably they would also be staring at the mirror like me or they would have forgotten the fact that I still live . Because I myself don't know if they even exist.

Its just a Photo that reminds me that I and my parents existed in this so called world i was born into, I still wonder why was I even born ? Is it to have the same thought process all these years.

My cells have adopted , my body doesn't require as much as food , sleep or anything that I would have had 20 years back . I don't know how the food comes , it just comes . 


It was like yesterday when the first Covid patient died 

I used to be a 21 year old guy then , from a middle class family.

With so many complex problems that I had to face 
Being single , girlfriend , sex , love , job , cooking, money, dad , sister, caste , reservations , marks , grades , professors , social acceptance , wanna be rich , powerful , famous ..........were all the obstacle I had at that time , which I still believe to have because all of that made me realise that I was either stupid or I was living life like how general audience would live theirs.


But here I am, still looking at the only mirror in my room... as all these thoughts pass by daily . 

It started with my sister , she was Covid positive , and after that , we were put in quarrentine , but I had a connection with the world then . I got the newspapers, the nurses told me stuffs . But after Some months everything stopped . I don't see the nurses too. Hope she's doing well. Hope she's alive


I have never seen or heard anything since then .



The last time I heard about something in a very long time ,  was in 2036 when they said that they were shifting me because the place where I stayed had been affected by the rising water level and that half of Antarctica had swallowed up most of the major cites of the world.


I don't know how the world is now .


I don't know if my sister is alive or dead , the last time I saw her was when she was holding my hands in fear , I kissed her and told her that you'll come back soon and healthy .


I think Covid was just first of its kind and after that many more, with power more infinite than its earlier impact , has taken a stroll on this insane world , with different outcomes . 


I wonder if there's a America or India now?Guess what if our prime minister is even alive ? I still don't know "" How do I still remain sane."" After all these madness and Illusions I have been through.


Its probably the drug injected food . 


Here I am still emotionless , staring at the same only mirror , with the hope that I could give my body its peace but all I can see in this empty room is that there's no means to end my meaningless life , rotted by the selfishness of some people who run or think that they run this empty world . 


I guess I would have had a normal life or a better life if I just had the proper amount of money and power back then.


I have accepted the reality that this is my new illusion which I should feel real just like those old days.

Every relationship I have is just another in a series of loose friendships that are bound to slip into nothing if given another month. I have no friends. Every single person is bound to their friends by genuine connection and I can feel myself never being able to click into that with anyone I’ve ever met. I know I will always be a fourth, fifth, sixth option in anyone’s life, because they can all see through the facade and immediately know how truly pathetic I am. There is nothing to my personality except for smoke and mirrors. I have nothing. I am nothing. I’m just a ball of tightly wound emotion waiting to shoot myself in the head and let all the stress release. My falsity is not convincing.

There is never going to be any escape from this hell. At the absolute peak of my recent life, in a period of perfect discipline and willpower, I was able to only distract myself from this hurting.

2526,hunterdeathbane,1588654538,1,"Before I get started, I should mention that I’m 20 years old. With that being said, here we go: 

I don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to take this being lonely/single thing... Seriously... I’ve had enough of it now... It’s a flat-out joke. I’m done with feeling like this. It’s hurting me deep down, man... Sure, I can go by some days without feeling sad due to this lonely feeling. However, the rest of the time, I’m hurting and hurting hard! So much so that it sometimes affects me at work and I’m so bummed out that I can’t concentrate on the task at hand! My heart is crying out, craving, and yearning for that special someone to fill the void that my ex-girlfriend left when I broke up with her in early June 2019. (We were together for a year and a half and it was a long-distance relationship).

I sometimes have rough nights that often end in tears... I hate this lonely feeling so much! I’m also introverted to an insane degree. I have a very little amount of friends. In fact, I think I only have about 3 close friends. I can’t socialize at, say, a church gathering or around people that I don’t know. I’d be quiet as a mouse and I wouldn’t muster up the courage to speak to someone and “socialize” unless I’m spoken to. I’m more of a family man. (I’m not sure if that’s a Romanian thing or a European thing) We’re a pretty big family and we’re all pretty tight with each other and we often have family gatherings/barbecues when the weather is nice outside and we also get together for the holidays, as you do.

A few people in my family have said things like “He has time to get married..” “There’s no need to rush it...” They don’t understand! I can safely say that I’m nowhere near being ready to get married, not at all! I’m just looking for someone to talk to! Is that too much to ask?! 

I agree with my parents when they say I should find myself a Christian girl. (We are a practicing Pentecostal-Christian family). However, I can’t seem to find anyone from our church... I’ve tried talking to a few girls from our church but it resulted to nothing... two of them straight-up ghosted me and another one told me she wasn’t interested. (ask me about this story if we end up chatting. It’s an interesting one) I don’t know, maybe it’s down to me not being in with the youth of our church growing up and now I feel excluded because everyone has their own “cliques” and I’ve missed out. I feel like this “special someone” is not from our church and I feel like I ran out of options. I feel lost and I don’t know where else to look... 

Surely there must be SOMEONE out there... SOMEONE who’ll fit my “requirements” and who’ll put up with me and want to spend time with me... If my ex did it for a year and a half then there MUST be someone else willing to, right?! Surely she couldn’t have just been a fluke, a 1-in-a-million...

I don’t have a suicidal feeling at all, no. God forbid. This lonely feeling just sucks. If anyone wants to talk, I’d be more than happy to.",lonely,I’ll just leave this here..,2020-05-05 14:55:38

I had such an amazing day! 
- My siblings FaceTimed me right at 12am to talk about the old days for two hours lol
- I woke up to actual voicemails and texts messages from friends and family. 
- Someone got me bagels delivered.... complete with a “Happy Birthday!” sticker!
- By the end of the day, I received $120 in cash apps!
- Gifted a $50 Amazon gift card!
- Gifted a marble colored porcelain teapot with some Forté Tea! (I love tea, I have a small teapot collection but I haven’t been able to get them from my parents’ place so I was stuck here with only one lol)
- Gifted a cake with strawberries on top!
- Gifted a meat and cheese platter! 
- Gifted a new nifty fifty camera lens! 
- Topped it all off with a video of all my friends wishing me a happy birthday and singing and showing me their dogs and stuff. 

I had the most amazing birthday you guys! 

I’m sharing this because I’m happy....
I’m starting to think that I’m lonely because I don’t let people in. Not because people don’t actually like me or because I’m boring or whatever. 

I think it’s because I’m perceiving things that way, you know? 

I assume people don’t like me and avoid them, then end up lonely and sad and even more depressed than normal. 

I think my anxiety keeps me from seeing what’s really going on... people are actually friends with me. People actually care about me... people pay attention to things I like and they think I’m interesting and funny and kind. 

I was planning on ending my life today. 

BUT This day gave me hope that things may get better.

Anyway... I’ve never seen the Star Wars movies! So I’m going to spend the rest of the night watching some of them. 

May the 4th be with you all!

TLDR: My birthday was amazing. I have friends. I  also have mental illnesses. My life may not be as bad as my mental illnesses are leading me to believe. I am not going to commit suicide yet. I am going to watch Star Wars.

The only people who talk to me, use me as a therapist and then when I ask for help it's ALWAYS ""I'm sorry I'm busy :/ maybe later"" but later never comes, I always start conversations they never ask to see if I'm okay, not even my so called ""friends"" I'm alone and I can't go out and leave cause I live in the middle of nowhere, I just wish someone could just ask if I'm okay for once, and right now the quarantine just makes it worse. I see people my age and younger all falling in love, while I'm sitting at my desk alone just getting sadder and sadder seeing ad after ad that have couples in them, and love song after love song that I can't relate to.

I really wanted to attend university after high school but due to my family personal issue they don’t have enough money to pay up my university I sacrificed my uni and I permanently started working in an airline at the age of 18 

I was thinking after my lonely life in high school  was bad I decided to be more social to be more social and make new friends at the airport but it turns out a massive failure again is complete different from my high school experience it is worst is like I work continuous 12hrs shift every time and then go home sleep eat come to work that cycle stills continue I was thinking to leave the job but because of my family I have to work after so many years of cycle 

I have mandatory military training for 16months in 2019 I went on leave for my airport work to continue my military training for 16months this whole year of 2019 without a doubt is a worst thing Ever seen even after I finish it will haunt me forever I have endured so much the strict training and stuff here I also thought and make last chance to make friends here but no it didn’t take us must worse people here are in own world wanting to finish just like me they don’t care this stuff whatsoever I become one depresses a lot I think too much about my past and start crying in the dark room

When we were in discord with some of our friends late at night just talking about some random stuff I heard something was wrong with my friend (who's also my crush). Their voice started shaking but they  still kept talking during the conversation. I texted them are you okay, and they said what they were thinking about. 

It was super heavy stuff, and I had no idea what to say. It wasn't a small issue. Honestly I had no clue what to say. I have a hard time being supportive, and I realized I basically said I think it's a good idea if you went to bed.  I meant it in a way like how sleep can help with anxiety. They didn't want to leave the voice chat though, and I offered to say something stupid and make a distraction or something. They said they will leave when they want, we ended the conversation there. 

At the moment I realized I was annoying and I feel so bad for it. The next day I sent a snap to them saying how I'm sorry that it sounded insensitive and I tried validating them. They said it's okay, and they left it at that. But now every streak I send is just opened, and I haven't gotten any communication with them after 3 days. We have a 57 day streak and not even a blank picture from them. I still send streaks but not really anything else just so I don't bother them.

Well let's just say that I am just a basket case they adopted so they could like, be proud of themselves for SAVING someone. I don't even get tagged in travel posts even if I am there.) So I guess, forgive me for dumping this here. It's either this, or self harm, and I have been clean for almost a year now and I don't want to fall off the wagon again. 

I don't know what love looks like... (Or maybe once in a while I look at it and think, 'oh, this seems like love but heey, it will hurt to assume and end up wrong'), but when I do, it's usually after I see its back, walking away from me. I used to ask my self what I did to deserve not being loved... But now, the painful truth finds its way to tear itself through my skin: I am difficult to love, and I have either done nothing to make myself better, or done too much to the point where I end up becoming so many people in one body, I no longer have any idea of who am I.

I am pretty much seen as a normal person. I smile and I laugh and I tell dirty jokes. I always say things are fine and okay and fine and okay and nooope, nothing's new. Nothing's new. I am still lonely and miserable. I didn't seem to be, right? It's because I've been this way since I am ten. I have learned how to blend in the normal crowd. I have learned how to make people laugh. I have learned to be someone you can depend on when you needed a shoulder to cry on. I have learned how to listen to people talk about their sadness, and how to never tell anyone about mine. Yes, I understand what happiness is. I have faked it so well, you can't tell mine is fabricated.

Who am I? I am nothing and everything. I am like a universe, vast, ever expanding, full of mysteries and galaxies people often look at with bewilderment, but then when they call out to me, I am nothing more than just an infinite void...

I am a void... A void that constantly tries so hard to fill itself... With hobbies, interests, vicarious emotions from fictional people, art, music, sex, food, existence... But at the end of the day, I am a void...

2579,Atham_MessIAh,1588615001,1,"Hi,  


I'm ATHAM.  


In the past years I've thinking about an idea of how to help people who feel lonely, since I suffered that kind of feeling so many times in my life.  


 I always thought about developing a project to help people, and most of the time that project came to me as a personal diary from every single person. A place where you can express your feelings but also ask some questions about your life, and how to move one.  


I'm not trying to be a psychologist or anything related, I just want to put up a project and a place where people can gather around and share their feelings, cheer up each other and sometimes feel that ""someone"" is there listening. I remember that going online in platforms like Omegle and talking to random strangers, hearing about their experiences and sharing my thoughts was pretty cathartic.  


I've also been following the lo-fi fenomena on YouTube, and I think it is amazing how people with a shared interest can gather and express positive ideas, help each other... and as I said, at least vent their problems for a while in a healthy enviroment.  


ATHAM is a Retrowave style radio, presented as if an IA is controlling it on YouTube. In here, people can ask questions via chat, participate and relax with some nostalgia type of sound.  


As you can see, I started a couple of days ago, and Im working on spreading the word and ""gather"" souls haha for this project. I don't have any interest of winning money with this. I just want to help an put something up for people, so they can be more happy, or at least relaxed.  


You can find my channel [**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClsEdkTeqffFHl0OJ9bz7lw):

I pretend to go live almost every day, or at least a couple of times a week.

They always know exactly what to do and say, they never seem to have to put any time or thought or effort into what they say, but it still comes out right, and they're rewarded with friendship. Meanwhile, I spend several minutes or even hours trying to come up with something to say, overthinking every single minor detail and every word and panicking about how others might react to it, and all I get is hatred from ""people"" and have to rot in eternal loneliness, all because I'm so anxious and uncertain.

I'm never able to participate in conversations because I'm afraid I'll say something wrong, or say it at a wrong time, or whatever. I have so much to say but I never know how and when to say it, and I'm always afraid of people's reaction to it.

Needless to say, these things have also prevented me from finding a *girlfriend*... feels like girls feel repulsed by me just because I'm not a slaying dumb extrovert monkey, and because I don't have any confidence in myself.

But I can't talk to anyone about anything in real life, because they don't allow me to, they're not capable of listening to me, they don't tolerate me at all, seems like they only want me to die a slow horrible death! Everyone seems to hate and suspect me all the time. The INNNOCENT are always the ones society mops the floor with, innocent people like me, everyone hates people like me.

All of these things also apply to talking on online forums or chats, the only way I can even talk online is by giving rants or monologues like this. I can't have conversations even online because I'm afraid of being mocked, laughed at or judged. After failing to get friends in real life, I figured that maybe I wouldn't feel so restricted online, so I tried joining some Discord servers to find online friends, but I couldn't say almost anything because all the servers were full of aggressive extroverts and I was too afraid to interrupt them, so I just cried of jealousy and self-pity.

And still some people have the audacity to claim that social anxiety doesn't exist...OK, these may not be the biggest problems in the world, but they're only making me sadder and ANGRIER. I'm very angry.I've been smashing my desk and slapping the back of my head, that helps with the anger a little bit but not enough.

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKK! I feel like killing myself sometimes but my thoughts are too valuable to just be lost like that without anyone knowing about them, I have to chronicle everything. And anyway, I don't fully have the will and courage for it yet.

So. What should I do? What CAN I do? Nothing works, this just keeps getting worse and worse. Who knows if I'm even alive...",lonely,New here (long angry rant...),2020-05-05 02:10:19

I had a few fake friends at the time and I asked 1 if he wanted to come to my basketball game and watch. I said I could pick him up and we could grab something to eat afterwards. He said yeah... HE SAID YEAH!!!! LETS GOOO! Later that day after school I texted him and said “Picking you up 6:00,” that alright?” He replied... no joke... “For what?” My heart sunk. He actually forgot. He said “I’m hanging out at (joes) tn. My entire friend group hung out without me later that night. Never invited me and I took all of that awful negative energy And absolutely went to town on the other team. I scored 22 points and was the mvp for the night. Anyone else have a story like thay.

2586,IBlurredYou,1588601433,1,Been going in and out of sleep all morning. Was really depressed going to bed last night.  Also think I've ruined my diet after trying so hard to make it better. Food is such a big comfort for me during this pandemic. I sound like a loser thinking that. I was talking to someone last night about how I don't think anyone genuinely wants to be around me or cares to keep me around.  Makes me just think it'll be a continuing cycle. Also people continue telling me to do therapy. I've had this my whole life and I think that's why therapy isn't always the way to go. I've always been yelled at to go but I wanna go when I actually want to go. Idk I'm sorry for the long post today. Might update later.,lonely,Day 6,2020-05-05 00:10:33

Then had trouble with writing and reading in my later years of school witch made for a harder time joining in with them all the way up to grade 10. Joined a discord server with a old friend some time back, when ever i get invited to a call i just never talked unless asked a question, joining calls online makes my brain work overtime trying to figure out when to join the conversation but ultimately fails then i just get super uncomfortable once i leave the call. I know i should open up to people but i find it i just can't relate to anyone at all. Stopped talking to my only friend as he was harsh and hurtful at times.

As days went on, I had less and less people to talk to, sometimes your circle of friends naturally gets slimmer in high school, but by the end of senior year I had none. When I was a junior I was sexually assaulted, I believe that’s when I started to pull away from everyone around me. I really changed from this happy go lucky person to this dark just depressed person. When people try to talk to me now I get major anxiety, even if it’s as little as someone bumping into me in a store. People have tried to come into my life, but no matter how bad I want to I can’t bring myself to let anyone in. My parents never helped me get therapy after the assault, they said it was over now and since he was in jail I’d be okay, but I’m definitely not.

The previous girl I liked ended up ghosting me, but she lived in Slovenia, so it's not like it was ever gonna go anywhere. After that I started spending more time with another girl, who I had met about 3 months before the Slovenian. I ended up liking her a lot more, at first I thought it was me being desperate, but after about a week, I ended up falling in love with her, and I mean like love, like I cared about her very much, and I still do. Today I ended up confessing my attraction, which to no surprise led to me being rejected. But it was the first time a girl was honest, and didn't come up with a bullshit excuse, yay! I still have feelings for her, and the more I think about it the more sad I feel. I think I might be done with this whole relationship thing, it always brings sadness, so there is no point in trying. So yeah, maybe I will try again in a year or two, or maybe just completely give up, and live my entire life wishing I could have a relationship, but knowing it will never happen.

I have Boyfriend which most would think there’s plenty affection that comes with it, and while it does it’s especially hard since it’s long distance.

She broke up with me quote on quote, “I think I needa be with someone else for everything to tell me your the one” like they say if you love something let them go so I did. Before she left my cousin broke up with his girl and he was desperately trying to have me break up with mines cause they were friends. He couldn’t live with the fact his ex and my ex were still friends so this man deadass stared to turn everyone against me little by little he brainwashed our friends keep in mind we are about the same age grew up together and everything. He is the oldest and ever since I was a little boy he was always favored as the “smartest” and “successful” and what not. My family even started to take his side after they saw him all heartbroken and I’m with his ex friend still. A year has gone by I don’t talk to my fam anymore they show me fake love I had my older cousin and another younger who was my circle they left me. I once went to his house at 10:30 at night and cried my eyes out in his room in front of his parents begging him to be my friend again his mom which is my aunt forced him to hug me back which was so fake and meant nothing after being begged. But his dad my uncle proved everything to me that night he was my fishing buddy we did everything I used to call him my second dad but that night he was all against me. Told me “Im not worth the shit”. So with that all being said 3 years have gone by I’ve learned to be more independent I’m always alone i don’t go to family functions. Recently told my mom if I ever get married I don’t even want my family to come to my wedding. I have no friends cause the people I knew are now his homies more like butt buddies and I remember he used to talk shit about them.

But, looking back, this is nothing new to me. I was neglected emoyionally by my parents growing up. I remember being no older than 8, listening to my parents fighting, threatening to call the cops on eachother. They had more time for fighting than they did for me i guess. And i remember when i was 16 and my dad comitted suicide. Theres just so much pain in my heart, and a deep feeling of loneliness. The thing i dont understand is why it hurts so much more now. I guess because i live on my own, and i no longer have my parents to blame for it. I dont know, all i know is that life has become so joyless, and so painful lately. 

And i think its also extra painful because I have so much love to give. Like all i want to do is just love someone, or love a group of friends, and to be loved by them. But it seems that everytime i give i get nothing in return. It feels like im a punching bag. I serve a purpose to people but all i get in return is pain. 

Im being dramatic, life isnt that bad. I just need a outlet because ive really let myself go because of the whole pandemic situation. I just worry about my future. I dont want to lead the same lonely existence my parents did. I saw what they became because of it, and I want more. I want friends, i want a partner who i love and who loves me.

2619,carriemcbride628,1588565710,1,"I'm not really sure if anyone will care or even understand. However maybe writing to you will help me. My story is long and I'm horrible with grammer so please excuse me. Lets go back, back 5 years ago when it all began.
March 4th 2015. I was 18 and a senior in highschool. I got up and went to school like any other day. It was a Wednesday. It was the day my father died. I got up and went to school and my mom went to work not even knowing he was gone. He didn't show up for work so someone called and my sister ended up finding him. It was rough my dad was my bestfriend. He taught me a lot and there was so much more I had to learn. I was lost with out him, but I had to be strong for my mom. As my dad and her had been arguing with my older sister. Anyways fast forward a month and we found out my mom had stage 4 colon cancer. Her first chemo treatment was the day I graduated highschool. In July she got put in the hospital. Two weeks later we moved her to hospice. August 4th 2015 she finally passed. It was hard. I started college on the 19th I couldn't take a semester off because I'd lose my scholarship. By the end of August my sister told me she couldnt stand living with me because I wasnt the best at inside house work. She moved into the house next door that use to be my grandfather's before he died. Now I live on a family farm so I have two uncles that I could throw a football to their house. Well neither one ever had kids and my mom told them to look after us. Well this is when thing really went down hill for me. One would call me every day asking where I was even though he had my college schedule. One day he came over I have my books scattered across my kitchen table, dirty dishes in the sink and my bed wasnt made. He yelled at me and told me ""school isn't as important as keeping this house clean"", it made feel like shit. I cried for hours. We share a drive way that crosses through my oldesr uncles property, he's told me "" the only reason I let you use it is because your my brothers daughter"". When I got married I decided I didn't want a wedding, because I couldn't do it without my parents especially my dad. I went to the court house just me, my husband, my sister, her fiance and my husband's grandmother. One of my uncles was so mad at me told me I was selfish. We had got married before I got out of school because my husbands grandmother who raised him was having heart issues and we didn't know if she'd make it. That same uncle calls my husband a piece of shit every time he can even though I was dating him before this all happened and hes been there for me. He's made comments about ""oh you got married because she was dying, why isnt she dead?"". But what hurt the most is when my sister got married they bought her dress and said ""if you would have had a real wedding we would have bought yours too."" They both put my sister on this pedestal even though shes 6 years older than me and married. They still moved her yard, clean her gutters, pretty much if she needs or doesnt need something they do it. They tell me if you need something no matter what or when just say something. Well one night my sister and i got into a fight. It was probably 10pm. As i said they live right by me so i called my husbands wife because the lights were on to ask for advice. I go over there we talk and she just tells me to drop it. Well next day i get a call to go over there. My uncle chews me out saying I shouldn't have called her. That it wasn't important. That i was out of line. Then said if you need anything even just to talk you can call us... but thats what i did and you said it was wrong. Even though i was upset and needed someone. Anyways two years ago my sister moved ten hours away. First year was just to try it out. Left her cat, I'd go down there and take care of him. I couldnt bring him to my house because he didnt like my dogs. I'd text her updates and pictures with no response. Well she decided to buy a house where she was. Didnt tell me till she closed on it. Came back got the things she wanted from the house and took the cat to shelter. The house just sits next door empty. I go and check on it after storms and let her know any updates even if nothing happened. I never get a response. My uncles still mow the yard for her. She doesn't pay them or anything. They just do it. I've asked her to at least send my oldest uncle a gift card once a month to say thank you but she doesnt. It really breaks my heart. He's 72 years old so i stop in and see him often. I take him movies when its cold so he has something to do and usually food once a week. And yet I'm still the outcast of the family. My dad loved his older brother and worried about him. So i do my best to check on him. Well today I did something I've done my whole life. I picked up some sticks and went to throw them in the woods in front of my sisters house. We always did that. Well my uncle comes up to me mad as hell. Calls me stupid says you know better than that. I said it what dad and I always did. He said ""well you dads not here any more its been 5 years you know better"" he gives me a lecture how its my sisters property  now and I have no business going on her property. He points put 2 trees that are dead then the new property lines they are getting ready to deed up. He tells me you need to put it in the burn pile next time, which isn't on my property and i didn't have a way to take the trailer down there. Then yells and says ""you should have used the tractor"". The tractor has a mower connected to the back of it. I told him i didnt know how to disconnect it. He yells at me again and say ""you watch you dad unhook it a dozen times so thats your fault."" I told him I hadn't that the tractor always stayed hooked to the mower. Then he called me a liar. At this point I was about in tears and my husband had just walked up. He then yelled at my husband about some bs. Then my husband had asked about getting some dirt to fill a hole in the yard. My uncle went on his normal lecture ""I dont let anyone use my tractor, my tools, my trucks or anything else."" My husband was like okay. I was just asking if you could bring us a bucket of dirt but I'll figure it out. Then he goes back to the tree branches and was like ""why didnt you use your truck?"" I told him i was waiting for a new starter to come in. Then he goes you can use my old truck any time keys are in it... am i just like you just told me not to touch your stuff... then he said if you need help just tell me... 

At this point I'm so confused fused and angry. They tell me if I need anything to ask. But when I do I'm a burden. I needed help finding my septic tank last week. Cause the house that was my parents is older, it burried and you have to dig it up. I couldn't find any plans for it. And I was just yelled at. He was like I showed this to you when your dad died. I was like i know I'm sorry it was 5 years ago, I know the area but I can't find it. 

It just makes me feel so bad. I miss my dad so much. I wish I would have learned more. I just feel so useless. I feel like a burden. I try so hard. I mow my yard try to keep things looking nice. But there are just somethings i don't know. And I hate asking them for help. I try every thing not to. I've paid someone to cut down a tree even though they said theyd help me because they just yell at me the whole time. They yell at me for cutting my own grass instead of my husband. But I only work part time while my husband pulls 50hrs a week. They yell at me if it gets to tall. And I just feel worthless. My husband's family loves me and tells me they are blessed to have me. And it helps but it just hurt when my own family doesn't even care about me. I tell them i love them and rarely does my family tell me they love me back. It just hurts so bad, i try to just let it go in one ear and out the other.but i cant. It breaks my heart every time. It makes me feel so small. Like i dont even matter. I do everything I can for them. It just never seems to be enough. I don't seem to be enough. And I don't know why?  I don't understand why they love my sister more than me. I stayed, I love and am very grateful for the house my parents not only left me but the house they built with their own two hands. My sister has left hers rotten away. Yet she's the little angel. I just don't understand. I check on them because I love and they meant a lot to my dad. And I'm treated like the black sheep. I just don't understand.",lonely,Family issues,2020-05-04 14:15:10
2620,Sally_A552,1588564420,1,"I feel like most of us let the sadness we feel of having no mates overweigh us actually doing things we enjoy. For example, I love going on walks and to Westfield to get clothes when I have money. Even just getting ready in the mornings by myself before this pandemic kind of excited me, as I loved making myself feel somewhat pretty. But then silly toxic thoughts would form in my head for example, ""your so pathetic getting ready just go out on your own"". I would let myself feel pathetic for even being excited in the morning when getting ready. 

But you guys guess what we have no social life. Sitting at home feeling sad about that won't do anything. How about we do what we enjoy. You may love horse riding or ice skating ( Hobbies I thought at the top of my head). So actually start going ice skating or horse riding. Though that you'll most likely meet someone with the same common interest, and if you don't at least you did something you enjoyed. Or try get a part time job, or volunteer if you have too much free time on your hands. I personally know that I can't afford to do horse riding lessons and wouldn't want to volunteer because I want to get paid for me time working, lol. So I'd try working in a pet store or something if I loved animals. There are ways to work around things.

I know this is a random burst or happiness in me at 4am, lol. Tomorrow's I turn 18, I didn't expect my life to be the way it is at my age to stay the least. But I'm tired of just doing nothing. 

I also wanna learn Spanish get my licence and all that jazz. But I need to learn to walk before I run. So I'm just gonna focus on trying to get a job.

 Obviously now stay safe self isolating and let's take this time to relax and focus on what we want to improve for ourselves. I'm spending this time learning to do my natural hair and working on my physical health.

2625,sparkquery,1588561459,1,"I’m about to be 20. I’m young and have so much ahead of me. So they say. It doesn’t really feel that way. 

It’s almost been two years since we broke up. I’ve had a girlfriend since then. Ex, though now.

When I first met you, I was talking to someone else. I liked her, she was a great girl and liked me too. But she wasn’t able to date because of her parents rules. I told her I liked her, that I thought I could wait for her to date. But you showed up and proved me wrong. I was a liar. A promise breaker. A thief of ones heart.

Your beautiful personality, your adorable laugh, the way you looked at me and your piercing green eyes shot. I started falling for you.. and honestly, I’m not sure I regret any of it.

I had something different with you. Something I can’t explain. I think you genuinely liked me back. Except.. I was emotionally insane. I had always thought I was mature. As someone who had so much self reflection, time to himself and thoughts running through their mind. I thought I may have been mature. But you proved me wrong. I was not. I was inexperienced, unstable and didn’t know what I had wanted. I was insecure about myself and envied your friendships with others, even though you were mine. 

I thought I was an excellent communicator. I thought I knew how to express myself and my feelings. Take thoughts and carve them into carefully chosen words. So as not to scare you away. But you proved me wrong. I am not an excellent communicator. I don’t know how to express my thoughts or say my feelings.

You showed me so many of my own flaws I didn’t were there. Insecurities and weaknesses I made myself believe I didn’t have.

Time and time again, I thought I could make you happy. And you know, maybe I did, temporarily. But I don’t think I was able to fill your cup as full as you needed it to be, or as much as I would have liked. I poured my heart out, wore it on my sleeve, hurt myself, for others to live and breathe.

I think I ended up not giving you what you need. And that’s on me. I wasn’t sure how to do those things. I thought I was romantic, 50s era type romantic. But.. you proved me wrong. I don’t know how to go on a date, I don’t know how to flirt or make you feel beautiful or loved.

Let me just take a deep breath here and say, I think I am probably sad. Depressed some may say. It’s been two years now. A mutual decision to go our own way. I think now, it wasn’t a mutual decision. I didn’t want to leave you. Or go another way. 

Part of me says you belong in my life. And some days I dream of you, the same path as I. For you and I, become each other’s. You my wife, I your husband.

I am in a new city now. No friends or family around. But I know you. I know I. We are bound to our home town. 

Where there, you and I will seek each other out.
Like the earth does the sun on a new day.
Awaiting the light to let dawn return, and darkness to take rest.

I belong to you. My heart, my soul.
Someday, I say to you, we shall cross
As if we never left, those days adrift.

In this time, make memories and laugh like no one watches.
For me to hear and you to tell, when we sit near.
And when I say goodnight to you, shall we wake
Basking in the morning sun, which was meant for me and you.

I think I may love her. Yes, that would be you.

I continuously just drop of the face of the earth with people i'm 25 and i've never really had anyone that close to me, I just got my family who i've always been around and not to sound like an angsty teen but they make me feel the fuck i'm doing with my life, why should I live it the way I do.

I just wish I could develop the discipline to focus and put my work, my emotions into something that I can take pride in but the loneliness eats me up and theirs not a whole lot of re assurance of who I am. My head, mind clashes too much with the culture of my country (Britain) fucks it going, I feel like i'm going to get dragged down with the way things are and i'm never going to do anything of effort with my life just be running up against a wall my whole life.

The anger at myself just makes me isolate myself then things always just end up worse because I sit and think over the regrets and mistake of why I have to be so withdrawn and antagonistic why can't I just behave myself?

This week is so different. I went from peppy to  ""this is how im going to be the rest of my life"". All my friends are married or in a serious relationship or atleast have roommates. I have no one. My family lives on the other side of the country. Ive been around maybe 4 people (6 feet away) in 8 weeks. 

Im so lonely now. Im curled up in my bed watching disney movies and getting messages from friends about the quirky corona adventures them and their SO are having. I think theyre trying to brighten me up and im so happy for them! But im doing all of this alone and everything is reminding me that Im such a horrible person that i had no one to wade out the pandemic with. Even the most volatile people I know are with someone right now. What did I do wrong? This feels like a prison sentence for being a bad lover. I havnt been this low in years. NOT that I want the quarantine to end if that puts peoples lives at stake.

I just want a hug.

2666,takaeoreo,1588525586,1,"I want to share about a crush I had on a girl, and where better to do so other than behind the anonymity of the internet!! 

We sat beside each other in class out of sheer coincidence. She was shy and had a really cute voice. I wasn't drawn to her at first. She was average-looking, about a head shorter than me. Bored in class, we would talk alot. I was surprised by how easygoing she was. She was nice to talk to and appreciated my jokes and sarcasm. 

Over time, I began to realise that I liked her. She had a sweet personality and never judged me. She was a great listener. We would spend hours texting daily. Being rather shy myself, my life was rather dull, with little to no friends. She brought light to my once dull life and I began looking forward coming to school everyday. She motivated me to put myself out there. Soon, I saw myself with a nice friend circle. She gave me the confidence to talk to more people, and was never selfish with her connections.

 We talked about everything under the sun. I would share my problems and she would confide in me as well. It was a friendship with so much trust in it. Till this day, I don't think I have established another friendship with that amount of trust in it. I knew I could count on her and that she would always back me up. We would send each other our favourite songs, and I came to like afew artists because of her. 

In a way, I felt indebted to her. She brought me out of my shell and brought out the best in me. I wanted to give back, even if it was just a little, but I didn't know how. I would help her with her weaker subjects but even then I always felt like I wanted to give more. There were times when I was tempted to tell her how I felt, but ended up not doing so as I was afraid of ruining the friendship. I knew she saw me nothing more than a close friend, and I was satisfied with that. I wanted to respect that trust. 

After graduation, we would meet up once in a blue moon. But we no longer talked as extensively, since we no longer had common topics to talk about. I truly missed the late night heart to heart conversations, and I really miss the times where we would stay up till 2am talking about life. 

Looking back at my life now, I realised that I had reverted back to my old ways. Retreated back into my tiny shell. The idea of meeting new people scares me, and as everyone else moves on with their lives, I feel alone, stuck, unable to progress and move on. I reminisce about the past, wondering how my friends are doing, but too afraid to reach out.

While I named the title as such, I still do like her, and I miss her quite alot. I feel a confusing mix of regret and resignment. I wished I had found the courage to tell her. But at the same time, I knew what the result would be. I am grateful that I was able to share those times with her.

It’s a constant struggle and I guess the day that the agony surpasses the fear is the day I’ll just go ahead and off myself.

It’s strange cause I keep trying to figure out why I’m feeling this way when rationally speaking I’m a rather blessed person. And yet I’m just sad. Every explanation or rationalization for my feelings that I come up with seems to make sense to some degree but none of them ever feel right. It feels like I’m just sad and that’s it. Like that’s my normal state of being, just unhappy. 

I mean there are actual issues in my life now and in the past but it’s not any worse than the average person yet my emotional state is disproportionately bad.

It’s frustrating cause feeling bad feels wrong when you can’t explain it rationally. And when some friends have tried to help me or talk to me about it it just feels like they don’t get it or rather I’m unable to properly talk about it cause I don’t understand it myself.

I guess a TL;DR would be “I’m just sad.” 

And by being like this I’m also constantly wasting every day and sooner or later my whole life will have passed me by and it’d be like I never existed. I know I should get up deal with it and be productive rather than wallowing in self-pity or wasting time trying to figure everything out. The smart and commonplace decision would probably be to just keep on trucking but what can I say I’m weak and this is all too hard for me to handle.

2680,thepooptato,1588512359,1,"Of course, being lonely isn't very fun, it's one of the more annoyingly human things someone can go through but there are a few aspects that are important to keep in mind when going through it yourself. 

**Being lonely** 

I've seen posts where people state that it feels like being lonely is weird and abnormal and it might definitely feel like it. However, even though you will rarely observe it for most people loneliness is a very universal human trait and practically everyone has gone through it to some extent. Some may have suffered more than others but there's nothing strange about being lonely, it's one of the most human things you can do. 

**If I just did this one simple thing**

Even though getting out of loneliness could just happen out of waiting for it. It very rarely does and almost always requires at a minimum your own effort. It is easy to point a finger to something that is causing your unhappiness such as *""I don't have a partner""* and while many examples will most certainly contribute to you being happier they will not solve the issue entirely. Not because they're not positive to have but because the underlying difficulties you experience are never solved which means that even then you won't magically feel happy. There is no one thing you can do to just be okay again, there is no one magical solution. 

**What to do?**

An important part of getting on top of this is looking at who you are and the things you do and why they're causing you to be lonely. It could perhaps be an unrealistic expectation for others or perhaps not being very good at social interaction and shying away from even trying to make new friends. This process isn't particularly fun, after all as humans we're not very good or fond of pointing out or own mistakes even when we're very negative about ourselves. Be realistic, in the end, your looks do not matter. Only the real assholes of society have looks as a standard to be friends with someone else, it might be nice to have it as an excuse but as hard as it may be it's not. 

**That seems quite challenging**

Yes it is, the process of climbing out of loneliness isn't easy or even remotely fun. You will be out of your comfort zone and it will be difficult. But in the end, it's one of the only ways you're going to achieve what you want so badly because in it's in your hands how shitty that may be. But while you might have to do the heavy lifting, there's no reason why you shouldn't call out for help. Loneliness is an extremely human condition most people you ask to help you with it will be supportive although you might be unlucky with a few don't let that dissuade you. 

**Don't give up yet**

Be aware that everyone you know are still only mere mortals, just because people are willing to help out doesn't mean that they have their entire day to help you cope and vent. Be realistic in your expectations for others, you have to build up a relationship with someone for them to also care about you, you can't magically have them care about you. so take every help you can get but know that someone else is just as human as you are and they're struggling with their own problems and don't have all day to help you. 

This is not some magical guide, but a few points you must very keenly aware of especially if you're having problems with loneliness for extended periods of time. Everyone is different and everyone has their own solution. Sometimes you're stuck in high school, or your current friends aren't very supportive or you might have anxiety. Loneliness is not the end, it's just another phase in your life.

Be realistic and good luck",lonely,To those that are lonely and sad,2020-05-03 23:25:59

If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-05-03 22:56:01

2685,mirandafischer,1588506243,1,"We all yearn for those friends who we actually resonate with, not the 'social media' superficial friends. The type of friend we can call up at 3am when we need help. The type of friend who stands by us at the highs as well as the lows. This is how to make those friends even after you have left education:

**1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you.

**2) Be proactive.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) stories - both great way to reconnect with old friends in a direct way.

**3) Use friendship apps.** There are many great apps out there which connect you with new people who are all on there for the same reason. They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](https://serendip.co/) \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values. Others include [Bumble](https://bumble.com/), but it is more used for dating.

**4) Phone calls.** Calling your existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message.

**5) Just ask.** This isn't dating, you don't need to worry about being rejected to find the 'one'. Ask people you have just met for a coffee or their number. ""I am new to the area and it would be great if you could show me around"". Put yourself at the receiving end of this - it's a very natural message.

**6) Join local groups.** This is not advised during lockdown! Whilst we are under social isolation we can fall back on #3 for the meanwhile.

For example, I'm asexual and I joined an asexual forum. It didn't work. I played online games to meet new people and make new friends, it didn't work as well.

2713,PointlessLoser,1588481950,1,"With spritz of joy feathered in between long bouts of agony, life is suffering. What is so great about ""the journey"" when the journey is arduous and painful? No meaningless platitudes about how there is some vague happiness or glory in pain is going to convince me otherwise.

All I have done my life is just try and survive to the next oasis of happiness, but I pull out my telescope now and it is desert as for as the eye can see. The oases got smaller and smaller until now, when they do not even exist; Maybe I can not see them, and they just lie over one of the dunes.

Some might say that you have to keep trekking for the oasis over the dunes, but try telling that to the parched, sunburned lips of a man whose journey seems endless. Moreover, why keep going if getting to the oasis just means that I will have to experience the treacherous search for another oasis all over again? What an idiotic concept, akin to a hamster in his hamster wheel.

The emotions I feel on a daily basis are so confusing and gut-wrenching. I spend a considerable amount of time trying to decipher them and their roots, but this task is a mostly fruitless endeavor. My skin becomes paler, and my body becomes fatter from continuing to establish poor habits.

I have a flare gun with rounds, but if I shoot it in this desert who is going to come get me? I am so alone. I do not know what led me to this desert. I might have interpreted the map wrong, or maybe the person who sold me the map was a snake oil salesman. It is possible that the destination never really existed.

I feel like casting the map away, for it only fills me with the hope that the destination might exist and that will mean I have to keep going. It also fills me with grief knowing that it is possible my own misguided turns are what have me going in circles and not the nonsensical muses of a phony cartographer.

When I see other people traveling, I bury my head into the ground like one of those cartoon ostriches. I think some of them might have canteens filled with water, but I am either much too haughty or afraid that the water might be contaminated; if they see my parched lips, they will try to offer me some.

Night time comes and the frigid air pulls my heat energy away with it. I have learned that nature tends to diffuse from high to low. Ordered things become disordered with time and that is just the natural flow of things. Nature should just go ahead and take all of my heat energy and redistribute it to travelers with better sense.

2715,libbyasanocean,1588481505,1,"I just wanted to share the story of when I realized how alone I really was and currently am. 

This all started in the fifth grade. During this time, I only had 3 friends, Mary, Bob, and James (fake names). This was the year Mary and Bob started dating. Mary was my best friend since the first grade, it felt like we were sisters. I had a crush on Bob for the longest time, and it hurt me when they got together, but as a supportive friend I didn’t say anything. Mary confided in me that she didn’t even like Bob very much. Yet, she was very jealous of Bob and I friendship because we were very close. Some part of me thinks she liked him but didn’t want to admit it. 

Anyways, because of them dating, I had no where to really put my feelings and so I started becoming boy crazy. Any guy at my school who I thought was attractive, was my crush. Every week I had a new crush - even though my root feelings were for Bob. 

James kind of did his own thing. He wasn’t liked by many due to his disability, although we were friends, he preferred to do his own thing. We occasionally hung out on weekends, and had lunch together everyday, but other than that he was good on his own. 

I tried to make some new friends, Morgan and Thelma (fake names). They were great honestly. We hung out multiple times throughout the year, and we even did a sleepover! One day, they told me that Mary had said to them that Mary was only my friend because she felt sorry for me. I couldn’t believe it, it broke my heart. I confronted Mary the next time I saw her and she denied it. Although mad, I chose to ignore it. Also, by the end of 5th grade, Thelma and Morgan and I were no longer friends. We were on good terms - we just stopped hanging out and talking as much. 

Skip to eighth grade, and I’m still friends with Mary, Bob, and James. I also added my friend Valerie and her sister Natalia (fake names), to the list of people I called friends. 

There was a day I saw Bob and Mary whispering. I asked them what they were talking about, and they said it was nothing. If I can remember, I think I kept asking Mary to tell me what she said, and she gave me a lame excuse, that at the time I believed. 

There were events throughout the year that showed that Mary and I were drifting as friends, and I didn’t know why. One day, I asked Bob, what was going on. I pretty much forced him to tell me. He told me that the thing him and Mary were talking about, was the same thing she said to Thelma and Morgan. She told bob, she felt sorry for me and really didn’t want to be my friend. I confronted her again, and this was pretty much the end of our relationship, as she admitted to it. 

I’m sure I left a lot situations out, due to this being already kind of long, and because since this was such a long time ago, it’s hard for me to remember what happened and when. Since having Mary as a friend, I have struggled to maintain friends outside of my friend Valerie and her sister. Since this happened, I completely shut myself out from trying to get close to the people I meet. I told stuff to Mary that she made me feel bad about, and I refused to let anyone do that to me again. 

My experience with Mary had affected me all the way into my adulthood. I still have only a handful of friends, and I feel so lonely. It feels like I’ll never have a close connection with another person again. It feels like I’ll never met another woman to get close to, because of how I assume everyone is like a Mary, and will only be my friend because they feel bad, or hurt me by leaving. 

I’m grateful to have my boyfriend and the handful of friends I do have — but like I said, it feels like I’ll never have a close connection to a woman friend to where we feel like sisters, because of what I experienced.",lonely,a story of how I became so lonely...,2020-05-03 14:51:45

2720,ariesgoddess97,1588476155,1,"Since lockdown began, it's just been me, my childhood friend, and our roommate stuck in the house together. At first, we started off spending all day everyday together, which is great because I love social interaction even though I feel I can be a bit annoying at times. Anyway, before lockdown even began I felt that my childhood friend and I were drifting apart slowly and now I feel that I can actually confirm that she or my roommate don't want anything to do with me. For example, my CF and our roommate spend a lot of time together, which is cool, but I usually don't get included. If I go out for food, I'll ask if anyone wants anything or if they would like to come with me, but the two of them will just leave the house and not ask me if I want anything or if I would like to join them. I didn't think anything of it really even though it kind of hurt my feelings a little bit, but if happened again tonight. This time I asked where they were going and they said to go get food and I asked if I could come. My CF seemed to be annoyed by me asking and when we got to the drive thru and I didn't order anything to eat (I wasn't hungry) she asked me why I even came.

It's not just when the leave the house, it's also when I try to include myself in whatever they're doing. If they're watching tv, I'll come in and sit with them, but the room is quiet until I leave to go do something and I can hear them laughing and talking again. 

 Idk maybe I'm overthinking things and I'm not being excluded like I think I am. I've always been lonely and a bit weird, but I don't know how much more I can take of this. It's bad enough that I have problems with self-isolation and being treated like this is only making it worse. And when I close myself off in my room, nobody comes to check on me. I don't know what to do. I don't have a lot of friends and I thought my CF would be the last person on Earth to treat me like this.",lonely,I feel alone even though my friends are with me,2020-05-03 13:22:35

2725,IrregularOccasion15,1588472103,1,"I posted here once and am grateful to those who replied. I'm here again for the same reason, only this time I'm without the promise of a future partner. Several months ago, I met a man who said he was interested in me. He's younger by nearly two decades (I'm nearing 40), and I was ambivalent about giving him a shot, but I found him interesting, too, and not simply due to age or appearance: we had numerous shared interests that had drawn us together in the first place. Circumstances prevented us from making any immediate or serious plans, but promised to wait until circumstances were more appropriate.

Well, he recently contacted me and told me however deeply he cared about me (I'm paraphrasing loosely), he found someone else and thought ""he might be the one.""

As I alluded, he's about 18 years younger than i.i expected something like this and guarded myself enough that this only stings a lot, rather than devastating me. But it was sudden.

 I'm feeling every bit of my 38 years right now, plus some. My health isn't the best, and I already want getting out enough; with Corona-tine I'm stuck inside even more often. My roomie has offered in the past to hook me up with someone he knows, but given the company he keeps... H*LL f*ck no!

I'm also on the autism spectrum, in the region formerly called Asperger's, and that complicates my ability to interact with people, let alone meeting new ones. If my mother wasn't a local shut-in, I'd go out exactly once a week during this ""pandemic"". Her needs have me out about two-to-three extra times a week, including to visit her. Otherwise I sit inside doing nothing about my weight or asthma and making my cholesterol worse (my doctor never renewed my asthma or cholesterol meds). I shop for myself maybe, MAYBE once a week. During normal times, I go out a few times a week due to obligations. Those are indefinitely on hold for now.

I'm not after sympathy. Just needed to share... And hit my inhaler again.

This quarantine shit has been really hard for me. Like really hard. I’m an only child and have never been in a real relationship. I feel lonelier than usual. A typical day, pre quarantine, is go to work, go home, and go to the bar. I don’t even like to socialize at the bar. The loud music and alcohol kinda helps to drown out my thoughts. But now I have to where to go. No one to see. All of my friends are either practicing social distancing or have their own families/lives. Being at home 24/7 really has me in my thoughts. It gets even worse at night time. All I think about is how I’ll be alone forever. I’ll never have a bf or kids or anything. Social media sucks Bc everyone I went to school with are always posting pictures of their partners,kids, etc which is just a constant reminder for me that I’ll never have any of that. 

And now it’s time for me to be a hypocrite. I don’t even think I want a bf or kids anymore. All of the guys I’ve ever dealt with are all trash which makes me believe all men are. I know that they aren’t but I can’t help but think that. Kids are cool and I love babies but I can’t help but think what if I do magically find a guy, start a family and he leaves me in the end ? My parents have both been married and divorced twice. It was bad. And I never want to go threw that. I have sooo so much love to give but guys just end up treating me like Shit.

He isn’t physically abusive anymore. Just verbally I guess. Not like he doesn’t make threats like “stfu or else” though. We’ve been together 9 years. Since I was 14 and he was 17 at the time. We never make out. I mean like never. Not in years. We only kiss when he goes to work and it’s just a peck. There’s no affection. No cuddles, nothing. I guess it’s silly to think I’d automatically get that if I cheated on him. I just get lonely. We have a toddler together so I’m always stuck inside with her all day everyday. I used to go to college but I stopped this semester because I couldn’t take all of the mean things my bf would say to me some mornings. I failed my finals miserably because that morning I was crying so hard and late after arguing with my bf all morning. I feel so pathetic. I don’t drive or have a job. I have literally nowhere to go and my bf loves it. He tells me to leave the apartment whenever I complain about anything. Says I have nothing to show for my life and he’s right. One day he told me he didn’t have to be a parent to our child because he “provides everything” (we live paycheck to paycheck so it’s not like he’s spoiling me or we’re living lavishly). When I tell my boyfriend how lonely I am he says “how can you be lonely when you have (daughters name)” .. like yea a two year old is the same as an adult that actually talks. 

Thinking about what he’d do if he found out I was doing anything behind his back.. it’s scary. But I’m so tired of living like this. Unloved and unappreciated. I won’t physically cheat on him because the consequences are too scary but dam, a girl could use some love.

When I'm at school I always feel like people are talking about me although they most likely aren't and sometimes I get my words mixed around which is very annoying when I'm reading out loud. Anyways I officially have no real life friends. I have 20 friends on my PS4 but I only play with one of them a lot besides my older brother. I'm being honest when I say my online friends have given me more friendship than my real ones. I messaged one of my real friends last week just saying ""how are you going?"" And he just left me on read, I try messaging others and they just leave me on read. When I message an online friend they will respond within 3 minutes (that's if they're not busy or sleeping). I'm not talking to my "" real friends"" anymore because I had a lot of time with my own thoughts and realised I'm like a background character in my small group at school. They plan dinners and going to the movies but I'm never told about it until after they have done it. Now I don't mind sitting alone at school but when I'm home it just makes me sad. I can't even focus at school well because I can't pay attention in class, not that I don't want to it's just that I get distracted fast. I'm probably just going to go mute at school now.

We started hanging out for a little bit, and then one day out of the blue she said that she liked me. At the time I didn't like her back but I still said I liked her too. We started to get closer over Thanksgiving break and I caught feelings for her while we were talking. We planned a date a day before school started again. I thought the date went smoothly, but apparently it wasn't good enough for her because she went back with her ex the next day. I was heartbroken at first but I forgave her and we started being friends again. It was all fine for a month and then she invited me to her apartment to hangout with a couple of her friends. We all hanged out all day and we played spin the bottle right next to the Jacuzzi. Me and her kissed during the game, but I didn't think of it much because it was a game. It was what happened after the game is what confuses me the most. So she was walking me to the pool bathroom so I can change into some dry clothes. So me and her were talking about one of the other dudes she kissed during the game and we were laughing about it for a little bit, then it became complete silence for a while. We were just staring at each other for a long time, that's when she kissed me. We made out for a long time. After we were done I went back home. I was confused and happy at the same time. I kinda fell into a depression after that, I felt constantly unhappy because she continued to stay with her ex. And that's when I felt played. I tried to keep myself happy around her for a few months. Then all of a sudden she stopped talking to me and her friends except for one dude (which wasn't her boyfriend). I started to get suspicious and I logged into her account and read their messages (which I regret very deeply). Turns out they were gonna start being boyfriend and girlfriend a few months after she breaks up with her ex. I was devastated, I was pissed off because they've only talking for a month and they'd were already dating. I continued being ""friends"" with her for a month, and then I lost it one day and stopped being friends with her. Then she said told me that ""I was like every other dude in her life"", ""I didn't have to be like every guy"" (What she meant by that is that I didn't have to be sad), and ""she loved me and cared for me"". Which hurted a lot.

I feel like I'm never gonna find the right girl thats gonna love me back. I feel like shit. No one is gonna love me back at all. (Ive been played 3 times before this but thia one is the biggest one ive gone through)

The person controlling the event was going to pick on someone else but the actor had other plans. He stopped the guy and then pointed at me. He got the microphone and told me to stand and asked me, ""What is your question?"" I said, ""It's not a question, it's a comment. I drove 5 hours to be here."" He said, ""Was it worth it?"" and I said yes. He said to follow him on social media to me. Then he had everyone clap for me. After the Q&amp;A session was over, I decided I would like to find out where he went. I guess that's kind of like stalking, but I couldn't help it. I was so close to him and he was so friendly. So instead of talking his friend who was standing in the lobby on his phone, I decided to go to the bar next door. So I bought a street ticket and went inside. I saw him. In the VIP section. The entire upstairs of the bar was VIP and my ticket was normal, so I couldn't go up there and talk to him. So I just started staring at him. I didn't want to be creepy, but I wanted him to notice me. Well, he did. And he started ferociously kissing this girl. After about 30 minutes of crappy music and no progress, I decided to go home. So I drove back to PA, and fell asleep. The next day I followed him on social media. I found out he has an official Facebook group that used to be hosted by his official website. I found the link to the group on his website. I joined the group and tried to make friends. I'm kind of the obsessive type when I have a crush, in a very unhealthy way. So I was on that group all the time for the next few days. I did all kinds of research about him online and I found out that he was gay. I have no problem with gay people, but I just got the feeling that he wasn't completely gay. Anyway, on the group a few days later was a news article that his hometown was hosting a showing of the movie I had just seen. So I decided to go. It was closer after all. So I posted what time I would be there in the comments. It turned out that he must have read the comments. When I arrived an hour early, I saw him walk into a diner near the movie theatre. So I went into the diner. He was with his mother and someone who appeared to be a relative older than his mother, maybe an aunt or his grandmother. I didn't spot him inside the diner so I ordered and ate. Keep in mind that I hadn't slept in days, and I was an emotional wreck. I went up to the counter to pay, and he was sitting right next to me. Staring at me through a mirror. Smiling. I freaked out and after paying ran out of the restaurant. I was having my first panic attack. So after screaming and crying in the parking lot near my car, I walked around the town and tried to gather my strength so I could go into the theatre. I went in and bought my ticket and then tried to approach him but had the sudden urge to throw up. I tried changing direction and running into the handicapped bathroom, but the elderly woman he was with was in there. So I yelped and ran out and asked him where the ""OTHER"" bathroom was. He looked disappointed. Really, he did. But he pointed and said, ""I think it's over there"". So I ran there and cried in there a little, and possibly threw up. I then went into the theatre and the movie had already started. I watched the movie in silence and then after the movie ended spotted him a few rows in front of me. See, the weird thing was that even though his hometown was a superb of a pretty big city, there were hardly any people in the theatre. Then, I tried to approach him again, but as soon as I was going to talk he interrupted me to say, ""Thank you for coming."" in this very static way. I said, ""Thank you for inviting me"" even though I wasn't sure that he really did. He left. He provoked my schizoaffective. I had my first psychotic episode 2 weeks later. Time passes and my obsession does not go away. After you have a psychotic episode, your entire brain chemistry changes. I was no longer the same. I was ""crazy"". So, I had a YouTube channel previous to that and one of my old videos had some interesting ideas in it. A few months later, he created a television show based off of one of my unique ideas... Then he guest starred on a TV show where a skewed version of what happened between us happened on screen. He even describes his love interest as ""the cute girl from Maine with the bit up lips and the Asperger's... you're just a chess move buddy.... Oh you mean you aren't clued into the whole act? She's a dirty girl who knows what works..."" I have chewed up lips and asperger's and I had already posted my diagnosis online. The thing is, at the time, I really think he thought I was playing some kind of sick game with him. Maybe I was, but I was def more innocent than he thought. So after more time passes, he comes out with a movie. It is even closer related to the events that had happened and even includes the main character having schizoaffective. He was dating a guy that had similar facial features to mine, and he would always work with other actors who look like me. But his work before we met was completely different. It's like a rift. Anyway more time passes and he decides to star in a live off broadway show in New York. I decide it's time for me to try again as I am more sane than I was before. Nothing major happened except I gave him a note with a whole bunch of crap written on it and I'm not even sure it makes logical sense. The thing is, most people dont believe that he cares about me. They won't watch the movies and shows that were possibly based off me and they won't even let me talk about it to them. I just feel so alone because I feel like this man totally gets me, but I dont understand why he won't talk to me. There's so much more to the story than that, but my post is already too long.",lonely,story time,2020-05-02 15:52:07

And is not the lute that soothes your spirit,  the very wood that was hollowed out with knives?  When you are joyous,  look deep into your heart and shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight. 

Some of you say  ""joy is greater than sorrow, "" and others say, ""nay, sorrow is the greater. ""
But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board,  remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.

Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.  Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced. When the treasure keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or sorrow rise or fall

I’ve been trying to push myself to anything but lately I just see others do so much better in so much shorter of time. Frankly I’m just accepting the fact that I’ll never be good at anything, I’ll never be even ok at anything. I’m too awkward, shy and self conscious for anyone to want to be friends with, I am too quiet to keep a convo going. I’m too boring too keep a girl interested for longer than a day.

I’ve never been congratulated, I’ve never received any good luck or great job from teachers.

Trying to just be there for people, but I’ve never looked at myself and realized I have no one here for myself.

2803,MGaber,1588396687,1,"27/M I don't even know where to begin.

Maybe I should start when I move home from Colorado. I was a paraprofessional (teaching assistant) at a school for students with behavior issues in Colorado, but as cheesy as it sounds, I found a family out there. I lost 30-40 pounds because I stopped drinking and starting working out, also weed, and I actually felt like I had a real connection with people out there. I had people who genuinely cared about me. My last day in Colorado the students gave me cards they drew by hand. Marvel themed cards mostly because they know I love Marvel, then they all gave me a group hug. The moment they started giving me the cards I teared up. It took everything for me to hold it in. Once all the students left, one of my co-workers asked if I was gonna cry. Without skipping a beat I started to sob. The very next day I was driving halfway across the country back to what I called home

Two to three days into me being home, I went looking for the shotgun my mom owned. I didn't use it, but I picked it up because I wanted to feel the weight. I grabbed the barrel because I wanted to feel the chill of the metal. I held it for a minute, then went looking for some shells, which I found. I then put it all away and texted a crisis hotline. We texted for hours until I felt better. Which, I use better as a loose term. I was supposed to go to my brothers high school graduation, and I missed it. I forgot my ticket and I absolutely exploded. All I remember is feeling anger and rage. Not towards anyone, just the pure raw emotion of it. There was another ticket, but I just couldn't bring myself to go. I drove to a local cemetery, kicked off my socks and shoes and walked in the grass, dragged my hand across a tree to feel the roughness of the bark, and I just sat there. Alone. For hours. Family called and family texted, asking where I was, but not asking how I was feeling. My dad saw me explode because I was on his porch when I did, but no one thought to ask how I was.

After I left the cemetery, I drove an hour back to my mom's town where I sat in a Walmart parking lot for another two to three hours talking to myself. At this point I should mention that not too many people sent me any sort of text, Snapchat, or anything saying welcome home. I put a picture of the big green freeway signs in the city near me on my Snapchat the morning I got home saying something about being glad to be home or something. I think 2 people sent me something saying welcome home. That's it. Other people saw it. No one cared.

Fast forward to where I left off, my parents recommend I see a counselor, which I did, and he helped at first. Then, about 5ish sessions in, he looked like he was tired of listening to me talk, which I don't blame him, but he wasn't helping me anymore. Then, August came around and I was moving an hour and a half away for another teaching job, which I was excited for because I thought it would be just like the school I came from in Colorado.

I could not be more wrong

The school I came from in Colorado, in my eyes, they were my family. I loved them all, and I still miss them all. This school, I had a coworker go complain to my boss about something that happened the second week of school, which he found out the complaint was blown WAAAY out of proportion, but to be safe I got moved to a different part of the school. The new wing I was in, another coworker allegedly went to my boss saying she didn't like me and wanted me out, so I got moved back to my original classroom. Long story short, lots of drama at my school and half of it comes from staff, not students.

In January, I was in my best friends wedding. In fact, I was his best man, but I don't feel like I should have been. For the past 5ish years, him and I hung out almost every weekend. I'd get off work, drive to his place, and we would spend the weekend getting drunk, watching Netflix and YouTube, playing games, and whatever else we could think of. Now, he's married to a woman I think he settled for, I feel like he doesn't actually like, I don't like, and I hardly ever talk to him anymore. The wedding, I was his best man, but I didn't feel like it. The wedding pictures of course he's getting them with his mom, his dad, the bride, his brother, his entire family, his family and the bride's entire family. Out of all the wedding pictures taken, I was in maybe three of them. Now granted, I get that I'm not family (kinda. He was married to someone in my family, they divorced, and he and I stayed friends), but I'm his best man. I feel like I should hold some sort of importance of more than just 3 pictures. Which, the wedding was in January and I still don't have any pictures. Idk how long wedding pictures take, but I'm assuming they don't take 3+ months. I think they have the pictures and never bothered to send me them. If I'm wrong about how long pictures take, please let me know. I obviously don't know.

Then, this virus hits. I followed this thing since the day it first popped up on Reddit. I tried telling people at work, they didn't care or listen. I tried telling family, and they barely cared. Then it hit here, and I practically thought to myself, ""if only anyone fucking listened to me, none of you would be shocked by this right now"". Not that knowing about it would cause it to be any less severe, it's that I tried talking about it but no one cared until it was already here.

I never finished my teaching degree, which I'm glad I never did because that would be more debt for a job I'm hoping to leave soon, but I never finished school so as a paraprofessional I'm only hourly at my school. What that means is since I'm not salary, I was told to suck it and I'm not getting paid over this break. I've been off work since the third week of March. My school also didn't set up online classes until recently, which I'll be helping with starting Monday. However, there's a month left of school and the kids already have behavior issues as it is, why TF are we even starting online classes with a month of school left. I digress because work isn't why I'm bitching.

Long story short, I decided to crash at my mom's place for the past month and a half since I've been off work. I've done nothing but the play videogames and use other unhealthy coping mechanisms because I go days on end without anyone texting me and at this point I'm just rambling and idk what I'm even saying anymore.

I gained all the weight I lost when I moved back from Colorado, I didn't mention the girl I was talking to last summer, or the first time I tried an miniscule amount of shrooms. I didn't mention why I can't smoke weed anymore, or the girl I was talking to this past winter who I had a fight with and no longer talking to. I didn't mention my addictive personality, or the last time I remember feeling truly happy (it was this past October)

I like solitude, but I hate loneliness, and tonight for the first time in a long time I wish I was dead (I don't have suicidal thoughts, I just wish I were dead. Just so we're clear). I don't know what I'm looking for on here, because obviously there is no magic wand to magically fix me, I am just desperate for something because I'm not suicidal right now, but if I had to guess what'll be my cause of death 10 or 20 years down the line, I'm afraid it'll be suicide due to loneliness, and that thought unsettles me deeply",lonely,"I really don't mean to throw a pity party, I just don't know where else to turn to",2020-05-02 15:18:07

I miss having someone to talk to nonstop


I miss having someone who genuinely wants to talk to me a lot


I miss having someone there


I miss talking to someone


I miss calling 


I miss playing games with someone


I miss feeling like it was just me and them, and that's all we needed


I miss feeling special


I miss feeling wanted


I miss feeling, like I wasn't so alone, and maybe just once, all the hell I go through is worth it



Maybe life is just testing me, that someone amazing will come from the shit I live in



Maybe forever is coming, and maybe it's happy

In my life I can say I’ve only truly loved one boy, I’ve only been alive 20 years so it hasn’t been a very long one haha. I’ll call this boy Chris. I met chris in 3rd grade because we were in the same class although we didn’t really talk much until we were both in 7th grade. He happened to also live in the same apartments as me and was also friends with my cousins! The first time I talked to him was because i was with my cousins playing outside and he came and wanted to play too, so he did and we were put on same team. He happened to remember me from 3rd grade and we caught up. He loved to play soccer and everyday in the afternoon he would go out and play. I happen to also play soccer and I think the only reason I started to love it more was because of him. He would like to play with me and always tried to help me get better haha. Or when we would play against each other he always made sure to go easy on me. I slowly started to catch feelings and they also started grow. He was so sweet and would always tease me. Before I knew it I was in love with him. In 8th grade we started walking to school and home together. I was so happy! Although I started to notice how many other girls also liked him, and I’ll admit it made me jealous. I couldn’t compete, I wasn’t popular and I wasn’t the prettiest. That didn’t really matter to me though because Chris still talked to me and hung out with me at lunch I was happy! All the girls who liked him would always ask me to help them get with him and I would just ignore it because I liked him too. When we both got to high school he sadly decided to go to a different one but he still live in the same apartments as me so I would still see him, it sucked because I always wanted to be close to him, because like I’ve said before I don’t know why but I was so in love with him. Everyone in our friend group knew and I think he did too at one point, but he never started acting weird or stopped talking to me because of that. I wanted to get closer to him but I had no idea how or where to start. Then we entered sophomore year and I was still in the same spot 3 years later, me being in love with him and he still only seeing me as friend. I didn’t want to give up though because I still had hope, then I remember one day I was scrolling through Twitter and I saw him post a picture of a girl...his new girlfriend! I was so heartbroken I actually cried (embarrassing i know). She was so beautiful and I well,  I had not changed much since middle school. I slowly distanced myself from him and stopped talking to him because I was sad. He would still try to talk to me and you know be friends, but I was so angry at him, myself, his new girlfriend who didn’t even know I existed! I stopped replying  and eventually left him alone. He didn’t last with his girlfriend and they broke up a few months later. I went on with my life and tried so hard to forget about him. My junior year I guess you can say I changed a bit, I started to dress better and kinda style my hair. It was definitely doing something because boys were actually paying attention to me! I was actually getting asked out! Although I never said yes to anyone I was shy and had never had a boyfriend yet. Then came my senior year and it was basically the same as junior year. Then I remember one day I got a message that said “why don’t you talk to me anymore” “you never reply” and my heart sank, it was Chris. At this point I had sworn I was over him so I replied and we chatted for a bit. We became friends again and  he currently has another girlfriend who I believe is the one he got after his first one. Im so happy for him and of course part of me still loves him a lot! We play online and talk but I try to limit my communication with him because I know if I start talking to him like I used too I’ll fall in love with him again and plus he has a girlfriend. It still sucks that I never got a chance with him, who knows what could’ve happened. I’m 20 now and still have never had a boyfriend and sometimes it gets really lonely. I always wanted to play with his hair while he lays on my lap, admire him as he play video games, or just listen to him talk about his day. I know that my love for him will never run out. I hope one day though that someone will love me just as hard as I loved Chris. If you came along this far thank you for reading my rambling haha",lonely,A one sided love story,2020-05-02 10:28:21

I was actually getting asked out! Although I never said yes to anyone I was shy and had never had a boyfriend yet. Then came my senior year and it was basically the same as junior year. Then I remember one day I got a message that said “why don’t you talk to me anymore” “you never reply” and my heart sank, it was Chris. At this point I had sworn I was over him so I replied and we chatted for a bit. We became friends again and  he currently has another girlfriend who I believe is the one he got after his first one. Im so happy for him and of course part of me still loves him a lot! We play online and talk but I try to limit my communication with him because I know if I start talking to him like I used too I’ll fall in love with him again and plus he has a girlfriend. It still sucks that I never got a chance with him, who knows what could’ve happened. I’m 20 now and still have never had a boyfriend and sometimes it gets really lonely. I always wanted to play with his hair while he lays on my lap, admire him as he play video games, or just listen to him talk about his day. I know that my love for him will never run out. I hope one day though that someone will love me just as hard as I loved Chris. If you came along this far thank you for reading my rambling haha",lonely,A one sided love story,2020-05-02 10:23:59

I am missing the feeling of ever going in the local woods of my town and just having some childhood memories. But my friends never let it seem that they dislike me.

2869,CJ_Thomas,1588371412,1,"For context: round about 2018 - early 2019 was when I finally started to date with some distant regularity. In mid 2019, a few months after I had a really bad breakup, my depression got way worse, and I started figuring out that I had home-grown some pretty killer issues with anxiety regarding women. I don't think I've been on any sort of date for about a year. I've more or less been waiting for the last decade to find somebody, and tbh the loneliness - between the worsening bouts with depression and now anxiety to deal with - the loneliness is really starting to wear on me as person.

I feel that I am starting to lose this fight, and that I am to the point where I'm no longer healthy enough to carry on a good, healthy relationship. I don't handle rejection or breakups very well, I get anxious and panicky when it comes to sexual activity of literally any kind, I'm too scared to make the first move as a man - which at that point you're just sorta fucked. On top of that, I struggle with jealousy, and in some cases unreasonable anger towards women that I realize isn't healthy - but I can't always help but to project some of the hard shit I've been through onto the women I see around me.

These things not only make me not able to carry on healthy relationships, but they also end up contributing (I struggle to say ""They make me do X"" they don't make me do anything) to some of the shitty ways that I act, and the shitty things that I feel about other people - and so it compounds me with not only am I not capable of love, I don't deserve it either.

I'm the person I was afraid I'd turn into at this age, except instead of being handsome/dark/angry like a movie :P - I'm just kinda pathetic, and angry, and not really worth noting.

As a child, I was told that my name means ""Victory."" As an adult, I looked up my name, and it actually means ""hill, or bump.""

2874,lostmaverick1111,1588369341,1,"Typing out that subject line felt like a dagger to the chest. It’s like forcing myself to look through a mirror that vividly reflects my actual reality.
I’m in my 30s and have now accepted the saddest realisation that I’m alone. I have a small family that I’m grateful for and beat myself up for feeling that I need and want more. 
I know there are people out there that don’t even have the support of a family foundation, so I feel like I’m being ungrateful, but I’m really not.
I just feel empty and crave the warmth of having a group of friends that I can share life’s little moments with. 
Over the years I’ve distanced myself from groups of people that have eventually turned out to be quite toxic. I tolerated people for years even though it was no good for my mental health. My anxiety doesn’t help at all as I don’t like it being the focus of attention. I worry it pushes people further away, and because I don’t talk much when I’m in a funk, people automatically assume I’m being weird and in turn shun me. In the few times I’ve shared my condition, it’s usually met with blankness, a lack of understanding and tangible discomfort. 
I’m super empathetic and have being taken advantage of far too many times because of it.
I fall under the  lgbt spectrum and wish I was within a community that embraced that too. 
I’m at an age where I feel that trying to make friends with strangers just looks desperate. It’s like I can almost hear people’s thoughts assuming something must be wrong with me if I’ve gone through this far in life and have no circle of friends.
The truth is, I moved around so much growing up that I never had that solid foundation of friends that most people have from going through school, college etc.
The whole process of it has knocked me down so much to the point I assumed the label of being an introvert. Reality is, I’m more of an ambivert. Once I’m comfortable around people, I’m outgoing. Around strangers, I tend to be more observant and reserved.
I feel, care and love too much. And I’m loyal to a fault. I feel it puts people off. I wish I could connect with people that genuinely care and check in as much as I’d do for them. I always seek to make connections with deeper meaning, but always end up meeting people that focus on the superficial.
I feel I have so much to give and share, but so far, the pain of constantly being rejected has made me recoil to a point where it’s now suffocating.
How do people restart life at such a late stage? How do you meet and connect with new people without looking so desperate even though your approach is non-invasive and subtle?
It’s sad that I often think about when I die and no one would turn up at my funeral except my immediate family? It breaks my heart to envision them wondering why no one else showed up for the person they love so much but the rest of the world didn’t...

Even if the opportunity for friendship did happen I always ruin it somehow, stop bothering with people out of fear they secretly don’t like me, that they find me weird. I can never feel comfortable in front of someone, it’s like I exhaust myself trying to sound, act and seem normal, like putting on a front.

One when I was 14, just a silly little relationship, nothing too serious. Then I was with someone for 3 years, this person was nice for the first year but after that they became really emotionally abusive and I didn’t even realise till later on.

I’ve always wanted a girl friend who I can go out with and go shopping, do typical girly things, but also someone who likes the same things as me like games, who’s laid back asf, not bitchy, who would just wanna chill and not do much.

I also have a strained relationship with my mom and I’m not terribly close with my only sibling anymore either. My family is one person - my dad. (My parents are divorced too)

Can anyone relate?

Now I’m just venting but read on if you’d like...

I was a depressed kid even as early as elementary school. I ended up getting into drugs because they made me feel happy. I really dug myself into a hole and found myself homeless and friendless at age 24. I burned bridges with all of my high school friends. Mooost of those friends I’m probably better off without anyway. I was always pegged as the shy weird kid in all of my friend groups growing up. 

I made incredible progress getting my life back on track in the last 2 years. I’m clean besides a few relapses and I have a decent paying albeit soul crushingly repetitive commission based job at a call center. I have my own car, motorcycle, and apartment and I live in a somewhat expensive city. 

I have friends. They’re all people I’ve met in the last 2.5 years. I’ve also had mild success with online dating.

Waking up to no notifications beside my phone being fully charged is kinda getting to me tbh. Last year i was really depressed and lost a lot of friends because i pushed them away, and the few i have left have given up on me which i don’t blame them. I tried regularly texting them but it just felt forced and awkward. I don’t have a special connection with any of them. It just makes me feel sad that i can’t keep friends like other people do and have that strong bond. So I resorted to twitter and online friends but that’s not really working out too since i’m crippling with insecurity plus i was placing my self worth in how much likes my posts got. Whenever someone interacted with me i didn’t know how to reply with something interesting so i usually took hours to reply and the conversation ended  short because of me. I felt like i had to keep trying to get their attention by posting what they wanted to see even though i’m not really a fan of it.  I tried taking breaks off social media and dived into binge watching every show. It helped a little till i enjoyed something a lot or found something funny that’s when i wished i could send it to a friend.

Since lockdown I’ve been texting loads of people trying to stay sane but it’s apparent most other people have phone calls, drunk Zoom group calls with family and friendship groups going on most evenings. The only person who calls me is my ex-girlfriend, and that’s when she’s bored and it’s a reminder that part of the fact she left is because I had no real friends, and her extroversion and ability to make friends is what I wish I could be but just can’t seem to do.

My evenings are sitting playing PS4 alone wondering what’s wrong with me, why I don’t ever form close friendships or have a group to fit into. I’m starting to believe that I’ve missed the boat and wonder if family and the friends you make in early life are really the only dependable close bonds. And it’s not like I don’t try, I probably text about 10 different “friends” a day but it doesn’t seem to help.

I’m dreading lockdown lifting as well as I don’t really have anyone who’s house I’ll be rushing round to hang out.

I'm 22, 5ft7, study Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), and live in central London.

As far as my personality is concerned, my female friends have always said that I'm quite cute, charming, loving and affectionate, so I'm hoping that's your cup of tea! I have always been quite sociable and popular throughout my life, but deep down, I am fairly shy and introverted. I'm quite fun and enjoyable to talk to, however, so I'm sure we'd get on just fine! :)

In terms of my interests, I thoroughly enjoy reading books on philosophy, history, and economics, as well as non-fiction and detective fiction. I also like travelling (lived in 9 different countries till date owing to my dad's job!), discussing politics, following all kinds of sport (especially cricket, football, tennis, chess and badminton), spending absolute hours on good old YouTube, doing loads of window-shopping (I've always had a habit of trying on *reeeally* nice clothes, but hardly ever purchasing them!), playing the piano, listening to a lot of music (primarily EDM, classical, and folk), going on lovely long walks, watching plenty of documentaries and films (mainly comedy and romance), cuddling, and so much more...

I enjoy trying out and doing a wide variety of things, so I can almost guarantee that I would have great fun doing a hobby of yours that is not mentioned in the list above! Just try me! ;)

On that note, thanks a lot for taking the time to read my post! I hope to hear from you soon :)

I feel like I need to get professional help but I don’t know how to access it especially with the pandemic. My coping mechanisms are alcohol, weed, and video games and those aren’t helping anymore.

\- My Sister moved multiple provinces away with my nephew

\- I have a severe alcohol dependency and a lack of money

\- And it's been 15 days since my last suicide attempt

That about clears it up yeah? I have no idea what I'm gonna do though, because every time things start getting better, they seem to just get worse and worse almost immediately afterwards. My sister moving kills me because it's either I move out to be a part of my nephew's life in buttfuck Canada, or I let him grow up and mostly forget about me. This was already stressing me out but then of course there's the fact I had been sober for an extremely long time and in danger of a breakdown by the time I got my latest bottle so when I did I just downed 1300mg of an old Zoloft prescription and spent the next day or two not dying but in bitter fucking agony. \~ Quick Comment \~ Killing yourself with antidepressants and alcohol is insanely ineffective, and I'm speaking from my second time trying it. 

This time didn't even come close, it was just agony for hours. Since then it's been a violent swing from completely content and happy to aggressive and irrational outbursts of being very violent towards myself. I fucked up my arm like a 16 year old girl looking for attention, and don't mistake that as my demeaning of all depressed girls, but being I most certainly am none of those things I feel so fucking silly I even felt compelled to cut up my arm and not finish the job. Honestly, maybe I'm just bitter or some shit, I can't even tell anymore.

I don't know what the future's gonna hold for me but fuck it man, if I didn't talk to someone about all this shit soon I think I'm gonna go insane. And I can already barely deal with it now, I don't think I'm gonna deal with it getting worse any better.

But that doesn’t mean I won’t stop feeling sore, that tight feeling in you’re chest, when slowly vivid memories slowly loses it’s colour. This year I’ve moved into a new school and was separated with my class that I knew for 4 years. I had two friends (and my only friends) that I strongly loved and admired. Both helped me out of my shell to open up with the rest of the class, I was so happy, I remember my cheeks hurting from laughing, I dated one of the two, and I was madly in love, they were also my first love. I’d want to spend time with them as much as I can, but we couldn’t because their mom was a teacher there, and we didn’t want to get caught. Instead we had constant calls that lasted for hours, and chat when we walked home. Remember the saying love is blind? I was completely blind that they didn’t actually love me back. 
We both agreed we’d not tell anyone, but they instantly told everyone and even his mother knew in a couple of weeks, they were boasting about it and not telling me about it. They’d say “I have a (gender)friend” to everyone they spoke to. Even though they never tried anything romantic, and I was the only one who made moves (btw they asked me out and they just don’t do anything afterwards like wtf) They used me to flex only. They rarely started to talk to me, and when we did have the time, they’d  just play games. (Ik that sounds memey, but if you barely talk to someone and then call them without actually talking to them yelling at the their game, Hella deserve to be mad, even I stop playing games to talk to people). 
We both agreed to break up,
We’d both said we’d still liked each other a lot and will wait for each other to be older, they told me how much they’d want to be with me even if we’re separated.

And they instantly started to flirt with another person who was in our class.

I felt sick. It tore me apart, when I think of myself in a romantic relationship it makes me vomit. 
We said we’d still talk, but they’ve been always making excuses. 
I had only one friend left.
They were my sunshine.
I loved them, even there imperfections.
They emitted a homely, family presence.
They still do...
They left me though, for someone more fun, that fun person hates me, and they play together 24/7 (without telling me when they say they will) On video games. 
Okay, I love bingeing on minecraft, pokemon, Skyrim and other games that I love so fucking much, 
But if you’re going to leave me for entertainment rather than catching up with me, and bonding like how we use to, and rant to me we talk talk as much and always tell me you’re busy during lockdown. 
Why do you blame me?
I don’t feel valued, I feel alone, my sister and my parents always reject me every time I ask to just spend time with them.
Is it that much of a struggle to just talk to me? Is it selfish for wanting to laugh with Someone?

I miss the sore cheeks, 
I miss the deep conversations 
I miss being able to wake up excited to see the people I love. 
I miss them. 
I know this is cheesy but that’s how my raw brain works. It’s just how I feel, I don’t have anyone to tell me what’s even right or wrong anymore.

2948,_donotforget_,1588302616,1,"I see it a ton. 

I went to the public market since I was a baby- it was and still is one of my favorite places in &lt;insert area here&gt;. I wouldn't really call it a community, though. Likewise for everything else. You go, you buy, but no one talks to you or support you. I don't even know if it's that I'm broke and rarely get out; my dad basically funded most microbreweries before drinking daily for years did it's thing and killed him, none of those bartenders talking about how much they support their customers gave a shit. Aaaand now they're on TV asking us to support 'our community' and buy a lot of beer from them. 

Yet everyone is posting on their own accounts or on area accounts-like there's an instagram that's called explore&lt;insert area here&gt;, each week, someone new takes it over and shows their view of &lt;insert area here&gt;, and mentioning how until they moved here they never had a community, or that they've moved out of the area then come back and missed how much of a community is here. ""When you walk into &lt;insert bar here&gt;, it is instantly welcoming. What makes &lt;insert area here&gt; so great to live is how friendly people are.""

Like da fuck? I go to the same places and do N O T have a friendly, welcoming community. People on the street most certainly aren't friendly. The suburbs are isolating and boring, even the working class ones- I don't know a single one of my neighbors. The inner city is typical inner city except even the Mayor got criticized by our governor for being too afraid to shut down a block party during mandatory social distancing. But nope, we are v e r y f r i e n d l y here. 

I ate at a ramen shop because it was close to one of the only low-cost art markets I could attend and try selling woodworking stuff. The chef was extremely welcoming, and I stuck to his shop because that was the first time in 21 years I've ever been welcomed, anywhere. Even when I stopped going weekly the dude still says hey, how are you? Not even deep friend shit, just, not hostile. That's all it takes to stand out here. 

No, the bars aren't welcoming, the streets aren't welcoming, I wouldn't say there's a thriving network of artisans that all support one another yet that's everywhere- one guy said fuck you asshole because I didn't want to pay $35 for a shirt he ""designed"" that he kept pushing. The dude is on instagram and 20 people are agreeing with him how friendly that collective is. The makerspace was run-down, with bulletproof doors, barbed wire fences and padlocks around the parking lot, I've had a gun pulled on me t w i ce going there. And everyone is going off how much of a community neighborhood it's in. Two years, I only got one conversation, the rest of the time people just do that awkward grimace like yeah I acknowledge your presence.

But lately i feel like he is pulling away from me. we don’t talk as often anymore. his slow replies, short replies.. he is cold towards me and he never initiates conversation anymore. it seems like he lost interest?  i feel like at this point he only replies to me out of pity. because he knows I don’t have friends and no one to talk to. he actually said it to me before he pity me because I don’t have friends and im lonely. 
i have social anxiety and depression he knows it

I want to add also, this guy showed interest of us being in a relationship.. he always said that he wants to be part of my life. that he wants me to be his gf. he flirted with me. so I’ll say expected something. but this is what happening now.

So that’s it, i wanna ask what should i do next?

I’d like to think I’m a good person, I try my very best to be kind, understanding, and empathetic towards others, but still nobody ever wants anything from me. I’ve never really had a true friend, and I’ve never been in a relationship. And if someone ever does express interest, it’s happened multiple times that they use me to get something and then toss me away after. I just don’t know. I’m sorry if this is really negative, I don’t want to bring anyone’s day down or be too “woe is me” or whatever, but I just want to let out my feelings in a way that isn’t too destructive or unhealthy. Anyway, thanks for reading, and I hope that you have a good rest of your day",lonely,Feeling Like I’m Never Wanted,2020-05-01 07:59:34

However, silver linings and all that, I'm glad Quarantine gives me a chance to not be disappointed when no one came through for my roller rink party. Here's the thing, if I mention I'm doing something or I invite you, and you say something along the lines of, ""absolutely"", ""wouldn't miss it."", ""I'll request the next morning off."" Something that sounds like a confirmation, and I make plans around your confirmation, YOU👏ARE👏NOT👏ALLOWED👏TO👏FLAKE👏 for lazy reasons. If you have a family/personal emergency or you're legitimately sick..I completely.understand. but outright flaking..nope..hard nope. Just don't give me any kind of verbal commitment.

Having friends and being in love is such bullshit. Because they eventually get tired of you and drop you when you are most dependent on them, as you have been for a year. I spent years getting over the fact I was lonely and I accepted the world around me. Because of my attitude I made new friends which I quickly became all dependent on.

So, things have been changing a lot for everyone due to the coronavirus outbreak and I know there are worse problems than mine but I need to get this out of my chest.

I had depression before, and I was okay until a couple of weeks ago, when I completed 1 month of self-isolation. I've always been a few friends person and now I realized that all the ones I have now are not close to me. I feel so lonely, like, my mother is the only one who still cares for me (it's fine yet a bit sad because I always support other people but nobody is never there for me).

I'm in a 1-year relationship and I really don't know if my recent crisis affected it or it's the other way around. I don't like to demand a lot of things, specially online because I know each one of us is busy doing our things and when we have time we talk.

But in the last weeks, I feel like giving and not having receiving anything back. I'm always the one who start conversations, and he always finishes it with only a visualization of the message. I'm always trying to maintain a topic, find new ones, but he just... respond. Never really engage. I wanted call him but he didn't and if I don't start a conversation we pass days and days without talking to each other.

Like I said, I tried to understand and continue contacting him but this week I couldn't. I was in such a crisis that I just wanted to feel that he wanted to text me... what a fool. Three days and nothing. I've read some things about an old philosophy to be happy: never expect anything from others. But... If I don't expect anything, feel joy for a text, that is less than you'd expect from a reliable friend, then why should I be in this relationship?

I'm a bit tired of trying to comprehend everything and never get a chance to feel sad and get some comfort. I feel like a fool but don't know what I should do. Am I exaggerating the whole situation? Am I just depressed and creating bad scenarios? Should I talk to him, wait a contact or end it all? I guess I'll never know.",lonely,Self-isolation has brought me to a new depression crisis and maybe it's affecting my relationship,2020-05-01 05:00:54

The last few years I was trying to get myself together after a messy breakup and after failing out of college. Only to have my friends abandon me completely and move on to a new life in a new city. They both entered relationships a while ago and so I’ve been rendered completely redundant. I don’t go out, I work 9-5 during the week and sleep through the weekend. I thought that I just have to stick it out and things will get better, but at this point I really have no idea why the hell I even bother getting out of bed in the morning.

This is hard for me to write but I stumbled across this sub and now I just can’t stop thinking - what if.  I’m 31/F. I’m fairly successful for my age.  (When it comes to society standards - not that, that measures anything in actuality).  On paper, everything looks great.  I come off as an extrovert because I have perfected how to fake it.  I come off as extremely confident when needed.    I am in sales and territory management.  My job is to create immediate connections with strangers and build a relationship with them that can produce results for others quickly.  I can turn it on when needed.  However, as I sit here and do some self reflection - I know that I am not that confident person on the inside.  I am an insecure little bitch.  I worry way too much.  I’m starting to reminisce about a past that I’m not even sure happened.  Most people don’t see me this way.  It’s to the point I even receive compliments of people saying I wish I could be as confident as you and direct.  My job even has me mentoring people that are my senior in this.  It feels so fake because it is so fake.  It feels like I’m watching a train wreck over and over which is my life - but others think it’s great.  I feel like I have an extremely hard time connecting with people and having them care for me back.  I am completely stuck in my head.  To the point I now find myself wanting friendships /relationships with people who I don’t know and would have no reason to even really care about me.  All I can keep thinking is.  What the fuck happened.  The best way to describe it - I am finding that to the people I consider friends - I am just their diary.  I am the one they come to when hell has happened and I hear the darkest shit.  No one in their day to day finds out because I’m not in their day to day.   I’m just me. On the side. I’m their fucking diary.  All I want to do is talk to strangers and fill this void and find a purpose again.  I want friends that turn into family and rocks in my life even if I never meet them in person.  That’s weird though, right?  That can’t be normal.  But who fucking cares at the same time.  

So, here I am.  I usually get a long with guys better.  I have primarily lived with guys my whole life.  I want some lady friends though too.  In a fucked up way.  I want to meet some people to “pen pal” with around my age - preferably have had some professional success but don’t feel so together on the inside.  I’m ready to feel alive again.

2990,Colossus2709,1588262692,1,"18 M here, heavily introverted in nature. I am a high schooler and have had problems socialising with new people due to being extremely shy. I had a quite small friend circle who I could open up myself to while in school. 
Now that my schooling days have ended and we are all stuck up at homes durong lockdown, I realised i have no real friends. Not one call, no texts by any of my friends. I pm'd them all but some of them either call off the conversation too quickly and some plainly ignored them. I switched to the weirdo/creep mode and stalked some of them on social medias with the only purpose to learn if they were busy with something. And yes, they were busy....in chatting and posting lockdown pics. They were so busy, they couldn't muster time to ask their shy friend if he's still alive.
Three month ago, i confessed my feelings to my crush, but ended up getting rejected and ghosted by her. I dont blame her for anything, since my social skills suck. However, this rejection has surely dropped my esteem to the level where i feel hopeless. Im now full of self loath, and this is causing me to have sleepless nights for weeks.

I think the problem is me, and that i find my socialising skills beyond any repair, I'm thinking of getting myself accustomed to this loneliness ...and stop expecting to find people that would love/befriend me, so that it might stop me from contemplating . I'm surely hurting myself, and having problems in focusing on my work but I find no way out of this.

I have social anxiety, so making friends is pretty difficult as I come off as socially awkward and weird.  it's a chaotic time we live in, and some of us or a lot us are lonely or need an escape. I am opening my inbox to everyone who may need/want someone to talk to. Age... gender.... alien... mouse... dinosaur.. doesn't matter. Message me!
I guess I could tell a little about myself..
I enjoy gaming (ps4 mainly), I enjoy watching movies, but I don't really enjoy it when I watch alone because I have no one to discuss the movie with. It's the same with watching videos on youtube. I have started getting back into ERBs (if you know you know). I enjoy listening to music. My playlist is all over the place, so I basically will listen to anything. 
I am open minded. I will talk about anything. Puns. Jokes. Conspiracies. ANYTHING! (As long as you don't get offended easily) 
Here is where I believe people will be turned away. I do make tiktoks out of boredom, and yes they are cringy but tiktok itself is cringy. 

So basically if you want an open minded, lonely, socially awkward friend.. message me. I'll talk to anyone. Any age. You could be male, female, alien, or zombie, and I will still find a way to talk to you!
