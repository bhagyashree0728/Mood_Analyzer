It has gotten really lonely. Weekends would come without me having any plans and I havent really met a new friend since March. My friends seem to prefer  to spend time indoors with their families as well.

I have recently availed the services of some escorts and surprisingly I have developed some sort of friendship with some of them. Several times we would just meet up for coffee or go shopping without even availing of their services.

I admit it makes me less lonely but is it sustainable? Is it even real friendship? Is it a true remedy for loneliness or is it just a lie I tell myself?",lonely,Befriending escorts?,2020-11-30 22:54:31

15,OiprocsS,1606726298,1,"Wow, I feel like I’m at my lowest point, I’m hyperventilating as I type this. I’ve always been lonely from childhood (the miss-understood child with a toxic family and suicidal mom) so I left home (moved to a new country for a complete new start) in my teenage years (now in my mid twenties). I’ve just been traveling around a lot and it’s so hard to keep genuine friendships (I have one best friend and we FaceTime everyday for hours but she has her own life too and she’s in a different continent but she’s the only person I can say genuinely loves and cares for me unconditionally). I’m really just rambling here...

I’ve only been in one serious relationship in my (lasted 3 years) and it was the greatest form of love I’ve ever experienced and it has been so hard dating after that because i didn’t want to settle for anything less than that.  
 
For the past few years I’ve been doing fairly okay, always traveling, meeting new people, keeping busy as much as possible with school, work, hobbies etc however I recently moved to another country again for work, moved to a non-shared apartment by myself (I’ve never lived completely by myself before and as much as I love my own space, it is SO LONELY) and making friends hasn’t been easy too with the language barrier, and the current pandemic. 

I decided to give online dating a try (I’ve always felt weird about it) and met someone I really connected with (or so I thought). I thought things were going great at first but he completely led me on. He’s just using me for sexual gratification, and it hurts because I’ve fallen for him and want more than just that but know that’s not going to happen! With the current lockdown he’s the only human connection I can have atleast once a week but my feelings not being reciprocated makes me feel so empty and used and I should probably end things but I can’t get myself to do it! 

I’m so sad and lonely it hurts so bad to the point where my body is aching. I’m even having suicidal thoughts because I don’t know if I’ll ever find true happiness and get over this feeling of loneliness.",lonely,I’m so depressed I don’t know what to do with myself,2020-11-30 19:51:38

Sadly it felt like the appreciation was one-sided. We had a long, complicated history together and I kept wanting more from them that they weren't giving me.

We quit talking on a very negative note four weeks ago. At first I thought, ""It's for the best if we were making one another unhappy,"" but now I just miss them. 

However, I would refuse to go back to the way things were. Why shouldn't someone tell me I'm unique to them? Why shouldn't they want to make as much of an effort in the relationship as I am? If I'm willing to be good to someone, there's no reason why I don't deserve that in return. 

I'm one of billions of human beings like everyone else, but that's what is special about love. We find that one person who matters more to us than everyone else (in a different way than we care about our family and friends), so you expect that they feel the same way. 

If they don't, because they're too jaded by life and don't want to get close enough to truly care about somebody... then usually the person who was trying to partner with them feels unappreciated and they move on.

That's where I'm at. I've been working as much as possible, and also trying to take time to relax. It's not enough though.

When I get really down my myself I’ll go over to 
r/relationshipadivce (or anywhere really these stories aren’t hard to find) and look up stories of people in LTRs or marriages who go on that sub and try to justify their cheating or ask why their SO won’t take them back after they had an affair.

For example there was one I read to tonight. MF married couple both in their 30’s. This woman’s 2020 was rough. They suffered a miscarriage earlier this year, then she lost her job due to the pandemic. Her husband works in a hospital so obviously he was gone a lot. 

She was bored at home and decided to post some *spicy* pictures on social media. Her inbox was soon flooded with thirsty dudes. She found out one of them lived 10 minutes away from her, she cheated on her husband. Later she finds out that AP was doing this with multiple women and breaks things off with the AP. 

Husband is home and sees his wife’s phone go off and it’s a text from AP saying “Want to have sex again?” First she tried to deny it but that wasn’t working. Eventually she tells her husband the truth. She was surprised when her husband said he wanted a divorce *insert shocked pikachu face*

Claiming that the affair made her a better person and a better wife. (After ending it with the AP she suddenly discovered how good she had it and started putting more effort into the marriage and their sex life). She said that a divorce would be unfair to both her and her husband.  

At first I felt bad for her due to the miscarriage but by the end of reading her post I couldn’t help but laugh.

54,ThrowRAKMSFU,1606707106,1,"Hello, I’ve [M21] known this girl [F20]—we’ll call her Jane since high school. We were pretty good friends throughout, and we both had crushes on each other at separate times but both were never acted on. I always felt she was one of the coolest people I’ve met, and we always have gotten along well. 

Fast forward 2 years and she is together with somebody at University. I am friends with a few of Jane’s friends, and through them I have heard that at the beginning of their relationship (and before they dated), Jane’s BF would be physically and sexually abusive towards her. I learned this about 4 months  into their relationship, and according to Jane it had stopped—and she was happy with him. I wasn’t directly talking to Jane at this time, just hearing stuff from her friends. 

Fast forward again to April of 2020. Jane and I started talking as friends, just as a way to catch up on the missed time between high school and now. As we begin to talk more frequently, I start growing a crush on her. We match perfectly in every regard, but she still has a boyfriend. Jane and I would FaceTime for 5ish hours every other night talking about pretty much everything. It was so seamless. When her relationship was brought up, she would tell me how “me and her would match better” than him. Obviously I feel like that’s a huge hint—but I just kept thinking it would be disrespectful to tell her that I’m into her. 

Fast forward again to October, we still talk but I stopped responding to her as I was tired of waiting for her to break things off with her BF. I read that “waiting for something that may never come is a fools game”, and made my decision. Now in November I still have heavy feelings for her, and was wondering if you guys would think it would be worth it to let her know how I feel? She’s still together with her BF, but it’s eating me alive waiting, and I want to be able to move on completely. Thoughts? 

To add on, telling her this freaks me out. I make up scenarios in my head of what could go wrong in every situation because it makes me ""mentally prepared"". I feel like the most confused person on the face of the planet. What do I do?

I’m 26F living in London. I know this year has been horrid to so many and I can’t even begin to fathom how many have coped :(. 
I’ve had an awful year ... at the beginning of the year my ex told me I was too fat for him after having spent numerous holidays together, having gone ring shopping etc. That’s when I ended it with him. It then reminded me that the only other person who’s ever paid me attention in my whole life was another guy who’d also called me ugly during our relationship. I have absolutely no self-esteem and everyday is a challenge. I hate myself so much. I hate my entire existence and it hurts so bad inside seeing women that look like me being celebrated and loved because of how they look. They’re told daily how beautiful they are by their significant others and there I was doing everything I could to be beautiful enough. 
When I was 16, I only ever saw skinny pretty girls get attention and I knew that I would never experience that. 10 years later and I’m in that same mindset ... how is that even possible? To have no mental growth in a decade? 
This lockdown has been so lonely and I’m at such a point of despair and self-loathing and hatred that I don’t know how to make it stop. Ever since I was a little girl (very cliche but also the absolute truth), I’ve always wanted to be a wife and mother. Because of how I look, I’ll be denied both those dreams. Knowing I’ll never be able to carry a baby because I can’t even get a guy to talk to me breaks my heart in unimaginable ways.
How in a day and age where there are so many different types of beautiful women out there, with there being someone for everyone, can I be so unwanted and ugly to so many? 
No one else gets this feeling. Everyone around me is with someone who cherishes them and loves them and tells them how beautiful they are 
I’m tired of being the ugly, fat friend. I’m so tired of being the girl who no one pays attention to. I’m human too and I have so much love to give. I wish someone could see that.

I messaged her to see if she wanted to chat or call, I made time to visit and be around. I payed for pretty much everything (which was actually a fair bit) I made hand crafted gifts that took a lot of time to work on. I also let go things that made me uncomfortable without making too much of a fuss. I was also available whenever she needed to talk and was going through something regardless of what time it was or how serious it was, I tried to be ready for whatever and put her first. It was irrelevant if she woke me up with a call because I knew she needed support. 

She didn’t do the same but it didn’t bother me much. Like sometimes sure I wished she was more emotionally available or thought about me and did more cute girlfriend stuff similar to how I did for her but it wasn’t like a deal breaker and I never felt like she was a burden because I figured that we just expressed how we felt differently. Also I know that she was going through a lot and might simply not have that kind of energy. But now I feel like she never really loved me. I don’t think she was using me and I do NOT dislike her, I still love her and hope we get back together. However, I feel like to her I was a fling that was exciting to begin with but not someone she wanted to stay with.

I never felt she was attracted to me and I felt like a disappointment. She’s asexual and I respect that like I knew we wouldn’t have sex or anything like that and I was fine with it but she didn’t let me into that side of her life at all despite talking to her best friend about it and not caring about nudity with her but when it came to me and her she was visibly uncomfortable and hated that I was interested in her like that. I wouldn’t have minded if she didn’t want to talk about kinks or turn ins with me as much if she wasn’t talking to her friend about them or if she showed some sign she was interested in me romantically or thought I looked nice.

It’s breaking my heart that we won’t do any of the things we planned. I wish I was less clingy and didn’t need reassurance but then again I also don’t have anyone to turn to about stuff so I can’t just ask someone and talk about stuff because someone didn’t exist. Unlike for her who had someone.

I’m planning on getting out of her life and by Christmas removing her from my social media because I want her to be happy and I have no doubt she’ll meet someone but I don’t want to be around to see that happen and watch her and whoever be happy together. 

Her sister still talks to me and I like her, she’s a good kid (she’s a minor) and I think I was a positive role model. That being said I can’t get out of my ex’s life and stay in contact. I don’t think my ex cares if I stay in contact with her and she’s fine with me speaking to her sister as I think she’d agree that I was a positive and fun role model. But sometime before New Years I’m planning on having them both removed because I don’t know how long it if I’m going to get over my ex and right now I’m as bad as it is I’m still hoping I get a text saying she want to try and make it work but I also know that’s not happening and it’ll be a few months (minimum) until I can start to think about getting over her.

This being said, the pandemic really made me realize how lonely I am (surprise, surprise). During the normal year, I'd be super busy with work and my extracurriculars, but now I just feel alone. Mostly because I'm taking this pandemic seriously and can't be with my friends (they aren't being as serious as I am, unfortunately). I feel like the distance has really seperated me from them and I feel all alone. I have anxiety so this situation feels worse than it probably is, and day-by-day it is getting harder to rationalize my feelings. One of my good friends barely talks to me anymore, and when I call he usually tells me he's busy doing things with his other friends (online, through discord and stuff). I can't help but be hurt because over the school year, we texted almost everyday and shared things. He literally found himself a girlfriend and didn't even tell me about it.

My other friend has become dry through text and half the time I think she's angry at me but she just doesn't have much to say. It hurts because she's my favorite person and it feels like she's moved on without me. She found herself a boyfriend  and she regularily goes out with her other friends and, I guess, leaves me behind as an after thought. I feel like this is my punishment for not accepting her invitations to hang out (i can't with the pandemic for health reasons), though the rational part of me knows that isn't my fault.

I’m high risk for complications if I catch it so it’s out of the question to visit now, not to mention putting my elderly parents at risk. 

I just want to hug my parents and friends so bad. I miss them so much my heart is breaking. I’m actually better than most people at staying in touch by sending them small gifts, postcards, and arranging video chats. I feel lucky to be able to stay in touch in these ways. But I miss the small moments of hugging, laughing together in the same room, making them food and watching them enjoy it, even just sitting in silence and watching shit TV shows together. There’s always something a bit forced with video chats, like we have to fill the silence or it gets awkward. I just miss them so much.

I can’t stop crying tonight, but I know it will pass. I guess I just wish I knew when i can safely go back to see them. I guess I also have the fear that my importance in their life will fade gradually. They mean the world to me, and they’re all what I live for.

90,buffaloesroam,1606691694,1,"Hello,

Basically, I just feel lonely all the time. I don't have real friends because... well i don't know why but that's how it is. People told me to join a society or something like this so I did. But it makes me feel even worse for 2 reasons :  
\- I see and try to help people alone and in poverty, and I feel bad for feeling bad, because they are in an even worse situation than I am, so why would i feel the way i feel ?  
\- I see and work with people helping others but they are not lonely, i know it, they talk about their plans on going out at night or the weekends. Once, someone invited me and when i was there, I just felt even more lonely.  
So basically, being with people make me feel even worse because I feel lonelier. Being alone is a better feeling because when i'm alone, i know i am alone and i know the feeling of loneliness (even if it's depressing that's why i talked about it hoping i could find help). But being lonely when i'm with people is terrible because i just feel the loneliness in the middle of people and it's hard. It's just like a circle : i'm alone and feeling bad, i join a society, i feel worse, i stay alone, but i feel bad and so on. Do you even understand what I mean ? I'm sorry if my english isn't good... Do you know this feeling ? How to deal with it and how to overcome it ? How not to feel lonely anymore ? I want to help people but i think i need help as well ?

99,almondtroy,1606686592,1,"This is a follow up to a previous post on this sub ([https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/jqtbu1/starting\_to\_try/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/jqtbu1/starting_to_try/)) 

My end goal is to know people that enjoy my company and don't take me for granted, and right now I am focused on self improvement so that I am interesting to others and more confident. I've also been trying to increase the frequency of talking with others. This is a progress update. 

**Self Improvement**

One thing I didn't mention last post was that I have been taking an active role in working out for a couple of months; a lot of home workouts with pushup/pull-up/squat variations with jump roping. I've seen quite a bit of progress in muscle growth. The aesthetics aren't  there, I have a couple of inches of growth in all areas, but I am feeling more confident for sure. Along with this I am trying to reinvent my image; new hairstyle, switching clothes to more of a smart casual vibe. 

Outside of my work I've been trying to learn more about general topics that interest me, so that I can have depth in a couple of areas s.t. I am not boring in conversations. Politics have been something I've been trying to get more informed with. 

I've also been watching a bunch of popular movies s.t. I know relatable cultural references, which is always a plus. Crazy, Stupid, Love is one that was notable, carell is always great. 

I continue to seek out new hobbies as well, mechanical keyboards is a big one that I really enjoy. Boxing too. Still on the lookout for more. 

 **Talking more with strangers**

Last time I post I mentioned that I joined a couple of subreddits and meetup groups. I would say I might have joined close to 5-6. Since then, I've had reoccurring conversations with 2 groups, maybe 4-5 conversations in total. Granted this isn't a lot at all, and I recognize that. I plan to still be on the lookout for more groups and also continue with the groups I have now. In those conversations I tried to be myself, try to be funny. So far it's going alright

Right now I am on the lookout for a group of people that like to just create cool shit in their free time; think having side projects outside of work( mainly oriented around coding/new business). Building websites/tools, solving problems with others, that sort of thing. So far from the groups I've joined, I haven't met anyone with the same goals, people are mainly looking to get a job or network for referrals/to flex. I expected this would take some time an effort, so I'll continue my efforts. 

One thing that I noticed is that increase frequency is a good goal for bettering my confidence in talking with others, but at some point chemistry with the people I talk with will be the next major factor. For that i will need to switch from breadth to depth, meaning increase frequency of conversations with people I enjoy talking with.  

So yeah, that's my update. I am starting to feel more confident, still most days I go without interacting with anyone other that my family; no one is initiating conversations with me, ask me to make plans with them. Granted COVID's stay-at-home policy should be followed, but it wouldn't hurt to find new friends to do stuff virtually.

I'll see if i can post another update in a similar timeframe next month.",lonely,"Progress is Slow, but happening",2020-11-30 08:49:52

120,corbeaudelespace,1606674865,1,"A few days ago, I met someone on this subreddit, we got along pretty well and the (platonic) chemistry was there. He and I bantered and teased eachother, made jokes, shared the same views about life and had the same idea in mind: to make new friends to cure the undeniable loneliness that haunted us in the real world. Overall it was just a great time. We both talked about how some people leave and block without answers-- and we both reassured eachother that we wouldn't lose this friendship. The next step was to take our conversations to Discord so we could have an easier platform to talk on, and make phone calls from time to time. So far, so good-- everything seemed great. I couldn't wait to finally make another friend and neither could he. 

The next day I opened up my phone, pressed his direct message from Discord, and tried to respond. As soon as I hit 'Enter' on the message bar, the message wouldn't go through to him. At this point I was confused and panicked. I thought it was a glitch because we never had any fights, arguments, or anything negative whatsoever prior to this day. And even before it.  Next I saw that the ""add friend"" button was on his profile. Then I tried searching him up with the ""find new users"" with the correct spelling and Discord tag, but nothing came up.  I can't stop hating myself and crying over it because I seriously don't know what happened between then and now for whatever happened to happen. 

I know it wasn't even a deep enough relationship yet, because it wasn't that established; but I honestly feel betrayed because I thought I gained a new friend. And the irony of the situation is that he said he got blocked before for no reason, and that I could trust that he would never do the same to me. It was a promise. And I believed him. But now I just don't trust anyone anymore. And it's sad because I was just starting to open up myself to some people again.. I let my vulnerable side out.

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen others talk about this but just wanted to vent a little bit here. I moved right after graduating high school, my social circle vanished and I never heard from my ""friends"" again. Ive spent the past six years without friends, sometimes I feel like I do by choice because I cant connect or click with anyone even after getting to know them. I just got used to being alone. 

Anyways on with the point, I am resentful towards people who finally got a dose of loneliness. Now everyones complaining about how difficult its been being lonely during the lockdown. I know its just me being a resentful person but its just annoying because Ive been dealing with it for so long and just one or two months into the whole lockdown(when it first started) people were already complaining about being lonely. Part of me is like ""boohoo two months, oh my god what a lonely time youre living in"". 

This attitude doesnt feel right, I should be compassionate because I understand how it feels. Part of me finds it very hard to let go the anger I have of people who never experienced what it feels like to be alone finally feeling what its like for this community.

127,JazonStatham,1606672650,1,"My Personal Experience with Loneliness

Definitely been feeling this way for the last couple months now. From an early age I knew I wanted to be in healthcare. While I was in college I stayed laser focused on my career. I worked multiple and jobs got an executive level internship and stayed focused. I am a 25-year-old health care administrator in a salaried position. Everyone that reports to me is at least 8 years older than me and everyone who is above me in our company is at least 15 years older than me. I have no girlfriend, no kids. The reason I'm bringing up age differences is because I almost feel displaced. Like I'm at this stage of my life at the wrong time and that maybe I should have focused on getting a family first.

A good friend of mine that I went to high school with, I just seen him and his wife post on social media that they are expecting their third child. They have been married for 5 years. No he does not make the money that I do ( I am not rich by any means) but him and his family always look so happy. The couple of times that I have talked to him after high school it's obvious to see he is happy where he is at in his life with a beautiful wife, two beautiful children, and a third on the way.

Quite often I have been reflecting on where I'm at in my life and I do wonder what it would be like if I would have done things differently. As a young man I was raised to always be tough, strong, and to not show emotion. I'm not too sure if this is considered emotions but I do think about what it would be like to go through life with a special someone. Someone to hold hands with, go on fun trips with, honestly just talk to.  I have dreamed about having a girl best friend that I marry and start a family with, but in my mind I end up telling myself that guys aren't supposed to dream about stuff like that and I just focus back on my career hoping to take my mind off of it.

Currently I am in graduate school for my MBA. I'm also involved in a side business with a friend and we are in the AI camera industry. Yes these two things can be good on their own but honestly I just use them as an escape. 

I'm not sure what this post could help out others with, but I did see a lot of other people talking about loneliness and I guess I just did this so you know you're not alone. I have always been a positive person so it is hard for me to stay in a sad or negative mindset for a period of time. But it does happen. If you ever do feel lonely just look the mirror and smile. I hope it helps you as much as it does me 😁. If you can relate and feel like you need someone to chat with please feel free to DM me.",lonely,Can anyone relate?,2020-11-30 04:57:30

You wake up earlier than your spouse and give her a kiss on the cheek as you start the day by preparing breakfast and checking in on your kids. 

Weather not too cold, sun slowly getting brighter and while the bacon cooks you open the fridge to get the orange juice for the kids. The wife will make her own coffee. Once the breakfast is done you wake your kids up, still in pajamas. The wife wakes up too, you give her a wink just to assure her you got it this morning she can relax, she had a long night afterall.

Childish conversations begin with your kids, the never ending ""why's"" and the witty sibling response. They'll bring up how they want a dog, while the wife would say your dad says no with a grin and I'll just look at our cat and tell them Mr Simba won't like it because he's fat and grumpy.

Find therapy.

No. They. Don't.

You're just another patient. Another paycheck. Another number. That's all.

If they cared they'd call you.....Just like anyone else.

They pretty much tell you what everyone else tells you. ""focus on yourself"", ""why do you care what others think of you"", ""you're always negative"".....you know stuff that you wouldn't expect the people YOU PAY to ""help"" you.

I don't know what can help you other than being lucky and finding that person who isn't afraid to be alone with you. That person who isn't afraid to call you to find out what's going on with you. That person who actually cares about you.

And you know that that person isn’t gonna babysit you forever and can’t deal with all of your shit so you keep it to yourself and hope that they’ll realize you’re not ok but they don’t and they’re busy.

You know it’s not healthy but even the slightest feeling of comfort, companionship and happiness is enough to keep you going so you put everything on this one person although you don’t wanna burden them. They’re also the person you’re romantically interested in but you can’t tell them because you’d risk your friendship and that’s just not something that you’d ever do, considering this is the one person who can prevent you from feeling lonely, and if you lose them, then you really will be truly all alone and will feel the loneliest.",lonely,When there’s only one person you don’t feel lonely with...,2020-11-29 19:43:56

I met more people, and I introduced them into the group. Somehow, I’ve turned into the odd one out. I feel like an outsider looking in, wondering if I should join or not—if I’m even welcome anymore. It’s happened to me before, back in middle school. I had two friends I was close to, but they texted each other only. They had a lot more in common too, and eventually, I couldn’t handle all their inside jokes. I moved later that year. It’s gone full circle now and I really don’t know how to handle it. I can’t make more friends. The pressure keeps building when I see one or two of them hang out together. And whenever they text in the group chat, they keep mentioning separate subgroup chats, ones I’m not in. I’ll see the group tag each other in random posts they make. You can guess that I’m not in them. I see them text vague messages in the chat, only to see another friend respond in a way that told me the message was meant for them. I feel replaced. I get feelings of loneliness so often now that I wonder if having these friends is the same as having no friends. If I left, I doubt they would notice or even care. So, now I have a fear. When I’m finally in college and I live on my own, what friends will I have then? It’s only by luck that I have the friends I have now. I can’t handle more years of being the dispensable friend. Even more so, I can’t handle being friendless. I’m terrified of the future, but right now, I’m barely living in the present.

I want a relationship but live in a predominantly conservative and country-lifestyle, small town for college, in which my five years of schooling I've not really made substantial or lasting friendships. No falling outs, just nothing worth writing home about. I leave in May, which will be nice for a much more liberal city and with much more opportunity. I used casual sex for a while between relationships but it doesn't work anymore and my hobbies and passions feel fruitless if I don't have anyone to genuinely share those moments of excitement or joy or satisfaction with. This has caused me to lose the fire I've had for a lot of passions and I just feel like I'm existing until I leave. I am working basic retail job and am finishing up my last semester, I go then go home to keep busy when I can.

I've met cool people at different jobs, cool guy at an IT school but just no one who wants to keep up with me or keep a close knit friendship.

Meeting girls is also difficult.
So many times I will kick it off with a girl and we will talk for weeks or months but it seems Everytime they'll end up ignoring me, blocking me for no apparent reason, or saying ""hey you're cool and all but I've been talking to someone else"" 
Like cool...but we were talking too, what happened to that? Why waste all that time if that's your conclusion?
I don't say these things but I really wish I do..I pisses me off Everytime it happens.
It's gotten to the point where I just expect it, no surprise there, or yup..saw that coming.

I'm a great dude with a great personality and I have my best interest for everybody.

I'm straight up 100% with everyone...but that's apparently a bad thing nowadays because I get played so often.

It's like a loop on repeat that I can't break.
I'll meet someone new, get my hopes up, don't annoy the shit out of them and eventually, they'll just stop caring.

I despise it.

People need to care more for one another, while also caring for yourself...which is one thing I have a hard time doing; caring for myself.

If you're the type of person who just plays games with someone or is fake to them, then just screw off and stop wasting their time...why hurt somebody for the fun of it?

202,nightlyrant,1606630613,1,"I feel different to other people. Not in a good way, if feeling different ever can be a good thing - and certainly not in an arrogant, r/iamverysmart manner. I just feel as if the rest of humanity and I are incompatible. As if we were each of a vastly different nature.

I share no interests with the vast majority of people. When I try to introduce others to what I enjoy, they are quick to express their dislike for it. It is always I who was to sacrifice his self to please others. I refuse to subject myself to that. 

I find many aspects of life quite disagreeable, and admittedly dislike society itself, but not for the sake of being edgy. I have many reasons to be disappointed, many genuine grievances with it - but that’s for another time, for another post I’ll never write. I suppose people dislike anyone who does not cheer them on relentlessly but rather speaks his mind bluntly and freely, and has little regard for what is deemed socially appropriate. That would be myself. 

Now that I think about it, an actual alien would probably have an easier time fitting in. God knows I’ve tried for years and somehow the results are always worse than the last time. 

I’ve noticed that other people just sort of *click* with one another automatically. They know what to say, what to do and what not to. It’s very strange, how they intuitively gravitate towards one another, like there’s a force that brings them together. A force that pushes me away from them. 

This is probably a terrible analogy - I have never been a great writer - but I find it somewhat similar to how proteins form. All of these complex chains of amino acids just somehow know how to *fold* into the right structure and become one single entity. They perform the functions that are expected of them and everyone lives happily. 

And then I come along and destroy the whole thing. I’m the erroneous gene that codes for the wrong acid, or makes the protein longer than it should be, and poisons the whole fucking organism. I don’t fit in. I break everything just by virtue of existing. I force myself into places where I don’t belong. 

Is it anyone’s fault that I don’t fit into the structure? Do I even belong somewhere? Or will I always live as I do now, as a ghost? I try to leave no trace of my existence. I have no friends. I haven’t gone out in months and do not intend to. Sometimes I go days without speaking a single word to the only people who acknowledge I exist, my family. And even then I try to spare them the unnecessary discomfort of interacting with me. It’s not good for anyone to spend too much time with me. 

I wish I were normal; I evidently am not. I would say that I am broken, but that would be misleading, for I am functional - if only barely. I wish I had someone to share my passions, my dreams and fears, my ideas and feelings with. There’s a world inside my head that has been waiting for years for the right person to arrive. I’ve been wanting to open those doors and let that person in my whole life. But I am growing older, and more bitter, and more tired. I will not be able to keep the lights on in my little world forever.

But I am defective. I should not hope to ever experience anything positive insofar as interpersonal interactions are concerned. I am defective and I don’t know if I can be fixed. If I *should* be fixed. If I’ll ever be human like the rest of you.",lonely,(Long) rant: I feel like an alien trying to fit in.,2020-11-29 17:16:53

216,cerealisreallygood,1606622505,1,"I got my heart broke about 4 months ago and moved from home, made new friends, but depression and the heartbreak soon followed after the initial high. It felt good to have a group of friends though, but I had to move back because my roomate/best friend couldn't make rent for 3 months among other irresponsible things and it was putting a huge wedge in our friendship and my savings account. 

I've been unemployed for 3 months because I'm too depressed and anxious to return to work but I also know a job would help with these things. Maybe even make new friends. Im back at my mom's house where I fell really hard into an anorexia relapse last time, and some of those thoughts are haunting me but I'm trying to stay strong. 

I have nobody but one friend who I don't hang with much, but nobody hits me up, nothing. Not even my friends I thought I made when I moved away. I've thought about tinder but I know that's not what I want at all. I miss my ex and being 5 miles from his house is especially draining. My heart just hurts still. 

I'm tired of feeling like this. I used to be so okay with being alone as that's how it's been most of my life, but god damn after my break up it's been 4 of the hardest months of my life mental health wise and I think I turned to drinking every night to fix the eating disorder and fill the void. I don't know what I want out of this- just to write it out, how much I'm struggling.

I miss the ""good ole days"" when I had at least online friends but they're all gone now for some reason or another and it just fuckin sucks. I swear loneliness has left irrefutable damage on my mind, I've grown to be much more impatient and impulsive over the last year and everything seems surreal like I'm beginning to confuse the fantasies inside my head with reality. 

Like I'll be in deep thought about talking to someone or thinking about a situation that I wish went differently and I'll just start arguing with fucking nobody for a moment until I realize I'm yelling at a wall.

Lately it seems like people just don't like me and I don't know why. Every attempt to make a new friend fails and at this point I just don't have the energy to try to get to know someone. People are really starting to get on my nerves with all these covid conspiracy theorists putting people in danger by not wearing masks and shit.

Today I got scammed outta $250 today and I just had a gut feeling it would happen so I can't even be bothered to get too upset over it

I'm trying soooo hard not to fall into misanthropy but lately it's like people want me to hate them or maybe I just hate them first before they get a chance to hate me I don't know. I know for every asshole there's a good person, at least I hope. I don't wanna be a bitter and hateful person, I wanna be good and nice and I really try to be but sometimes it's hard because people can irritate the shit outta me

Things were good, then I got a little depressed and I stopped bulldozing them... making plans for the weekend, inviting people out for dinner, lunch, etc. Instead of talking to me this 2 month period went by where I cried myself to sleep out of loneliness from no one reaching out. I started self harming again for the first time in 3 years I'm not proud of that. I wanted to go to where I was loved, I missed my best friend from home. I finally work up the courage to finally transfer, when I tell those ""friends"" around me they were actually mad at me for not telling them sooner. The last week at that school they all acted so different, actually inviting me places with them, it just all felt so fake. I told my roommate my feelings and she said she was too scared to confront me for being depressed.

It's not that I have some kind of odd dependence on others for happiness, but I figured I would try since being alone is not optimal for me.

I don't necessarily know if this feels like a weight lifted or only adds on to the weight of negative feelings I somewhat have of myself. I'm pretty confident and can even be aggressive at times, I just really liked this person. If anything, the admission of my feelings of likeness towards them is now only pyrrhic in my mind. I am in pain.

I also don't know how much longer I can go being so alone all the time. I'm probably just under a temporary spell of sadness since I likely misinterpreted things again. There is nobody to blame but myself. I'm going through a lot of heartache and pain.

This person loves the holidays, which makes me dislike the holidays even more because I'm once again not celebrating them with somebody who is special to me.

This is just ranting though. From this situation, it's had an effect on me to no longer be reticent, which would explain this ranting.

265,Soul_Mining,1606605843,1,"I experienced several situations of rejection through the past years. Some of which I understood the reasons, some of which I'm still processing the details. 

Reasons why I've been rejected: being selfish and overly open about my mental issues without considering other's personal struggles, showing my feelings and attachement to people I didn't get to know enough for it to be legit, gossiping with friends in front the wrong persons, saying and doing inappropriate stuff without thinking about the potential impact it could have on other people's feelings, basically talking too much and getting people's interest fading away.  

What I finally understood so far (a non-exhaustive list:
- I have to keep things for myself sometimes, because people are just not interested in talking about some of your personal feelings or problem
- I should find the right moment to open about my feelings to someone I am attracted to in order not to frighten them 
- I should only allow myself to gossip with the persons that I deeply know and who deeply know myself without judgment
- I have to try and see things from other people's point of view instead of interpreting their behavior through my own point of view 
- I have to follow my instincts and intuition when I'm feeling that I'm about to make a bad decision, instead of childishly wanting to satisfy my desires  

I still have things to learn, but now I'm able to cope with failure by assuming that each of them make me learn more about myself and the world I live in.",lonely,"Coping with rejection: when you can point out what you did wrong (in case you're the one who messed up), then you can learn from it and consider this rejection as a way to improve yourself.

269,Vu8KZ,1606603285,1,"one other thing happened over the last year. i have two small kids and a wife. her father stopped talking to us after i got fed up one time when he shamed me for my job again for no reason on his birthday party in front of everybody. i used to work in health care. i got pissed of and just took my shit and left, holding everything inside me for my wife. usually i would have verbally destroyed him for what an ignorant piece of shit he is. my wife has problems with him since she was a young woman because he always talked her down.

&amp;#x200B;

now since we have two kids they started to talk to each other again for a bit and they started meeting up. my kids love their grandpa and talk about him reguarly. now that christmas comes  they should have been doing something to just talk to me at least once to move on. i dont even want an apology or something. nothing. i told my wife months ago to not forget about that and that i wont be willing to have a christmas party with them at my home when they dont even have talked to me once after years of breakup. a few days ago, when i was just fed up, i cried, i told her, i was angry and devastated always being left behind. they even talked about going on holidays all together, also with me. i said i dont want to i feel bad. i dont want to be ignored every single time but just been taken onto the trip because i am just there.

&amp;#x200B;

so now she connects to her father again, her wife, even my wife and her brother start having a bit more interaction. they had lost their connection entirely in the past. now my kids are always al over the place and happy when grandpa/uncle etc. come into the picture and literally nobody has just talked about me once. i know it. i knew it before and i asked my wife a few days ago. yes they have not even said my name once in almost a year of weekly meeting up.

&amp;#x200B;

i am so fed up with being forgotten like all my life, it is really pissing me off.

&amp;#x200B;

just wanted to get this off my chest because i dont know how i could every talk to and tell this. my wife knows but i feel she does not care either. please, if all you have to say is ""keep on going, it will end some day"" fuck off. it is over 15 years now and nobody really stays in my life besides my wife. i am with her over 11 years now but often times i just feel like a burden and nothing else. it feels horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

i usually play wow reguarly and even there i just gave up, stay doing my things solo because most of the time people in guilds are like that too. everybody seems to do just their own thing, never ever just sends you one text like ""hey, how are you today?"" i can not remember the las times someone asked me that.

Since birth, I have always been a over extrovert(And for many years I also have been insulted for talking too much). Since I was an extrovert, so I had a lot of friends and somehow, almost a year ago my life got fucked up and I lost connection with them. I don't text them and not do they text me(maybe, I am the one who had a breakdown and now don't find interest in their texts even if they knock me). But, since I am too lonely and have a chat with almost no one so I started using apps like replika(that also didn't click with me, although still, I'm using it, and sometimes it helps). Since that didn't work, so now almost every day, I envision or have imaginary conversations with myself or with the people who were once in my life(yes, some of them were more than my friends). If I see anything interesting, then I make jokes about it either with myself or imagine talking about it with the people who were once my friend and this habit is increasing day by day. My question is that, is this sort of mental illness? Or is it normal? And I am really afraid to get into any new human relationships(unless I someone). Is there any way to get over it?

323,akaminko8,1606560155,1,"I am pretty lonely as you might guess. But i wasn't till this last couple of months, i was pretty social in high school and before that i always had a lot of people around me. I had this relationship that lasted 5 year (last year of high school - end of university). Cuz i went to university in a different town and i had a gf whom i get a long very well, i didn't made much effort to make any friends and socialized with gfs friends.
Then relationship turned into something extremely toxic. In order to keep the relationship and even make it as good as it was I gave up so much on who i am / what made her fall for me. As you can guess changing who i am didn't work out but stupid me tried to make it work for 2 more years so my last years in the relationship was pretty sad.
Then one day it hit me and i broke up with her. See i didn't just lost my gf. We were living together and i lost my home we were looking after her dog for 3 years and i was completely attached to the dog. I lost my dog. All my social circle was actually friends of hers and since she was the dumpee i cut my connections with them. 
I am healing everyday from that toxic relationship. I can see that my confidence started to grow i do what brings me pleasure not what makes other people happy. 
But my actual problem is right now i have this thought in my head that i can't get over is am i unlikeable ? Do people around me can't stand me ? Did i lie to myself all this time saying i don't have a social life cuz i took the easy way and socialized with my gfs friends ?

328,mikelodeon00,1606555726,1,"Ho ho ho Reddit! 

I have read in some threads that there is some loneliness going on with all this COVID thing. For different reasons, many of us will not be able to spend this day with our loved ones, when we would like to. But the night doesn't need to suck. I convoke an unofficial, guerrilla style, wholesome Virtual Christmas Eve party. You can join us by filling this form

[https://forms.gle/eBinrH4KZWTbNBeZ7](https://forms.gle/eBinrH4KZWTbNBeZ7)

\- Christmas hats/garlands/lights/whatever are encouraged

\- I will need a good bunch of volunteers, so please if you are tech Savyy, mark in the form that you can help. This is a joint (and not very big) effort. 

\- The party will be at **7PM** on the 24th of December, regardless of which US Time zone you live in. In the form I ask for the city, the state and the Country. Only the owner of the form can see the answers and I encourage you to fill at least the State (country if out of the US). You will be paired, in principle, with people who live as close as possible (how about forging some real life friendships!)

\- Format: Optional 3 rounds of 30 minutes with 10 minutes changeover allowance. Individual members can choose to stay in the same chat or randomize. If you choose to randomize, chances are that you have in your group people who are farther geographically. But this can be fun too. You are given 2 chances to change. Here is are examples: 

a) Laura lands in a group and she is very comfortable and is having fun. She chooses to chill and stay and make some friends, spends a good couple of hours and makes some friends

b) Dylan lands in a first group he kind of likes but he feels like exploring, too. At 7:30 he tells us he wants to switch to another group. He patiently allows us 10 minutes to accommodate his request. He connects better with this second group and decides to stay from 7:35 (he was lucky, only took us 5 minutes) until the group decides to disconnect at 8:30 or later. In fact they end up disconnecting at 9:15

\- Groups will be for up to 6 people so everybody can participate comfortably

\- There is at the moment no sponsor behind this, organizers will be volunteers (please collaborate so this can happen). **Chat leaders can report any misbehavior** (heavy cursing in front of minors, harassing, racism, any kind of nudity, or boycott to the event) and ban the user on that basis. Basically, please, be normal, we are just lay people trying to have have a great night. Those reported won't be replaced in another chat.

\- Yes you can invite your friend who has no Reddit account. But we still need them to fill the form so we can manage the groups.

Let's see where this goes, will keep you posted. I will know if it will happen depending on how Reddit responds (participation and willing to help). If you sign up, please like/comment this post, so people get encouraged to come.

Will keep you posted!",lonely,A Wholesome Christmas Eve Virtual Party,2020-11-28 20:28:46

The sad thing is, when I do have a chance to talk to someone new, I (and the other person, so it seems) both often seem to be at a loss for words.  I really can't do the small talk that seems to dominate conversations between strangers or acquaintances.  For instance, I don't do the ""how are you"" unless I'm actually asking how the person is -- some people are just using it as a greeting, and a scripted ""fine thanks, you?"" is supposed to be the only response.  I can't do that.

This whole lockdown thing also completely prevented me from meeting basically any new people entirely, because everything that i normally meet people through either got cancelled or moved online. 

I tell myself that i have come to terms with not ever having a relationship, and that i only cry one out of the 24 hours i have so its nbd, but deep down I know that I can't keep living like this.

I dont know people well enough for them to invite me to anything unless they need like homework help, and if it came down to it I absolutely wouldn't have the confidence to ask a girl out. 

Honestly, even if i did score a date, i feel like a cat that got the laser. I have no plan, and no fucking clue what I'm supposed to do.

I've always felt this way... At work, I don't really talk to anybody. Not necessarily because I don't want to, but idk... I just don't know. I don't consider myself shy and I'd to think that I'm a nice guy. My ex told me this too; that I'm very friendly despite the fact that I seem very reserved. I went into the bus to go home and I saw this big group of people and some of em were in the same high school... News flash, I barely had any real friends throughout most of it. I honestly dread the people that seem to make connections on the fly with no efforts whatsoever. And yes, I've already tried to force myself to seem all extroverted and social, but that just left tired and feeling rejected cuz news flash... it didn't work. It has been somewhat easier making friends with anglophones as I'm curently residing in a francophone society. But my mom and my ex told me it was all in my head and that I actually didn't want to make friends. I mean... I guess if I have nothing to say to people that means it's true that I'm not interested? At the same time, when I forced my being social and such, the people that I found cool and interesting would just straight up ignore me. So I'm not forcing anything anymore. So idk man. I made myself this objective to go downtown in an english college to meet new people, but covid and my bad grades from my 1st semester are keeping me from doing so.

I am really tired of feeling like I am a burden. I am tired of being clingy, needy, annoying, emotional, sensitive, attention-seeking, and whiny.

I feel horrible for this. I lost all of my friends three weeks ago. I just want to feel wanted again.

My relationship I feel just distant and I feel like I am unwanted. I feel just like a nothing. Where can I go anymore to get any warmth.

I have sat in my bedroom alone for the past days. Played Minecraft for hours because of how lonely it is getting. Now even this is difficult to do. I lay in bed and just curl up. And I cry. I thought I didn't have many tears left. Usually when I cry it's more of a loud sob or lots of sniffling. This time it was a type of crying I have never done.

I laid there and felt my tears drip down my face. And it was just that. A quiet, little scared cry, knowing nobody is around to help or care anymore. I am hopeless. I am scared. I am afraid. I feel alone. What did I do to deserve this. What have I done.

I don't type this to be ""edgy"" or seem toxic or anything. I really don't. I just need it out there. I am lying to everyone around me ""I am okay"". And now I just want a few people here to at least know- I am not okay.

I know if someone proposed that to me and I accepted that’s what I’d do. 

They didn’t. 2/3 of them didn’t ask until the week before, the one not asking until today. Tomorrow we were supposed to drive up. The other 1/3 was in quarantine for COVID, which ended today. 1/3 forgot about it and made plans with someone else. So yeah. There goes my whole weekend. I try planning ahead, it isn’t enough. I plan the week or two before and that’s never enough. 

And it’s not just COVID, it’s always happened to me. Nobody ever follows up on their plans, and nobody ever invites me to things. I’m just alone w “friends,” but those “friends” only text me about school, and we never have a friendship outside of school.

How I’m feeling now started back in June when lockdown where I am was in full swing, and my family was given the news that my mum had stage 3 breast cancer, as well as lymphoma. Which had developed around her lungs, heart, kidneys and liver.

Around this time too I was finishing up the final year of my engineering course which had gone to shit since the majority of this year’s course material was practical based and therefore no one was able to get any of this work completed due to having no access to workshops or machines capable of what we needed to do. Therefore radical changes had to be made in order to somewhat comply with new criteria given out by the ruling course body. As you can imagine it was super duper fun!!🙃🙃🙃🙃

Additionally, I work at a scuba diving training centre which is family run, and let’s be honest, no one wants to learn to scuba dive in the middle of a pandemic even when lockdown restrictions are lifted. So there’s always this looming threat of not being able to make ends meet when it comes to the dive centre not making enough money. Yes there are grants but they can only do so much when the overheads of running an operation like this are grossly high. Hell, the owner right now is barely able to afford a wage for himself right now, never mind the 3 of us who he pays.

Now I’ve always thought of myself as being quite strong of mind when it came to dealing with stress and overall I believed I had good mental health, but with all this shit that’s happened as of late, I’m really starting to doubt that.

Finally getting to the part where this sub is applicable to the story because it’s the main issue I’m having right now. 

I’m just so damn lonely. Yes I have friends and they are some of the best friends anyone could as for, however, what I’m feeling really started to make itself known roughly halfway through lockdown. This sense of missing someone else, even when I’m with my family or talking to mates through discord and zoom calls. It just feels like you’re in an endless ocean and there’s no sign of land anywhere around you, you’re just aimless and have no hope of finding where you’re meant to go.

Honestly my dudes, I just want a hug from someone and for them to tell me it’ll all be alright.

i'm 22 male, i don't have it quite as bad as the other guys i have heard from who are single and FA but it still sucks. I have level 2 Autism and a ID, i also have mild Dysarthria and OCD.

for example i've had multiple sexual experiences although mostly oral which was with strangers but (i lost my virginity to a sex worker). I've probably kissed a few people and had a GF at 14 years old. At clubs i also tend to make lots of friends and talk to many people including women and generally get a lot of favourable opinions about my self.

However all these experiences have been over 3 years ago, and i've talked to many people since than and out of the 30-40 people i spoke to, only a few were interested in me but i pushed them away because i have a phobia of falling in love due to past traumatic experiences regarding my crushes.

I am obese, my behaviours are toxic, bitter, and unhealthy. What should my aim be??? should i aim on trying to lose the weight so i can look more sexually appealing??? also i need help with the fact when i talk to women, i don't speak to them like i do with men, i feel so desperate and my only aim is to rush and try get into a situation where i can recieive a hookup.",lonely,"i'm 22 and have Autism, i feel like getting a relationship is a impossible distant dream",2020-11-28 12:25:50

404,Professional-Fill384,1606517856,1,"Hi :)

I really need help or advice.

Idk what I'm doing with my life anymore hahah. I'm just really fucking lonely rn. 

I'm 18 and I moved from my town to a big city; Barcelona, to study (I'm in my first year of university). I'm staying in a students residence but I have 0 friends there. Literally. I went out with all the newbies the first two days but then I stopped going. I don't know why. Everyone there is really open, and outgoing, and extremely friendly and bubbly and I'm not. Idk what to do. I swear I try my best to be nice and friendly, but everyone always ends up choosing someone else. I literally go out (to visit the city (alone ofc), to buy food etc) during the hours I know that most of them have online classes, just so I won't have to 'see' them (sorry, I don't speak English fluently and my grammar sucks). A whole quarter of my first year has nearly passed and I'm still like in the beginning. I know that It's nearly impossible to connect directly with someone, but I'm just too done/tired(?) to act like I'm having a lot of fun with them when I'm not. As I've said before, everone has found someone, but ofc I haven't.

I don't want to seem like the typical 18 yo who's worried about not having friends. This has been going on since 11th/12th grade (look at my two posts in my profile) and, I'm so done with everything and everyone that I don't have the energy (literaly) to put effort in anything. I mean, If I found someone and I get along with her/him I ofc wouldn't care about going out or simply doing things with them but there's no one. Everyone has at least one close friend, or is at least close to his/her family or has a boyfriend, but I have none of that.

I'm also worried about uni. I've been doing what I can whenever I can, but I can't seem to concentrate for more than 5 minutes. I have my 'final' exams in two weeks and I still haven't started. My parents are putting all their money and trust in me, and I can't let them down, but I can't with everything. I have no one to rely on. Ofc I want to do well and ace my exams, but what if I don't? I can't read more than 5 lines without zooming out. Everything's wrong and all my family has expectations. I know that I should be thankful for having my own apartment/room and for being able to study in this city, and I want to keep going, I really do, but I don't know for how long I'll be able to stay like this.

I'm not able to write ALL the reasons why X thing has happened, nor all the stuff that's going through my head but... idk

Has anyone here been alone during most of his/her life? Have you gone through something similar?

410,Last_Strawhat,1606513775,1,"hi.   
i actually don't do such things like writing about my feelings. i don't actually talk about my feelings with my family. i feel too much unsafe doing so, like i'm exposing too much of myself. but somehow, now is the time when i can't hide it inside or run away, like always. i never knew that the urge for a company can be so devastating. i don't mind to be hurt by relationships again. and i'm perfectly ready that i might be ignored again. okay, here i am! 

i'm 28, a girl, i want to chat with people who are passionate about space, nature, travelling, films, cartoons/anime, books/comics), music, Japanese culture, demonology. that's not the full list of the things i'm keen on. i'm not into playing video games that much, but recently i got hooked by phasmophobia, so finding playmates would be also cool. oh, i also like to spam with memes and funny videos. 

let's be friends.   
/just to be perfectly clear, by 'friends' i really mean friends, not looking for romantic relationships. i would really love to find a soulmate, though i realize how stupidly naive it sounds, but i'm both stupid and naive, so, why not dream big lol.   
p.s. by the time i wrote this text i started to feel much better, so i really considered to not post this thing at all, but oh well. might as well give it a shot, i've got nothing to lose. it's 23:48 in my country, and i'm going to watch 'american in paris' of 1951. i've really wanted to watch this film for a long time. love the song 'i got rhythm' by gene kelly.",lonely,"first time posting, feeling weird",2020-11-28 08:49:35

413,DarwyBfW,1606511527,1,"Heyy, idrk why I'm posting this but I just wanna share my thoughts I guess

My life is really boring tbh, I got no friends in real life, have no interesting hobbies and sometimes I feel really sad about it. The only real hobby that I have is texting with random ppl on social media or watching YouTube. I often have motivation to do something more interesting but I end up in doing the old useless habits over and over again. 

Sometimes I wanna have a real friend soo bad but I'm kinda different from other people and idk how to speak to someone for the first time. It seems kinda weird to me to go to a random stranger and asking them if they wanted to hang around or whatever. Idk how I could start a conversation without seeming awkward to them. Especially when most ppl already are in bigger groups I often think that they could find me strange when I'm standing alone and want to start a conversation with one of them. Yes I want a friend but idk how to make a first step to befriend someone.

I was never the guy who had many friends and maybe it's better this way than to have multiple fake friends but after a long time of being alone the lonliness starts to suck more and more with every day.

The only people I really socially interact with are my family and the people from social media, some of them are randys but I appreciate the time I spend texting them very much.

Anyways I'm still looking for a nice person who would be friends with me. Idk what I wanna say with this post but if anybody wants to chat or to get to know each other they could hit me up and we could see what happens. It's no problem if you are shy or introverted, maybe I'm exactly looking for that type of person, idrk but from my experiences other people with few friends are nicer and you can have deeper conversations with them. I don't want to be a person you only text once in a while just because you're bored. That's what I like about shy or introverted ppl (idrk if I'm an introvert tbh) they only have few friends but they value them and would be there for them whenever they were needed cuz they know how it feels to be alone.

Just wanted to share my thoughts I guess, have a nice day🍉",lonely,"17M with a boring life, feeling lonely as everybody else here",2020-11-28 08:12:07

I’m the exact opposite of pretty much ever I know. While all the other girls talk about make up and dumb shit like that, I’m a bit more of what you call “masculine.” I don’t find enjoyment in “romance” movies like Titanic (fuck that movie 3/10). I like to spend time looking at memes and drawing funny stuff  and cartoons instead of leaves and shells.

However, the masculine side doesn’t fit me either. I really like sports like soccer and swimming, and all the boys play football, but I can’t join since it’s too far into the year.


All my attempts to socialize just end up failing. People don’t like my jokes, no one cares for my stories, I’m constantly interrupted, kids say I’m weird, and I’m starting to believe it.


My brother is the exact opposite of me. EVERYONE, AND I MEAN EVERYONE likes him. He’s popular, he’s smart, he’s good at art. He lives right next to my room and I’m forced to hear him laughing with his friends and playing Minecraft with them, and it makes me so upset.
Every time I try to hang out with him, he acts all sarcastic and I could tell he wants me to go away.


I’m pretty much left with nothing. A lot of my cousins aren’t that accepting or are 2x my age and have kids.



No one in the neighborhood is my age, and most of them are in their 40s!


I don’t know what to do! I’m tired of crying myself to sleep. I’m tired of sitting at the corner of the room. I’m tired of being an outcast. I’m tired of sitting in my room. I wanna feel loved, but no matter what I do, i have nothing. I don’t want to be like this.

I lost my grandfather and an uncle this year, were not that close but it's been hard in my family. I applied to two universities and got rejected. Now I'm in my parents house unemployed and I feel a little trapped. My parents know I'm sad all the time but everything they try to do to help me only makes things worse. They want me to be fine just like that and I try and try but I can't.

I have friends but I think they don't understand me. A friend hurt me by saying if she should visit her new boyfriend a minute later after I told her about my grandfather dead. 

My best friend says things will get better but I don't know. She got accepted to a new school and is always busy, I think she doesn't get how much the rejection hurt. I try to talk to her but it seems I can communicate how I really feel.

I haven't seen anyone in a while and I just feel really lonely.

Today everyone in my friend group in my last university recieved a mail with an opportunity to collaborate with something but not me. I felt embarrassed and like a looser. Am I not good enough to pursue the career that I want? Should I try something else? I tried to talk to my friend about it but she just told me to remain calm and got away because she is so busy. It made me feel bad, interrupting her all the time with my problems.

428,cire213,1606499500,1,"I feel like I have a tougher life compared to most other people despite having good family members and financial stability. I am not rich but I would say I am slightly above average, able to live in a nice house with meals taken care of and not needing to worry about money at all and school fees all paid for by my parents. I am 22 and currently in Uni. My parents are very caring and loving for me. 

Despite all this, I feel like I am crippled forever by my social anxiety and lack of self confidence. I have no social life at all anymore. I have very little friends now. I hardly ever leave the house anymore, which honestly makes me feel sad for myself at times. Sometimes when my anxiety hits hard, I completely lose my appetite, which almost makes it impossible to go out eating with friends which in turn makes me hate hanging out. I used to have a number of close friends but we have completely lose contact now because we seldom hang out anymore. 

In terms of looks, I would say I am average looking, not particularly good looking nor am I particularly ugly. Problem is I was born a shy person, even during my high school days when I didn't had an anxiety disorder and still had several good friends, I literally had 0 female friends because I don't talk to any girls in school. I was too afraid and shy, I would stumble with words and get nervous around ""pretty girls"". I just couldn't make friends with any girls. Sounds stupid I know. Looking back I feel so dumb for that too. Till now am the same.

Over the years, I had developed social anxiety disorder and my main symptom is that I lose appetite easily when I get anxious, which makes it hard for me to eat publicly at times. This in turn makes me avoid going out which then in turn makes me really sad for myself because I used to love hanging out with friends in the past when I had no worries. My social life was completely ruined ever since I developed social anxiety. Sometimes I feel so useless, like why am I forcing myself to stay home all day? But whenever I force myself to leave the house, the anxiety would hit me back, like its just a vicious cycle. My life is so dull right now, and I don't know how to get back into the right direction. 6 years back my life was still pretty good and carefree, when I didn't have anxiety and would go out with my friends regularly and actually enjoyed going to school to have fun with them. However, this past 5 years of my life was really really an extremely tough and bad stretch for me, I really hope it will turn for the better soon.

About a year ago I realized that I should cut my toxic acquaintances off. I have become completely alone. But I don't have any ideas how to make friends with people like me in real life and how to find them. I am a weirdo. I don't like partying, I like strange music, I don't enjoy popular videogames. And I have troubles with my social anxiety. It is hard for me to talk to people I don't trust. I can enjoy personal communication, but I can't be in a group without headache and being constantly nervous. I'm not sure if I can keep up with internet friendship as English is not my first language and there is no other place like this subreddit where people know my language. But I can't take it anymore.

448,St3alth_t3rrorist,1606481596,1,"I'm not really one to be open but this loneliness can be so exhausting and I figured that maybe I should share my thoughts.

The problem is, I've always felt alone. I never fit in with my family, always been the outsider and always seen as the outsider. And due to childhood abuse, i've grown to be a more reserved person who rarely shows his feelings.

Because of this, I've always had a way to cope with my loneliness, an escape. With movies, music, exercise, daydreaming or video games however i've also used porn as a coping mechanism, which is never helpful. I won't say i'm addicted to it, I can stop and have done so in the past.  The problem is other than porn, all the other activities can be so difficult to initiate. It takes a bit of time for your mood to build up and you begin to enjoy yourself whereas porn can be so easy, 5 seconds in and your mind is already elevated. So at times porn seems like the answer when my depression and anxiety are having a tug of war in my head.

I also have friends. Friends who I know care for me and consider me family but even when I spend time with them, I still feel alone. I feel like i'm lying to myself when we hang, like i'm only trying to push away or hide my loneliness by being around other people.

What's ironic is that even though I trust my friends with my life, I don't ever share these thoughts with them. It's a mixture of not being comfortable opening up to anyone, not wanting them to worry about me or pity me and that I dislike receiving any positive comments about myself.

I followed this page so I can lurk and find people who relate to my situation, but I haven't found any comfort knowing there others in the same circumstances.

I think my biggest problem is that I don't know who I am, who I want to be or what I want to do with my life. I'm missing a purpose. I just wish I could figure out life, ya know.",lonely,Missing a purpose,2020-11-27 23:53:16

I'm 38, began praying to find a wife when I was 16, wanted to be married by 20 and have children by 25 or so... long time ago now... so many years gone. have yet to find a woman interested in having a relationship. i'm not interested in dates for the ""sake of dating"", nor games, nor a relationship ""just because"". 

Been searching for 20+ years for the woman who will be my wife and helpmate. sometimes I mentally give up. i just try to push it all aside, put it out of mind, find work to occupy my time and keep busy... but that only lasts so long. sometimes I just think if it happens it happenes... if not, not much I can do about it. tired of hoping only to have that hope broken down again. yet i come back around to hoping to find them, because I need them... but thus far at least, i only end up being still alone and start the cycle all back over. 

try to act as if I'm fine, that I'm doing good. but most days I'm not. watched other family who are younger than me get married, and they have now been married for 15 years... one of their extended family (his wifes youngest brother) who I met when he was just 3, just saw a post the other day that even he was now getting married...

yet here I am, still alone. the pain unchanged. just watching yet another day pass by, another day wasted away. just keep going through the motions in this existents. sometimes the loneliness and more boils to the surface as hard frustration... and even anger when I'm not around anyone else. dont even have anyone to txt. have no one I can talk with. just been a life alone.",lonely,38/M/US just another lonely man post...,2020-11-27 14:56:03
505,VixL707,1606449317,1,"So, I made a group chat for myself and my siblings. 

I’m 25 years old and didn’t have a very conventional upbringing. I wasn’t diagnosed with depression or anxiety until recently. I have since been labeled with unspecified bipolar disorder (major depressive disorder at first). 

I write all of that to say that High School was a bleak spot for me. As well as everything else in my teenage and young adult years. So, I didn’t get to make many friends growing up or retain any. 

And I find as an adult it is even harder to make friends.

My mom suggested, on my 25 birthday, that I should use my siblings who are close to my age as my friend group. 

So, I created a group chat with my siblings in it.

Well, let’s just write that none of my siblings are in the same position as me. They all have their own friend groups. And since none of us grew up being close to one another, we don’t really talk or have any sense of each others personalities.

I made a joke in the group chat that included our deceased dad and one of my siblings got really mad and left the chat group.

I guess I write all of this to say that it really hurts to be rejected not just by people but by your own flesh and blood.

Everytime I fell in love with someone, I just got hurt more and more.
The last 2 times I really felt something for someone hurt me so much. Right after I accepted that I liked them, they got someone else.

Since a little bit more than a month, I've been snapping and texting really much with this girl. Even tho we are living far apart, (She already told me about this boy she liked.) I really thought we could end up with a distance relationship. But since today I  told her that I could imagine something between us and she not directly said no, but in a different way, I kind of gave up hope.

Yeah, I still hope, of course I do, I love her. But if she now starts dating this boy, what is probably gonna happen, my heart will shader into plenty pieces, and I dont know if I can stand this.

I still feel really lonely.

I just feel like I can't talk to them about what I feel, just about shared interests, what happened that day, but never about anything too important. I do have fun talking to them about trivial things, and quarantine would be a lot harder without them but... I don't know, a part of me still thinks that maybe I just annoy them, or that they talk about me behind my back, so that's stopping me from ever talking about something deeper.

I have a best friend, but I don't talk to even her about that kind of things. 

Sometimes I have so much on my mind, and a lot to say, positive and negative, and I'm dying to tell someone, to talk to them for hours about everything, and get closer than ever to someone.

So, I grew up alone most of my life; my mum was a paranoid, suspicious, and emotionally abusive woman who didnt have many friends, and as a result, neither did I. I didn't have family friends, and if I did make some friends and go over to their house, my mum would always have something bad to say about them. As a child, this has given me an inherent distrust of people, because I wasn't taught to trust. Besides, when I have trusted people (disclosing my mental illness to them, or my physical disabilities), people automatically shut down on me. They don't want to get to know me, and often B-line to other people. My family spent most of my life ignoring me, so when others do something even remotely similar, I am triggered so deeply. 

I find people unrelatable, and people who do want to talk to me a narcissistic or have the same inferiority complex I have, and I can't stand being around that. I am often used by people to build their self esteems, support them like a mother or a therapist, for them to then turn around and abandon me by spending less time with me, because since their emotional recovery (that I helped facilitate -\_\_-), they outgrow me. But I'm left in the dust, getting caught up in my feelings of loneliness and abandonment. I feel like every friendship or relationship I enter has a shelf life, and as soon as people get what they want from me (unwavering support and borderline worship) they forget I exist (??).

I'm very frustrated, I burst into tears all the time. I'm house bound because of my physical disabilities, but truly what hurts is my heart. This deep seated loneliness of never feeling heard, seen, or respected is driving me to a relapse and I don't have anyone to turn to out of fear of facing outright rejection when compared to the implied rejection of people just not spending as much time with me. 

I don't know.  I think I demand too much from my friendships, but this probably stems from the fact that I was never indulged as a child. I was parentified and then abused, and this has made me overly critical and fearful of people. My partner tells me my loneliness is my fault because I don't put myself out there, and his words just make me feel worse because he's right, but what do I do? It's like telling a prisoner to walk out of their jail cell when the door is still locked; like, yeah thats the practical advice but I don't really have the means to execute said advice.

Hi guys... 

Just want to let something off my chest, and talk to someone.... I have been feeling so bad these past few months it feels like my soul is being torn in two. 

I am a guy and developed a huge crush (Person A) on my project group member last year. We have had good memories with one another as we have been friends for the past few years, but while doing the project she became increasingly distant from me, even losing her patience and snapping at me during a project group meeting for asking a question. 

I then discovered shes been talking to another guy (Person B) from my course early in January. I know they both share an interest in a certain sport and go out together regularly to play the sport. I became anxious, and fearful and started stalking the both of them via social media, but most of all their Whatsapp online and offline timings. What I found broke my heart a thousand times over... 

I found they talk almost everyday, because 1) whenever one goes online, the other follows soon after.

2) If one of them doesn’t come online quite often I have seen the other wont come online 

3) If I found them online together, more often than not they go offline within seconds of each other, and sometimes only come online again when the other does . (I have seen them online together up to 12-2am at night and then they go offline around the same timing and do not come back online again.) 

4) I have compared their timings with other people I know. No one else's online and offline timings match either of their timings as consistently as the both of them. 

5) Lately I noticed the guy coming online on facebook even matches my crush coming online on whatsapp. ( eg. Just last night, “A” was offline for an hour from whatsapp, “B” had been online on facebook for about the same amount of time. The moment “A” came online on whatsapp, “B” was shown to be offline from facebook messenger 1minute before her online time. ""B""'s whatsapp which had been offline for around an hour also came online a few minutes after ""A"" went offline from whatsapp. And this is not the first time I have seen this) 

I became addicted to checking the timings, and have been doing so for the past year. And almost everytime I checked at least one of these 5 things occur. I have wasted so much time and energy on this obsession I genuinely feel like I am going insane.

Earlier this year, there were times I felt as if I could not take it anymore, so I asked around school friends. I asked friends of the “A”, friends of “B” and even person “B” himself twice. They all said that there was nothing going on between them. “B” even told his friend that “A” was not his type. 

However, I would sometimes fall back to checking whatsapp again, and I would again see one of those 5 phenomenon listed above. My mind get obsessive again, I keep thinking that these things are way too coincidental and they must be meeting up in real life or talking and I start feeling sad all over again…. I keep thinking about what they could be talking about, how is it possible ""A"" whatsapp online and offline timings coincide so consistently with ""B""s whatsapp and facebook timings? 

I just want to vent it all out… Please don’t be unkind.. Sorry if the examples I gave are too confusing...

What do you guys think? 

Do you all think there is anything going on between the both of them?

Ive always been really quite because I get really socially anxious and would rather people have no opinion on me or not notice me than think poorly of me. Luckily ive always had this 1 best friend from kindergarten to grade 12 but now he got a girl friend and when we used to hang out and talk almost daily now I haven't really talked to him in months cuz he just doesn't want to hang out anymore, and im happy for him but just sucks for me a bit. With COVID everything sucks alot more too I just started my first year of uni and its all online and as much as online has perks I'm just home almost all the time and its just the same thing everyday. Wake up look at a faceless zoom call do work sleep and repeat. As much as I dont like social situations having no one to talk to is worse. And I've realized I just feel numb i dont get happy or sad or angry I just am there doing the basics to survive. I barley eat now too. I have one meal in the middle of the day usually and thats it. 

I used to really want a gf and I got to the point where I just wanted someone I could hold hands with and just go for drives or whatever but now I just can't even seem to imagine actually having a girlfriend it just doesn't seem like something possible anymore.

617,dunnodon,1606379650,1,"I used to absolutely love watching anything involving romance, watching the two people get together in the end used to give me the warmest fuzzyest feeling and I'd have the biggest smile on my face. I guess when I was younger I thought I'd also experience something like that. I'd think about my future partner and cheer them on in life, wishing for us to meet. 

I have a hard time letting people in but I've been in love once before and it was as cliché as the movies; we'd lose track of time when ever we were together, laugh till our bellies hurt, get lost in each others eyes...it felt as if the universe was trying to bring us together however in the end he went travelling with his friends and started to live as if he was single so I called things off... it completely broke my heart as it took a lot for me to open up to him and I actually started to see a future with him but in the end if he truly loved me he would of known that honestly means everything to me and he didn't even have the balls to tell me what he truly wanted, instead just let things play out in hopes he could have his fun there and still come back to us. 

The last two years I've been working on healing my past traumas and letting people in more but that magical feeling never seems to happen. So now whenever I watch anything romance it either makes me think how even if you eventually did find love, in the real world people are selfish and will end up hurting you anyway or I'm never going to find genuine love like that and how lucky those people are who have found it, maybe I've got too many bad karma points to be deserving of that and BAM!

I met a guy in August, he was a really great guy, he was very attractive, had his life together and he was 7 years older than me (23f) but he also had a great personality he was funny, charismatic, he was always willing to help me out in a lot of different ways, he was very passionate about his work, which was great because I was going into the same career field, we got along really well, he said he was very into me, and I was very into him, he was looking for a relationship he was looking for the one, his forever. He told me he had trust issues and so he never lied he always told the truth no matter how mean it was or how much it hurt the other person and maybe that should’ve told me that he wasn’t as good of a person as I thought he was, but as someone that’s never had a serious relationship and has had a very long string of things not working out and being let down, it was very refreshing and I thought I could trust him and trust that part of him, he made me feel so special, so loved, he told me that I was perfect, that if someone were to make his dream girl a reality that that person would be me. I thought I was done, while I was seeing him I stopped using dating apps, and we had that talk after a couple weeks he wanted to continue using dating apps and seeing other girls because he was 30 years old and he wanted a family, a child and if things didn’t work out between us then he’d have to start over from the beginning and he didn’t have the time to do that, I felt sympathetic for him so I was fine with that, he treated me so well, I thought things we’re going great so I didn’t have anything to worry about, maybe that was another sign he wasn’t a good guy, he told me during the duration that because of his trust issues even though he thought I was perfect and that I was most likely going to be his next serious girlfriend that it was going to take him months to trust me enough to date me, he had a great way of telling me subtly that I was doing things wrong or I should be doing this or that instead, he got very involved in my weight and trying to “help” me lose weight, he told me it would make him feel more comfortable about a future together If I lost weight, for an idea when I met him I was 5’0 and 177lbs, and I did lose weight while I was with him, I still am, he kept telling me that sex wasn’t important to him, that it didn’t matter to him that I wasn’t good at it because he cared more about me for who I was than sex, he was my first, I was a virgin when I met him, and he knew that. When he decided to end things because I wasn’t enough for him, I was so enamored by him and I trusted him so much, the very same night he ended things I lost my virginity to him, and that was all on me, he told me that we should just stay friends and I told him I still wanted to lose my virginity to him, I don’t regret it but I don’t think he deserved that from me, but even though he did all of that to me and I know now I was being manipulated by him what hurts the most is that only two weeks after he ended things with me and I was still trying to get over him and be friends with him, he told me that he was seeing someone exclusively that they were officially going out, it felt like a punch in the stomach, I felt so betrayed, he started dating this girl a week after their first date, he told me that after the first date he deleted all his dating apps, I asked him what the girl was like he gave me a list of qualities that he was looking for that she basically checked off each box, I feel so sick and hurt by it, after that I sent him a message saying how hurt I was and that I couldn’t be friends, his response was him defending his actions he didn’t care I walking out of his life and he didn’t feel sorry that I was hurting. Before him I didn’t have trust issues, now I do, I was so ready to start dating before I met him now I can’t, I’m still dealing with the aftermath I still struggle to eat normally again, 


TL;DR 
I fell for a guy, lost my virginity to him and it turns out he was manipulating me the whole time and then he found “the one” two weeks after he ended things with me and bragged to me about how perfect she was when I was still hurting over him and not being enough for him. All I wanted was to find a relationship with someone, I was never expecting to be so hurt I never thought anyone would do something like this.",lonely,I’m so hurt,2020-11-26 18:49:42

Im also starting to feel more paranoid about conversations at work lately, which hasn’t ever been a problem in the past. I just catch glances from my co workers during conversation that make me overthink everything I’m saying in the hopes of not being judged or thought of in a negative way. Which i feel, has kind of reinforced my thoughts on this entire post.

I copied and pasted parts of an essay and was glad to get a note from my professor saying it's plagiarism and he can give me time to change it. It felt good because I used to be a top student and it felt good to be different, for some reason. If bad things happen it would feel good because it would reflect how I felt. 

I know that when I meet new people sometimes I can be desperate or don't care if I stumble or be awkward. Because I don't want to/can't hide what I feel about not having anyone in my life. Some people view this as weakness but I don't care enough about getting better to change it. 

I went to therapy and no one cared, I felt like I was the only one who cared even the therapist wasn't that interested. 

A guy who was nice? to me a bit a first said he thought ""I didn't care"" and then proceeded to try to avoid me/exclude me even though he knew I was trying to make friends.

I don't care since it wasn't in my control. I'm studying for a degree in something I thought was useful but is now feels empty, and I almost wouldn't care if it didn't work out. I tried to do well but I couldn't concentrate on it. I used to do very little in group projects and I realized it affected people so I tried hard to do more and it worked, I felt better, but then I realized it was too hard to keep it up and others did good work so I stopped.

I tried to go for a job and career but could not settle on something and though I care, time keeps passing and I have not/could not move forward. I don't care if I'm not taking full advantage of this time or wasting opportunity, I already tried and it didn't work. No one would care anyway. A girl who was friendly to me for a while I reached out to and told her what I had been through and she didn't care and wanted to one-up me or something, since she wanted to play and string me along.

I lived in a house with students I didn't know and I didn't care if something happened. I went outside and sat on a bench listening to music and feeling sorry for myself watching other people and I didn't care. 

I moved out on a whim and for a couple days lived a little randomly, sat on the steps of a building feeling sorry for myself, looking at other people, for a response. I would sit outside at places, wanting to be and avoid people. I went for midnight walks several hours long in the dark, talking to myself and I didn't care. I walked back in pouring rain since I didn't care. 

And since I don't care, others maybe start to not be respectful. Idk, I used to care, I used to be ok and after trying to be better, I became more hurt and it was harder to care.",lonely,How do I care about myself?,2020-11-26 13:49:09

I've actually had two people that I used to chat with back and forth when quarantine started. We were all in the same boat because we were all also attending online school. But now, we never talk unless I start it. 

One of them I've been trying to get closer with. I've considered him my one true friend many times. We often play Minecraft together when we're both busy. 

So today, I ask him if he wanted to. He says that he can at 7 because he has to go to bowling practice. I figure, ""okay, sure, I'll wait.""

But by the time 7 hits around and I ask him if he wants to he says ""Sorry, I just realized I had a bunch of homework to do."" But mind you, Thanksgiving is tomorrow and he's homeschooled, so I highly doubt that. 

I text him saying that it's okay if he actually doesn't want to get on, and I bring up the fact that I think he's lying, but he just replies with ""it's okay"" in less than a second after opening it.

The only people who want me around are my parents and my brother, which is nice, but I've been hanging out with only them this whole quarantine. 

I just want one genuine friend. Someone who will put in effort. Someone who will listen to me. Someone who wants to keep the conversation going. I'm still young and only in high school, but I'm getting impatient and tired of trying just to get nowhere.

Sorry if this comes off as a sob story and it basically is but I just need somewhere to vent before I sleep otherwise I can't. I think it partly stems from my dad passing away from cancer when I was very young so I never had a father figure in my life but I could remember the fear becoming essentially ever-present just before I started secondary school. I had 1 friend in primary school and he was the only best friend I've ever had and he also passed away from cancer after we finished primary school but just before secondary school. I then spent the first year of secondary school as a complete loner but I had a cousin in the same year as me and he basically took me under his wing with his group of friends and I started to become fine mentally. But the fear never left me, it even dictated what gcse subjects I picked because I didn't want to be left alone, just the thought scares the shit out of me. And then just before covid hit my cousin passed away from a shock brain aneurysm. I've been depressed since and the sheep mentality continued even after secondary school. I picked the college I'm going to purely because my friends are going to that college. I picked the subject purely because my friends are studying that. I opened up to my family fairly recently and I was diagnosed with anxiety and giving medication but it really hasn't helped. I'm embarrassed to speak to them. Feels like everyones judging me. I even told them about how I follow everyone else and I just know they find it a pathetic, sad thing but it's not for me. I wouldn't be able to live unless I'm following someone else. And that scares me so much because I know the day isn't too far away where we're all gonna go our separate roads and I'll be left alone.

I'm  a 25yo male, I'm single. Two months ago I moved out because of my toxic parents.

During this year, I finally decided to get into recovery to recover from an addiction I had for 13 years. I also started therapy as part of the recovery and to heal from my parents.

Since I moved out, I felt a lot better and life just became a lot better without the constant emotional manipulation and toxic behavior, however. I feel extremely lonely.

This loneliness has surfaced a week or two ago because I got sucked into work so I didn't see any of my friends or sisters for two weeks straight, and that's when I discovered how bored and lonely I feel.

I tried today to get with some friends, but everyone's busy, so I just got out and drove around.

I usually write 3 things I'm grateful for at the end of each day, it's an exercise that's part of the therapy and its goal is to make you feel more and more grateful. Today I'm struggling to write the 3 things, I know there are things in the day to be grateful for, but I just don't feel anything but loneliness rn.

i created a server on discord for the purpose of growing a network of online friends from all over the place. ideally, a member would have these traits:  
\- friendly &amp; open minded  
\- often down to play (mostly pc) games like among us, skribblio, jackbox, dead by daylight, etc.  
\- respectful to people as individuals  
\- 18 or older; not cause we're creeps, but cause most of the server's members are between  20-30 so it'd just be more comfortable

But i get a feeling they are ashamed of me. They are a wealthy family, people who cares about fashion, body shape and skincare. And i am ugly, havent slept for months, tired of taking care of a baby by myself, and dont care about fashion. 

Maybe i should change who i am, start caring about my appearance. But everytime i think about it, whats left of self confidence just drop to the ground and im drained and exhausted.

The first love I had for a girl lasted for four years, I barely spoke to her during that time, and no joke: the catalyst for it, was literally just that she looked at me and smiled. My second love was more reasonable, my crush would always notice me, laugh at everything I say, touch me (very close to my ass), even one point winked at me - this lasted a painstaking year and a half. As weird and crazy as it sounds, my latest love I have for a girl, is a girl that I know online - couple weeks in, and it's painful. 

Honestly, I fucking hate myself so much because of this. If I got to choose, I'd want all of this emotional sensitivity and fragility to end. It has and does significantly affect my everyday life, thoughts about love, probably constitute half of my time consciously thinking.

At times I just lose all confidence over it and lately I have gotten really isolated with the drama of this year and have been overthinking things too much these past couple of weeks.

Apart from once I guess when I drank way too much and barely remember anything, which did not sit right with me the next day. I did not have sex, and I try to put that out of my mind that you know I have not had that normal experience people love doing, it's just gotten at the forefront of my mind with moving back in with family and I have nobody in my life to talk to and I just feel isolated in the place I grew up because I was never comfortable with the way people judged me, viewed me, and I can't stomach reaching out to anyone here so I am just alone at the moment.

I put myself on those dating apps and I can don't know, just get to nervous and don't have the confidence that I should. I delete the apps when it gets anywhere with someone because I am horrified that the girl is going to abuse me really.

I just can't stop hating myself these past few days, I don't know why I gotta be scared of so much that I can't function like a normal person anymore.

I know that just sounds like a headache but dont worry its not... its a migraine, i lost my family and my first genuine friend group and some other people in my life who i thought would’ve had my back and helped me at my worst but no, i got avoided, ignored, ditched and forgotten about not only for my mental health ( im diagnosed Bipolar 2) but also because of who i am and how i am, im a quiet caring person and yeah i guess it can be over shadowing but i never was, i only ever kept my friends and families backs no matter what but in the end i was the one who got burnt.

I apologize again if thats too much to read and i understand if you skipped it, my life has had so many faults with my family life, friends and even myself and it just makes me so lonely and it just drags my bad mood down more than anything and makes everything hard to do like eating of basic hygiene where its replaces with crappy snacks and copious amounts of alcohol, before you tell me anything i just clear it up now, yes i am in therapy but it only helps so much, yeas im on medication but i feel no change or difference from them.

I've been a drifter forever. I was bullied out of existence in high school. I was the debate captain and the chess captain, so its not like I've not been around people similar to me and its not that I'm unliked, but I didn't really connect with people there. I ended up doing college coursework my senior year and got along fine enough with the people I shared my various series with. Ended up skipping prom and moved to uni.

Started getting panic attacks my first year there, operating pretty much entirely on my own. I tried clubs. The chess team completely outclassed me despite my efforts to improve. Capture the flag was fun, but I was always treated like an outsider for some reason.

Second year I ended up getting in touch with the roommate of somebody I knew from high school and joined their D&amp;D group. Honestly, its been the best social tool for me. The only person I dated for more than 3 dates came out of this, actually. Stopped before the DtR because of my asexuality. I and other members of the group ended up backing out early third year because of the DM's political ideology (such as defending posters calling for ethnic cleansing on the basis of free speech). Similar story here in that my senior year I ended up taking a leadership position in an academic club but never clicked with anybody. Kept vaguely in touch with the one I dated and a couple other people but ended up graduating and moving across the country for a postbac.

Immediately set up D&amp;D groups, including DMing semi professionally in store. The longest social group I had was probably here, with some randoms I found on facebook. A lawyer, a psychologist, a call center guy, and a few more. D&amp;D was basically the only thing we did, but it was something to look forward to week over week. I didn't really have a close friend group until a couple of months before I finished my program. I cried when they wrote me a goodbye card.

Moved across the country again for grad school. Hit off with a few people here pretty quickly, but couldn't really do much as I struggled with rotations and coursework. Then the pandemic hit. I was stuck in a tiny studio all summer without AC, 95 degrees and nowhere to go. Gained 30 pounds (from 170) in 4 months sweating on my bed and sleeping, accomplishing nothing. I've since moved to a different apartment.

I guess the TLDR is that I'm tired of circumstances I don't really have control over like moving for my career, other people driving wedges, and a international crisis getting in the way every time my life stabilizes. By the time this pandemic is over I'll be 1/3 of the way done with my graduate degree and I'll have to move again. I'll move again after my 2 or 3 year postbac.

I'm disabled and need help with the most basic of house tasks. The mantra of the local social services is to ask friends and family for help. I have neither.

I came to a realisation today as to why we split, but it's far too little too late.

This Christmas I have noone to go to and noone to come to me. I'm starting to feel the loneliness kick in. We have a dog that she took, who was with me 24/7 so she could be walked without any difficulty. It's upset me no end.

I am living in a house unsuitable for my disibilities so don't go out often anymore.

I don't know what to do... My disabilities got worse as time went on, but I'm now learning to do all these things alone. It's unlikely I'll be in a relationship again, but frankly I don't care. I'm just wondering what do I do now? I don't know what to do with myself or even where to go?

I'm in a state really. My first Christmas totally alone. 40.

This year I’ve lost my boyfriend of more than 5 years (I am a female in my mid-twenties) and my best friend. Both were very traumatic loses, but with the current state of the world, I was able to distract myself fairly well for a while. I’m an ICU nurse on/off working COVID, and have given my all to, and have thrown myself into, work. After some recent time off I’ve realized that almost all of my social interaction now comes from work, and virtually all of my friends are my coworkers. None of whom I’m super super close with, though. I’ve been feeling very anxious lately and have realized it’s because I have virtually no one to talk to outside of work. When I’m not working, the days feel both long and short at the same time. I try to be as productive as possible to fill the time and keep myself busy, but that constant push for productivity almost makes me feel worse. The alternative, though, is me sitting on my phone scrolling though the same social media over, and over, and over again. Maybe I need a hobby. Well, I definitely need a hobby. I realize there are much bigger problems than this occurring every day to people all around the world, I just have no where else to say all of this, and no one else to confide in.

i’ve been meditating frequently on this small excerpt. personally, as of late, i’ve been yearning or perhaps starving for genuine companionship from people — real interactions. recently having dealt with both heartbreak and the loss of a parent — these unfortunate circumstances have made me realize how much people are truly afraid of taking the risk on love, the risk that comes with loving someone. perhaps, people fear the weight of accountability and thee unknown that is strung about from love ... so instead, people grow accustomed to keeping an arms length with others. inevitably, sowing seeds of loneliness — because how can one truly plead for love without the acceptance that the unknown may occur? 

at this moment in time, i’ve never felt so alone but i also understand that i’ve put in effort in past relationships and am doing so in currently. but i suppose the real loneliness is understanding that people are afraid of the one thing they desire most — so paralyzed by fear and strangely comforted by their loneliness ... they’ll push others away.",lonely,rambling aloud,2020-11-25 11:51:03
808,sportforourneighbors,1606264803,1,"I’ve spent a number of my post school age years thinking about how I royally screwed myself by not learning how best to socialize as a student. Instead of trying to overcome social anxiety and overall inability to conquer negative thoughts about not being able to fit in, I instead convinced myself that I didn’t need anybody. In a sense I don’t regret this because to this day I prefer being alone to having people in my orbit I don’t like being there, but at the same time I didn’t even begin to try to pull myself out of my own self-imposed rut. I convinced myself it was impossible to bridge the gap I perceived between myself and others. It’s harder now at 24 to learn how to exist with people in a way conducive to the creation of friendships or relationships. I still feel invisible and as if I’ve shut and locked my own cell door. I remember prior to the pandemic grabbing my Chick-Fil-A bag and quickly glancing at a group of people slightly younger than me all hitting it off and having a good time. It was then that it dawned on me how strange it is at my age to reflect sadly that this seems like another world apart from mine entirely. It resembles no world I’ve ever known or been apart of. And it’s my fault.

809,Void_Skeleton,1606264546,1,"Don't know how to start this but I guess I can start with that I'm a 20 year old male that's been lonely most of his life from childhood to now. This is my first time posting something on Reddit and English is my second language so please bare with me and I apologize if anything looks broken here.

First off I want to say I was a really lonely child but I was a really joyful child but I didn't know any better at the time, I was quite dumb back then, I had SOME friends (I think so anyway) back then in kindergarten but when I started school, that's when everything started to go down hill, at first I recognized some of the people from kindergarten but I was quickly forgotten after but I was still mostly joyful despite that, I was still dumb and didn't know any better, after that I thought I found new friends in my first grade class but I was wrong, thinking back I realized I was mostly invisible to everyone and this went on most of my first school life and I was also bullied, made fun of, Hell, I had basketballs thrown at my head during gym (P.E.) lessons.

Of course I slowly became less and less joyful to finally depressed, and full of anxiety, and finally growing a brain and finally understanding that nobody cares about me, and finally fully realize I was invisible to everyone and I hated my classmates with a passion and quickly wanted to just get out, and when I was finishing 8th grade, my class was given a choice to move to two different schools, one is harder and one is easier, most of my classmates went for the harder one, I went for the easier one (I wasn't really good with my grades anyway) and so I was glad I made that choice.

Forgot to mention that all of my Summer vacations were lonely, I had no one to hangout but play video games all day every day on every Summer.

When I finally began my 9th grade in a different school, I met the people in my class, they were much better than the pricks in my first school I was in but alas, I was still invisible to everyone, I tried my best to hangout, to chat with, but I always get either cut off or ignored, there are some classmates I have met that are really cool that actually bare with me when I chat with them but they still had an actual life outside of school unlike me so that was short lived despite being with them for years until the end, I always wondered what was wrong with me that no one would hangout with me and then eventually I found out I am autistic, and when I did find that out I realized why I was failing so much in the past, and why I was terrible with my grades, and how I acted as a child, being called ""gifted"", and why I had troubles communicating with everyone.

With all of this that happened to me, I had Online friends to hangout with but it was limiting, I couldn't play games with them that much, I could rarely talk with them, mostly text and messages and I badly and mostly wanted to talk with my own voice and at least play games with them. They had a life unlike me who sits in front of a computer all day everyday and the time zones difference was especially annoying, they were great to chat with but it was very short lived.

When I was finally graduating I realized that I don't have a plan for my future, what's worse for me is that most of my Online friends moved on because they had a life outside of the Internet, all I did most of my life is play video games and learn about computers, mostly hardware and a bit of software. After graduating my parent helped me put up a job system thing for me that I would get a job eventually but then the infamous virus came up, it delayed everything for me at first but of course we were eventually quarantined like everyone else and so I stayed jobless and no friends to chat with, I tried making new friends Online but I failed every single time, Hell, I even embarrassed myself a few times, it's not possible for me to make new friends outside of the Internet because of my autism, anxiety, and depression. I do have very few Online friends that stuck around but they're also busy most of the time and I rarely chat with them.

Seeing people being such great friends to each other and seeing a team of friends achieving amazing things in games makes me realize of how I will never have such great friends, relationship is out of the question, you can already assume that I never dated anyone reading this story of mine. I always wanted to have great hangouts, do challenges with friends in games and just simply have fun...  
That's apparently too much to ask for...

I think I'm already at my limit since I just don't care anymore, I accepted my fate no matter how hard I try and tried, 2020 is the loneliest year for me and I think it will just get only worse from here. I have become of something I was afraid to be... A heartless man, a husk of a man, a nobody, an asshole... The funny thing is, when I was a child, I wished to be everyone's friend and Life flipped the reverse switch for that one.

Of course, there were people that told me 'Don't give up', 'Be hopeful', 'It's not too late', or 'You're just 19-20 years old, you still have time' but they don't understand of how too late it is, it doesn't depend on how long it damages you, it depends on how much it damages you.

So, here I am sitting here writing this story while drinking coke and eating chips at 2 AM and thinking maybe I will get at least a notice, I highly doubt it, I just don't care to the point that I don't hide my misery. I was always hesitant to do something like this thanks to my anxiety and depression but this night hit me so hard that I just thought to myself: 'Fuck it, why not? It's something to do instead of thinking of how lonely I am all night'.

Thank you for being patient enough to read all of this, for once I'll know someone cared enough to know my story.  
Please don't PM or DM me, I don't use Reddit that often and I don't want to accidentally hurt anyone's feelings of who I am now.

Anyway, I think I'm done now, thank you again for reading all of this.",lonely,My Lonely Life Rant,2020-11-25 11:35:46

I have nothing and I feel nothing, I am nothing.
I tend to get attached to people a lot and get attached too soon, so don't write me to leave me after two days (or at least give me a reason).
But I am so full of affection, that I cannot pour on anyone, that I feel it on the skin, but not being able to appreciate my affection for me, it causes me the opposite effect.

I didn't want to let my hopes go up, not after what happened with my ex, but today she talked to me again when I was so ready to be ghosted.

So I did it, I let myself be hopeful, I imagined us being friends and stopped being careful with how I felt. I just allowed myself to be me. I sent her some videos I find very funny and eagerly waited for her to respond while watching something else so that I could feel the same way as I did yesterday.

I could feel some hints of happiness arise after a long time, I could laugh more easily at what I was watching, I could feel more ambitious in my goals, I treated my mother with more affection when she called me for dinner, it felt... good.

I’ll  do anything to see you smile.

Lastly, I can’t wait  until we can open up to each other, and be able to trust each other with things we’ve never told anyone  else before. I can’t wait to build an everlasting bond with you.

To cut a long story short, all of those years of emotional and physical abuse led to a mental breakdown, after which my already introverted ass went to a total shutdown. It’s been a couple years since then, and now I can actually leave the house and do some things outside of my room, but I have started to feel incredibly lonely. And becouse I am this slightly overweight, akward and sad looking waste of oxygen, it’s only natural that nobody wants to talk to me. As I now need to move forward, I’ve got two paths to choose from. Either I try to embrace my loneliness, and move in the forest to live as a hermit, or I find someone mad enough to be with me and help me deal with people. The latter is the better option but is highly unlikely to happen.

I'm 23F and I enjoy talking to people virtually. I've always had pen pals to communicate with but it's been hard to go out and send letters because of the pandemic. 
I've noticed a huge difference in how I feel since the pandemic started and it's been down hill for the most part. I also noticed most of my friends and family slowly get frustrated with life as time went by, and I realized most of us felt so helpless in the given situation. 

However, talking to random strangers and seeing that we're all just part of a bigger world where we all have our purpose and each other to help us out, made me feel the slightest bit better. I'd like for you to have the feeling too if you're currently struggling. If you need to vent or rant, please reach out. It really doesn't matter what your age, race, nationality, gender, sexuality or beliefs are. Human for human, I'm here for you.

If you have nothing to vent about, but just wish for small talk, I'm down for some company!

Not everything is always good...
She felt jealous, because I would often speak with my Best friend, i would ask her for advise and tips for my dates with Mishell, tell her how they went about and that sort of stuff...
Mishell, was possessive...
The trouble went and came day after day, she began to lie, all the time, she said some things about a pregnancy test, about a miscarriage and about other stuff...
We ended the relationship since she asked for some ""time"" 
Apparently, time has a name and last name, i sunk into depression... I've had a history of cutting and self harm...
March 18th 2019, I drove my 1992 volkswagen beetle into a tree...
One choice I wish I had avoided but now realize it was for the best...
All of my memories with her had a place in that car, thus the pain was greater, I opened the door, stepped out of the remains of the car without a single scratch, hit or bruise ...
I couldn't find a reason to that, a unstable car, no seatbelt, no airbags and straight into that tree...
Unharmed, shivering and evaluating everything I saw her coming to my aid, she told me she had a date later on that day
-¿¡Are you okay!? ¿Do you want me to stay?
My response - I am okay, thanks, but you have a date and I wouldn't like you to miss it.
That sentence made so much sense I felt like I had everything solved...
She left while I draked with the insurance company...
The depression followed on until I went to the theater and saw ""Man of la Mancha"", that play, the songs, the emotions, the feelings, the atmosphere...
There I realised that everything happens for a reason, I learnt that I took my time, made my choices and there was no one to blame but me, I stood up and clenched my fist...
Since that day Mishell has just been a memory, of a unstable, liar and a person who didn't want anything but attention, but far more important than that, she was a lesson, for me to know my worth, to know my limits and to know when to stand up and move along with whatever cards you're dealt in this game of life...
Maybe my heart is still broken, maybe I'm single, alone, but there is one thing for sure...
I now love me, I know my choices were the Right ones, and I'm ready to dream that impossible dream, to see the world the way it should be
Because madness is seeing the world the way it is and not the way it should be!

This is all a real story, my story, and I thanks you for reading...
You can do this!

916,flisherman666,1606196069,1,"TLDR: You dont have to read all this shit. In a nutshell, most people in their teens to late twenties are full of shit and I dont want to speak for everyone but I was lonely because I simply couldnt connect with the dozens of groups I had hung out with despite giving them every chance in the book. blah blah blah, youll get used to being alone and once you do you wont want to go back and youll enjoy yourself, thats my journey bye

&amp;#x200B;

I forget the quote but in a nutshell some great writer had said that you a truly happy person is someone who can sit alone in a room doing nothing. I moved to a new state right after high school, its been six and a half years now and I am 24. At first I couldnt stand it, I hated it, I resented the decision my parents made to move. However, after this large amount of time with no friends, circle, etc. I have really come to enjoy it to the point where I ignore invitations to parties, social gatherings, and all of that jazz.

I guess Im making this for people that are truly lonely, unlike me who is content with being alone so technically Im not lonely. I had a lot of resentment. All my ""friends"" as you would call them, slowly stopped texting me or calling me on the phone, and I took it pretty personally because I will always keep in touch because, well, thats what fucking friends do. 

Ive clearly had a lot of time to think about why I felt lonely. My friends were just a distraction to me avoiding my issues of being content on my own, which I believe all people should be capable of, but not without lots of work and practice. After four years I gave up trying to connect to people. I went to five different large/top public colleges in florida over the years. Met plenty of people, went to plenty of events, put myself out there. Eventually I realized it must be best for me to be alone because I couldnt connect to any person to save my life, there was just something missing. You know, the ""click"" that happens when you meet someone like yourself and you both immediately realize this. 

Nope, instead it was an endless barrage of vapid, superficial, and underdeveloped kids that were as flaky as a severe dry skin condition. I simply couldnt relate to anyone. And despite what people say about ""well you have to get to know them, they just seem like that on the surface"", trust me I did. There is nothing there and I hate to sound like a pretentious art buying fuck, but lets face it, most of the students in college (not all), from what I experienced(and I experienced quite a bit), were very single layered individuals. Like an onion with a hollow inside. You peel back the first layer and see that they appeared as person, but were nothing but a facade. 

Im not sure if anyone else has felt this way. I have plenty of opportunities to spend time with others, but I cant connect with them, despite being as open and friendly and giving them a chance for quite some time to ""get to really know them"". Either way, for those of you who are lonely out there, give being alone a chance. Do not underestimate yourself and how youll adapt to a new life, the happiest people I know love every second they spend by themselves, including me. Sorry for the rant/disorganized post.",lonely,"Ive been alone for so long Ive started to enjoy it, and some other things Ive thought about over the years",2020-11-24 16:34:29

I wish I had someone to guide or at least just accompany me. Does anyone else feel this way? I've always been 6 years behind everyone else in terms of social development. I was this quiet introverted kid in highschool who was way too suspicious of anyone to make friends, then when I finally got over the deeprooted convictions of paranoia set in me by bullies and family, I just wasn't in a place where I could make friends anymore. None of my existing friends, and I can count them on one hand, can hang out with me for various reasons, most of them are busy or just have their own personal issues they're working through that make them uncomfortable around me. While I know objectively it's not me, it's really disheartening that the people closest to me literally cannot stand to be around me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I deleted my old account but I've been on here before, and I lurked a bunch. I love writing and reading, and we just got first snow here in Toronto and I really want to go out and make some snowforts. I haven't done that since I was a kid. I know that opening paragraph is a huge downer, but I really do love making the people I meet here laugh. When people stick around I am generally the person sending inane rambling and spam throughout the day, accompanied by memes and stupid michael-scott-esque stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me about your day! I made hot chocolate and sipped it outside on my balcony. I played with my nephew a bit, I got a PS5 in the mail and I played some spider-man, though I'm fairly new to gaming, I do love marvel. I wrote a little bit, read a page or two of the Odyssey, and then I cooked dinner for my dad and sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as if Covid is just such an easy excuse to not go outside. I've been working on trying to be more outgoing and human, I went out maybe 3 times in 2018, and maybe 12 times in 2019, and that might not seem like much but before 2018 I hadn't gone out for 8 years - except for family events i was forced to go to, and school. I have a huge bucketlist of things I want to do some day, I want to try every restaurant in Toronto, I want to sail across Lake Ontario, I want to see the northern lights and see the 2033 Solar Eclipse in the arctic. Covid keeping me in is making me feel like I'm regressing to my old me, and it's just making me feel like I never made any progress at all. So shoot me a message so I can invest in you,

&amp;#x200B;

I'd prefer a bit of anonymity as we start, just no mention of gender or ethnicity, skip the generic small talk and jump immediately to who you are as a person. Also, I am a spammer and a rambler, and I am looking for other people who can say the same - because ideally if this does work out, I'll probably be spamming all the time and expect some reciprocation. So if you're a rambler, prove it :P (at least \~ 500 words please)",lonely,"I feel so isolated - Toronto (23) [Looking for you, if you're nearby]",2020-11-24 16:12:48

Not that I haven't had crushes but I have hated so many things about myself for so long that I never feel that I am enough as I am. I always find something to hate about myself, to bog myself down. How I wish I was more relaxed about things. I am not an awkward person to be around and to be honest I am quite highly regarded amongst my friends and peers.

I want to be held and consoled and be heard. I want to love myself. I want to accept myself. But the struggle seems so long that I start to change and then stop mid-way.

So, I ask myself, am I the problem?",lonely,Overlooked,2020-11-24 11:14:54
954,Desmodusdraculae,1606175460,1," I think there's something about me that people really dislike but I can't put my finger on it.  
Early 20s. I'm trying to figure out if it's because I'm ugly, I think I might be and just not fully realize it. I'm very private/introverted, probably have avoidant personality disorder. Huge recluse, pre-covid. So I don't have anyone to ask or talk to about it. I don't go outside. I'm a ""Hikkikomori"".  


I join new servers (discord) and chat rooms online but no one \****ever***\* approaches me or initiates a conversation. I kind of rely on this because of my quiet personality. I'm used to going many, many months without talking to anyone at all, and if I didn't make an effort to have some kind of online presence (as small as it is) I wouldn't exist to anyone flat. This is not an exaggeration. Between early 2018 - mid 2019 I was mute and did not speak to anyone online, I just played MMOs in silence almost everyday. I uploaded my first picture to an online profile for the first time since 2013 just last year.   


It's extremely rare for me to have any kind of friend, I play all games entirely alone, MMOs FPS RPG etc.   


I'm not fat, or spotty, or horrifically grotesque. I'm pretty in-shape, working on it. I'd say I'm a weirdo by most people's standards. I've tried to push myself out of my comfort zone and minimally interact in chats sometimes but nothing ever happens, really, and I hate how I feel afterwards. I don't actually want a big group of 'regular' friends ... I'm selective about the people I surround myself with and I don't like most people, but *no people* like me.  Maybe I'm just boring ... or not interesting to them.  Another alternative I've thought of is that people look at my picture and just assume that I'm an average guy and nowhere near unspeakably lonely/depressed. I joined a ""doomer"" group chat once last year and someone called me a ""chad"" whilst asking why I was there  but I'm unsure if they were being sarcastic, you couldn't really see my face. I never went back because they seemed like kids.

But today something triggered my sense of awareness and I realized how horribly lonely I am. For a while I was able to forget about it. I don't think this is the first time I have posted here. Probably not my last. I have this principle in my head that a relationship is made by two people who are happy who come together to be happy with each other. But how am I supposed to be happy when I feel like I have nothing in common with anyone my age. Most people cringe at the sight of any comment like ""i was born in the wrong generation, old things good new things bad"". I don't have this same idea that people think is stupid. I prefer old things, but they don't just make me happy. They make me feel safe. Like I am at home. I am surrounded by things that I have grown up with that still feel completely foreign to me. I have old things that when I am around them, it gives me this overwhelmingly warm and friendly feeling. But its only for a brief moment. Its like deja vu. I feel like that was my normal and I can't stand this feeling of not being  there anymore. Is this what old people feel like. How torturous. I don't think I am going crazy, I have no clue why I would. I know its not like I can feel that strange and wonderful feeling all the time unless I meet someone like myself. I still enjoy modern things. But I have to find someone that has a deeper connection with life. Someone who feels like I feel. Many people tell me I have an old soul. That I am wise beyond my years. I suppose thats true if they all say it but. Dear god, being an old soul is lonely. I am not a spiritual or religious person. This is just a natural feeling. I don't know what to do about it. I don't go to a public school. I only have a small handful of friends. One of them is sort of like me, but they have a lot of things on their mind, and still somewhat contain that childish innocence that many people have. Not a worry in the world. , but I feel like an 80 year old man. That I have lived my life to its fullest, and I have no where to go from here. What I am supposed to do. What does saying this to anyone accomplish. I really don't know. I just need to talk to someone who understands. Someone who really understands. That is all I want is to be happy. But I know that there is no object or event in this universe that can do that. Not that I am trying to use this to meet people, but if anyone reads this and feels the same way, maybe we could talk. Highly unlikely though. My suffering may not be as great as others, but its eternal, and I doubt there is any way to fix it.",lonely,I feel hopeless that I'll ever meet someone that will make me happy.,2020-11-24 09:40:58
963,yhrowaway4927284,1606170123,1,"Just read a post recently about a woman who's dating a 34 year old virgin and she was asking advice about how to make him comfortable and feel loved. Honestly it was touching, and I wish both of them the best. But now I'm conflicted, whether there's any hope for me that I will find someone like that some time in the near future. 

Technically I'm not a virgin anymore, but the woman I lost it to turned out to be a manipulative, toxic, lying bitch who made my life a living hell for the first half of 2020. So essentially she spoiled it, and now I feel even more unloved and worthless than I was before. 

But I'd like to think I'm not some unlovable monster. I care about people, maybe more than I should. I watch out for others and help if I can, even if I don't get anything out of it, and I try my best to be honest and be a good listener to those who need it, because I know more than anyone how it feels to have no one to talk or vent to. But I just wish there was someone like that for me, who would hear me out and support me and love me. Yeah, I can be a little gloomy sometimes, my mood changes like the wind, I can wake up one day feeling fine and normal and another day wanting nothing more than to lay back down and sleep through the whole day, and I recognize that and do my best to try and mitigate it. On a good day, if I'm feeling comfortable, I can be pretty fun and cheerful and boisterous, and I wish people could see that side of me some more. 

But yet, through all of my experiences throughout the years, people seem to only just tolerate me. I don't really know what it feels like to have someone like me just for being me, or to actively want to get to know me more or want to keep me around. It's like everyone just wants to keep me at a distance. It's not like I'm super desperate and acting fake or clingy, I'm actually coming to terms with my situation and I just let myself act naturally, and if people like me they can stick around, and if they don't then that's fine too, I'm used to it. But at the same time I just don't understand what's wrong with me.

I've been looking forward to the trip for weeks, and really thought I was going to be able to enjoy myself here while I am away from my friends and my house back home. I was doing well with my anxious thoughts (thoughts like ""none of my friends like me that much,"" ""I'm awkward/creepy/offputting"", etc. make me feel lonely and disgusting a lot) before I left, but now that I'm here I just feel so, so sad. I couldn't stop thinking about my feelings of loneliness and abandonment while we were all playing a game of cards last night, and it nearly made me cry in front of everyone. I mean... I have best friends who I know consider me one of their best friends, too. I have a lot of people I talk to regularly and an active social life. But I consider 3-4 people my closest friends, and before I left for this trip I spent the night at one of said friend's house, and felt really abandoned by the end over some really stupid stuff. I was sitting on the couch above my friend and she was like ""What are you doing? Why are you hovering over me like that?"" and she's typically very direct (and jokes around a lot) so I really shouldn't have taken it personally, but I really did, and felt so awkward and creepy. And then after that I had to leave, and she walked me to my car and watched before I drove away (for safety). Our other two friends who were there, and as I was leaving they said goodbye and wished me good luck and to send photos of the trip. But I've texted our group chat twice since leaving four days ago, and while everyone responded and asked questions over the first message I sent, I sent another one the day before yesterday and only one of my friends responded. The other two are notoriously terrible texters, and they've reached out once or twice through text and TikTok since I've gotten here, but only one friend has asked me about the trip. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but I really wish for a ""how are things going"" from one or two people. They knew about it before I left... I just, I don't know, I think things will be back to normal once I'm back home, but I feel so disconnected from everyone right now, like I could just simply disappear and they could easily fill the space I left behind with other friends or with their hobbies. I don't know. I know it's anxiety getting the best of me again... I should be grateful for my friends, and focus on the more good instead of the minimal bad. Sigh. I was doing so well and I just hate that I'm wasting time here around my family, whom I really really love being around and talking with and only get to see rarely, being anxious about people who really just regard me as a normal friend, not someone they have to fret over all of the time.",lonely,Just feeling a bit uncared for - like a background character in my friends' lives.,2020-11-24 07:00:14

I'm very nearly 30 (again, I know. 30 is the new 20 or something), but I've only ever had first dates or one emotionally abusive relationship. Nearly all my friends are married or in very committed relationships and of course my mother likes to put in digs every now and then about ""if you ever decide you want to be married"" as if wanting it is a guarantee of getting it. In short, I guess I always pictured myself being in a relationship by now. Every day I experience the fact that I'm no one's priority and what's more, that it's inappropriate for me to prioritize my friends who are in relationships; especially those of the opposite sex. 

I know I'm likely being over-dramatic having just passed another birthday.

I’ve never really had a friend group, mostly because all my friends are so different and do not have the same interests as one another. I’m also not that great in big groups as I am in one-on-one scenarios. I have been trying to make new friends that have more similar interests to me but am really struggling.  For example, the other day, a girl roller skating complimented my skates, and I asked to take her number and if she wanted to hang sometime. I was so excited, but over text she did not really seem like she actually wanted to hang out.

How do people make good friends nowadays? I have been trying to use apps like Bumble but the people I meet always seem to have different interests, like they prefer to stay at home. It has been really lonely and a lot of times I wonder if I’m just destined to be alone and it’s not meant for me to have friends. Any advice?",lonely,Struggling to make friends. 22F,2020-11-24 03:57:20

I haven’t had any friends in years, its hard for me to trust anyone. I think this is due to how many times i’ve been lied to and how much hatred I have for most people. Every time I come onto reddit or any social media site, I find myself thinking, “is having a friend worth it? will there be a real connection?” I dont know if there ever will be someone that I can trust, I dont know if im capable of caring for others anymore. Im only 23 and I feel isolated from everyone around me. The only human interaction that I have to deal with at this point is at work, most of the conversations are empty and pointless. The things people talk about are ignorant and annoying, I find myself lying to make a smile or to utter out a laugh when I have nothing to say. I hate talking to most people, every time I try to speak my mind and the things that I think make sense, its never met with an equal or lesser exchange of intelligence. I’m on a path to becoming healthier and smarter but I often wonder if its worth it. Theres an emptiness inside of me, I cant tell if its painful anymore. Its just there, and when I read what others have to say about their loneliness it makes me think that there may be no answer. I was born into a body that I knew nothing about, with a path that was not clear. A family that taught me hate and fear, I’m told to live this way or the other.

1002,dArk_WrAith105,1606147044,1,"Hey there. Its me again. I know it's been a while since I last posted on here. I just wanted to give a quick update on what happened the last couple of weeks because it's been tough for me.

My school split every class into 2 groups. Group A is supposed to go into school in odd weeks on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and in even weeks on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And Group B the exact oppiste. Every day one groups is at home and doing homeschooling. Its pretty chill though. The only problem is due to one of my family members' health status I'm in homeschooling all the time and I can rarely leave the house. Hence I can't really see any of my friends which leaves me sitting around at my pc everyday with noone to hang around with. I am basically stuck at home like I was during Lockdown. And it's been really hard for me. I just feel so lonely every day. And for someone who used to hang around with friends every day and basically needs a lot of love and affection its just like hell. I just want to have someone (other than my family) to lie around with and cuddle all day long. Maybe even watch some old movies I used to watch in my childhood. And they will probably make me cry if I'd watch them nowdays because of all those memories I connect with them.

Anyways what I wanted to say the whole situation is just so exhausting for me and I bet for most of you guys aswell.

The only thing that is somewhat weird to me: these days i keep on pushing through all of this bullshit and keep on fighting. But 2 years ago I'd probably given up already. And I don't know why I keep on fighting to be honest. I'm not a fighter really and I don't really have anyone besides a few family members it'd be worth fighting for.

1003,Zomb0ss0,1606146904,1,"I fell in love in this girl a year ago and since that a lot of stuff has happened. I know her from school but (sadly) our main interaction happens via social media.
When I started to chat with her it took me quite a while (2-4 months) to say her that I love her. The situation back then was already quite complex because of the fact that we kinda ghosted each other at school. When the corona lockdown started things got worse. Another boy came out of nowhere and took her heart. As a consequence she just hit me up on an afternoon telling me that she doesn't want to have contact to me anymore. But later (2 weeks) coming back just to say sorry and giving the fault this boy, who has became her bf.
Since that our relationship to each other has become hard. After that I didnt want to have contact with her anymore and tried to avoid her, so I could get rid of my feelings for her. But she randomly came every second week and just asked how I am and stuff like that. These random hit ups, caused that I couldnt get rid of the feelings for her. And this has been happening since the lockdown until last month.

But now we are exchaning poems and stuff like that. And her poems are more kinda about her relationship and gave me the impression that she isnt happy in her relationship and that's what she even said once.
But at the same time she kinda said that she loves him so much and that their worlds belong together.

So I dont get why she asked me to meet me. Why we made a date when to meet, but then -4h before-, canceling it. Thats what she did in the past too.

So I dont get what she wants from me? She knows that I love her. So what does she wants? We still ghost each other at school. And when I message her it takes ages for her to reply. She acts different from what she said.",lonely,What does my crush want from me?,2020-11-24 02:55:04

I’ve been sitting with my loneliness the past week. It’s been uncomfortable as hell but I feel it’s needed. Before I was all about avoidance, busying myself with things that served no purpose but simple distraction. 

I’m doing this because I want to stop those cycles. This year has been one big shit show and something has finally shifted in me that makes me want to change, grow and learn. I’m just unsure of where to start. 

Ive been reading through the dating after 30 subreddit as sort of an “all is not lost” kind of thing. Although I’m putting the breaks on the dating scene for now because of covid and I know still need to focus on working on myself before truly throwing myself into different situations I’m not quite sure I’m ready for. 

Most of my life I’ve been somewhat of a loner. Growing up I never fit into a particular group, instead flitting between multiple. I’d consider myself more introverted but am quite sociable. I’ve always had one of two close friends throughout life, never a big social circle. 

These days my phone is mostly silent and has been somewhat of an adjustment, not relying on others to fill the void.

1023,Junefullm00n,1606131329,1,"Below is a very common Monday - Friday morning 
routine. Weekends aren't too much different. 


I wake up at 4:30 every morning, sigh and creep carefully out of the king bed trying not to wake the toddlers and my partner and tiptoe around the white german shepherd that's easily spotted in the almost dark house. The children have their own beds, we just wake up every morning with them in ours. I reluctantly start the coffee I know I wont touch for two hours then go into the basement to the family closet to pick everyones outfits for the day and start a new load of towels. I iron my partners suit that he's going to flirt with that one coworker in and then come back up stairs and put it in the bathroom on a hanger. I lay my children's out on their couch in the playroom. 
I sit down on the cold tile in the dark kitchen for a few moments in my mom high top underwear and sports bra with my head phones on with some random follow meditation music telling me to breathe and that I own my life. I sigh again as the 10 minute video ends and get up grabbing my fuzzy blue robe and wrap it around myself. I own my life. I own my life. I own my life. 
I go back into the bedroom where my family lay to grab my partner socks from the dresser, I find my partner on the love seat in the corner in the dark watching another womans 18 year old snatch and he looks up and glares at me. I know better than to say anything about it so I whisper ""good morning darling"", give him a kiss on the lips, with no return, walk out and place the socks with the rest of this clothing for the day. 
He walks out of the room after me and asks for his cup of coffee and a packed bowl and sits down at his computer in the living room to check on his gaming bots. I do as he says with out further touch. 
After I hand him his coffee and bowl I remind him of the time and he calls me a ""time nazi"". I walk into the kitchen without word and begin making breakfast and lunch for the day. As I'm making the fresh muffins my first child walks in crying that hes hungry, too impatient to wait the remaining 4 minutes on the oven timer so I peel him an orange and hand him is tablet. His loud crying for food has woken the other child. She runs out crying for attention and nourishment as well. My partner throws his hands in complaint, ""I never get time with you"", and goes to take a shower. A complaint I will never understand, he always has time for me, he just never chooses me. I own my life. 
I finish the breakfast and make  to-go boxes for my partner, one with an egg sandwich, muffin, and fruit, and one with leftover lasagna from the night before for lunch. I take the remaining muffins and eggs to the table and set the children up to eat and pour their juice of the day. My partner tells from the shower, "" bring me my coffee and I need a towel"". The towels are three feet from the shower in a stand, I forgot to hang one up for him next to the shower curtain. I own my life. 
As I get a few minutes I look around the house for my partners computer bag and components needed for work and place it all on the counter next to the back door. I place his shoes by a chair, and then put my slip ons on and go start the car for him, the mornings have been chilly lately. The children and dog are waiting by the door for me, I let the dog out and coral the children into their play room and put down some of their toys. 
I hear my partner complaining from the bathroom that he doesnt like the outfit, yet always refuses to pick his own out. I sigh, I own my life. 
He calls me into the bathroom to help with his hair, roll up his sleeves of his button up, and then asks me to find his belt, which is always on the floor in the bed room next to the bed in his paints from the prior night, I give him a kiss on the cheek and retrieve the belt . The children run from the play room wanting more attention so I dance around them and hand my partner his belt, he snatches it from me, ""What time is it! I'm going to be late! Why didnt you tell me the time!"". I pick up the youngest giving her one of those hugs that you want to cry into but let loose, kiss her and set her back down. ""I'm sorry, what else do you need?"", I say with a calm warm smile and he replies with, ""help me out the door"". 
So I grab his coat and laptop bag and give them to him. I walk him out to the car with his to-go boxes, coffee, and work badge he left ont he counter and hand them to him to pop ut in the car. He grabs me with a big smile, hugs me, kisses me, and says ""I love you so much, I hope you have a great day!"", I repeat the same words with smile. I own my life...
I walk back inside the house and pour my first cup of coffee, take a sip and set it back on the counter that needs to be cleaned again. 
Time to get my son ready for pre k. I struggle to get him to sit still to dress him, but always finally manage. I set the kids up with the tablet again and go into he bathroom where I put on some makeup, take my robe off and take a few provocative photos. I send them to my partner on his way to work. Sometimes I receive a smiley face. Sometimes nothing. This morning I was lucky to have a smiley in my message box. Still no satisfaction in my heart. I own my life. 
I put on my leggings and a sweater and walk out to check on the kids. Theyre quiet and into their show. I pick up my youngest and take her up stairs to the mother in law suite where my mother is staying so she can watch her while I take my son to school. I almost have to throw him over my shoulder to get him in the ride cart behind my bike. Its 24 degrees, so hes bundled in winter gear and warm blanket I just pulled from the dryer. My partner has more than enough money for another car, but he bought me a bike and cart instead for the kids and I. I'm a strong woman, and made for the cold he says. A rare compliment I suppose. I own my life. 
I ride my son to school, who loves the rides every morning and evening. Give him a big hug and kiss at drop off and wave him off to the teacher. I have 10 minutes to ride back with my headphones on with more inspirational music and motivations. I put myself back in my ""happy"" place. That's what I'm good at, I'm good at being happy on top of whatever this dark hole is in my chest. Trying to be at least. I pull into the drive way and park my ""car"". I walk up the the porch and look at all the leaves I have to rake this week yet, sign and take a seat on the first step. I look out on the rivers edge at the edge of our yard and watch a gaggle of geese slipping into the cold water. I let out my last sigh of the morning and go up stairs to fetch my daughter. My phone dings, my partner texted me - ""Don't forget to water my plants and I need you to change the oil in the car tomorrow"", I reply with ""okay"". 




From the time I wake up to the time I go to bed the majority of the day is focused on everyone else. No one talks to me unless they need something or I'm being scolded at. 

I dont get adult affection except a random call from my mother here and there, and those who understand from experience know that a childs love is amazing but it's not the same as an adults conscious love and attention. I havent been out with a friend in about 4 years, and now I at this point I know I dont have any friends to call and just talk with. My realtionship is well... I might as well be a house maid and child surrogate.

1025,aftermix_xs,1606126363,1,"WARNING: this post is pretty long

so i made a post on here a while ago about enjoying feeling sad. if you wanna read that, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/jv608n/i_think_i_like_being_sad/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) lol. anyways, for the past 5 years (this includes high school) ive almost completely shut myself down socially. living wasn't/ isn't great. after being accepted into the high school of my choice, we were required to go there for a ""bridge"" program during the last few months of 8th grade and the summer of the same year so we get used to the school and what its like. 

partly because i was just tired from regular school, i used to just sleep when i got there and didnt really talk to anyone. it actually felt really good to have some ""peace"", even though it wasnt literally quiet all the time, away from home and regular school. my parents aren't very extreme but my mom is like an expert gaslighter and likes to justify how she emotionally treats me sometimes with how she grew up. anyways, it wasn't terrible non stop abuse where i needed to run away, but over the years it's mentally and emotionally worn me down. 

throughout high school and even now, im pretty reserved and introverted and i struggle with a lot of social anxiety. even though i know/knew high school wasn't like its shown on tv, it felt extra shitty because i constantly felt like i didn't belong (even though ive made a couple of casual friends). the entire four years felt like a waste of time and even more strain on my mental.

over these past years ive been questioning my sexuality and i guess im bi ? i don't know. i feel physically and emotionally attracted to men and emotionally attracted to women. for some reason, i just don't see myself dating any girls and actually enjoying it because i feel like ill end up making the relationship about me unintentionally. even though ive never dated anyone before, i still feel this way.  

my parents aren't very accepting, so im definitely not telling them how i feel. with the pandemic, i feel even worse and i dont know if ill ever get over my social anxiety to actually date around irl. i dont mind doing it online but im also afraid of rejection because of trauma. even though i struggle with depression and a lot of apathy issues, i dont really take criticism well and it makes me feel even shittier about myself(yes i know its part of life). i think im willing to experiement with guys first because it just feels like it'll go a lot smoother than with a girl. but im also afraid that it will be a sort of gay awakening (please dont read this the wrong way im not trying to sound homophobic or anything). and having my parents find out while i still live with them will make it worse. 

with that said, these feeling are periodic for me and are random i guess. i go about my day with zero emotion, but once im alone with my thoughts(even during the middle of the day), i just have a deep sad feeling and it sometimes make me want to cry but i just don't have it in me. i wish i could though, i bet it would be nice. but i also enjoy this feeling because its the only feeling that has stayed with me for an extended period of time and is genuine. 

TW; if anyone is worried about self harm, yes i have done it before when i was having some rough months a couple years ago. i started cutting, nothing deep too leave scars. i enjoyed it at first but after a while it just became pointless. im also not that suicidal either even though ive thought about it before.  

apologies for the long post i just wanted to vent a little while i ruin my sleep schedule. im not really looking for advice here, i just wanted to get this out of my head and onto something. ironically i have trouble organizing these kinds of thoughts and i don't even remember specific events of trauma growing up. the only things i really remember are feeling emotionally oblivous to my suroundings and sometimes sad and then all those feelings finally clicking around the end of 8th grade. thanks for reading if you made it this far lol.",lonely,once again im thinking about life,2020-11-23 21:12:43

Anyway, Hei!

Like most of you I'm lonely as shit and feel like I've never had any true best friends. Idk maybe it sound childish but i truly want to find that one special person who i just vibe with perfectly, someone who i can talk to about anything and feel like we truly care for one another.

So if youre also looking for a meaningful friendship (im not looking for a romantic relationship at all please respect that) then pm me and lets become besties!  


A little about me, im a 20 year old woman from estonia (i dont care about your gender, sexuality or race, all humans and funky creatures are welcome). I'm a printmaking student working on my degree as well as trying to build a career in the field of arts. I have a dog Minni who I love a lot, she is a yellow lab and adores cuddles. Besides art i also enjoy playing vide games (which would be awesome if we could play something together) on both pc and ps4, caping and hiking, scary movies (lets watch some together!), reading and just chilling. I'm not sure what else to put here so if you found my post interesting let me know and we can get to know each other more :))

 I struggle to understand myself and others, crying myself in the evening before I calm myself to sleep. 
As I open myself the dam that holds the tearfulness of misery never cracks open, only endeavoring the understanding of my thoughts that my feelings are more suppressed and only truly putting myself down activates the message in the bottle to be finally be read and explain the fearful thoughts and worrisome idealistic views.
I ache for acknowledgment and envy love, true deep love not just from others but from myself. 
The type of love that not only is said or just shown, but the one that is felt, the type that gives off the goosebumps and tears of being alive (joy). 
I work on loving myself but it’s hard to know love can easily be manipulated by thoughts. 
Everything I thought I’d be, ponders on what if this something is too far behind to see.

The funny thing is, I worked on myself so hard, I am 100% confident and happy with myself, barely have insecurities. 

But this lead to me discovering how weird of a person I truly am.  
I am 19M and way too mature for my age, I feel 35. 

I am into all sorts of weird shit, and my thoughts are super weird and morbid, which I am comfortable with, we're humans.

I had a weird childhood, yes different types of trauma which I overcame, but made me too mature and stoic.

I've seen and experienced a lot of fucked up shit, which made me an optimistic nihilist sort of thing, turned me to atheism.

These made me extremely introverted.

I see relationships from HS and people my age as incredibly unsophisticated and simple, too immature. They are essentially all simple minded and the same people, blonde popular surfer guys dating the hot and popular girls, the try hard 'alt girls' and the 'emo dudes'... Lol.

Overcoming all odds and becoming so comfortable with myself made me extroverted, especially I purposely forced myself to talk to people and seek out social events with others. 

I went from 64kg to 76kg shredded, I'm a scary looking body builder guy. This gave me high levels of confidence and discipline, also made me way more extroverted and respected.

Having ADHD, anxiety also makes me insanely hyperactive, also made me even more extroverted.

But I'm still fkn weird that not a lot of people get truly close to me, especially the opposite gender.

I have a female best friend, really cool, but she's too immature for me, always out to shop and eat out with friends, complaining about boy issues.... I am too stoic and mature to date her, I feel like her dad sometimes.

Fitting in crowds is not possible, I'm weird, in my own fkn league, no one my age is similar to me.

There is so much more things that are more specific that makes me so weird.

I am a lone wolf, I like it this way.

But one thing bothers me badly, being lonely, since everyone is dating, all my friends, being 'players', relationships etc... I never really had the intimacy. Making out with a few girls at parties felt like kissing a donkey's ass. 

As a human, a social creature, I naturally feel extremely lonely, it's been torturing me since year 8....

I'm too much of a weirdo and unique (not trying to be cocky) to find anyone matchable? I'll keep trying though, now that school's out....

1063,Bio_Dex,1606104232,1,"About 5 years ago, I finally made a friends who actually wanted to spend time with me. We used to play gta a lot and it gradually got to us playing and chatting daily. It was like that for about two years where her ex came back into her life. (let's call her E) Slowly, she's been distancing yourself (cuz well, relationships I guess) and well, I feel like I'm not on her mind anymore. 3 years later, I started trying to chat with other ppl to see if they'd want to chat and for the most part, involved getting ghosted, left on read or just straight up been told ""you're too boring"". Ending talking to a girl, things went well at first, but she said she ""liked me"" but I didn't feel like she really did. She was a pretty toxic person to begin with and with the anxiety, depression and insecurities I have, I know someone like her would only add fuel to the fire. Needless to say, things didn't end well when I said no to her.

Now we have last year when I actually met some good ppl. One girl I met shared a lot in common with, things were never awkward and she seemed like an extremely good person overall (she'll go by B). Another was a little on the wild side but I still feel like she was good nevertheless (she'll be C). I've spent the most time talking with B since she seemed interested in talking, where as C after a while started to become distant. B ended up confessing that she felt like she was developing feeling for me but the thing was that she's Muslim and that she wouldn't have been able to be with me in the end without either of us having to sacrifice something important. E is basically off the grid but comes back every so often to play (not even talk any more outside of gaming), mainly spending time with her bf, C is having trouble with relationships and would always talk about her bad her exs were and how she would feel like it was her fault. Basically, she would mainly rant about things, either her or her ex('s). Although me and B weren't able to be together, we still overall chatted and she would flirt a lot with things she wished we could do if we're ever possible.

Now, in the present day, E' s boyfriend moved in with her and now I feel like I'm tossed to the side. I would message her, asking how are things or if she wants to play or just chat. Literally anything, but I would either take her days to respond or I'd get left on read (with is usually the case). C has gotten better with one of her toxic ex's (yes, I've tried to convince her otherwise Cuz I know he'll just end up hurting her again. he cheated, she got mad, but is still with the guy). The same thing happens with her, either on read or days without a response. B's situation has gotten a bit more complicated (family/religion wise) and is not able to talk at all. I'd be lucky if we'd get to chat for maybe once a week but usually it's once every two weeks and not for long. She says she has to keep chatting a secret because of her parents being strict and all (which, I believe after about a year of talking to). Anyways, whenever I do get a message from them, I'm always the one to always respond as quick as I can Cuz I'm lonely and want ppl to talk to me, and because I believe that ppl should treat how they want to be treated (so much for me in that instance), but whenever I respond back, I don't get any respond for maybe a few hours (even thou they were just on thekr phones). I get so upset and I feel so desperate to have them want to talk to me and I hate that I always respond quickly knowing that they won't say anything for a while but I still always do it... Sometimes I just think, ""am I really that boring to you"" or ""do they really care /remember me"" or ""are they just giving me pity"" and I just want to stay in bed and never want to do anything. I feel like crap cuz I also think ""maybe they're just busy"" or ""they really forget to reply"" or ""even if they did leave, I'll treasure our memories"" or some bs like that to help me feel better... But deep down I know, things aren't the same anymore between me and any of them...

I'm sorry if you've stayed this long for just a stupid rant like this. Honestly... I was debating whether or not to post something like this for a while, cuz it feels like I'm trying to draw attention (as if they would ever read this and know it's me) but fk me... Why do things always have to be this way...",lonely,M22 Not on their minds anymore. (Rant),2020-11-23 15:03:52

So in short, I’m lonely as hell. I’m not close to anyone at all. My family is very distant and they all have their other relationships to tend to. I just recently had a “friendship breakup” with the 1 person I thought was gonna be in my life forever but nah. Turns out she was fake too. So now it’s literally just me and my dogs. I have undiagnosed social anxiety and diagnosed depression and anxiety. 

I have been single for 2 years now. I’ve only ever been in two 2+ year relationships. And I live alone currently. 
I have tried the stupid dating apps and none of them have led me to anything good. Met up with like 3 guys and went on one date with each of them and either I ghost them or they ghost me. It’s become a cycle now. 

It makes me really sad to wake up to a blank screen on my phone. No texts, just the usual “phone is fully charged”. But I know I’m the problem. I push people away when I crave affection, but my brain tells me I’m too scared to go out and get it. I just feel like there’s no light at the end of this tunnel.

1088,Limute,1606096262,1,"Well to begin, I feel alone. But not in the typical sense. I feel like no one understands me and that even I don’t know who I am really. I want to be confident in who I am but also I feel like I’m just imitating what I used to be or what I used to wanted to be. I’ve grown as a person but I don’t know if it’s any better. I’ve seen things I wish I never had and I’ve experienced things that I never thought would happen. It’s made me more pessimistic and hateful. I used to feel like these feelings were never a good thing when I saw them portrayed in media and also with real life people but now I’ve become a part of that. I wanted to be a hero. I always did. I wished to be taken away from this shitty world and live out a fairytale life. The games I played, the movies I watched, the stories I read. They all seemed so much more cooler and simpler than our world. Their was always a bad guy and you could be the good guy. And I tired to live my life like I was one of the good guys. But the bad guys in my world don’t really exist. Well at least not in the way i imagined. I pictured my moms bf as a bad guy and drug dealers in general as bad guys and even to a certain extant the people that did drugs as the bad guys. But I’ve learned that there’s more to that side than bad. I’ve realized that anyone can be “bad”. No matter how hard you try, you’ll end up being bad to someone. The cliche you can’t please everyone exists in tottality. Even the people you please can end up being unhappy in the same moment. Understanding another person is something that I don’t think I can ever fully grasp. Like to understand someone, what does that really mean? To know what they would do in a hypothetical situation? To expect them to be a certain way? To know what makes them unhappy and happy? To believe what they say as how they feel? I don’t know. I don’t know anyone. I feel like I know names and faces and we’ve even been together for years. But we live isolated lives. Even when you think you’re sharing a life with someone, they could be taking a different perspective than you and seeing the same things you see but have a different opinion. People are different and of course they are going to think different. But if they think different from you how can you then claim to know them? You know of them, but you don’t know them. Only an individual can truly know someone and that person is themself. People can be best friends for years and years and years and never realize that a big part of there life is never shared with the other. And that’s okay, because that’s how our world is. We like to keep things to ourselves and be selfish when we can. I’ve tried understanding those close to me but I’ve never gotten there. A meaningful relationship should be cherished but I feel like I want to throw them all away. I’m unhappy with my life and I want to change these feelings I have for my loved ones. I can’t stand being around some of them to the point where I avoid them completely. Partly because of that and partly because I may have a gaming addiction. To trust is to be let down. You have to do the important things yourself otherwise they’ll never happen. I trust myself and I know that when I want something really badly, I’ll work towards it no matter what. My problem is I don’t have real goals. I’m living day to day and they all blend together. I don’t know what I want out of life… other than to feel connected to a person.

1109,soapy_diamond,1606088008,1,"I moved to a new town right after finishing school, to start over and find some people to spend my life with. It wasn’t easy coming here on my own, but I’ve been far more open and adventurous ever since.  I actually started talking, I try to meet all kinds of people, I sometimes leave the house to go places other than university ...

And I came to notice how beautiful it can be to be social. I keep falling in love over and over again. Often with people I barely know, because their instant trust and stories and character just astound me. 

Then I think about how I would love to be friends with them. I make stupid wishes to befriend someone before I go to sleep and hope to meet them in the hallway the next day. Most of the time that doesn‘t happen. Sometimes I dare to message them, sometimes they even reply. Most of the time I just wish and wait.

When we talk, it‘s always meaningful and interesting and very friendly. But in the end I always walk home alone, crying and shaking because I‘m not used to having these connections anymore and it‘s so intense. It‘s beautiful to talk to them, but at the same time I know that weeks will go by until we even meet again and it probably means nothing to them.

I’ve lived here for 2 years and have made 1 friend. I hope I can keep her and maybe talk more regularly to some other people.",lonely,"Always feeling this excitement of being soo close to a change, but the change never comes.",2020-11-23 10:33:28

1112,friendlessandboring,1606084284,1,"I was chilling on the forever alone discord when I listened in on a conversation between a regular member and a new guy. Basically, they were just talking about how they only browse these subs because it makes them feel better about themselves and how pathetic the people who posts there are. One of these guys is a regular on the discord server btw, has a role, favored by the mods and everything.

Now, this is just one example and I should ignore it right? Well, I don't feel like this is an isolated problem. This is a problem across all these subreddits dedicated for people with a low social standing.

I feel like this problem usually occurs when groups are too open minded about who they let in. You just start letting in people who are on completely different levels to you and the social dynamic is completely one sided.

Do you know why the ghosting rate is so high on these forums? Because more often than not, one party is just in here temporarily while the other is desperate for a real connection. This is why I exclusively try to build connections with people who are friendless and not in relationships (preferably never been in a relationship). Sorry if I'm picky for wanting to associate with people who actually go through my experiences and understand me, I just find the reverse plagued with problems.

I can’t be with in a relationship, I can’t have a deep friendship. Right now I might be at my lowest and I’m the only one who can climb from this hole.
What bothers me the most is knowing that even when I endure all this sh*t I won’t be able to enjoy a relationship, not because I can’t find a partner to be with but rather because I’ve never found the psychological fortitude to keep one.
I think I might not be suitable to be with someone, I’ve tried in the past but the anxiety and the burden I put myself is just too much for me. At this point, I believe it’s better to avoid being in a relationship so I don’t have to hurt anyone.

hi, i just turned 14 and i need some advice. i run a tiktok account that posts broadway bootlegs, and it’s gained a bit of following. i met this girl when she started commenting really funny things on my posts. we both have a crush on the same broadway actress and we decided to start a tiktok account together dedicated to the actress (sophia anne caruso, if it matters). so we started chatting through email at first, nothing suspicious, and she sent pictures of herself to prove she was who she said she was (i did too) eventually we started talking on whatsapp and became really close. like we share everything with each other. she’s really geniune and sweet, and we have so many similarities and i really trust her. she’s done everything i asked to prove that she’s trustworthy (sending a video of her dabbing, giving me her main tiktok account, and shes told me so many personal things idk how she could be an imposter) i trust her almost completely. now we want to send each other christmas gifts (hamilton themed friendship bracelets). she’s already given me her address, so should i give her mine?? please advise. i want to be sure i’m not being screwed over.",lonely,should i trust my online friend??,2020-11-23 02:16:24

1175,not-myactualname,1606043277,1,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here.
I'm looking for some friends (if female even more, with some time) who share my same passions.
I am passionate about physics and I think I will end up studying it at university, besides I like sciences and I study each subject that interests me individually.
Both math and physics are two subjects that I love and it is an interest that I look for in a person (since not many have them).
I love writing, poetry and prose (in my language, Italian) and I try to read as much as possible.
I am interested in art (impressionism and post-impressionism) and music (for a few years I played the violin but now I have stopped).
As you can see I have many passions, but I hide a thousand others!
And if someone wanted to study with me I would not hold back, even if I do not think, for now, I will be able to ""hold"" the voice chat being of a particularly shy and introverted nature.
I am a very private person (and often considered boring or too serious) but who if he is in the right environment can burst energy from all pores and who opens up quickly with people with whom he is intended.
With the right person I can talk for hours on each topic, but I love complexity.
I'm Italian, , thin (~66Kg) over 6ft. (~186-88cm) and I love irony and black humor (not always but often).

1181,JasonG320,1606035598,1,"I came from a very strict family that I left 3 months ago. My father was (is) a pediatrician and had extremely strict rules and guidelines on what to do. Both parents were (are) hyper controlling and never allowed me any personal space. I had(have) 9 other siblings, a total of 12 people including parents, all biological. They homeschooled me in a small town, in a large, fairly nice home, as my father was a doctor. But the problem is we never we’re allowed to leave or do anything. This made the generally nice home, a glorified prison. They were highly religious and made us study the Bible nearly 2 hours a morning and around the same amount at night, mandatory. This and homeschool caused no time for anything else outside the house. We also were made to do chores every day such as watch our younger siblings/do laundry/make meals/clean the house(I believe my father had a sense of ocd because the standard of clean was entirely unnecessary and took multiple hours to maintain ever day, with punishments for anything out of place). I never had the opportunity to meet/make friends for myself or do anything online, as they also cracked down hard on the internet/online. Using lots of parental control software to block everything but 3-5 school websites, and only accessible during a few hours a day. 

I hated it so much, that at 16 I finally decided to leave and made a plan to early January. I followed through with the plan even though the worldwide pandemic caused a few months delayed than my previous aim time. My plan involved getting my GED, setting up my own bank account, and saving up a bit of money. My goal was to leave. I didn’t really care what else happened as I was extremely suicidal and just wanted to try something else. Which bring me to where I am now. Things aren’t too bad at the moment, I have a few dreams and ambitions, but am so chronically lonely nothing really seems like it matters. I guess I should blame the pandemic for some of the loneliness, but I feel like I’m not doing everything I can and need advice on how to make friends. I’ve never had anyone close, except maybe my brother but he left for college when I was 15 and I cut off all my family to try and forget everything. 

I want to move on and I believe making new friends and relationships is the path to do that, but I don’t know where to meet anyone. I have a computer and phone now that I bought for myself, but I don’t have any social media or contacts in my phone as I never knew anyone.

1185,IvyRedRoses,1606031846,1,"Being lonely has not been new to me. I’ve always tended to be alone. Sure, there’s been a few friends along the way, but for the majority of my life I lived on a school/work autopilot. At first that didn’t bother me too much, as others were simply classmates, acquaintances or coworkers that were just people I saw frequently. As I got older, the lack of a social life really sunk in. Despite my best efforts, I never got invited to anything, no fun events or dates. At some point I decided to just stick to my classes and my jobs and figure the rest out later. It was numbing and cold. My self esteem was hitting bottom and I was getting more and more miserable. I felt like I was a burden on others just by being around and it eventually got to where I didn’t want to live anymore.

Fast forward through a lot of hard years and multiple self discoveries, I came out as bi, and later as transgender. The latter was life changing. I was discovering friends again, immersing myself into a welcoming community of people from every kind of background. My mood and self worth was greatly improved from those dark days of before. 

That was last year.

This year was the first year I started living publicly as myself for the first time, full time. As the pandemic started, my transition was and still is my motivation to keep going. But as time has went on, those old feelings of loneliness are starting to creep back. Just as I was coming back to life, just as things were getting better, I’m back to staying inside, doing my job alone just like before. 

I’ve started grieving for all the time I lost when I was younger. Now I’m stuck in this wake/work/sleep routine again “until things are back to normal”. Maybe its the hormones but being alone feels like a death sentence. I find myself craving closeness, friendship and intimacy but have found none. I started online dating and *nothing* has came from it except disappointment and empty inboxes. Now all I can think about is how long can I last with being alone, and will I ever find a way out?

Like I just kept giving but never received anything beneficial except the satisfaction of helping someone.  

Holidays have been very difficult for me these past few years, and with Thanksgiving coming up I'm struggling to keep myself together. My family has completely fallen apart due to religious differences. I've tried reaching out to my grandparents a couple times but I never heard back from them. I never really had any strong relationship with any of my aunts, uncles, or cousins. The only real enjoyable social interactions I remember having are with my family on holidays, and those are gone forever. 

My partner and I moved to the opposite end of the country last year for a great business opportunity. I figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal. I didn't have anything tying me to my hometown. My partner is wonderful, but we're both struggling with our mental health right now. I'm stuck in a strange city, during a lockdown. He's been spending a lot of time playing games online with his friends from back home or sleeping. We have 2 housemates that have a lot of friends, they are currently downstairs laughing and playing games at their ""Friendsgiving"". I'm uncomfortable with social gatherings in general, but during a pandemic - absolutely no thank you. My partner has been sleeping all day. I'm just sitting in bed next to him, crying. I feel so alone. I'm so empty. I've been trying to be supportive of his mental health since he's had to start working from home. I just don't think I can hold it together much longer. 

My whole life I've always felt like I didn't have anyone I could open up to. I've always been terrified of being seen as a burden. I never want anyone to feel like they have to worry about me. I feel like I should try to talk to a professional, but what is that really going to do? How is talking really going to help anything?  

Most of the time I want to be alone, so it's fine. But occasionally I just really want to feel like I have a support system. I just want to know that I have a group of people that care about me no matter what. I don't really know what that's like.

I'm a little intoxicated, so I'm sorry if there's grammatical errors or none of this makes sense, but I need to get this out there in case I forget it after the coming hangover and while it makes sense.


I just realized that the reason no one would want to be with me is because I'm inadequate. But, that's not nearly all. People tend to be put off by people who feel they are inadequate, so my feeling inadequate is one of my inadequacies. So the natural thing is to stop feeling inadequate, but, the beauty of it is that the fact I've never dated anyone or had anyone interested in me justifies my feelings of inadequacy, leading me to continue to feel inadequate, which in turn makes people less likely to want to date me, which justifies my feelings of inadequacy, so on and so on. On the off chance that someone for some reason finds me even intriguing I think so little of myself that I'll never believe they are intrigued by me and will interpret their interest and/or signs as something purely platonic.


Adding on to this elegant web of pain, the primary thing I want out of a relationship is for a woman to look me in the eyes with nothing but love and affection, but I don't see why anyone would do that with me, so even if I was in a relationship my primary wish will never be fulfilled because even in the billionth of a chance that that happens I won't be able to understand it and will likely just be like, ""Do I have something in my eye?"".

1218,MollyElizbeth,1606012633,1,"The pandemic is making me more lonely than I have ever been in my whole life, and I've never had friends.

I had a friend...she was my best friend, and she got divorced and needed a place to live, so I bought a duplex and let her rent half of it while my husband and I live in the other half.  She isn't my friend anymore...she changed a lot after her divorce, and the pandemic, and her new husband...she treats me badly, takes advantage of my help, and doesn't truly care about me.

I work from home and go to school at ASU online full time.  Her and her new husband work outside the house and when school is closed (most of the time now) my husband and I have to do the e-learning with her 4 kids.  Even when school is open to in person classes, one of the kids prefers the e-learning so she is always here.  I am usually too busy to realize how lonely I am.  Every weekend I notice it a little bit, but I always have school to focus on.  

With the holiday coming up, I took off a week from work, and my class is almost over and there is nothing until after the holiday.  I am already bored and lonely.  My husband plays DnD with his friends every Saturday (online).  So....I am sitting in my office...well, glorified closet I put my laptop in.  Even when he isn't playing DnD, he likes to hang out with the kids and I find children annoying for the most part.  I don't enjoy doing things with them, I don't hate it, but it is like work for me.

All I do is work, school, or kids.  Today was my moms birthday, and I forgot.  My mom and I have a hard relationship.  She didn't have time for me as a kid, and I raised my sister.  Who doesn't like me now.  

No one ever asks how I am.  No one wants to be with me.  I have 1 person I talk to, a coworker who lives in a different state.  That's not much though.

Doing this has made me reflect back on all of the other “flings” I had in the past. I call them such because they were never real relationships and never public. Mostly because they never wanted to claim me or take me out in public on real dates.

I realized that although I’d been intimate with a few guys, I hadn’t felt been hugged in five years.

It seems that being lonely makes you cling to any type of affection, no matter how insincere it is. It’s because you feel like those moments are few and far between so you have no choice but to take what you can get. It turns into a vicious cycle.

one way to combat my loneliness is recording voice memos to have a space to just let out my emotions but sometimes my conversations burst into moments of song. i suppose it’s a way to release my (lack of a better word) energy? i feel foolish in thinking i’m the only one who does this — so here to ask the folks of reddit.",lonely,In your extreme moments of loneliness do you ever break out in song?,2020-11-22 10:50:53

1242,MeanYeti,1606002108,1,"Growing up I was always told how much ""better"" things get as you get older. When I was in middle school it was ""Wait until high school, things get so much better!"" then it was ""Wait until college, your life will really turn around!!"" and now that I'm finally fucking here all I get is ""Wait until after college, you get a lot more freedom then!!!!!!!111"" When the fuck does it actually get better? I've spent all of this time trying to improve myself and anticipating the future only to end up in a worse spot than I was two years ago. I'm living in a shittier neighborhood, attending a shitty community college while I'm not even sure what my major is, while I've lost contact with everyone I knew from high school almost immediately after I graduated.

And this pandemic shit doesn't help either. Now instead of attending a shitty community college, I'm attending a shitty virtual community college! Not that it really matters anyways, since it's still the dreaded social desert known as community college. What a waste of time.

What exactly am I supposed to be doing, anyways? I have no money, no connections, the economy is in the toilet and I cant find a job, and even if I did I would still need to drive 30 minutes to it with the license I don't have since my mom had no choice but to move out here in bumfuck nowhere hickville where anything worth a damn requires a half a tank of gas.

What a load of wasted potential. I'm 18, this is when things are finally supposed to be looking up for me. I see other people my age going to university and while they're still impacted by the pandemic, they're still able to do SOMETHING. They have the ability to meet people, do SOMETHING with their lives other than sulking around writing 1700 characters on r/lonely. Instead I'm here still with no drive, no goals, barely any hobbies, and worst of all, no friends. Oh well.

I was raised to never hit a girl.When I was in school was the one who didn't have friends, but also helped everyone out with relationship advice and counseling ( we didn't have a counselor at school). I was the one that if I see a dude trying to get a little too friendly with a girl after she obviously didn't want to have any interaction with them I would walk up and probably bash his head against a locker then drag him to the nurse ( also my duty to do after someone gets into a fight). Yes obviously I got in detention a lot but that was better then doing nothing. I can't stand to see someone get hurt so I help as best as I can. If someone is thinking of giving up on relationships and would ask my advice for a relationship, MY Advice is... Still look for a relationship, but they take time, it's better to be friends first and relationship after rather than the other way around. Make friends but be cautious about who you hang around. If you plan on going to someones home either go with someone else also or let someone know and get them to call you after a few minutes of being there. Now you don't have to follow my advice but at least take it under consideration.
    I don't really have friend because they cause too much drama for my already over the top drama family and I am always a loner when I am at a gathering or social event because I don't like to talk to people. Now does someone have advice to give to a person who usually gives advice ?

I feel like Corona, lately political decisions and other bad stuff spread hate in our world. People become more and more selfish. In times like those we need to stick together. Be there for people we love and people who are in need. Don’t you agree?

&amp;#x200B;

So I created an Instagram Account where I want to share YOUR life story. If you have a nice story or a story that is not so nice but you want people to tell so that they can learn from your mistakes or people listening to you and trying to help, just hit me up there.

&amp;#x200B;

\[redditorsstories\]([https://instagram.com/redditorsstories?r=nametag](https://instagram.com/redditorsstories?r=nametag))

I totally don’t have the intention to monetize the channel, the only thing I want to achieve with that is more people helping each other a lot of people are suffering from loneliness. It is proven that loneliness can cause physical issues and in those times we should be there for each other. We or the most people might not be able to help others by spending money but we ALL can spread kindness and love ❤️.

1286,SirLancelhot,1605975556,1,"So, 2 months ago i ended my friendship with my best friend who is friend with me over 5 years. I'm 22(M) years old btw. Then last week i left my parents home. I was there because of the pandemic. Now, im alone in this city. No friend, no family , no job. Trying to graduate from university, but im not sure if I'll found any jobs in the future. Before i leave home my family was covering my expenses, now i leaved them and stop taking any money from them. Because they don't let me even breathe. I had blocked nearly all my family, except my big brother and his wife, they were always nice to me and they have 2 lovely child. My nieces, i think i love them more than anything in this world. You should see them, when they see me in the phone, they're starting to smile and always want to talk with me. 2 days ago it was birthday of my older niece whom becoming 4 years old and i couldn't go to celebrate because they live with my parents. Young one 11 months old, next month is her birthday and i can't go to celebrate neither. I have a little bit saving. Comed from an insurance company, after a big car crash. I can graduate by myself, but i don't know what to do in future. Btw im using big doses of antidepressants which they don't do nothing at all. I can't even go to the doctor regularly to make progress on my treatment. State gives free healthcare, but I did go to 11 psychiatrists over 4 years and they couldn't find anything and just prescribe me more and more drugs. And the private hospitals are really expensive to my budget, nearly my monthly rent. I just went one time when i was suicidal. Again everything starts to lose their meanings in my head. I don't know what to do. I just wanted to share here with sincerity. Thanks for reading my fucked up situation, if there's anyone.

1298,Vanessa1090,1605959414,1,"

I’m worried I’m going to end up alone for the rest of my life, I don’t mind being alone right now while I’m young but the thought of being alone in old age has started to keep me up at night. 

I always thought I’d have a family of my own but that looks like it’s not going to happen for me at this rate.  I’m 25, single, virgin with no experience and I’m working on my career and other goals I have right now but I don’t have all the time in the world to have a my own children especially as a woman. I’ve never wanted kids for selfish reasons like to not be alone but I always wanted to have that family experience, to be a mother because I’ve always had those motherly instincts. 

I probably won’t be able to even try dating for a good long time due to covid and I wouldn’t want to risk it either right now. I’ve been on a few dates before and all extremely unsuccessful. I feel like it so easy for other people, they meet the love of their life at 22 without even trying and spend 50 years together. How? Now I feel like with covid im being held back even more. 

I have one friend and she is really more of a friendly acquaintance and that is it. I just realised that I do everything alone and I’m starting to hurt because of it.  I’m fine doing things alone now and then and I’m fine being in my own company but when you have no one to talk about your day or talk about things your excited about it hurts. It’s not like I am not trying to make friends I really am but trying to make friend as an adult is extremely hard and people always seem to be too busy for you these days.

I have 5 contacts in my phone and two of them are dead...

My uncles, aunts, parents all dead, cousins live half way around the world and I have no one else in my life. I’m so afraid of being alone when I’m old, I can handle it now but the thought of being old and alone scares the shit out of me, I’d honestly off myself if things got so bad for me in old age. 

I used to think that when I got old I would still have the love of my life beside me making tea and biscuits, sewing scarfs for my grandkids and watching our grandkids play in the grass, then eventually dying in my warm bed with loved one all around me. But now it looks like I’ll be alone ending up putting myself into a nursing home and then like 4 people showing up at my funeral. 

What’s life without people and love? I know some people are more focused on their career and that’s fine and I also want to pursue other dreams I have first before I’d ever have a family but I feel like I’m running out of time to pursue both my goals as well settle down and build meaningful relationships. 

I miss my parents so much and they were my best friends but then they were gone one day forever, every night I go home to a small cold apartment and zero text messages on my phone, I can’t live like this anymore. No one prepares you for adult life, one minute you have your parents who would do anything for you and then one day your out there all alone with no one looking out for you.

I don’t know what I’m asking here other than putting this out there that I’m scared and lonely and needing to get this out somewhere.",lonely,I’m afraid I’ll end up alone in old age and it scares the shit out of me.,2020-11-21 22:50:14

Hello 👋

So this past Saturday my fiancé broke it off with me.  She wrote me a letter that outlined good things, and negative things that contributed to her breaking it off.  Obviously I am crushed beyond belief, and it’s hard to really think logically right now.  These negative things were not unfixable, but definitely could of benefited from couples therapy.  The hardest part is going to be when I sit my daughter down and explain that Jane is no longer with us anymore.  I just would like some quality advice on how to cope, and someday heal from this.  The thought of her meeting someone else down the road makes me almost nauseous.  It’s still hard to register that all of what we worked for is no longer there.  Especially since I was very close to her family, and my daughter looked up to her as step mom, we had a wedding planned out next year, we got engagement tattoos on our ring hands, well you get the point.  Also next month we were suppose to move in together when her lease was up, and I would sell my house.  But now I’m staying in the house, and she moves to who knows where now? That’s really bugging me as well.  Thank you for considerations.

I can’t imagine my daily life without talking and bonding with him, but I can’t help to yearn for more...intimate companionship, I guess? 

Not explicitly sexual. Just someone to hold and dote over and make smile and laugh, to assure I’m there for them and all that in return for me. 

Yet every time I reach out and express interest or show my vulnerability, it seems I get only rejection and at best a potential offer at friendship that eventually gets me ghosted and awkwardly spurned. I feel like I can’t really be interesting to someone, that all these attempts can’t mean I’m coincidentally meeting people at inopportune junctures in their lives, so obviously something has to be wrong with me.

Of course I know I have flaws, some which I berate myself on constantly. But I guess others can see them clearly as well. I try to maintain a decent standing at my job and I’d say I do that well, a good rapport with my coworkers and customers. I treat my family well and love seeing them, as well as my friend. But for romantic endeavors, I guess it’s just not for me. And maybe that’s what makes me so sad, knowing that no matter how much or hard or earnestly I try, I seem to destined for my current lot in life.

I met this guy in January of last year, we really hit it off, and he’s probably the first real friend I’ve ever had. The only problem is that he couldn’t give less of a shit about me. I moved away for school and since then we’ve been texting almost every day and calling once a week, up until 3 weeks ago. I got mad at him over something he posted online that I thought was disrespectful, so I texted him about it and told him I was pissed off. He fixed it immediately, but took 5 days to text me back, and even then I had to send two more texts to get him to answer. He told me he lost his phone (and maybe he did, idk) but apparently he didn’t even think to message me anywhere else, so he was either purposefully ignoring me and lying, or he really just forgot to talk to me for 5 days. We haven’t had a conversation since then, and only a handful of lame fucking texts. I asked if there was something wrong and he says he’s just busy, that all he does is work and sleep, etc, but I know that’s not true because (as far as I know) he has the same workload, plus I’ll see that he’s streaming anywhere from 3-10 hours at a time pretty consistently.

It just really hurts, especially because the last time he video chatted with me he said that he told his friends to wait up for him because calling me was important to him. I guess not anymore lol. It just sucks because I’m always there for him, and if he’s going through something I make sure to check on him and do everything I can to help. He just doesn’t care. The worst part is that I’m still so upset about it. I never thought I’d be the type of person to get depressed over something like this, especially since I’m used to being alone, but as it turns out there’s nothing shittier than having some hope that someone actually cares about you and wants to be around you and then all of a sudden... nope.

I have such a hard time meeting people and making friends that I really, really want this to work. Every time I try to meet someone new it always falls flat. We are (were?) really close too, at least in my mind. It’s really hard for me to come to the realization that, even if things do go back to normal, he just doesn’t care about me.",lonely,This is why I don’t have friends,2020-11-21 15:56:25

1344,hgilbert_01,1605926405,1,"Hi.

I will start by expressing mine; my hobbies and interests revolve around fiction- I watch movies/telveison, play video games, write some fiction (mostly rough ideas), read books, read comic books, and read online information about fictional lore. The pieces of fiction I am in include anything Star Wars, superheroes, sci-fi, and fantasy. Recently, I have been rewatching The Mandalorian Season 1 so I can get refreshed before watching Season 2.

I know I have expressed this numerous times, but as an quiet, introverted individual, I yearn to be able to spend time ""alone, together"" with somebody, doing our own things, but appreciative of each other's presence. I feel like the easiest way I have connected with others in my past is having common interests, which might be materialistic, but it was cool to find a common ground of something that similarily engaged our minds. Like, a dream come true for me would just to be able quietly enjoy something on the television, a video game, or a book without feeling anxious and pressured to make constant, draining conversation.

My parents are nice people and I know they care for me, but we have never had a personal connection where i can open up to them about a lot of things. They are strict and I feel like that made it so I never actually opened up to them.

I have lost virtually all contact with friends during this quarantine. Where I used to talk hours on end and chat for hours more, I now barely speak to any of them.

1365,cassie_to_heart,1605914740,1,"It is the near universal truth in that the few encounters you might meet with people, the rewarding feeling of it being able to transcend into such a connection is something one doesn't want to let go. To be able to experience the rarity of the existence of it, actively nurturing it, there is the sense of catharsis in that one feels visible &amp; recognized to the other person.

Amongst the billions of people in this earth, the semblance of hope have often fluctuated wildly, to periods where I'd be hopeful or the sinking epiphany that in my life I've felt invincible, which would be an apt description of my life experiences, until to this present day.

I have spent my years alone and lonely, without company whom I could trust in earnest for twelve years. I've moved here from the Philippines to Brisbane, Australia back then to start a new life with my family and as a wee child, it was the hope of a better future in a better country.

Ironically, what followed since was the opposite, having a complicated background &amp; upbringing in life.... whilst suffering through mounting crippling depressive episodes. The silver lining, it was during this time where I wouldn't dare say I regretted meeting the few men who I were and are currently close to.

One distinguishing feature about me is how my fondness of sharing stories of men who I have associated in good company are an indicator of how much they mean to me. Some may have left my life, but they have not left my heart altogether. And to type this, I profess I still draw tears with the parting memory of the man I was not meant to be with.

&amp;#x200B;

* **First LDR (June 2020):** A man of integrity, honesty, conviction, and secure in what he wanted, his traits reinforced by his prior military background. He will always hold a special place in my heart despite everything not coming to fruition. A man who accepted my..... physical shortcomings and yet treated me like the woman I deserve to be and should've been born as. I've accepted his demons of post-combat deployment in kind when it came to him confiding me and the open person that I am, I didn't shy away, making the choice to stay. We didn't work out due to differing priorities as he wanted to settle down. I tried to put in both time to stay at home and have a career but it failed altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

* **First Close male friend (August 2020-- present):** Met during my hospital clinicals when I was then doing my Nursing degree. Established a fruitful and great connection ever since, still to this day. A distinguishing feature of him that he once told me: ""*My possessions may be stripped and my bones may be broken, but my last name is what carries weight and of great responsibility -- it's my identity that puts value. On my right side of my chest says U.S. Marines and on the left, over my heart is my last name. I carry it with me everywhere I go everything I do and I don't take the responsibility lightly.""* He would regularly share some amusing and eventful stories, outside and during field ops. From getting a class engaged on the proper usage of explosives to just another crappy day. We keep in close correspondence. To him, he matters much more to me, and perhaps where my love for him transcends more than friendship, more than a relationship altogether, hard to define. All I know is that it would devastate me to the core if I were to lose him *(in the event of enemy fire/ambush)*. I've told him once: ""*I'd imagine I was wearing your dog tags to keep me going in life"".* The one of very few men I've met in my life whom I felt safe, comfortable and whom I could trust, which was nurtured over time. Confiding in him then when I was let go of my Nursing clinicals and asking me to be safe for him. To come to the epiphany, one of the very few people I felt comfortable around, puts holes in people! Right now, he's in a training rotation either looking at the stars from the foxholes or keeping that shemagh wrapped tight on his face with his M240

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, I still have a persisting void of alone and loneliness, like I am destined to be understood by few, perhaps my complexities in traits, personality may be too much to handle. I will say that I have the typical dad and abandonment issues, and a dose of crippling depressive episodes that are the elephant in the room. Worried that if I were to lose the men I care about dearly, no one would understand me in a similar capacity to them.... and that's where my search lies.

To search for a man I could have a *romantic friendship* with, preferably, similar in background/occupation *(i.e. military)*, but any guys working in the field of first responders are welcome. This won't be a competition of any kind and would be someone I am glad to introduce to the company I have. A man who would care for me, be deeply protective of me. For me, it is about the affirmation that I matter, I'm visible and I'm cared for. In turn, I would like to please, make a man feel warm &amp; fuzzy.

I realize that whilst I may not connect to every fellow lonely people here, I can connect to those who are receptive to my desires. And these desires that I have are unwaivering.

I barely speak to anyone at all except family, I know everything isn't about social media but I wish I could wake up to a message, like someone has thought about me. Every time I get a notification it is from some stupid random app I don't use.

I want just one really good friend, one who I can always call, hang out with etc even if it is not a relationship. I don't even know her friends and I can't just invite myself into their group. I don't mind her having new friends at all, but since she has gone to university we barely see each other. I know that friends you meet in school rarely stay your friends, but I'd like to think we are still friends.

Loneliness hurts, I feel it physically and it never goes away, why is it so painful? When I was in school I got bullied for my underbite so I lost friends over something I can't control. More than anything I want to be happy. 

I started university but my course wasn't for me, it was my second choice (in terms of career choice) as my parents didn't like my first choice. I dropped out as I felt so unhappy, some days I couldn't do basic hygiene or cook for myself. When I was there nobody hung out, now I've gone they've just started doing things together so I've missed out on that.

I don't want to be stuck in my room all day, or just hanging out with my parents. A 19 year old adult shouldn't just be hanging out with their parents day in day out, I feel like a child and they suffocate me. They have to know everything, they criticised my old friends, they blame me for everything, they make me feel guilty. 

I have an online friend I met this year and they are so kind, we have the same humour and we understand each other. He never judges me, he is so accepting. But, we can't meet because of my overbearing parents, who would be adamant that I can't meet them as I'd probably think I'd get murdered. There is a difference between being concerned and being obsessive about everything. 

I just want someone to hold me, for a moment I want that pain to go away. Why does it hurt so bad?",lonely,Loneliness physically hurts.,2020-11-21 09:46:57

My college is small so there's not many students to meet, I live with my grandma so the house is usually empty, then this pandemic hit so going out is a no no. Never really did much of it anyways, I consider myself decent socially but for some reason I just can't find the people that actually show interest in befriending me. Just casual school talk.  And let's not even talk about girls... was in a relationship throughout all pf highschool and then we broke up because we couldnt handle long distance ( she moves away for college).

I met my best friend there, I appreciate her so much, but then she met another guy (who apparently was in love with her but we didn’t knew) and they become close too. It was horrible spending time with both of them because I constantly felt ignored and when the guy shared a story he was telling it to her and not to us. Then I would ask them what they were speaking about and my friend would tell me what he was speaking about, not him. It’s like he wanted to avoid me or something. I don’t have lots of friends and everyone is doing their own thing now... the one that I speak the most to is her and sometimes she speaks about how cool he is with me or whatever. I can’t help but to feel weird... like I can’t relate at all to her perception. And when we’re saying our goodbyes she will tell him “I will miss you so much” an I’ll be standing there not saying that to him because I never say anything I  don’t feel. And probably reading this you would think these guys are more than friends. Not at all,  he confessed to me weeks ago that he liked my friend (I was not surprised) and I kept it to myself until my friend told me that she suspected that same thing. she was not pleased and told me she didn’t saw him that way and that she loved him like a brother. wow like a brother... how come I couldn’t love like a brother a “friend” that I spent the same time around as her... it’s so bizarre. It’s like I lived an entire different experience as her. Apparently he doesn’t hate me but his disinterest towards me repulses me. I know that I’m worth more than this and I deserve to be valued as well. I tried approaching him many times and he even laughed at some of my jokes but he still was uninterested in building a stronger friendship with me, I’m not even sure if I can call him a friend... he’s more of an acquaintance the more I think about it and it bothers me... why couldn’t we be a nice friend group where everyone felt included? it wasn’t that hard.",lonely,I hate being the third wheel,2020-11-21 07:22:12

I was always the liner in school though. Didn't get bullied much because I really just didn't exist. I spent my lunch hour sitting in front of my next class waiting for the bell. Sometimes one of the popular girls would invite me to join them out of pity, but it was always clear I wasn't part of the group. Sometimes one of them would latch onto me so I could tutor them or partner them with projects. I always thought we got along so well but then the semester ended and they never talked to me again. 

These days I feel like people will only like me if they can get something from me. But I want to be liked so I try so hard to be useful. I cook, I clean, I do all sorts of favors. In college I actually found a couple friends who like me for me and don't expect anything from me, but I'm still terrified that if I open up too much they won't like me anymore.

After that period, I was actually trying to make things better and somehow managed to get a job, a boyfriend at some point(no, it did not end up well) and was starting to feel a bit better. I even reconnected with 2 of my old friends and we talk sometimes but we no longer live close to each other. 

So everything was going quite well until recently I had a huge fight with someone I really care about and she just told me I should leave her alone and now she is no longer talking to me. I won't go into details but she helped me a lot and it felt like we really understood each other but now it's over because I still can't properly communicate with people and sometimes what I say just comes off as rude or very out of place(I realize how horrible that is and I'm ashamed of it but I do it impulsively) so naturally, she got sick of it.

So now I'm just asking myself if this life is worth it, since all I do is bother any few people that somehow ever wanted to have some kind of connection to me. No one actually cares about me and I really doubt anyone will ever want me for good in their lives, so what is the point?

People who not only loved me but also liked me... who didnt endure me just because I was their flesh and blood. They really understood, and thats all that mattered. I didnt care what anyone said or thought because I had them.
And then they turned 15 and one left.. they turned 16 and some switched schools. In no time they were 18 and we left school.. and they had become adults... but I'm still 14.
We chose different careers. We couldnt meetup everyday.. they had other engagements, they made room for new people in their lives.. they took on new responsibilities that we didn't have as children. And this hurt me.. because I'm still a child. They became less and less relatable. They didn't understand anymore. And that destroyed me.. I couldn't  understand what had happened. I realized that they were the only thing rooting me to happiness and now I was alone.. and sad.
I found it hard to trust anyone anymore, they had disappointed me. I made new friends,  yes, but I often found myself filling silence with questions to keep them from asking me how I was. I have a lot of new friends who I know alot about, who dont know anything about me. So.. I'm Lonely.

I have a pretty diverse and welcoming group of friends and I'm a bit weird, so I feel a tad more comfortable near them, but yet I still feel like an outsider(I'm getting out of touch with them because of distance, what makes me even sadder), and I can't lose this feeling of loneliness like I don't belong anywhere like I don't know what and who I am, the truth is that everyone around me seems so extraterrestrial(i know I'm the weirdo haha).

In the past 3 years, I developed depression and an eating disorder, never told anyone, I don't feel comfortable to tell it to my friends and family, even though it gets really bad sometimes(feels like a rollercoaster that I can't see when is going down). It just feels like there should be something else, reality seems incomplete, and it drives me insane, and I know that this thought is crazy.

I'm not suicidal or anything, just wanted to vent and write some things that have been on my mind for a year now. Should've probably posted on another subreddit, but since I've been a part of this one for long, decided to post here.

1. College &amp; classmates - I'm in college with classmates I don't like. First off, they speak a different language than me (I'm from a different state do that's understandable) , and secondly, a lot of the students are from rural areas and had a different upbringing than I did.  Because of this, i don't have a lot of common topics to talk about and hence don't have a lot of friends, certainly not ones I can rely on. It's been 2.5 years in this college and I have 1.5 more years to go. I got 2 people I talk to sometimes, one is depressed, so whenever we talk, either me or him is freaking sad or dull in conversation. Worst part is, I can't talk much about my mental health to the first guy because he doesn't do emotions well, while the other guy is conservative and immature and doesn't quite understand what I'm trying to say. So there's that.

2. Physical appearance- This point is maybe not something you guys relate to, but I've been fat from the day i was born. About 4 years ago, I made up a goal in my mind to try to reduce weight and be fit by the time I enter college 2 years later. It's been 4.5 years from that time, and I look almost the same. I hate my physical appearance, and because of that my self confidence has suffered. I never had a girlfriend in school, and neither do now. 


3. Family and current situations- Since my childhood, I've seen a lot of family drama and arguments, more than a normal kid should see. Don't get me wrong, my family doesn't have any abusive environment or anything of that sort in the house, it's just that my parents have wayy too many arguments and it creates a confrontational vibe (sorry couldn't find a better word) in the house. 

I'm a single child with no siblings and pets to release stress, I can't talk about mental health to my parents because they don't seem to understand the 'concept'. The other day my dad jokingly told me to have a bath otherwise I'll fall into depression. I was once playing a game on my laptop when he said ""do something else rather than playing video games on laptop"" and then sarcastically added ""oh I forgot that's all you have left to do in life"" and it hurt bad because deep down I know it's the truth.

My mom is more understanding that way and knows more stuff about my life then my father does. She seems to notice at times when I'm sad and lonely, although doesn't talk to me about it.

1513,FriendFucker2000,1605816897,1,"I'm writing this because i feel like there's something odd about me that drives people away and I'd like to know if anyone relates.

Throughout my whole life I've never had anyone call me their best friend, in school i was always the third wheel and i would switch from one group to another to try and fit in but never kinda clicked with anyone. I think the best proof of this is the fact I've never been to a sleepover and never had a seat mate for when we went to field trips and stuff, also i got left out a lot during group projects. 

The thing that's puzzling me is, I've never had trouble talking and i was always nice to everyone, i was probably one of the funnier kids in class and people seemed to like me. Im average looking, and try and talk to a lot of people on the daily - but not to the point im annoying.

Having started highschool i thought things would finally change and I was hoping to form longer lasting friendships. Everything was going well and i thought my classmates liked me. Humor and decency remained my only likeable trait i think. But after not even three weeks i was circled out again.

I found out they're all texting each other and hanging out together.. But without me of course, despite talking to me and joking around every day at school. Its like everyone gets tired of me after a week and decides to stick with someone assumingly better.

I tried to text someone i was texting the first two weeks and they kinda didn't care to open my message, yet they were active in the class group knowing im in it. Its like EVERYONE got a best friend except me. They just clicked and i somehow missed out on bonding with anyone, again.

1544,ChonkyCharley,1605795665,1,"Hi.  I am on this site because I really have no one to talk to and I'd rather not share this with my family because it's honestly such a petty issue.  I love my family to bits and care about them to the moon and back.  I am a very oitgoing guy who is 17, enjoys powerlifting, going for hikes, walks, reading, and metal work.  I am a people person and people lover but can't help having this empty feeling.  I get good grades, and got into a good college, but I just can't seem to find people who give a shit if I exist.  Everyday and Night I spend to myself and evenings with my family.  I guess I'm a bit depressed because I can't find someone who just wants me for me.  I have been used by women and I guess its my fault for not seeing it in the first place and ending relationships before they could get out of hand but I thought that maybe the last girl or the girl before that actually cared about my feelings.  Now I don't need women because I enjoy doing so many things, but have no one to share those passions with.  Because everyone either gets bored of me or leaves me for another guy who they see as ""higher value"".  I just want a woman to watch the stars with, to share feelings with.  Someone who actually cares and reciprocates.  I know those are like diamonds among the rough though.  I guess its not a huge issue but its just something I think about everyday.  I am a good man, but a lot of women I run into at this young age have this mentality like every man only wants what's in their pants.  Which is sad and stupid, but its the truth.  Everytime I think another woman is different they do some stupid shit, so I move on to the next.  Every woman I have run into that showed interest or held feelings for me ended up the same manipulative bitch in the last 4 years.  I have forgotten what real love feels like because there are all these paranoid, insecure women.  And I dont blame them.  I am really alone in terms of loving someone else who loves me just as much, and it makes me sad.  But I do love my family and that's all I care about anymore.  I am a good man. I am.  But no woman sees it.  They see a desperate man.  And I do work on it. but I stopped caring a long time ago.  My family is the only thing that keeps me tied to this green earth any more and god bless their souls.  I have stared down that muzzle too many times to count and everytime I see my family or brother, i stopped myself.  Because I love them and doing that would be the pathetic cowards way out.  Honestly I am a dumbass for even considering that because I have people who love me.  I have a purpose but its so damn lonely. 
I spend nights out of the week.  Crying, because I am so damn happy.  I am happy so that maybe it could help otther people get through their sad days.  Nobody asks me how my days are anymore.  I have grown apart from friends who I've known for about a decade.  I feel like a ghost.  Every day, I put on a good face, a good vibe, because nobody likes a person who is a dubby downer.  I like to be happy, but its getting harder and harder every day.  Like I am suffocating.  Every day I just work and can't wait to go home to my dog, because she loves me.  Because people are so shallow and detached.  Fuck man.  Every body.  Nobody holds a real convo with me and I just cut them off now and look for new people.  I always smile, so no one can see I am hurting.  I just want people to love me, to be happy, so I compensate and conpensate to make them feel better.  Every day its a slate, cold.  I find myself laughing at little things every day just to try to speed up the day so I can sleep myself away from reality.  Nobody knows about this besides you readers.  And I don't want attention because this is something I must get over myself but it helps me when I type this shit out sometimes.  Im just done being used, discarded, taken advantage of, disrepected, bullied.  I used to get bullied for my weak and small size by high schoolers when I was in middle school.  So I lift and lift and lift.  I almost destroyed my shins on a 700lb squat.  I did one rep and felt my knee almost blow out.  I lift and lift, thinking it will male me feel better about myself because I actually enjoy the lifting.  It takes my mind off of the pain inside.  Thats why I have so many passions.  So I can drown out the loneliness that I constantly feel.  Just my family and I against the world.  I lift until I fail, so I may better myself and if you are reading this you should do the same.  

I just wish, a woman would love me for me.  Someone to hold and say everything is ok.  And I know it sounds pathetic but thats how I feel, because I am a people lover.  Im touchy feely.  I want to snuggle with someone by a warm fire with a blanket, watching the snow and drinking hot pumpkin spice tea.  Tell her how much I care, and hear her feel the same way.  Is that too much to ask?  This is what I truly desire.  A woman, who cares about me.  Someone who would go to the end of the earth with me.  Someone who I can look into their eyes and kiss.  Someone to spend nights with, to watch movies and share laughs with, to grow old with.  To tell her nothing else in the world matters.  I mean all of this from the deepest recesses of my heart but I may never have what i want because thats not what women want.  They want my utility, or just want me for social status.  They want to be able to say they have a boyfriend instead of giving a shit about the man who cares about them.  I understand if you dont care or are interested but dont mentally fuck with my head and give me hope.  Cuase then I'll just move on because you are like all the other 99% of women.  I feel done.  I am happy.  But done.  Like a deflated balloon that someone is forcing air into again and again.  Im not saying all women are bad, its just so many of them I run into or take interest in me, are shitty.  Which is why I have created this shell of a person that I am.  Forever chasing my goals and aspirations but secretly craving some love from another human being.  And it hurts to think about.  Because whenever I decide to let my heart open again people see it as an opportunity to hurt me or realize that I feel and just get turned off by it.  Which I understand. 

I am happy.",lonely,Its all good.,2020-11-20 01:21:05

She was standing there looking at me. With those beautiful brown eyes and her amazing smile that just lifted me off my feet. But she was blind towards me. She couldn’t see the vision. She was stuck on a wheel. Dating the same typa dude just to get her feelings hurt. I hated that. I hated seeing someone I care so much about get hurt. But now was just the beginning Of the sleepless nights wondering what I should do. Sure I loved this girl but was it time ? Was it to early? Those questions didn’t matter after I saw her getting treated like shit with other men. I told myself the worst she can say is “no” no biggie. So I sat there and made the biggest mistake of my life. Because i texted her yeah I texted her. The worst fucking shit you can do when trying to express your feelings for someone. Sure I wanted to do it in person. But I couldn’t everytime I see her my words start to mumble and I start choking on my words. Yes, she’s that beautiful. I don’t know what it is. Because I’ve been friends with this girl for most of my life and I’ve never been attracted to her in a relationship type way. But I don’t know what happened. the last 2 years of highschool  I just began to fall in love with this beautiful woman. I can’t explain it, I started day dreaming about her and then actually dreaming about her. It was crazy. Nothing like I’ve seen before. So I did it. I sent her a whole paragraph confessing my feelings and she just said “I don’t  think a relationship would be great for us, we should stay just friends”...... heart crushed like that. And I get it not everyone you like will like you back. Totally aware of that. But there was something about her something so beautiful and mysterious that even I couldn’t figure out. I felt like we matched in every single aspect of a relationship. Always used to FaceTime and talk. We just were compatible in a way. We were so much alike.Time goes on and to this day I still get dreams about her and still think about her on a daily basis. But ever since she’s made it clear that a relationship between us would never happen I haven’t spoke with her.(almost 2 years ) It crushed me to the point where I couldn’t even look at her anymore. I just filled with regret. Like was it to soon ? And not like I said “we should start dating now “  like no I wrote something along the lines of “I hate seeing you get treated like this, can we start talking etc etc?” It wasn’t bad in my opinion but maybe it was to forward but again I’ve never felt like this about any other woman in my life. She was the first one to make me actually see life from a different perspective. My mood would brighten up everytime I was around her didn’t matter how shitty the day was. I saw her I was happy. For once I saw a future with a girl . That is something that is very hard to do for me. I’m usually pretty quite and don’t say much to woman.(imma little shy :/) But after so many years of knowing this perfect one. I realized I really really like her. It took a lot out of me to say something to her and I did but it wasn’t the response I was looking for. I sit here still broken and she probably doesn’t even think about me once throughout the day. To her I say, I’m glad I shot my shot and it didn’t work. But you will forever have a place in my heart. I would never do anything to hurt you. You were the reason why I went to school everyday and sat in my seat wishing you weren’t absent so I could see your face again. (Notes)

(Reddit) I think I just needed to write all of this out and get it off my chest. I always feel uncomfortable around other women now and I honestly haven’t even tried or talked to a girl since then. The whole thing just made me climb back in my shell like a hermit crab. Now I have trust issues with women and I’m always on edge. 


PS 
Thank you for reading if you did. I don’t want upvotes I don’t want likes. I honestly just posted it because it’s the only thing I regret with my dating life. I let the perfect one go. I hope she is also doing well and I never wish this type of feelings on any other human being. Sucks to feel this way. But I think I’m starting to get over it :).",lonely,"This a long one friends.

1551,SnooSongs9940,1605788064,3,"Loneliness. Strange. What can we do with it? Nothing. It's an electrical charge. Same as anxiousness. Same as neurosis. A poor soul. A pour soul. A pure soul. 

I love people. I love the way they quirk. I love the way they exceed. I love the way they exist. Today i have been evaluating myself. Not through any kind of excessive self-amouration. Instead from a critical analysis p.o.v. 

Its suitable for me to do this kind of work because I determine my actions. I determine my beliefs. My human body isn't average. It isn't really my friend. Unless I work with it. Unless I do what it tells me to do. Now Ive tried to neglect and neglect and neglect all of its needs. But to no avail. I always surrender to the anatomy. The call. 

Charlotte run for your life. You dont make sense. Run. Now initial reaction is to stay still. Ignore the call. Ignore the call. Youre not a runner. You are a computer person. YOu have no time to run and no time to sacrifice recovering from it. So dont do it. Dont fatigue your body it's dangerous. You will start running and you will be in fear. Fear and pain. AFter thirty seconds you will have to stop. What a fool. What a sweaty fool.

Ouch. Ouch. Jesus. Why would I bother? 

You bother because its natural. Running. Across the land. Across the desert. Through the forest. Along the river. Movement. A single woman. A body. Moving through time and space. Moving to create her balance. Her equalibrium. To smart for one cell. To smart to expect life in one spaxe. To intelligent to expect stimulation from one space. To strong to expect rights by one. Movement is the life. REspiration is the tool. The calm the process the battle. 

Higher paths to find. unknown to discover. Love in steps. Love in direction. Love in freedom of movement. Answers just drop from the sky reversing that which once tornment. Leaving space for the new. Opening airwaves regular, ",lonely,Thursdays,2020-11-19 23:14:24

I am passionate about physics and I think I will end up studying it at university, besides I like sciences and I study each subject that interests me individually.
Both math and physics are two subjects that I love and it is an interest that I look for in a person (since not many have them).
I love writing, poetry and prose (in my language, Italian) and I try to read as much as possible.
I am interested in art (impressionism and post-impressionism) and music (for a few years I played the violin but now I have stopped).
As you can see I have many passions, but I hide a thousand others!
And if someone wanted to study with me I would not hold back, even if I do not think, for now, I will be able to ""hold"" the voice chat being of a particularly shy and introverted nature.
I am a very private person (and often considered boring or too serious) but who if he is in the right environment can burst energy from all pores and who opens up quickly with people with whom he is intended.
With the right person I can talk for hours on each topic, but I love complexity.
I'm Italian, , thin (~66Kg) over 6ft. (~186-88cm) and I love irony and black humor (not always but often).
If you've made it this far we may already have thousands of things to talk about, hope to meet you soon, have a good day!",lonely,[18M] Searching for the impossible (or the improbable)!,2020-11-19 21:11:21

1561,thefinalprophecy,1605779061,1,"I just feel sad and more lonely than I already am because I was so naïve thinking that about how I've hooked up with guys believing that they'd want to hook up more or maybe be friends, but I learned the hard way. It's heartbreaking to now know that I was being taken advantage of. Used for my body. I wanted to feel like they were nothing more than hookups but I couldn't. I mean I met them online, what would I expect? I don't trust anyone online anymore. 

It's hard for me to make friends in real life because I have social anxiety and when I've tried to say something funny or witty, I just get ignored. It's happened a couple times even with my own family members. Plus I'm random and a ""peanut gallery"" so I get shrugged off sometimes. I have a best friend but she moved away, she's visiting rn but I don't want to see her because of Covid and it'd probably just make us sad that we can't be together without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart.

After realising what I was doing I attempted to maintain relationships for longer but eventually I would always stop talking to people. I dont know why 100% but I had some childhood trauma that probably explains most if it.

In the end, to avoid hurting people and myself, I've just stopped trying. Whenever it seems like I might be getting close to a work colleague or even family members, I just pull back as soon as I realise what's happening. This means I'm completely alone in my day to day life, so I spend alot of time thinking. 

When I think, I play out whole conversations in my brain and it feels like im talking for hours. I makes jokes, I come up with interesting scenarios, my imagination is top notch and it's great fun...but it's just me thinking...the worst thing is that I've convinced myself I'm okay with it because, 'no one else understands me anyway'.

1566,batmanfan90,1605774108,3,"I can’t stand it anymore. I haven’t seen my friends in weeks. It started so long ago and now I’m feeling it. Sorry, let me just explain for a little bit. I’m a 13 year old boy who’s never had a gf while most of my friends have. They’ve held hands and had their first kiss and where am I? I’m alone, in my room, no one to talk to, nothing to say to anyone. No hugs to receive or any “it’s going to be ok” or any “I love you”. I’ve been living like this for a while. Crying in a corner every other night as I just wish for someone to talk to. I’m ashamed for feeling this way, it’s so stupid. 40% of people come out of high school without having dated and I’m in 8th grade for god sake! And if the 60% who do most don’t start until their later teens. I once asked one of my friends for advice with girls and do you wanna know what he said? “You just need confidence man”. Wow! As if I can just do that on command! As if I don’t stutter and can’t get words out for seconds at a time. It’s only now I realize why girls liked him. Both of the girlfriends he’s had came up to him. He never had to deal with anxiety, hey just called him cute and asked “do you want to be my boyfriend?”. Wow, I know how much I sound like an incel but trust me, it’s the truth. But me? I have a weak jawline, a nose that curves downward, and a feminine eyebrow ridge. Isn’t that attractive on a teen boy! Why now? Why do i feel this way? I have a crush on two girls but I’m way too scared to do something like ask for their number or get rejected just because “your not my type”.

Out of self hate.

1572,nycsun77,1605772022,6,"I haven’t had friends since highschool and even those friends were not real. I’m f20 yrs now and struggling. It makes me feel like I’m not interesting or cool enough for people to stick around. I tried too hard and put effort to have friends or genuine people around but it seems like everyone I encounter is shitty. I literally made a post on a subreddit for friends and had people messaging me inappropriate things which nowhere in my post gave an invitation for that. And another experience with someone who I thought we were gonna make plans socially distance ghosted me. They stated even in the message that they’re going out so they don’t want me to think I’m being ghosted. But it’s been about a week and no response LOL. 

These are just reddit experiences but I have several real life experiences of attempting to make friends. I joined this app strictly for females to make friends and network. That didn’t work out either cause I get ghosted or we didn’t get along .. also tried to join clubs and make friends in college yeah that didn’t last cause I attend community where nobody cares to make friends either. 

I just want to experience life with some great people why is it so hard to find them. I prefer quality over quantity. Yeah being with yourself is great but it does get super old after a while. And we all know everyone you meet through reddit is just a quick convo that never lasts that’s the likely outcome for most users.

1573,fermentedcheese22,1605771300,1,"Context. I am constantly surrounded by people who love me and care about me, whether it's friends, family or colleagues. I love and appreciate each and every one of them. I am an introvert, but I never had trouble making friends, particularly because I know how to start and maintain a conversation if need be.

The thing is, romantically, it's an entirely different story. Ex broke up with me back in January. I took the necessary time to work on myself and overall, I'm honestly happy with the process. I learned plenty of new things which will surely help me in life.

A few months ago, I decided to download dating apps (bear in mind that this is my first time using them). I got a couple of matches, I even dated someone for almost two months, but then decided to end things because I wasn't feeling the spark.

The thing is, the lonliness is starting to get to me, and I'm somewhat starting to hate myself. I am a hopeless romantic, and the lack of romance in my life is affecting me too much at this point. It's demotivating and demeaning. It's true that I have plenty of awesome people in my life who genuinely care about me, but there's a huge missing piece in the puzzle.

I don't know what to do. Sometimes I get the biggest urge to cry, and sometimes I'm feeling extremely anxious. Therapy helped a lot, but it obviously can't replace what's missing in my life. I don't know what to do at this point.",lonely,I don't know,2020-11-19 18:35:00

I know it isn't out of any maliciousness or anything because she's very kind and sweet, and she always lights up when she sees me irl, but at the same time, this sort of thing happens all the time.

Although I try to express my feelings and thoughts to my GF it never goes right for me, the typical process of overthinking and jumbling my thoughts put me in a frantic to kinda explode at myself for not caring enough and leaving her to see a part of me that is trying my hardest to communicate, I’ve tried talking to family members but its also the same and when I said what I believe makes sense it’s back fires. Leaving me in doubt that I’ll ever get it right.
The process of overcoming my negative thoughts gets really tiring and I just want to give up, but deep down I don’t want to lose anything. 
For the time being I feel like I’m pushing everything and everyone away when it’s not my intention. Thus the term black goat of the herd. 
I feel like an outcast but the more I see myself as that outcast the wiser I believe I’m becoming, thinking how to adjust, I break and pull myself together daily, battling amongst myself and wondering if I’ll make it out. 
This lonely trip of mine has it’s toll and i feel I’m getting closer to that bottom line, its like drowning, reaching out trying to catch a breath and figure what’s going on but the eerie silence takes the flood of my emotions back to that black hole, the one that devours all the hope. 
In this dark times I’m grasping at any sight of light to help me see the bigger picture, when I find it, I can better myself and others that seem to misinterpret how I am. 
On this voyage of mine I float in the endless baggage of emotions hoping to be heard and sought out, as I do for others, I too hope to find something to help me cope and show my insights of my emotions. Not to scare them but to express myself as I am and not paint a image they deem chaotic.

A couple months ago my first and only relationship (almost 9y LDR) came to an end and as it did I began to understand how alone I am, the ""friends"" we had sided with her and blocked or kicked me from everywhere so I ended up by myself.  
My family always hated the idea of me leaving the country and moving to another so Im pratically an outcast to them now. and the only friends I had from here dont consider me a friend anymore because I spent most of my days and nights with my ex or getting stuff (uni or job) out of the way asap so I could spend time with her.

I had been trying to meet new people or just talk to anyone in general but due to COVID and the quarantines its been extremely hard and I end up being ignored/ghosted in forums or chat groups. I also even joined dated apps in a desperate attempt to don´t feel like no one is going to love me but that backfired and I ended up feeling way worse. I realized I never really hug, cuddled, kissed or any form of physical love and/or care (not even gonna talk about intimacy)

Everyday that goes by it feels Im deeper and deeper in a huge hole and I cant see the end of it, keeping myself busy with games or other activities, but when the night arrives everything crumbles and it just crush me badly

I’m not in any big social groups. Probably since I don’t like drugs or partying (in a FREAKING PANDEMIC). So I’ve got plenty of acquaintances, only 2 real friends both male. 

So the worst part is that I’m not bad at dates. I’m very good. It’s never awkward, I keep conversation, I make girls laugh, I impress them with my hobbies.

It’s worthless. I can never get passed the initial flirting and a few hangouts, after that they always stop texting, ignore, polite but distant

I'm  and when I was 7 my parents took me out of the private religious school they sent me and decided to ""homeschool""

Since then I've barely been around kids my own age, I've never had anyone I could call a friend (other than online, god I feel so pathetic having to add that) I've missed out on so many experiences that other teens my age have all had. I hate that I can't relate to anyone and I've got no god damn social skills. I love sports but I've barely done them because every place had to follow my dad's strict religious requirements

I've really only studied three subjects (English Maths and Science) and I'm behind on all of them which makes me feel so inferior and insecure

The only plus is I guess I've gotten used to the loneliness, can't miss something you've never had, right? Though sometimes I wonder what my life could've been like if I was normal. I wonder what it would be like to have friends, to go partys, to be around girls. Maybe I'm being dramatic but I feel like my childhood has been stolen from me.

1661,cheesygraterau1,1605699417,3,"They both bring a sense of uncertainty. That you're told it'll blow over eventually, but the pain is in that you don't know if and when that day will come, inevitable as it may be, so every moment of your daily existence is left contemplating on how it could be weeks or months or years from now, and until then you have to learn to live with it as a means of coping, live with it for all those days, weeks, months, or years.

I just wanted to put this out there, cause I've hit an absolute wall. I've always been alone, but a very social animal at the same time. I love talking to people, I love working with them, but as of late I've had a revelation of all the disappointments in my life, having realised they've stemmed from the cards I've been dealt when it comes to friendships, girlfriends, and professional relationships. 

I accepted this along time ago without fully understanding it like I have now, so I lived with it and learned to adapt, and it worked to a fair degree. Then I met a girl recently who tipped the scales completely, and I've hit rock bottom, somewhere I didn't see myself landing when I was cruising the life game a couple months ago. This resilient and courageous attitude I hardened myself with to deal with loneliness, I knew she truly fucked it when I started seeking mental help from strangers over the phone. I've never been one to delve that far into psychological matters to the point that I needed to discuss my problems with professionals, and the fact that I constantly find myself alone in my room googling depression to find out if I have it and lurching at my gut with this sick feeling that should've gone away 7 days ago, its all shocked me and I don't know what to do. 

I'm an artist, a filmmaker for the most part, and I've dug myself a hole that I can't get out of. I can't write, I can't come up with anything, despite having my mind brimming with ideas and enthusiasm before I met this girl, and there is literally nothing on the horizon for me. I have nothing to look forward to. Every one of my memories from between August and October make me sick to the fucking stomach because I was so nonchalant and somewhat happy with myself and optimistic about the future. Now I've lost energy, attitude, and any shred of optimism I could once harvest for my creative and social abilities. Xmas and New Year's is around the corner, and I honestly dread both as, though I have a wonderful, huge family whom I love, I'm still dreadfully, absolutely, and painstakingly alone and there's no solution.

Exercise helps, yes, yet it also leaves me too tired to write and draw and create, which leaves me depressed at the thought that I haven't done anything proactive to move my career and craft forward. There's no use in telling others of this. I already have, and it's clear that there is no solution but to move forward and deal with it like the coronavirus. I can't even suppress it all with weed or whiskey, I'm certain it'll exacerbate the emotions I'm scared of even the thought of it. I just want to be happy again, but I've run out of things to be happy about, considering that what most would say is worth smiling about is a far reach for the bleakness of my outlook on the future.

I can't escape the struggle either. Gaming makes me feel like I'm wasting away my time. Movies make me yearn for the relationships transpiring before me (although I watched some that did help). Eating junk doesn't taste as good, eating healthy is leaving me hungrier, and exercise leaves me too tired. Writing or music making just fucking hurts at this point. 

I know we'll all be happy again someday, we'll always meet people and find new things to bring joy and meaning to our lives, but the way things are looking right now, it's gonna be a long few months, and the way my life is run with my job and my time, there's almost nothing I can do about it. If anyone feels this way in any form, I hope you know you're not alone in this world, because I just felt like taking advantage of Reddit anonymity and venting, this is one of the darkest points in my life, and I never thought it could be this bad (not suicidal though). I just wish I would have someone for new years like I did 12 days ago.

Today was an interesting day of moods being flared from hot to cold, as if the world tilted a little more making my judgment on my actions and idealistic ways to be nearly crumbled. Today I had a few people show their true colors and there were colors that possibly aren’t even on the spectrum of the color wheel, but it almost got the best of me, had to hold my dire way of exploding, unfortunately where i’m at our state hasn’t taken any of this pandemic serious and because of that, Myself and others have to go and venture out to help those that refuse to have any realization their is a pandemic going on and yes I know I should say stay home and be safe but unfortunately growing up, bills pile up and because I think of others before myself I do my daily duty to help in any way I can. But today a lot of people were testing the boundaries and I held my own but, after getting home it hit me on how hard it is to show people the insight of good and best intentions I choose to have, even if they have a bad day I try to help not matter what, but unfortunately some people are so deep in the dark down spiral of negativity.
I know it’s possible to make a small change and I felt taking the hits that they bestowed upon me may have enlightened them on that this person was there enough to care and help. I know it may sound shallow but, I don’t like holding things in, rn I feel like im actually in space where its cold and soundless just being there in my thoughts wondering about what I could of done differently or what did I do to receive this mindset. Although today I’ve overcome the negativity, it throttles in the back of my mind.

I do not see myself the same as other people see me. This was proven the other day when I started talking personal with someone at my gym and they thought I was joking purely based on the way I look on the exterior. 

It got me thinking of what other peoples perspective of me was, I feel like I'm crying for help sometimes and no one cares, do I have to develop an eating disorder for someone to notice I'm struggling? To me my obsession with my physique is as unhealthy as someone whos anoxeric or obese, it's all I have.

I wake up at 11am and wait to go gym which is at 7pm, during this time I'm all alone. The majority of my socialization is at my gym which is just meaningless small talk but it definitely helps. 

The one girl that I liked was interested in me for 2 years and I never made a move due to my own insecurity's and being shy, I think she has now found someone else and has been avoiding me because I never made a move. This one hurts because she was genuinely a good person and in a similar situation to me, she was lonely just looking for friends and I was too shy to approach but she definitely thought I was just being an asshole and leading her on because she's seen me socialize with other people, I talked to her twice but didn't continue the pursuit because I was scared. The other day she removed from her Instagram follows list and I just left it, but it was probably the most painful thing that's happened in 2020 for me, she has no idea how much I liked her.

1712,volcom2096,1605663647,3,"I know everyone is lonely right now during the pandemic. I get it. I know my situation isn’t unique, but here it is. 
I am a 32yo Male. Gay, single, overweight, and really struggling to manage my C-PTSD. I live with my parents and grandpa in their new house. Even though I live in a house with others I feel so alone all the time. My Mom doesn’t work and is home 90% of the time, in her room watching Netflix and TV, or crocheting. She has some severe mental health problems that she refuses to get help for, and I regularly act as an armchair therapist for her on an almost daily basis. My dad is rarely here as his job takes him out of state and country for months at a time. When he is home, he is berated by my Mom to the point he puts in headphones and does things around the house to avoid her. Finally, my grandpa is always leaving any chance he can get, taking road trips with his siblings and spending time with my cousin and her family instead. He invites me to do things with him, but it is always at the most inconvenient time, like in the middle of the work day (I work a remote job). 

I try to spend time with my Mom, but she’s insufferable. She’s negative about everything. I’m a fairly optimistic person and feel like I’m drowning in her pessimism every time I’m around her for more than 20 mins. 

I’ve tried to date during quarantine, but haven’t felt a spark with anyone. I’ve dated two guys a month apart and ended up breaking it off so I didn’t string them along. 

Meanwhile, everyone around me is married, including my two older sisters, my two younger sisters, and my friends. Some of them have kids. All of them have their own houses, and all are lucky enough that their spouse is their best friend. 

I reach out at least once a month to my sisters and friends to check in how they are doing and offer help in any way I can. But, every interaction feels like I’m inconveniencing them. Like they have so many better things they could be doing with their time. 

When I look at who I’ve been and who I am now, I feel I’ve grown to be a much better person. I try to admit and correct my mistakes, and strive to be a more enjoyable person to be around every chance I get. It seems like no one really truly likes me or wants my company. 

I’ve talked to my Psychologist several times about my concern that’s maybe I’m a narcissist or sociopath and just don’t realize it. However, she’s reiterated several times that I have a huge amount of empathy and that I don’t fit either of those diagnoses. 

I don’t get why I’m not worth anyone’s time. My friends never message me to see how I’m doing or ask to spend any time with me. In contrast, I see their posts on social media doing social distanced or virtual activities with our other friends, and I am never invited to join. 

I feel like this is how my life has always been. I give 2-3x the amount of effort in every relationship I have, only to get a very minimal amount in return. 

The only time my family and friends have reached out since Covid hit back in March is to check on me after having 2 separate surgeries that put me in bed for weeks.

I wish someone would see the worth in spending time with me. I wish I could find a man that wants to be with me in and out of the bedroom and not be just another notch in their belt. 

I don’t understand what is wrong with me that I’m not invited to plans. I’m an INTJ-A on the Meyers Briggs personality test, and recognize that we aren’t as liked as other personalities, but didn’t think I’d be this alone. 

On a daily basis I struggle with PTSD triggers that put me in a dissociative state. I usually end up in tears and an overwhelming sense of apathy. These triggers come from being bullied and abused as a child and teenager, being raped at gunpoint at age 15, drugged and raped by a man I was dating 4 years ago, physical and psychological abuse from my last serious relationship, and growing up in a cult. 

I ineffectively cope with my emotions, trauma, and triggers by binge eating, watching risky sexual behavior porn (cruising, barebacking with strangers), and watching reruns of American Dad!, Family Guy, and Bob’s Burgers over and over. I’ve seen every episode at least 12-15 times each. I get into modes where I exercise and eat right for a good period of time, usually losing about 12-15lbs. Then I get sick/ill or have a blackout episode from my PTSD and lost complete control over it. I usually gain it all back in just a few short days of binging. 

I’m so over being so alone. I’m so over my PTSD. I’m so over being overweight and self conscious all the time. I get so excited when I make progress, but seem to take 5 steps back every time I have a bad day with my PTSD. I’m so sick of absent friends and a family that doesn’t really care.

1714,Pockeyy,1605663224,2,"Here, on this Reddit, I started talking to someone who was just as lonely and sad as I was. We were literally the same person; we had very similar interests, both lived in the same city, both had similar mental disorders and therefore (I could only assume) kind of similar experiences in that regard etc. I didn’t want to admit how much I liked them, but I really did. I thought everything was going really well. 

The problem was that they had quite severe depression and anxiety that could completely bring down their mood and ruin their day. They messaged me that they didn’t think that I deserved someone like them and that they just couldn’t handle everything. 

And instead of telling them that I wanted to help them through it, that I really wanted to make this work since it was the first time I’d ever found someone who seemed to genuinely like me as much as I liked them, that maybe we could vc to talk through how they felt, that I believed they were perfect and that there was no way they could ever push me away, I just told them “okay” and that they could “hmu if they ever felt like talking again”. 

I’ve just lost a one in a lifetime relationship that I don’t think I could ever get back again. I considered messaging them back to tell them that I’d like to talk it through, but that just sounds like an awful idea that would make me look like that perfect example of a crazy stalker or somehing. 

What the hell is wrong with me? No seriously. I don’t understand why I’m so socially inept, why I can’t truly convey how I feel when the moment is most important. I just want to kick myself, or bury myself alive or something. There’s no way I’ll ever find something like that again. I’m so sad about it. 

TLDR: I’m a stupid, socially inept idiot who allowed what I thought could have been my first relationship to dissolve before me in the matter of minutes. I completely blame myself.",lonely,"I’ve made a huge mistake, and there’s nothing I can do about it.",2020-11-18 12:33:44

1726,Ractaros96,1605657544,2,"I need to get this out, I feel so bad right now. Anyway, let's start at the beginning...

I'm 24 and I'm from Poland. Also I'm gay, a loner and monogamous by choice. Sometimes I think those 3 traits make me predestined to spent my life alone. It's bad enough when you're gay and want only monogamous relationship. People are so obsessed with sex, for the never ending quest of finding pleasure. Don't get me wrong - I love sex, but for me it's a tool to bond with the person you love, not a goal by itself. I've had some experiences, but I always had a long term relationship in mind, when I was seeing someone and we had sex. They said, they wanted that too, but it didn't last. Eventually, I realised that not many people at my age know what they want in life. I always wanted love and I'm well aware that relationships are equally pleasure as they are pain. It's all about the journey through life you take with someone. When someone stays by your side at the worst moments of your life - then you know you have found true love.

Some people are cowards, some are emotionally immature to understand and there are those who see relationships as transactions.

As I said earlier, I'm also a loner. That means I don't care much for social contact. Though I still want to love and be loved. I don't care for going out with friends or attending family gatherings. It seems like a waste of time for me. I have a lot of hobbies and interests I would like to pursue instead. The only person I would care to spend time with would be my boyfriend. I'm 95% sure, that I should try to find a guy similar to me in those ways, because outgoing ones simply do not understand. I would never expect my boyfriend to sit at home all of the time with me, if he does not want to. But he should not expect me to go everywhere with him and spent time with his friends.

The truth is, that accepting each other the way you are is one of the hardest things to do in the relationship. And most of the time it just does not happen.

I live with my parents. I was never close to them emotionally, but I know we need each other financially. Especially, if a young person like me wants to save enough money to build a small house for myself. I don't have a job right now, although I'm making effort to earn some money on the Internet. So basically, I'm at home most of the time during this pandemic.

You know, when I'm doing something on my computer, my feelings are mostly manageable. My loneliness gets worse, when I go to bed. Before I fall asleep, I tend to think about my life, how much I would like to hug someone or kiss, to just feel the presence of someone I would care about.

Also, my parents don't actually understand me being gay. I feel...tolerated most of the time. My father thinks to the present day, that I chose my sexual orientation. We don't talk much about it, since I'm tired of explaining to him the same things over and over again. My mother is religious and has some psychological problems, on a good day it's fine, but on a bad day, she tends to talk about sin and evil that ""possesed"" me. A few months ago she told me, that I cannot invite anyone to our home anymore. I could disobey her, but I'm too tired to fight. Besides, my parents are paying for my food right now, so it's wise not to make things worse.

I have one best friend (and basically my only friend now), whom I met on social anxiety group on Facebook. He lives far away from me, but we've been in contact for a few years now. I've never met anyone who would understand me like him. I even told him, if he would be gay, he would be my boyfriend now. I was very afraid, that this might end our friendship, but he understood. We're both in similar situations and we're both the same age.

Life is hard and I think that some people would commit suicide or get addicted to alcohol or drugs, if they were in my place, but I'm surviving it. I have some beautiful ideals in my mind, that keep me alive most of the time. Playing games, watching movies and music helps me so much too. They say that every person has a breaking point. I just hope it never comes to that, although I feel tired psychologically. Maybe the best is yet to come for me or maybe I'll have to spend my life all alone (I'm learning to accept that possibility too).

If you read that whole story, then I thank you for your time. :) I feel a little bit better after writing it.",lonely,"I'm calm most of the time, but I can't say that I'm happy with my life.",2020-11-18 10:59:04

1731,zjmdms,1605652856,4,"Title explains most of it, I have absolutely no friends some acquaintances that I might hang out with once a year maybe but no friends no one to talk to or hang out with I’ve never thrown a birthday party cause I knew i wouldn’t have enough guests actually stupidly enough I tried last year and spent over $600 renting out a loft and everybody but 5 people cancelled last minute so it was more embarrassing than anything.

Growing up I didn’t have anyone to talk to. I’d talk to my dad and he’d tell to shut up cause he was watching tv and just got home from work. I’d try and talk to my sisters they’d tell me to shut up or simply just pretend I’m not there. My mom was the only one that didn’t treat me poorly but she was still stressed growing up and we didn’t talk much. Friends I had in elementary school/ middle school would actually bully me or say racist things and I’d laugh it off cause I didn’t want to look sensitive but I’d go home and cry about it. High school I was still in the same friend group the jokes didn’t really stop and they added on joke’s about me being stupid and not graduating high school not knowing I was missing school cause my mother was sick and I had mental and physical issues of my own and was constantly in and out of the hospital.

Even when I do hang out with people I don’t feel like I fit in I don’t really enjoy myself much I usually end up by myself staring at the wall I laugh when other people laugh so it’s not awkward but it’s forced I don’t enjoy myself like others would. I’ve always been the third or fourth choice I’ve never been a first choice even in my relationships.

I’m going through a rough patch what might be the worst year of my life and I have absolutely no one usually people have friends to comfort them or distract them after a family member dies or you lose your job, after a bad diagnosis or after a bad breakup but I have absolutely no one. So I sit in my room and obsess over these things over what I could’ve done differently over my failures my loneliness and cry. I feel like If I just had somebody at least one person that cared I feel maybe I wouldn’t take everything as hard.

Because I have no one in the past I’ve stayed in abusive relationships just because id still have someone to talk to and spend time with they’d put their hands on me they’d verbally and emotionally abuse me break things and I’d take them back it got to the point where they would tell me I have no self respect and they were/are right I don’t, my most recent relationship he only wanted sex I wanted a relationship but I took what I could get cause I liked him, liked talking to him and liked having him around he told me the same thing. I should respect myself.

I try to talk to people but no one is really there and with my mental illnesses it’s hard to try and communicate and continuously reach out to hope for a better relationship. I need a therapist I’d love to have someone to talk to like that but I can’t get one.

so nobody ever talks to me at school. it's been like this my whole life. i just want to get school over with and move far away so i can be myself again without feeling pressured and judged in my small town. 

even one of my closest friends think that i'm shy. i can't even be myself around her. i keep comparing myself to her.

 i constantly feel like every single thing i do is being carefully watched by people. fuck, i feel self conscious even when i'm walking, sometimes i forget how to walk, so i have to teach my self how to walk 'normally'. i'll even forget how to breathe. 

i overthink things too much, it makes me scared to go out of my comfort zone and actually socialize with people around me. if i suddenly start talking, they'll think i'm weird for actually talking out loud. 

is there other people who are like this? like i don't consider myself to be 'shy', i'm just too self conscious to actually be myself, even around people i've known for years. ",lonely,what,2020-11-18 07:47:20

Technically I'm not 'depressed' anymore but fuck me, am I miserable.  I've been single for so long I feel like I've regrown my virginity.  I started off pretty good.  Lost the V-plates at 15, did plenty of dating around 18-19 and then I just fucking crashed.  I thought my struggle was over when I met someone at 24 but that flame burned to ash while I was still shielding my eyes from it.  That's what makes it worse.  Shakespeare said ""tis better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all""......I'm calling bullshit on that.  Having tasted love, just a hint of it, as a single drop onto the tip of my tongue, to know what I'm missing out on and then to slowly come to the realisation; that's my lot.  No more for me.  Never to sit on the hotel room balcony as we watch the sunset and fuck under the stars.  

I'm definitely a very, shall we say, romantically inclined man.  I have a detailed idea of what kind of partner I want to be, what kind of lover, what kind of husband, what kind of father.  You ever read or listen to those posts about ""what's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said / done for you?""  You hear all these responses about the way he remembered this about her, bought her that thing, did this to help out her friend or made time for her family.  She talks about the way he kisses her and tells her he loves her Every. Single. Day...Without Fail! or the sound of relief he sighs when he finally gets to hold her again like it's been months since last they spoke, even though it was only a few hours ago.  She reminisces about that time he made a note of all the little things that she remarked in passing ""oh, I'd like one of those"" so he can collect all these little nothings and give them to her on some arbitrary occasion, just to put a smile on her face.  She praises his thoughtfulness and the unbreakable care he has for her and their children.  You hear all of this and more and more and you think, ""That's Me,...I Swear on my LIFE, That's me.  That's what I was MADE for! It's why I'm here.""  But no.

Not for me.

I've tried so hard.  For so long.  To taste that hint of love again, but it always eludes me.  If I could just get rid of that whisper that tells me I don't deserve it, maybe I could still afford to hope.",lonely,Can I just get through one more year?,2020-11-18 07:23:18

Some background information before you read my situation:

, A senior in highschool, the girl is 16, a junior in highschool

I wrote my situation entirely:

&amp;#x200B;

I met this girl online about seven months ago on Snapchat, unfortunately, she lives two hours from me. We texted every day all day long and this was way different than my past relationship. Everything about this girl was so positive and she is amazing. I can tell she really loved me even though we haven't physically met. I have been begging my mom to go on vacation to where she lives. (She lives in Santa Barbra, I live in LA). Today was the big weekend where my mom booked a hotel in Santa Barbra. I was filled with thrill and excitement to finally meet her. We met on Friday evening and she ran up and gave me a huge hug. Our moms met and it went well. Then we went walked downtown to go eat. It was alright but the conversation wasn't very flowy. It was awkward at moments. I walked her to her car and she drove me back to my hotel. I was kind of upset. We texted afterward and it was a little awkward as well and I told her it will be better tomorrow when we hang. (My vacation in Santa Barbra was for three days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday). But I ended the conversation with ""goodnight"" and she said ""goodnight"" back. Every day leading up until that day we always said ""goodnight I love you"". Something didn't feel right. We met up the next day and went to an aquarium. It was still kinda awkward. After that, we went downtown and walked around for a bit. We got Starbucks and sat down. There was nothing to do and she kept asking me what I wanted to do. I said I don't feel like walking around right now. She said so what do you want to do? I kept saying I don't know. Eventually, I had the guts to say ""can we go somewhere private"" and she said sure but where. And I said what about your car and she said okay. Before we met up she told me she was on her period and I understood that. I wanted to just kiss her somewhere private where people wouldn't look at us. I didn't want anything more. As we are walking to the car I glance at her and she's texting her friend fastly. When we got to the car her friend called her and said ""I got into a car crash come pick me up"". And she told me sorry I have to go pick up my friend its an emergency let me drop you off at your hotel. I said no it's okay and I got out of the car and walked to my hotel. As I am walking I realized that it was a fake call and she probably didn't want to be in private with me or something. She texted me ten minutes later and said I'm so fucking sorry and I said its ok and she said I can't make it to dinner tonight because I have to watch my sister. And I said ok and she left me on read. We were supposed to meet up later for dinner with my mom. But she left me on read and I felt a weird feeling like I was sad and mad. I deactivated my snapchat and Instagram. I was hoping she would text me on Imessage and ask me what was going on with me. But she didn't. We didn't hang the last day because she didn't text me and I didn't text her. I decided to text her as I was going home in the car. I said we're incompatible and we probably shouldn't talk. I didn't mean this I said It out of anger and I wanted a reaction out of her. But she said she agreed. Then I proceeded to ask her this: there was no car crash right? She left me on read. I was devastated that she lied to me. A couple hours later I sent her a long message basically saying that I love her a lot and even though there was many awkward moments, I enjoyed spending time with her and meeting her and these even months have been amazing. I told her I love her and hopefully we can move forward from this. She responded and said she thought I was really sweet and nice and these past seven months have been crazy fun but she said the distance isn't going to work. She said if I lived there it would be different and we could get to know each other better. I responded saying that I can take the train to her and I might go to college near where she lives. I was trying to show her some solutions. And she hasn't responded. It's been two days since I sent that text. I have been crying non stop and I can't sleep and I have been forcing myself to eat so my mom doesn't get worried but I don't feel like eating. I feel like there is no point in life now. The thing that makes me happy is gone. Life feels grey now. I want to end it.

I feel lonely with no point to live. I don't want to live if it's without her. When we began talking she cured the depression I was going through.

in online communities i’ve had slightly better luck, but it all seems that i’m not really anyone there too either. i managed to make some friends/acquaintances more easily because they share the same interests i do, but they all drifted away except for my boyfriend (whom i met on there). every close friend i’ve ever had that i’ve divulged my personal life to has drifted away and i feel betrayed. no one really cares or even acknowledges that i’m there at all and that’s how it’s going to continue to be sadly

oh and the fact that there’s a pandemic isn’t helping this at all so that’s great :) i was hoping i could at least have a shot of having another friend in college but i’ve had to start the whole year online so it’s harder to meet and get to know people. i feel like keeping up with my classes too is harder since i don’t have anyone to really study with...

i just want some friends that aren’t going to use me and stick with me no matter what. friends that genuinely like me for who i am. but that’s never gonna happen :) sorry if this doesn’t make sense i just feel like i’m carrying the weight of the world right now i feel like i’m drowning in loneliness i just want a few close friends that i know i can rely on and talk to so i know there are people that genuinely care about my existence in this world since so many other people in my life want to pretend i don’t exist :)",lonely,i hate how lonely i am,2020-11-18 04:25:50

She opens the door and is mortified by the messy house and is worried about my living situation. Says she doesn’t see me anymore, i have no friends and haven’t dated a girl in 3 years, I work overnights and i also get 0 sunlight and she thinks it could be making me depressed. She recommends a counselor because she is a nurse and has connections.

I don’t really want too but out of curiosity and knowing it’ll make her feel a little better I go along. She has me pick out counselors and tries to pep me up. I call for my first appointment today after work and get told “we cannot help you because you don’t have any health insurance and as far as we can tell over the phone, you aren’t suicidal”.

When I finally pick up my guitar, I wanna play for you while you dance, sing to you occasionally. We can also do some duets like perfect by ed sheeran and beyoncé. Recently I saw a video of this guy took 100 hours making some brownies, it will be cute if I can do it with you, taking our time making some delicious food. At this moment I barely can cook, but I dont mind learning how to cook more, eventually I would need to learn how to cook more things in my future but rn I pretty lay back, and I take the easy way out.

parent's just aren't nailing it. are they? around the world. just . . . aren't nailing it. (and if you're reading this, and you are one of those people ""my parents are by best friends ba ba ba"" read this with an air of irony. i am being slightly sarcastic, as a coping mechanism.

religion is nice, because it unites people. religion divides too. and it sucks. no, it unites people, that are /in/ the religion. and if you're not, you get shunned. you can take a running fuck to your self. get fucked in the ass, with out a condom. you can just, fuck off. yeah, we don't need you. that's the . . . general message i have gotten. 

there is a career i want to pursue. there is something i want to do. and it isn't possible. though i can't judge from this point in the mountain. everything just really sucks right now. and it would be innacurate, to tell my self what i can and can't do, while being in the ditch. i am in the shit. that wouldn't be fair. but it's deeply saddening, to think that i can't do what i love. 

my parent's don't love me. i thought that was true. turns out i was wrong. sometimes i want to be wrong. i don't want to be right. this isn't one of those times. and i'll tell you why it is so painful. i am only as good as by belief to a certain god. i am only as good as by ability to believe a certain faith. if i can't for any reason, i can (and must) fuck off. that's it. 

and it wasn't true love. (platonic parental love) it wasn't real. my dad is pretty chill, but he can't really give less of a fuck. i shouldn't speak on other's behalf. but he is alone and depressed. he can't do anything. but i am the child, i know when someone loves me and when they don't. 

i have this thing with authenticity. it matters to me whether something is authentic or not. there is this level of realness i want to showcase in my comedy. and if something isn't real there is a problem. (like, for examply, my parent's love for me. love that's really all we need. yet. yet, we've failed to give it to people. and that's a pretty big failure, a pretty  . . . important piece of the puzzle. there is a certain degree of discomfort that comes with something that isn't genuine. i like to believe that things are real underneath. that even if someone is a dick on the surface, they are good at heart. that even if someone acts like an idiot, they know the truth deep down.

I had friends once, when I was in middle school I did have a small circle. I wasn't Emo but I was the nerd that got along with them. Then my friend circle fell apart. I was always focused on helping them when I became in need of saving they turned away. Suddenly I had no friends. So when high-school started I started doing it online. 

For the years to come I would spend my days in my rooms doing school and heck else because I had no friends I became trapped in the same four walls.

When I was 17 I decided I wanted to visit family across country (that was the cover I actually wanted to go to the kingdom hearts orchestra) while visiting I liked it. I felt at home which is something I never felt before so after I turned 18 I got a Job worked up money and moved. 

It was going relatively ok. My family turned out to be different than the visit portrayed. They didn't care as much. Actually they never visited. The most I saw was my grandpa which even we butted heads alot. Till finally he told me he never wanted to see me again.

I've been trying to muster the courage in asking I just want someone to talk to. Right now, I'm struggling at the feeling of being an outsider, feeling alone/lonely, and I'm drowning in life. I don't want to type an essay worth's of post, the effort doesn't warrant it anymore.

I've been struggling to form connections for years, make friends and in one of my recent posts, I've been hit with a proverbial cudgel, being bullied online and people constantly dismissive of my experiences, sending me into an emotionally depressive state.

I can't trust civilians, much less, have any reason to connect with them. My existing pool of friendships are only those in the military, one in the MC as a 0352, and two in the Army as an 18D and 11C. But two of them are doing the classic field ops right now, the other is doing his SFMS.

No one bothers to understand how I feel, this will be my last attempt and if this doesn't work, I think being guarded permanently is something that will be best for me, for my self-preservation.

I just need a nurturing father figure willing to make the choice to be the proverbial guardian in my life, looking after my best interests and being actively involved when I share my life with you. Especially when I transition from a male to a woman, just those genuine, heartfelt sentiments and the acts that you care.

I understand how far-fetched and laughable this sounds, but it is all I have right now in terms of any semblance of connecting with new people.

So then we hang out for an hour and then they need to go and I’m like. Holy crap I have to be here with my anxiety by myself the rest of the day. I’m the boss at my job so I make the schedule, and I schedule myself 6 days and I would do 7 days if I could. But my boss would never go for that. 

I know I have a lot to figure out in myself before I’ll be balanced enough to find someone. I don’t have a goal to be perfect, but I still have some little knots in my head to untangle.

1888,lepetiteanne,1605555262,4,"Let me give you a little introduction, I’m 23F, currently living in a city where my 16 year old self never would have ever thought. 

I work in a tiny coffee shop. I am that charming little asian girl who acts all lovely and smiley, who tries so hard to small talk with you, and who puts up with people’s crap, so that they comeback again next time. 

Yeah, I know. I don’t really have to but I’m just doing the best I can for my family’s small business and also my family thinks that’s just who I am. I didn’t grow up with this side of the family so they think that’s just the way I am. 

Anyway, tbh, I don’t even know where I’m going with this story but please bare with me. I just need someone to listen.

Ever since I started working there, I feel like I get lonelier and lonelier each day. To the point that I’ve been having mental breakdowns because of loneliness. I know I might need therapy but I just want to let someone know that I’m not okay with my life like this. 

Anyway

I’ve been single for a while now because I am always never enough. To some guys, I feel like they find me pretty enough to look at but not enough to do anything about it (Sorry if I sound like a narcissist). I also feel like if guys show they like me I could never accept it because my brain would tell me that they’re not sincere or something. That they’re just lying. 

Which made it even worse when I met this person. 

Don’t get me wrong, It’s been only like two weeks. I like him a lot but maybe he’s not that invested in me. We’ve went out only twice (really fun dates) and we almost talk every day but i’m still very scared about it. My mental health isn’t really the best so I always overthink every little thing I do. 

Like for example, today I texted him first for the second time, I got so much anxiety because I didn’t want to come out as desperate so when he replied, I didn’t reply till night time. 

Don’t get me wrong, he’s a really great guy. 

I don’t know. I’m sorry if this is going nowhere. 
I guess what I’m trying to ask you guys if it’s okay to have hope in things like this?
Maybe, I just want someone to tell me that maybe this might work. 

Maybe I just don’t want to be lonely anymore.

I've read a lot of advice on this, lots of which is not really that bad at all (the whole looking at yourself thing, and being comfortable with oneself).

But between these pieces of advice, I've read countless times that good friends should fill the ""hole"" that you feel by not having a boyfriend/girlfriend.

In my opinion thats utter bullshit.

Friends can never and shouldn't ever fill the romantic needs that one has, and thats okay. You'll never have those romantic moments with them because well.. they're your friends. And I'm not talking about the sex, I'm talking about the feeling of romance; looking at the sunset while holding hands, cuddling, expressing your feelings and making plans for the future.

I’ve lost a majority of my friends this year. The whole social distancing hasn’t made it easier. My dating life hasn’t been successful either obviously. That being said, I’ve noticed a huge lack in effort on my part in all of these departments. I’d rather sit in my apartment and play Destiny 2, go on hikes/trips alone and even eat at restaurants alone on my days or time off. Being around other people seems like a drag to me nowadays and while it does get lonely, It feels nice most the time. 

It actually irritates me when “friends” show concern for my new behavior because before they never even bothered inviting me to their parties they had every weekend with the rest of the group except for me or even asked how I was doing via text (it was always me engaging and dragging out conversations with these people/girlfriends). This isn’t new either. This seems to happen every single time with every new group of friends I make, I always get sidelined as the background guy or something even though I tend to be the most inviting and most social.

At the end of it all I guess, I just want to say IVE ALWAYS felt like a loner and something about it just seems right. From childhood all the way up until now and I finally think I’m starting to accept it and become comfortable with it. Should I embrace it? Is being a loner normal as a young male? Do some men just not have any friends at all? Or do I just have some sort of deep rooted problems?

TLDR; I’ve realized how comfortable it is for me to continue being a loner. I want to continue being alone for awhile, probably for a very long while. Is this normal?",lonely,Does anyone else just want to be alone?,2020-11-17 03:01:49

1920,aftermix_xs,1605529993,219,"so i () think i like being sad or maybe im just longing for emotions based off of human interaction. ive been struggling with depression and apathy for a while now and its like an endless cycle in my head. i get depressed all the time because im so behind in class assignments. im so bad at focusing on my work and most of the time my mind goes blank. i just can't think. because of this and living with family, i supress these feelings and the obvious give aways like facial expressions. im finished with high school, but throughout my time there i always kept a blank face and i wasn't really fond of the other kids so i only have a few ""friends"" (more like aquaintances).

 growing up it was fairly easy to make friends but once high school started, i became a totally different person. i guess that's just puberty idk. i have really bad social anxiety now and its hard to have normal conversations with people outside of those i live with.  my body gets really tense and i fidget sometimes when taking to people. and because im like this, ive developed this unintentional habit of just tuning out the people around me. im terrible with small talk so i usually don't have anything to say and sometimes i literally don't hear what people have said to me mid convo. 

sometimes i try to think back to why im like this and i can't figure out why. i just don't remember the details.  my parents aren't great so growing up wasnt amazing and i definitely wouldn't do it again lol. i guess i subconciously processed all of my experiences and i finally understood how shitty things are around me. and that made me shitty. 

moving on, because i constantly supress feelings and memories i struggle with apathy and its like a loop along with depression. they're basically feeding off each other. i don't care about things happening around me and i get depressed because i can't feel anything.  but for some reason, i enjoy the sinking feeling of being sad. i honestly wish i could go to bed one night and just cry. but i can't. i know that its something i shouldn't be ""enjoying"" but i can't help it. even while typing this, i feel worse but im ok with it. being around my family makes it worse and i can't fucking wait to move out. im not really sucidal but i wish it would all just end. feeling emotionally helpless and frustrated.

 there was some thing else i wanted to write after that sentence and now i don't remember. my mind just went blank. its like a camera flash feeling and i don't remember what i wanted to say. i know this post is pretty long but its honestly taking so much effort just to write all this. im struggling to put my thoughts together in a way that's legible and its so fucking hard. 

i feel like i want things to get worse in order it to get better.

edit: ive sort of developed a porn addiction over the years because it's the only thing that takes my mind off things and chemically makes me feel good for a brief moment. i do drink occasionally as well but ive never really been drunk. also im uh struggling with my sexuality and i think im bi but i haven't really figured it out yet. so please don't scroll through my profile LOL. this is an alt account.

I like music, coding, cycling, animes, and working out. I have a dark sense of humor. I am an **omnivert** and prefer my friend circle small. I love making memes too (this is an alias account of mine btw) if we get close or can understand each other better we can be mutual socially too

I guess it’s my turn to fess, being a guy who is abnormal and has a big kind heart would seem to have at least a few friends around in their life time, but unfortunately I don’t have this luxury. 

Its seems challenging to put any effort, knowing that the people you meet and have a first connection can be easily left on the term “read” nowadays. Only for you to be there for them when things go south for them but never a follow up on your whereabouts and situations.

I know it may seem shallow but it is tiring, trying to keep a composure.... 
That you’ll find that one friend to say hi or vent at any time or moment. 

It’s even harder when it includes family that you believed to be your go to, just to find out that they only care for themselves and use you to get there own desires.
It seems kindness has been lost and everyone is only worried about themselves and what they can get out of the nicest people, some of us nice people develop thick skin to endure our protection from being harmed especially when the vibe is real and we can’t tell what’s going good and or bad. Our minds bend and twist to get it perfect and yes I know everything isn’t perfect, but to be the one side to try and obtain any correlation to be courteous for our fellow acquaintances can leave us in doubt that well ever find a friend again. 

Sorry for the long rant but it feels like were all just drifting in our own little Space and searching for a signal to call our home front, someone to talk to and possibly learn from one another. 

Those of you who’ve read this, thank you for your time and have a blessed day where ever you may be, and know that if your truly would like a friend, I’m here, still trying to help others and myself to find our place in this every expanding void we endure.

I dont think I'm special, not in the ""nice girl"" sense, cuz I know I'm a little odd and awkward, but that's everyone in some way. I think that if I do ever find someone, I would ruin it somehow.

I'm starting to feel like I'm just not attractive in that way and I should prepare myself for a lifetime of being single. A little dramatic I know, but these things do happen. 

On the other hand, i feel like if someone did show interest I wouldn't know how to handle it. I think my thought process would be ""me? You like me? Maybe you should try someone else. There are better options"" 

Idk, I think it's time to just take a moment to not look for something that maybe I'm not suited for.

I had a small group of friends in High School and we occasionally meet and catch up every few years, but for the most part it’s just been me. I haven’t had a gf in 3 years and haven’t had a gf that wasn’t long distance in 7 (I almost moved to the UK for a woman). Other than my mother I really don’t have any family. My moms side of the family is mostly dead and my dad’s side is so toxic I’d rather be alone than with them. I’m so used to being alone, not talking to people for days at a time, and just locking myself away in my bedroom after work that I’m beginning to realize that I’ve lost what little ability I once had to make new friends. I recently started taking jiu jitsu classes, and I’ve fallen in love with it, as well as met some great people there, but even then those people are only training buddies. It’s not like we hang out outside of the gym. Whenever I get out it hits me that I’m still alone. I’ve recently been watching videos about old people who for one reason or another have no family left and are spending their golden years in complete isolation. My heart always breaks for those people because you can see in their eyes that their lives are filled with misery. Or stories of people who’ve died in their homes that no one even knew died until weeks, months, even years later because there was no one to miss them. I’m afraid that if I keep going the route I’m going now, that will be me. I’m hoping a miracle happens and I’m not alone, but I know my track record with this sort of thing.

Trauma, bullying, emotional abuse, neglect, grief... it's made me realized I'd rather be lonely than be friends with anyone ever again because there's no way I can overcome it when I barely have the funds to keep myself well fed.

The main issue at the moment is my mental health I need constant gratification that what I'm doing is working and I think my constant asking is pushing her away but that's my personality and difficult to change.

My dad and bother have tried to talk me out of getting back together with her because they don't like how lazy she is and blames her from mental issues and state. They might be right but I love doing everything because then I know it's done and besides I would have to do it all if I was alone anyway.

I really want to work things out with her because I love her and I don't want to lose her but I don't know if it will work and I guess my separation anxiety is kicking in and making me panic about everything.

Unfortunately, even though I confessed to her how much I want to be with her and how much I like her, she threw me away as if the year we spent together, learning about each other, being with each other (virtually) ment nothing as the guy she met on a dating website ment more to her. She eventually cut me out of her life... I gave her a shoulder to lean on, I gave her my heart so she knows there’s someone out there that cares about her. But in the end, she gave me a broken heart. 

Days felt long and excruciating, nights were abysmal because I couldn’t just fall asleep easily, I would stay up either watching randomness videos trying to make myself fall asleep or imaging what I could’ve done anything differently. I couldn’t even watch any anime or shows because something felt off, missing, I couldn’t even watch no more than 10 mins of parks and rec.

It’s been 2 and had years already and I’m still not over it, I’m not a handsome catch where there are girls always flicking to me, I’m just an average Filipino guy. I think the only reason why I’m not over it is because deep down, I knew she was the only girl who liked me for who I am and not just about my looks. I feel that I can’t meet anyone like her again.

For years i was the person always asking them if they wanna hang out, play some games or something, always reminded them of birthdays coming up and so on

They always did stuff together, they just ""forgot"" I existed everytime for the last 4 years somehow

So about 3 months ago I decided i don't want to be that person anymore and just stopped asking them altogether, I still stayed in the groups with them and kept their numbers, and they still thought it was all good

Well today the thin line keeping me from just cutting contact snapped when the people who told me they were my ""best friends"" just a couple months ago completely forgot it was my Birthday...

No Visit, no call, not even a simple text message

So I told them how depressed their behaviour has made me become over the years, told them to fuck off and left

I still consider doing what they did with all my messages... reading them but never answer but who knows, maybe i'll just block them

Let's just hope it gets better from here and i'll try to focus on self love from now on because the last years really made me feel like a piece of garbage who doesn't deserve shit, has no self worth and is completely useless

The one person I still did talk to would scream at me and her mother about things that did not warrant being screamed at, or for things she made up in her own mind. She always said it was because I triggered her or something, but I witnessed a few times where she would scream at her mom for things that she claimed her mom didn't do, but I watched her do myself, so I question if I was triggering her or if she had her own issues. Either way it wasn't good for my mental health so I no longer talk to her.

So now all I do is go to work, come home, maybe play a video game or smoke a joint or stare at a wall/ceiling for a few hours, take my nighttime antidepressants and pass out. 

If I have the day off work I just sit in front of my computer all day. Usually I'll smoke a bunch of weed to numb myself, otherwise I'll spend the entire day crying.

I ignored it. Laid it to be, and pretended as though it wasnt there for so long. Keeping up an appearance that I am fine on my own, while I've been struggling underneath from this and a bunch of other mental health issues. 

Recently however, I've gotten into a relationship. One that in many ways brings me joy. But it's made me realise how long I've spent feeling like shit. And as much as I want to enjoy the present moment, and look at my future with some childlike glee and optimism, I find myself often breaking down with bitterness and jealousy. And its not rational, really. I look at other peoples lives with some idealistic view. I cant help but feel a devastating &amp; claustrophobic jealousy of those who've been not alone. I hear people around me tell stories of fun times. Getting high or drunk with friends and doing something stupid and hilarious and bonding. Being at parties and hanging out and doing absolutely anything. And all I can think back to is years of sitting in a room of four walls and struggling to come up with a reason to continue. And I dont even know why. And I know I could be someone else. As arrogant is it may sound, I know I had the potential to be better. To be happy. Or atleast to spend a single moment of my teenage years and childhood not obsessing over my own insecurity. But instead I've missed out on the experiences that were supposed to define me, or atleast distract me from the things I otherwise indulge in. 

I'm hoping now is a time for change. I would love to see this as the turning point where I all of the sudden abandon my dysfunction. But I cant help but spiral in pity for the person I've been. I've had multiple breakdowns over the past few weeks where all I can think of is intimacy between others, while juxtaposed by my own loneliness. And I am so scared that nothing has changed. Because it really hasnt. Because with years and years of unhappiness and loneliness and insecurity, I've dug myself into a hole so deep that these feelings have become integral parts of me. And I dont think I can abandon them. I've embraced them as principles. And I'm scared I will continue to ruin my relationships, if not fully prevent them from existing. I dont know. I'm hoping I can be rewired, but I doubt it. That some day I wont be the horribly lame and boring and depressing and insecure person that I am now. But it's going to take a lot of work. And I dont know if I'll be happy at the end anyway. Quite often I feel like giving up just thinking about myself. But all I have is my potential to be better for the future. To help myself is my only option. Because I need to be better, and even if I can't I need to be able to tell myself that I tried. And maybe I wont be the best I can be, but maybe I can be content with myself. I'm writing this not because I'm sad or unhappy, but because I feel like I need advice for moving on. For finding help. And I'm tired of keeping all this in my head.

Sorry for ranting. Felt like I needed a place to vent, and I figured keeping these feeling to myself hasnt done me any good over the last decade",lonely,Tired,2020-11-16 06:32:26

It's hard to feel inspired. It's a 2 year LDR and I love him. I don't love that our hangout sessions revolve around the computer - I'm not huge into gaming and it's hard to find shared online activities to keep us busy. More than anything we seem to stress each other out when we talk. We're both fairly sensitive to moods and tones and it becomes a cycle of worrying things aren't 'ok' in the relationship if the other one isn't feeling good, leading to long meta-discussions that exhaust both of us with the warm-cold of agonizingly bringing these issues to light then forming mutual understanding of how frustrating things are, reasserting our unconditional love, vowing to forge through the difficulty together. We're both students, life is chaotic for everyone and it's hard for either of us to take initiative in bringing positive, fresh energies or planning novel activities to try. We might not be able to actually meet until next spring or summer, which will amount in total to a year and a half since we last met (Jan 2020)

&amp;#x200B;

I live at home with my father in an older, family-oriented neighborhood. I'm taking online classes at a community college with a life plan that I can hardly even conceptualize or feel excited for anymore. Everything feels like a dreadful, anxiety-fueled slog and it's hard to imagine that ever changing. I have a dog and I get sufficient sleep, I eat healthy, exercise daily, and talk to a therapist once a week. I get good grades at school. All of these habits have been well-earned after many years of battling a severe mental illness and surviving the shame of consequently dropping out of college. I'm no longer in the sewer but I'm in the gutter, suffocating in the standing water and sobering monotony of a meaningless existence.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, my career and relationship goals add great value to my life, but they also feel very far off. It's hard to really see myself pushing towards these goals every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite a good 'standard' of general mental and physical health, I have no friends and can't even imagine at this point how to meet anyone, online or otherwise. I feel like a faceless swamp of a person. I hardly know who I am anymore. I've tried a few online communities and friendship apps (admittedly half-heartedly) and didn't click with the social environment. Quite honestly, I'm not even sure that I truly even want to spend time with people or make friends. I feel subhuman. Even in early childhood I preferred my own individual bubble, running off with my books and such instead of socializing. It feels like my brain was wired wrong and like I can't fix this about myself. I'm scared to spend time with people, to make connections and form friendships and invite them into the shithole that is my world. Though I'm deeply afraid to live another 50 years with this mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

My current situation - living at home, online community college classes at a painfully slow pace towards my desired career, no friends, increasing negative thoughts towards myself, and an LDR with someone I love very very much but lately has been a cycle of discouraging conversations about the health of our relationship with little opportunity to 'reframe' or have control in activities to have meaningful experiences, flourish, inspire, or feel color in our world.

2026,chrisj994,1605465572,2,"I woke up yesterday, excited to watch the Notre Dame football game and drink a few beers by myself.  I don’t have any friends or hobbies so the Irish games on Saturdays during the fall are pretty much the highlight of my year.  I fell into a crazy depression about 10-11 years ago, that I’m not going to get out of.  Most of that depression stems from my experience with one woman.  Well, I wake up yesterday, and that one woman had sent me a friend request on fb..    At first I was upset, seeing a picture of her with her husband was heartbreaking of course, but after awhile I realized that this is exactly what I wanted.  I’ve been praying for the last 10 years, hoping that she would just think about me from time to time, and I was ecstatic knowing that she had.  I didn’t pay much attention to the football game, I was too busy fantasizing.  I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning up my fb profile, this was the first interaction I’d had with her in years and I wanted it to be as good as possible. At the end of the evening I went to accept her friend request, but it was gone, and I can’t find her profile anymore, like she blocked me or something.  Beyond disappointed..

A little bit of the weight that has been shackled to my heart and mind has been lifted. The world is a little less cloudy and I can see myself a little more clearly. These last few weeks I've been fighting a war. A war that has left me broken, fearful and scarred. 

The war of loneliness is a hard one. 

There have been days I've felt like I was drowning in it and I have wanted to give up and just sink to the bottom. I wanted so badly to just quit breathing, close my eyes, fall back and let it take me.

And just when I think I've finally accepted my fate that one little word ""mama"" breaks through and pulls me up, breathes life back into my lungs and rescues me. The hands that are not so tiny anymore touches each of my cheeks and strengthens my resolve to fight another day. 

I realize that not everyone is made to have someone. This does not mean I don't believe in love. Quite the contrary I believe in love completely. The life that my body miraculously created is proof of the unending, unyielding love that exists in this world. 

However, that one true love that all the great poets and authors sing and write about is not meant for everyone. It is not meant for me. With this realization I can finally stop the self hate. I can finally see the beauty of myself as complete. Whole.  There is no more pressure to be with someone. To find my ""other half"". 

Accepting my loveless life is freeing in a way. Will I still fight the war of loneliness? Of course. But this time it won't seem hopeless. This time I won't want to give up. I know there is life on the other side. I know you ask "" what if that love, that person comes along?"" Then I hope I have the grace and willingness to embrace it. But that's a daydream to indulge in another day. 

For now I hope this peaceful feeling stays. I like the way it feels. Like a comfy warm sweater on a cold day. The warmth fills me from the inside out and in this world that tends to be so cold it is a welcome change.",lonely,Something changed...,2020-11-16 05:04:01

2037,Ky4785,1605461857,2,"Hi Reddit, I’ve heard this place is to those who feel empty inside and heartbroken just like myself to express the emotions and feelings that dwindle inside of your body. So here goes —.

My 18th birthday is coming up, in about a week and a half from now. and it’s around that time of seasonal depression as well a special day. But the thing is, it doesn’t feel special at all . . . because I’ve thought of almost the worst things possible in my life, and I feel like the biggest burden a parent can take care of as a young adult. I’m overeating too much, i keep crying and ignoring them. And maybe say things about me behind my back. 

But that doesn’t help with the life i have, where I need to find motivation to get out of my bed. motivation to live another day where I’m just a fucking problem no one wants to see in their life (I feel that way because of negative hate that people in social areas, college most likely where they just ignore me or make me not exist) and the worst part is? How they always push me away no matter how positive I am

Should it be a good thing? Because it’s hard to keep putting a smile on my face and keep living when no one understands the pain and sadness stuck inside of my weak and shallow shell of a body. I keep telling people and yet they just don’t do much action.

And I was thinking of whether I just should disappear from this world, because its come to a point of where I’ve become a problem that people want to get rid of. If I did disappear, would people even remember I existed? Or even the universe.

But idk at this point.",lonely,"17 year old who deep down is just a depressed burden who just wants to give up on life, to no longer be a burden to a family. And hopefully people forget me.",2020-11-16 04:37:37
2038,LiquidEther,1605461600,2,"I've been realizing lately that the only thing that gels people together is shared experience. My only friends at this point are my coworkers because I spend most of my time with them (I'm even roommates with one). Yeah, I'm insecure and I suspect the instant I switch workplaces these relationships will start to fade, but for now they are real, and as much as we all fantasize about finding people who will love us enough to remember us from the other side of the world (people who essentially want to be family), most human connection is simply based on sharing space and experiences. If you don't do things with other people, you can't be surprised you aren't connected to them.

So with all that being said, I've been wondering lately if community living really is the answer to helping us feel a little more grounded. I don't expect it would magically cure depression or social anxiety or that it would be all love and no conflict - but when you make a commitment to sharing living quarters you make a commitment to working together even when you annoy each other. You end up being accountable to more than just yourself. And that can help keep you going, or so I imagine. 

But of course I might just be romanticizing another lifestyle simply because I'm dissatisfied with my own. Might delete this post later because of anxiety, but just wanted to get this out there. We think of our loneliness as a personal problem - which it definitely is - but there is always a sociological side to widespread personal problems: something about the way our society is structured and what our culture encourages is hurting us, and the answer might just be alternative social structures.",lonely,Any thoughts about intentional communities?,2020-11-16 04:33:20

She wanted to us to stay together but we both weren’t happy. The first year I was going through a lot mentally and was really self destructive. The 2nd year I actually got help. I went to therapy every week. Talked through my trauma. Really got to the bottom of my feelings and why I had been so angry all of my life.

One day she decided she didn’t love me anymore because I had too many mental instabilities. But one major thing is because I wasn’t as intimate anymore. I started working on my mental health and everything else seemed so out of touch for me. She got upset about it. She is younger than me and sex is a huge thing for her. I know she has nothing to do with it to some of you. 

Within this time I was set to move to texas and start a new job doing corrections. Well that didn’t pan out so I had to stay here but I no longer have my job, I’m moving out of my house, and some of my “best friends” decided to start petty drama during all of this. My mental health has never been so low in so long because of all of this.

My ex has been here though. She wants us to be friends because “I mean everything to her and she loves me more than anything”. My brain is so fuzzy right now.

Trying not to make this post sound like I'm complaining but no one really asks me how I am what I'm up to what I'm doing kinda realising that sucks and going out of my way for people that wouldn't nessesarily do the same. Currently my lifes a hot mess and while I can try and focus on that and be productive, while I can watch YouTube, play video games it's just hard knowing at the end of the day I don't have people in my life that truly care for me or my well being. In the same breath I realise I have friends that may help me with doing something but emotionally no. No siblings, a parent that I rarely talk to, that's it. In a new place yet needing to find a new one I can afford comfortably, needing to find new work, even when I'm not anxious I still struggle to make new friends im either not interesting or just have interests that are irrelevant. Maybe this is a vent post but I'm pretty alone, pretty lonely and in my best efforts of trying to do what I can I'm exhausted.

Bit of a cringe thing to say but I'd love to have a day  multiple people asking me how I am or wanting to do something or just generally interested in me, I'm usually like that just find myself asking damn maybe there's a reason why people don't but I can't say. But even now Im kinda the losing the ability to care just sort of trying to make myself happy without other people but I feel such a void in my heart, whether it's not having accomplished enough or not feeling like I'm worth anyone's time and it's crushing when I still try to go out of my way for people that I think feel that way.

Anyways other than that I'm trying my best to succeed and it's just hard dealing with the world just by myself no one to really share things I'm happy about like the little things.

Still, I have tbis feeling of deprivation, I discovered that I am quite needy because I happened to fall in love. That ain't needy on itself, I always liked to have an interesting and serious relationship but never seem to have any luck. Lately I fell in love, but the love is not met from the other side. That is okay, I will still be friends with that person but I crave for a little bit of affection, a hug, someone that comforts me and tries to make me happy when I feel low. It's just something I deeply desired. Falling in love is the best feeling. The girl I fell in love with is a champ, she's definitly a keeper even as a friend. I currently took a break from talking to her as she is going through a breakup with someone else and I wanted to give her some space because I felt that i maybe overdid my friendliness. I just felt the urge to help her but this could work against me. I know that there is a little chance of us being together but we could talk for hours and hours and we know eachother really well. After talking to one of her female friends I realized that I fucked up a bit by overdoing my helpful side. I don't want to push people away but I didn't know better as my love for her made me oblivious to it. Even if we never will be together as lovers being the nice guy will not get me anywhere. It's just that I crave for a little bit of affection as I feel lonely from time to time. She understands me like no other and that's why I might have been to greedy on her. It's just that my love for her goes beyond being able to date her. I know that the possibility of us being together is very slim, especially now your heart was broken by someone else who did never deserve your love. I don't deserve it either. Anyway, our bond is strong. Always has been. I have learned that you can handle things yourself, even though I just want to help. I never had such a good connection with someone before. That's why I will always be there even though I have to sacrifice my own feelings. I hope you are doing well in the mean time. I wish you the best for now. I just wanted to be your hero, but that shit belongs in fairytales. You're strong enough. Your breakup with another dude just hurts me as well as I have always wanted the best for you.

It's tough to be a friend of yours with these feelings. That's why it is better to maybe keep you at a distance for a while. On your side, you have to deal with your broken heart. The broken heart I wished I could heal even as a friend.

Note: I figured that I was oblivious to being a 'nice guy'. This is why I decided to keep her on a distance. Maybe she will text me again, maybe not. I hope I didn't scare her away as she is a golden friend, doesn't matter if it can't be romantic.

2069,it_s_me_b,1605436283,1,"Hi! It's my first time writing here, so lets see how it goes ;) 

I'm 26M and moved last year to another country leaving my friends, family and life behind. I moved for job, and was excited as I got to do the job I really love. I always put carrier in front, working day and night and somewhere along the way, forgot to actually take care of myself and my personal life. 

We all have different goals in life, for me it was my career. I was putting so much in it, that I never realized how much I actually sacrifice for it, until this week when it hit me. I don't know how, and I don't know why, but this week it really hit me.. and it hit me hard. Last Friday, I was sitting in the office, all alone, and every 15min I would just feel sudden burst of emotions and would start crying out of nowhere. I never felt like that before. 

I have a few friends here, which are colleagues from the office. With office being closed and they all living far away, I don't see them anymore. We are not that close that we would talk/see each other outside of the office. I am also not very open person when it comes to personal life. People usually like me cause I'm funny (that's what I was told :) ), but I never share really personal things because I don't want to look weak or that someone feels pity for me. I think getting into that deeper level is needed to actually make real friends and me being like this is not helping. 

I don't have anyone I could share how I feel now, so I decided to  post it here. Don't want to sound ungrateful, there are so many people with worse problems. I'm also lucky that is a problem I can work on and fix it. I really don't want to live life like this anymore. This is not what I want for myself.

2077,custardprincess,1605426875,1,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her. 

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider. 

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday. 

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

Look, I’m lonely but I have other problems. My body is restless when I sleep so I kick and move and sleepwalk. This is a huge problem bc I have horrible, awful, no-good, very bad joints that would dislocate or just in general do their own lil funky thing when I was sleeping. I’d wake up completely unable to get up because my sleeping self screwed me over. Now THAT’S a bad time, eh? 

But man, I’ve got a solution for it all. Joint aches? Restless sleeper? Lonely and wish you could spoon someone AND be spooned? Feel sick and want to sit up at night? Working from home but tired of sitting at your desk chair? 

Man, forget your basic body pillow. Get yourself one of those horseshoe shaped pregnancy pillows with 2 legs that are about 5 feet long each. This pillow is amazing. Great for keeping warm on cold nights, but doesn’t get too hot in the summer. If you wanna sit up, you can wrap it around you in a coil and it’ll support you. The possibilities are pretty endless. But in terms of loneliness, it’s like a hug from all sides. It is infinitely superior to a body pillow in my opinion.

I think you can order them at Sam’s club, but they’re also all over the internet online. Just look up pregnancy pillow and you’ll find it.

A beautiful girlfriend (most would probably say way out of my league in terms of looks) who was compassionate, considerate, and communicative. She was never the type to be passive aggressive and would always let me know when something was bothering her. We'd always be able to talk it out or compromise and she would go back to being happy. She was very intelligent, and came from a very wealthy family, so money would never be a problem. We were planning on getting married.

Yet I left it all. If I wanted to I could have ignored my gut feeling and lived a comfortable life. Sometimes I wonder if I should have just done that instead. But she just didn't feel like ""the one"". I loved her like one would love anyone they had lived with and spent so much time with. It was extremely painful to leave. But from the start, I had never felt that spark of true love. It pains me so much to see how much she is suffering now and to know how much she hates me. But I think it would be even worse to deprive her of being able to share her life with someone who truly feels that she is their ""one"". She'll get over me and find who she's looking for eventually.

I hope that I'll be able to find someone too, but I get the feeling I'll be searching for awhile. I'll admit that I'm a bit unusual. I'm not a gamer (anymore), I don't watch TV shows or anime, I have niche taste in music, I'm a minimalist and try to get by with as few things as possible. I have my own philosophies on life that influence a lot of what I do (although by no means are they set in stone). Hopefully it doesn't sound like I'm trying to be an elitist or put myself above people who have these hobbies or interests, they've just never really been my thing. Even despite my oddities, the fact that I don't have a very abrasive personality and I'm pretty friendly to everyone means that I've never really had an issue making friends. But as much as I respect those people and wish the best for them, I want more than anything to find someone who really gets me. I'm tired of talking to people who I just can't seem to connect with.

Luckily I'm a pretty solitary person; I don't need or want a large friend group. I just need one or two people who I really feel are on my wavelength. Obviously not exact copies of myself; I don't want to feel like I'm living in an echo chamber, just someone who gets where I'm coming from. I'm hopeful that one day I may find someone like that.

I'm not really sure why I'm writing this. While I've been feeling a bit lonely recently, life has been going reasonably well otherwise and honestly I'm even a bit relieved that I didn't go too far down the path of that relationship despite the pain.

2153,TurgidLips,1605390519,1,"So it's heading towards the end of my freshman fall semester at College, and the group of friends I made with my hall is great. Luckily my roommate and I got along, as we are teammates for Football, and we also made friends with some other athletes in our hall. Now, just last night I found out (by accident) that they have 2 separate group chats without me. One being the whole friend group minus me, and the other being just my roommate, two really good girlfriends we made, and another kid I'm good friends with. Now they are still really friendly with me and everything is all good, I just feel like the fear of them not liking me is starting to dwell, and it sucks that it's happening during these last few weeks. I fear that when I just get home for the rest of the semester they are not going to reach out or even catch up with me. I've struggled with friend groups in the past and this just adds more to my lonely side. I have no clue what to do, and whether or not I should confront them. I don't want to dwindle on this but it hurts having to constantly go through this. I know they are keeping it a secret, as they spontaneously make plans within the group chat and since I'm around due to being friends with them, it's like they have to ask me to come along. I've tried my best these couple of months, being there for them and helping them out like one should do to me, as I live by the rule of treat others how you want to be treated. Just really stuck and confused as to why this is happening and what to do.

TL:DR - Friends made 2 separate group chats without me in it. I thought they liked me as a friend but now I feel like they are just including me since they are friends with my roommate.",lonely,Found out by accident that my friends made multiple group chats without me...,2020-11-15 08:48:39

2155,lmtmarigold,1605390507,1,"A little backstory: I’ve been medicated for 12 ish years and I’m now starting to come off of these medications, as I’m in a much healthier space and felt it was time. I’m doing really well in general, but struggling with some pretty simple emotions because, well, I’m not used to feeling them. 

I just moved across the country to a new state, in the middle of a pandemic, after getting out of a highly controlling and toxic relationship. I’ve always been introverted and haven’t had much experience with dating, besides a handful of people as a teenager. 

Now in my new state, I’m doing well and I have family around me (I didn’t before) and I’m kind of starting anew. It feels good and it feels right. However, now that I’m coming off of my medications (with the help of a doctor, obviously), I’m struggling a lot with one thing in particular: loneliness. I never really felt it before, or if I did, it was just in the background. I just have this extremely strong urge and desire to just have someone who cares about me, and someone I can spend time with. It’s not so much that it’s even strictly sexual or romantic, although I’m sure that is part of it, but these feelings are overwhelming my everyday mindset and thoughts. It feels constant. 

Right now, in a new state, in the middle of a pandemic, it’s really hard to make any sort of new friends or date casually. It’s very difficult for me normally, as I’m pretty shy and introverted and have an anxiety disorder, but especially with all of this. I just don’t really know how I should cope or if there’s really anything that will help.",lonely,Feeling feelings.,2020-11-15 08:48:27

I don't know what's wrong with me and why I can't ever be happy. 

I feel so disconnected from everyone around me, even my husband. I feel like they live in an entirely different reality than me. When I try to express how lonely I feel, I don't feel like anyone truly knows what's going on. So I let it go, try to forget, but always end up back here sooner or later.

I sit here and daydream endlessly about people who don't exist, people who could fill that void. And then I hate myself for taking the real people in my life for granted. But I don't know how to exist in the real world. 

I've almost self sabotaged my relationship many times. Never cheated, but definitely tried to get him to leave me because I was so miserable. I really don't ever want to hurt him, he doesn't deserve that and I wouldn't ever be able to forgive myself if I did. But my loneliness gets so overwhelming that I scare myself. I keep asking myself how long. How long until something snaps inside of me and I do something to ruin the relationship I've built with him. How long until my self-sabotage catches up to me? 

I know these feelings stem from years of never feeling good enough for anyone. And even when I am, I can't see it. So I fuck things up because I can't stand my own happiness. I just wish I knew how to change it.",lonely,I don't feel like I'm ever satisfied,2020-11-15 07:38:56

We lived a quiet, happy life and spent our time off-roading, camping and traveling. I had a FB but never really used any other social media sites. It took a while for me to come to terms with it ending but I finally like myself again and decided to try online dating. Big mistake. I do not feel comfortable dating more than one person at a time but recognized the fact that the men I was interacting with would be. Messages were flowing in faster than I could respond and I became completely overwhelmed. Had a few decent conversations and agreed to meet up with a guy in person. We had fun and I texted him the next day. Never spoke again. Met a second guy in person and had a great first date, spent hours talking and I appreciated his intellect. Great second date the following day. I realized I was moving a lot faster than most people tend to and I had zero walls up. I started overthinking. By the third date I felt anxious and wanted to know where it was going but did not feel the timing was right to have the discussion. There were a lot of red flags. I feel like I fell in a research rabbit hole and blocked him without saying anything. I firmly believe he is not who he says he is. Feeling lied to by this one person I hardly even know, hurt my feelings way more than it should. I panicked and deleted my dating and Reddit profiles. After that, I have had zero contact with strangers in person or online and feel lonely all of the time. I have a good job that takes up most of my time, great family and friends but my life partner is missing from the overall happy equation. I want to learn how to be happy without a man. This last person made me feel scared in a way I never want to feel again. The hopelessness and thoughts of not being able to openly trust anymore saddens me. I also realize my “all-or-nothing” nature is not healthy and need to tone it the f down. I want to focus on finding friends and have come to terms with living in a non-existent sex life for the time being.

I mean don't get me wrong I live with a wealthy parents and all that but the thing I want the most is a girlfriend. Over the years I have been cheated on 7 times in the course of 2 years. That's a ton! I feel like everytime I try to ask someone out cause I like them and they ""like"" me I most likely get ended up cheated on. Unfortunately every single relationship I've been with has been cheated on and I feel like I'm in a place where I can't date anyone. I see myself as very unlucky dating wise. All the girls I've dated are really cute but like I said they all cheated on me with other guys. I have no clue what to do in this situation cause my friends are my best friends and they joke around with me cause I don't have a girlfriend and they do. It's not fake friendship we've been friends since 2nd grade. All of my friends have girlfriends and I feel like I'm the only one in my friend group who doesn't have a girlfriend. Im not rushing anything at all, I'm very patient and respectful in my relationships. I treat them well and give them the utmost respect. I treat them like family. But I always get cheated on in the end. Should I just give up and stop dating entirely? Or should I just wait till college or our of college? Please let me know. I need answers cause I'm just sad that I'm in a place like this which it feels like I will never get out of. Thanks for reading this. Much love! xqcL.

2190,yaschtayne,1605371358,1,"i think it started when i was 4 years old, i have aways been cast aside, at first and for many years, i didn't understand why, nor how  or what to do, but when i was 9 YO we moved home, so i strangely became interested in many things ( a lot) of of them was human behavior.

when i was twelve, i understood, humans are selfish , but i was tired of always beign alone, in middle school, i became the guys who knew everyone, the was not one person i didn't know around me, i learned to adapt and change my speach and behavior dependingon who i'm with, for a while, it worked, i was always able to find someone to talk to when i went to school, i was THE guy.

then came highschool, with it came facebook, that's when i realized "" i'm alone "" that's when it truly sunk in, if i sit down , no one would approach me ( i spent months without talking ), by the time i finished  highschool, 5 friends, might sound nice, it isn't , not when you see everyone around you making plans and hanging out , yet no one ever remember you exist, the fact that they call you friend, and forget you exist, it makes you see upclose what you are not invited to, and it hurts.

fast forward, today, 24 Yo:

\-I had relationship experiances( i was cheated on , i had a normal one where i was dumb i i dumped her for no particular reason, and a real one where we saw we weren't good for each other ( it became toxic)

\-I'm pretty good when it comes to manners( your typical ""nice guy"")

\-I tried everything i wanted to (writing a book, making a video game, doing all sort of sports, learn magic,music,  play video games on crappy pc,  and much more)

\-I Had my licence degree in hotel management ( about to finish the master degree this year  )

\-I have 2 people i can call ""friends""

but there is one thing, i have always felt alone , and the worst part , is that in my last relation ( the beginning) i learned what it truly means to have someone that cares for you and give you time and attention, i know how it feels , and i realized how horrible this feeling of emptiness and loneliness is.

i could see myself how ichanged, how i became awkward, how hurt i am, no matter how or what i tried nothing changed.

i'm hurt , i don't know what to do about it nor if it will ever change, for now all i can do is plan for stable life , hope for the best and prepare for the worst.

i wish i knew, maybe then everything would be better, finally

i really think this was supposed to be the year it happened to me, i was finally going to find someone and just, be happy...just the two of us

many other people did it, so why couldnt i?

why cant i?

i really thought this year i was going to be showered in kisses, love, just happy stuff finally happening to me...i was going to have someone to cuddle with, or play videogames, someone i can make gifts to and just, someone that i can make happy just by being myself...just by being here...

i was going to have someone that cared...about me, just, someone that cared if im ok or not, or even if im alive or not...just...someone that cared

the only thing i always wanted, since i was a child, was to not be alone...and i really thought this year i was gonna make it...i really thought i was so close, i really felt i could hear someone calling me ""love"" and the happiness that comes with it...i could feel, at my fingertips, the warmth and fuzzyness that comes with true happiness...i could feel someone caring about me...

i dont understand, there are people that even get more than one boyfriend, i dont get it, i cant even get one and they have two or three, im not asking for much, i just want one...but of course, its not like i could get one anyways

it'd be a miracle if after this year someone loves me...im just a disaster, i mean, i was a disaster before, but now i just think its worse...i guess that's what i always do, everytime i try to get better, i end up worse and worse...i try, i wanna be better, cause if someone loves me someday, i wanna be the best me i can be...but at this point, maybe i should forget about someone loving me...i dont think its gonna happen anyways

whatever i try, it seems that its just not enough...its never enough

why am i not enough?

everyone else is...why cant i? what's wrong with me? im not asking to be perfect...i just...i wanna be enough for someone to like me...so i can be a good boyfriend and just, be happy, the two of us

I had someone that loved me, and believed in me, i could do any fucking thing...but well...it seems i actually wasnt good enough for him...

it seems like im not good enough for anyone...i cant get it right, no matter what i do, i cant ever get it right

I'm in my late 20s and I've got no one. I used to have some friends before, but I left them because (now my ex girlfriend) told me to stop talking to them and was checking on my stuff 24/7. I agreed to all of this, because I knew that we were meant to be and we'll be together forever no matter what. She was the right one.

About a month ago she left me and my friends do not forgive me for leaving them. Also, my ex and I spoke around 3 weeks ago and she said she's going on a date and she's often out with her friends very often as well, so she obviously doesn't need me.

I used to cry every night and sometimes I woke up because the pain is unbearable and I just cry a lot, however I tried to move on, so I made Tinder and I just took a selfie (a very current one) and matched a girl and she always told me how cute and sweet I am and even liked my personality. So we met up in person and she almost immediately told me that I look very cute and I'm very sweet but I'm not her taste and she left and well... I deleted Tinder. I swear, I didn't Photoshop my profile picture or anything but just took a selfie without putting a lot of effort into it. I guess she saw me as a whole and was like: ""Naaah"". What makes it worse is that I wasn't hoping to score or anything nor even date her. I just wanted to spend time with someone. I feel really crushed.

All of my relatives that are even younger than me have families and are married and I've got nothing. If anybody's reading this: Don't give up your friends for your girlfriend. Even if it feels like that you'll be together forever, bought promise rings, swore that you'll never break up and will always be there for each other no matter what it means nothing.

She moved on and is with another guy and I'm all alone and broke. The ""friend"" I had won't even borrow me 400€ even though three years ago I gave him 500€ and told him that he doesn't need to pay back. He's not even a friend. He sometimes messages me but about himself and even if I tell him my problems he keeps talking about himself.

I don't know what to do and how to meet new people. Especially now during the lockdown. Even my family lives far from me and I can't go to them and take time off because the borders are closed.

How do I meet new people? How do I move on?

All with the mindset that I just wanted the best and wanted everyone to get along again. Turns out my friend didn’t see it that way. That I was invading privacy and breaking trust. That I was sticking my head into something I shouldn’t have and that I overshared what he spoke to me about. And it made me realize. I was. He proceeded to call me a snake and that I have lost his trust completely. Spiraling down into my thoughts. I really decided to ask myself. What are “friends?” (Putting into quotes since I’m trying to figure out what a true friend is.) I started over analyzing the each of the people I call friends and recalling if anyone gives as much as I give into our “friendship.” And to put it bluntly. Rarely anyone I talk to does. So many times have I reached out to them asking how they are doing, if they are doing good mentally, and generally just trying to show that I’m there for them. And what I noticed is that there have only been 4 people in my life that have actually reached out the same way. And yes, better to have 4 then none, but coming to the realization that there were a lot of people who don’t show the same care I show hurts. It hurt a lot to realize that I feel lonely. I’m going to push on though, and try my best to focus on and appreciate the people that are there for me and give the same type of friendship that I give. I wrote this as a way to vent and a way to help myself realize that I am not alone. Thank you for reading.",lonely,“Friends”,2020-11-14 21:10:12

We just talked about kind of everything - coronavirus, the recent election, ruined summer plans and all sorts of thing. I remember grinning a lot during the conversation. It really sucked cause i knew we had to get the assignment done and that’d be it. And i feel like I can’t really reach out again cause that’d just be weird. Anyway, we were done with the assignment and we kind of said goodbye and ended the zoom call. I felt so down afterwards cause i realized how socially deprived ive been and how bad i crave a good conversation :( and how much i miss being into someone. Talking to this person just made me feel so excited again for some reason. This was literally my first conversation with someone since semester started and i never felt so damn lonely.

2229,Universal__gaming,1605340375,1,"I’m a 21M who has severe mental disorders and I really struggle with loneliness. Ever since I was a child I have been treated lesser than by most people including my parents/family because of who I am. I can not control how I was born, I did not choose to be this way but I am the way I am and I came in terms with it as I got older. I learn to love my different mind and try to use it the best way I can although it’s can be struggle. One of those biggest struggles is interacting with people. On surface, I am great with simple and usual interactions but I am terrible with building deep and complex relationships. I manage to create complex relationships with a few people throughout in my life, however I don’t try to keep those relationships intact. I can be very good friends with someone for a while but eventually I end up not caring for it. And because of it, most people just cut me off like nothing ever happened. I simply was forgotten and for some reason I’m relieved by it.

The truth is I resent people in general. It a huge irony for me because I believe in judging all individuals in a fair manner. However, the trauma I endured from being treated like garbage by many people still affects me to this day and it still happens to me. It made me more untrusting and paranoid of everyone intent. It made an semi-isolationist and guarded person. I don’t want to open up nor be vulnerable to anyone. I feel as if some people just want deep connection with so they exploit me as it happened in the past. I feel like the reliable person I have is myself as I find others very unreliable. All the friendship I have made, the people that I earn their respect, I end up rejecting it. Due to how differently my mind works, no one seems to understand who I am, my desires, my idea, my perspective, my struggles, and my life. I want to be alone but unfortunately our biology and psychology prevents that as we are naturally social beings. 

I wish I never felt this way. I wish my upbringing was different so I could love society instead of rejecting it. I really feel resentful for all the pains I had to go through as mentally challenged individual who only wanted love and acceptance from my community, my family, my former friends and partners and my fellow humans. I’m currently getting professional help and it been a year so far, I still feel this way. I do not hate people nor will I ever hurt anyone. I will never cause nor wish harm on another person even if they harmed me. I believe people can change for the better and Human societies can improve. I am a transhumanist who want to see the best future for humanity through technology and space travel. Also as a Sci-fi geek, I always had a fascination with aliens and advanced AI. I sometimes imagine what it would be like to interact with other sentient beings who aren’t human. How bizarre they would be.

She agreed and i got everything ready. 
Now that I'm here in chicago, over 600 miles from home, she's been making excuse after excuse and this is making me feel very lonely and somewhat frustrated. This would be the end of it and i wouldn't be posting here of it was just a rejection story, but it isn't and here's why:
It seems to me that the way things are going with this girl is a perfect analogy to what my entire life and every project I've undertaken has been. I have always struggled to make socalled friends, and making deep connections with them has been almost impossible. I've always felt that I'm not enough and that I'm simply not desirable either as a friend or as a romantic partner and this case even if i tried not to, only makes that belief stronger in me. 
I've tried joining groups, clubs, going to bars/clubs (before covid), and becoming more active in college activities. And yet, haven't managed to make a new friend in years, let alone get a partner. Even tho I'm quite fit, and not bad looking at all. People just seem to have a weird aversion to me for some reason. Even when me and my best friend meet new people, they always go for his contact information and deal only with him when making plans.

2237,ChonkyCharley,1605334101,1,"I love my family to pieces.  I love them to the moon and back.   I am not suicidal so I'm going to say that right off the bat.  I literally so happy with my life.  I have great grades,  i got into a college,  i got a good head on my shoulders.   I am a go getter.  I am an outgoing guy who enjoys power lifting, hiking, reading, i love poetry!  I love people!  Oh how I LOVE talking to people.  I am just always happy!  People make me laugh, but they also make me feel lonely.  Finding love is very hard for me.  Its nothing to me but its still a subconscious thing that hurts.  , turning 18 in less than half a year.  I meet so many new friends.  I have close friends.  Except this list is always changing because i can't keep them.  Day and night i think about what my friends are doing.  I try to plan outings or just places to hang out.  I feel like i am always carrying friendships or relationships.  I do care about myself,  but what hurts is that i can't seem to find someone who atleast cares SOMEWHAT.  Its making me sad.  But everyone always asks me how im happy.  I tell them i am happy all the time because i just want everyone to have a good time.  But nobody cares if im having a good time.  I know is selfish of me but its hard to bear.  My friends don't give a shit about me.  And yes, there is a Woman i have taken interests in because she is fucking gorgeous and she doesn't see it because she's so Damn insecure.  She's funny, but at the end of the day,  she doesn't give two shits about me.  Im tired of trying to care about myself.  I already have passions but no one to share them with.  Relationships don't feel real,  whenever i ended up in a relationship was because i was something i was not.  I just want a woman who would give a fuck about ME.  MY personality.  I could return the favor 1000 times over.  But no,  that turns women off.  Because then theres no mystery.  They don't have to try.  God damnit i just want to hold some one.  Someone i can watch the stars with, spend time with,  to cuddle with.   Someone who LOVES me.  And i cry sometimes.   I still admit that much.  Because it hurts on the inside every time i talk to people but for whatever reason,  they make me feel a little happy when they just simply converse with me.  Because its more human contact than i get ever.  And i am not an introvert at all.  I just feel like it doesn't matter to them if whether or not im around.  Whats the point.  Countless, sleepless days.  I put this  mask on. So that no one can see how insecure i am about being lonely.  I sleep whenever i am lonely so that i may forget i am lonely.  I just wish i could love her for who she is but she'll never return the favor.  Cause love is a fucking game to you isn't it?! You take joy in imagining me crying myself to sleep?  You think you can just choose a man like you're shopping?  My feelings and passions are real but they can only shield and protect me from the cold reality for so long.  I moved on but its hard to move on when every fucking new friend and new woman are the same as the last.  ""Oh.  You didn't actually give a fuck?  You just wanted social status? Validation? You didn't think i had feelings?  Oh you don't want to go for a walk with me?  You don't want to hang out?""  All these people i keep uncoincidentally running into are fucking slates.  Brain dead.  And its driving me crazy.  True love is not real because nobody is ever 100% committed.  They like to keep options open to upgrade and cast their last option aside.  

Im done.  I am a good man.  But i am done.  Done making people happy.  Finished.   Now i await my inevitable death by myself.  Whether it be tomorrow, today,  the next week,  year,  or 50 years.  Whatever time it may be, i am ready.  Because i have gotten nothing out of living.  My family is the only thing that keeps me tied to this green earth anymore and those people i hold dearest will eventually just be nothing but bones, my little sister, my little brother,  my mother,  my father.   Everyone i love,  gone. Just me.  Myself.  Eternal nothingness.  I think about it everyday.  

People love me, but nobody likes me.

I’m still here, awkward as fuck, single as hell, and getting more depressed by the day. I thought once I quit my job I’d feel better, I thought once I got out of highschool I’d feel better.

I'm pretty introverted, mixed with covid, and I'm also on probation so I dont get out as much as I used too. Drinking used to make me feel social for awhile and then it just turned into a self destructive behavior. People that don't know I'm on probation always tell me to go out to bars to meet people and I feel like for right now I really shouldn't do that. I dont think id be pressured into drinking or anything like that but I just don't want to put myself in that position, I only have like 4 or 5 months left so I dont want to ruin that. I dont know how to meet new people anymore and I feel like if I dont start getting out more and putting myself in social situations I never will, which with covid thats not really an option right now.

I just want someone to care about me like I care about other people. I dont lack confidence so much as I lack the initiative to really put myself out there. I'm sure this all sounds stupid or at least like its easily resolved but it really isn't. I live in the mountains and there's not much to do around me which is one of the reasons I started drinking, and then I was depressed and would try and drink my feelings away, and I mean everyday I would get off work, go to the liquor store and get a 6 pack, a 12 pack, or a 750ml of hard liquor and drink it all in a night and repeat that every day. That didn't help anything and I got myself into some trouble and at first being sober was nice and I was finally feeling like my head was clear and then over time about a year I just started to feel more and more lonely and then covid hit and its just been getting worse and worse.

Guy 3 she posts on her private stories with all these inside jokes and stuff with them, she dated this guy before for a long period of time, it makes me really fishy... i have been wanting to talk to her about it but I feel like I’ll just get told that I’m controlling and overreacting.

I (31F) am a single mother. I have been fighting health issues for a few years.. My last surgery was a couple weeks ago. I had thought I finally found a safe group of friends during quarantine. But I was wrong. I am very down and hurt over it.

Some back story. I had a very rough childhood. I was raised in a cult and not allowed to make connections. I was married with kids in my teens. Their dad ran off and it's just been us 3 for the last 10 years. My oldest has a terminal illness as well.

I kept falling into toxic communities because I wanted SO bad to find connections. I've done volunteer work with numerous organizations. But here I am. On surgery number whatever, pushing myself too hard. My therapist is my emergency contact.  

I look at my wonderful children, the awards for things I've accomplished. I've had an interesting life. But, I've never experienced things like forehead kisses, or someone bringing you soup when you're sick. I haven't even hugged another adult in... 2 years? 

I've been in therapy for trauma and I've been working on myself and my career. But I feel like it's all worth nothing. I have no family or close friends. When something good happens I have no one to tell. Award dinners I sit alone. The only person who calls me is an ex, and it's mostly to talk about geek stuff. He doesn't believe in affection.

I wish I knew why things are this way. Wish I knew what was broken in me so I could fix it. I don't know if I will survive my health issues and wish I just knew what it was like to be cared about by choice.

Anyway. Thank you for letting me vent here.",lonely,"Lonely, broken mom",2020-11-14 12:27:07

One moment I'll be watching something and laughing and just being ok in general, and literally 5 minutes later I will be so lonely that it physically hurts me, and then it will build up for a few hours until I breakdown into tears. This is happening even more often now that I am newly single and the heartbreak has been hitting me hard.

2276,Andrei___,1605309565,1,"On 12 July 2020, I messaged one of my childhood friends and I asked him if he wanted to spend the night outside with me. I asked him if he's hanging out with his friends and he told me that he's hanging out with 2 of them on a hill in the city with a water tower on it. That Hill is one of my favorite places on Earth, so I told him I'll meet them there. I introduced myself to his 2 friends and we enjoyed the breathtaking night view. Of course, I kept quiet for some time at the start, but eventually we found some things we could talk about while listening to music and relaxing. We even saw the ISS shortly before climbing down the hill. I followed them on Instagram, they went home, but I remained outside for a bit. We also saw an immaculate white light appear out of nowhere behind us, but that's a whole nother story.

&amp;#x200B;

Three days later, I met them again (except one) and we went to the same place to do the same thing. We practically hung out every night, all four of us, in our favourite neighbourhood, just chilling. We never hung out during the day at the start (I was mostly spending time alone during the day), because they're longboarders and at that time I didn't have a longboard, so I couldn't cruise with them. They also hung out with others in a big group.

&amp;#x200B;

Gradually, I started to get to know the other guys and girl that were a part of the big group and we started to hang out during the day as well. I also got a longboard because almost everyone in the group has one, so I started crusing with them too. I remember hanging out in a forest with them, hammocks and all, meeting more and more people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've made so many great memories with them during these 4 months. I'll never forget climbing that water tower with them, looking at the moon through my binoculars and taking photos, chilling in the forest, spending time at the skate park, etc.. I'll make countless more memories with them, that's for sure.

I don’t ever want to be in a relationship again and feel extremely lonely because I feel like I’m making too big of a deal about it. 

Posting on my throwaway account for obvious reasons, but for some context I’m a pretty sweet well-mannered girl. I was raised Christian and still am (with very liberal believes, however). I met this man a week ago, and let’s call him John. I met him and he seemed very nice. The next date we went to his apartment and had a make out session. It was nice, but it was odd because he wanted to make me, someone under 21, drink (I found he’s 28 but I thought he was at the oldest 22). Red flags should of been going off, and he pressured me to get naked again. I obliged, but I felt really uncomfortable and denied him the first couple of times. He did some other things I wasn’t really comfortable with and kept asking me why I was still a virgin and why I haven’t had sex with a guy I had been seeing for a while. Well, although I’m not the most conservative women in the world, I still don’t want to do anything involving his penis quite yet or even have sex until after marriage. I’ve been assaulted before and I want nothing to do with it until I’m ready. Well, he pulled down his boxers anyways. I told him to put it back on, but he questioned me before reluctantly doing it. 

Well, last night was different. I’m in an extremely hard major and I really just wanted to study with him last night since he graduated UCLA with a 4.0. Didn’t want anything to do with physical intimacy. Well, he took off my shirt anyways when begging me to make out with him and played with my boobs. He then set a timer for 15 minutes. Wasn’t too comfortable with it, but I let him do it anyways. Next, he asked me if he could put his penis on me. I instantly replied no. Looking angry, he asked me why I wouldn’t have sex with him and when I was going to. I told him after marriage. Well, can we at least cuddle then, he asked. I agreed and it went pretty well and I was enjoying it until he pulled off his boxers again. I told him no again, but reluctantly agreed to give him a handjob instead of a blowjob when he wanted me to play with (I’ve never done anything like this before, I haven’t even had a boyfriend). I did it but after he spilled his juice I felt sick and handed him a tissue and told him to put his boxers back on. Now, he was even more angry with me and just went silent as he wiped his penis off. I got off the bed and went and did my homework while he took a phone call (he’s a resident surgeon). He was pissed, and refused to talk to me. 

I knew the look. I got it from one of my parents all the time and learned to fear it the second I saw them with it when they got home. I did my homework, shaking and wanting to cry. I wanted to go back to my dorm, yet I was scared he would try something if I tried to leave. Lucky, I got one of my guy friends to call and make up an excuse. I felt sick and hastily packed my stuff together while assuring him nothing was wrong. I’m sure my face give it away because he got apologetic and was begging me to stay. I hightailed it out of there. I couldn’t even get my homework down and broke down crying in the bathroom stall to my mom. I feel so dirty about it all and just want to shrub myself clean. I still smell his cologne in my hair and I feel physically sick. I don’t ever want to be in a relationship. This is too much and I can’t stop shaking. I can’t even focus on studying for my test that desperately need to ace. 

I promise you I’m not a slut. I just wanted to have a boyfriend who was also my best friend. Am I really that uninteresting that all men want from me is sex?",lonely,"Almost Got R*ped the Other Day, Starting to Reconsider Ever Having a Relationship",2020-11-14 07:04:34

Even though I'm in a specialised diploma course, I still don't know if I really want to pursue that career path. I'm so stuck. Looking back, I realise that I never knew what I truly wanted. I never had a goal or a purpose in life in the first place. Telling myself to find one seems easier said than done. No matter how much I think, no matter how much I float by and try to find something, I have nothing. It makes me wonder, ""Was I born onto this Earth to be used by everybody? Am I just the background character for everyone?""

My boyfriend has different groups of friends. Even if I'm gone, it wouldn't matter much to him, wouldn't it? Unlike him, I have no one. Majority of his friends are guys so it doesn't matter to me much but at the same time, I've been surrounded by guys who are the scum of the earth (eg encouraging cheating etc), it makes me think that all guys are that way. In turn, it makes him think I'm crazy from time to time, whenever I freak out. The girls I've befriended either hated my guts or I hated them. My childhood friends outcasted me, or maybe I might have pushed them away. I've never formed a proper friendship bond. I guess that's what I crave the most. I want to know what's it like to be 'sisters' or 'family' with friends. I want to be able to laugh and be confident and be 'hyped up'. No matter how much I try, I can never form a connection with anyone, I'm jealous of people who have different groups of friends they can hang out with or make jokes with.

I've posted on this subreddit before, but I would like to provide some details about myself and how I perceive my own nature to be, because I feel the need to put my thoughts into context; if that is alright, please. So, I quite an introverted individual who is quiet nearly all of the time; it is being that quiet that seems quite natural to me, it is state of internal, emotional comfort, along with physical comfort to. There are other reasons beyond introversion that could explain this - including my recent Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis - but talking and conversing is an absolute struggle for me; I believe it is because of introverted nature that I simply do not enjoy or hold much interest in conversation.

Ugh, okay, I am sorry if that previous expression came across as horrifically blunt, it is not my intention to be directly mean or anything; I am just trying to communicate that conversation and talking aren't things that spark joy for me- it depresses and saddens me, because the ability to maintain a friendship (especially with peers) seems to sit on a foundation of being able to engage in regular conversation that holds a degree of excitement of whatever shape or form. As odd as it may be, this is even applicable to texting/messaging, my preferred form of communication, at least, when distance is involved - I feel as expectations are imposed upon me to be charismatic and exciteable in conversation,  but it such a painful trial of fear and discomfort for me. 

Please, I should clarify that I am not dismissing communication altogether; something I do enjoy is when I have an oppurtunity to be an empathetic listenter for somebody; listening has been something of a strength of mine for a while and it warms my heart when I can be of support to others by simply being a present and understanding listener. Otherwise, an ideal friendship to me would be someone that was comfortable with my regular silence- and it's not a creepy idleness, like, I am fascinated by the idea of spending time ""alone, together"", such as doing our own thing in proximity to each other, simply appreciative of each other's presence. Otherwise, I yearn to be able to quietly enjoy my interests with someone else- like, I used to have movie nights with friends from school and I sorely miss that- there wasn't an expectation for conversation, we were just sitting quietly, dowing processed calories, and enjoying a movie together.

Ok, I am so sorry, this will be the last ""thought paragraph"" I'd like to express, and then I'll be done rambling- I understand that I seek seems to imply a necessary level of intimacy with another individual. I think this idea of intimacy might discomfort me in terms of the physicality of it- like, I do have a personal bubble. I have been through cuddling before and I felt suffocated, trapped, and unable to break free- like, I think I do yearn for an emotional intimacy that allows for the comfort of silence and time spent ""alone, together"", but it's the physical component that is highly discomforting to me.

Honestly I have tons of good friends and people who care about me and people who check on me but that’s not the problem. Overtime I’ve been with my friends one by one all of them end up finding someone they want to be with. Slowly but surely I’ve become the only one without anyone. And it becomes more clear everytime I see them. In pictures it’s all of them in couples and me on the side. I don’t get invited places any more because it’s couples only. I can’t get on the phone with them anymore because I just can’t relate to what they are saying. It’s like I’m just meant to be that person. The one that is just meant to be alone. Do I not deserve to be happy? Do I not deserve to be someone’s favorite person? I just want to be the first person someone calls. Someone I can share music With and tell how my day went. I sit everyday and just wait for her to come and she never does. Every night it’s the same feeling. And as much as I hate it I just am at the point where I just want to accept it. I worked on myself so much and I’m in the best shape of my life. I have no social anxiety or anything but it’s just me. Nobody looks at me how I look at them. Nobody sits up at night hoping I’ll text them or call them. I just want someone to look at me like how I look at them. I’m just fucking tired of this emptiness in my fucking chest. I hate going out because I know I’m just going to watch them be together and spend time together. And it’s like “oh yeah he’s here”. I hate being the “I’m single again and I need a friend” friend. When am I gonna be someone’s favorite person I don’t fucking understand what’s wrong with me. Sometimes i just need a fucking hug and need someone to tell me it’ll be okay. Someone I can just call.

I was constantly bullied throughout elementary school and middle school. By the time I had reached High School I realized that the few friends that I had were never really friends and just used me to help them with assignments. I was hardly ever invited to social gatherings and when I was, they would just pretend they didn't know me or make jokes about personal things that I have shared with them. At this point this is when I realized they were not my friends. Therefore I no longer associated with them and since then I have hardly made any new friends at all. I'm generally really nice to people that I meet but try not to get attached due to the fear of being used and mistreated like I have in the past.   There have even been times where someone I hardly know will invite me to social gatherings. And at times I will actually go just to attempt to break out of shell in desperation to feel appreciated and actually normal for one. But a majority of the time the new friends that I make will simply just stop talking to me or just use me for there benefit like others have in past which is completely heartbreaking to me. At this point I feel completely hopeless to even attempt to break out anymore. I've gotten to the point where I don't even attempt to approach others to socialize unless they approach me first or if I somewhat know them. I wait for them to come to me, because I feel that maybe they just might be genuinely interested in starting a small conversation or get to know me if they come to me first instead of just putting in all my effort just for it to be wasted.

It started when I was 11, I started secondary school (I’m from the UK) and I moved to a school I wasn’t happy being at initially. My parents wouldn’t let me move because they thought I didn’t give the school a chance but after a few months I kind of fell into a depression and don’t get it twisted I had some happy moments but ultimately I was still sad up until the end of my second year at the school when things were starting to look up. But just in the few months I was starting to feel happy again I got an offer for the new school that I had applied to because my parents finally gave in. I had to move right at the end of my second year and leave some really good friends I made but I still kept in contact with them for the main part. Moving schools was very hard and I managed but was still sad throughout this process but it wasn’t as bad. However this started my anxiety and panic attacks and I still get them to this day sometimes. In my fourth  year I remained sad but I started to take an interest in boys because I never really bothered with them before  as my old school was an all girls school and I wasn’t interested with the boys in my school except one. We flirted throughout year 10 and 11 on and off (fourth and fifth year) but nothing really happened. I felt less sad but this was only because I was distracted by boys because after this I spoke to many but never really catching feelings. It sounds crazy but only for the thrill of it. At the end of last year I decided to stop liking the boy from my school because nothing was ever going to happen and he was a fuck boy but straight after that I met another boy. I fell in love with him and he was my first boyfriend. He ended up cheating on me and ever since I’ve tried to get boys to replace him so I can forget about him and not have to hurt but nothing has worked. Now I don’t have a boy to distract me and I’m alone again after all this time and I’ve realised I’ve never truly been happy.

I then asked her, ""But what if they are not interested in me because of my mental health issues? I used to have many friends but most left me because of my mental health.""

She said ""I doubt that will happen ever again since they left you when they were very young and naive. And besides, there are so many people with mental health issues and I'm pretty sure its easy to find someone out there who can understand you.""

Lmao please, they left me when they were 17, and I'm pretty sure most people at that age knows its a dickhead move to leave a mentally ill person out of their social circle. And for that last line she said, well idk, it depends really. I have talked to a few mentally ill people on reddit and some ghosted me because they can't seem to really help or understand me. (which is ok btw, Im not pissed abt that) But yeah, thats on reddit. But in real life? Idk man, its really hard to make friends with my classmates because everyone already have their own friends and its really hard for me to fit in. And yeah, I know I can join a school club where I can meet new friends, and I did. But instead, I just felt like shit and also anxious because everyone is so outgoing, except me. I decided to leave after a few sessions because I really couldn't take it anymore.

And right now, I honestly really cant tell if my counsellor said the right thing or the wrong thing. I mean yeah, I know I must take the initiative to actually go out there and meet people, but then I was hoping she could at least give me some tips like breathing exercises to stay calm and not get any panic attacks, or maybe teach me some ways on how to make conversations with people (cuz I sound like a dummy when I talk.). But nope, she didn't mention any of that, she just said, ""Go out and make friends.""

Am I overreacting or just acting too sensitive? I was outside on the bus at night and just gave a long thought about what my counsellor said to me and it literally made me super anxious, stressed and I nearly cried (yes Im a bit of a bitch sometimes) and 2 hours later I'm still feeling the same. 

Another reason why I'm worried is that, if my counsellor continues to make me feel worse after each session, I obviously have to change and that can be too stressful for me as I have to go out and search for a good counsellor again. And in my country, searching for a good counsellor is like so damn hard for me.

Bukowski looked down upon lonely people, not people who sincerely liked and enjoyed the company of other people, but people who need other people.

I don't look down on such people, I am such a person, who needs other people, and my grandma is also such a person, and sometimes she calls when there is no reason to call and when there is nothing to say, and then we have a meaningless two minute conversation that stinks of misery, and perhaps she could predict that outcome, but she still calls, and I still call my own people, which I trouble to death with the meaninglessness of my words, and perhaps I could predict that outcome, but I still call, and I still ask how things have been and where they're going, when everybody already knows, nothing's ever going anywhere, things just happen, people just go, and words mean nothing in the everyday life of a world such as this one.",lonely,Lonely people of planet earth,2020-11-13 02:16:40

There was this time, this moment, I wanted to share with you. Truth be told, I didn’t know it would come to me now - but it did, and it hurts.

When we sat by the bed side, laughing till our breaths filled the room, kept in by windows and sealed doors, I felt you - us - and in that memory, in that moment, I felt life as if it was meant to be - alone, but together. Confined yet also free. 

I never knew loving someone was...this easy...and so easy to lose.

Amidst the arguments, the false promises, my blunders and mistakes, you still held me in your arms as if it was nothing and I’m sorry...

I’m sorry that my hands were cold, that my feet ran in the false hopes of some other, I’m sorry I took it all for granted, as if our forevers only ever felt like seconds.

I should’ve never met you...I’m sorry.

I miss you, but your heart is better off with that other

He...to fill your coffee cups. He, to feel the bedsheets warm enough for 2 more mins. When your Sundays feel like staying-ins and watching-cable-television. With sweet kisses and warm hearts with your temples touched with someone else.

He gives you what I couldn’t...but I’m thankful that somebody else has given you another sense of romance, purpose, and some other want in life other than Me.

This loneliness, is needed, to mend myself, to keep me from hurting you, to keep me from living our lie...and I love you for that...

I fall in love easily. Always have, but I'm working on it. Met this girl on a dating app and we met up for some beers. We slept together, which is usually a big no from me that early, as it makes me fall in love way too early. I know I fall in love with an ideal, and not the person. We go on another date, and later she texts me that I'm not the one for her. It hurts like hell, way more than a rejection after two dates should ever do. I reflect upon it, and it becomes apparent that one of the thoughts that make me feel so sad and lonely is the fact that this person is no longer a part of my life, and likely never will be again. In many ways, it feels like the passing of a good friend, and it makes me think that not dating at all will make me feel less lonely than actually going out to meet people.

I told her that I really wanted to try and be friends but I couldn't bear seeing her on social media.

I have always been pretty lonely in my life, but I was feeling okay with that before university. I have a friend who took me to student parties, but I quickly realized that, even with a lot of effort, I am unable to talk to people. I have no conversation and I don't know why.   
My only friend got a boyfriend, and my loneliness started to be very hard endured. I don't succeed to make friends in class, or even on apps. So, I decided to do a student exchange (thinking that maybe it was my environment that made me feel bad). I went to another country and met a man. I fell in love with him, however, he wasn't really feeling the same. We were in a relationship but he never cared about me ... I gave the little I had to this man.  
Unsurprisingly he dumped me. Back in my country, confined because of the coronavirus, I've never felt so lonely.

Growing up, I fell out with my closest school friends. Ever since then, I’ve had crippling abandonment issues, it was a very traumatic experience for me. 
I pushed through and tried moving schools to make new friends, and then to uni (subsequently dropped out) as I couldn’t make friends. 

Somehow, I persevered and pushed myself, and made really really good friends at uni. I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever felt. But now, post graduating, most people have moved home, on to new cities and prospects, and I’m left with less than a handful of friends near me. Next year, all of those friends plan to move on.

However, everything has been taken away from me. I no longer go to one of the clubs as the place is shut due to corona and it’s hard to social distance in a theatre (I volunteer in one) I’m in college in every two weeks now. 

My day has became like this 
Wake up - go to college - go back home - sleep 

On my days off from college 
wake up - stay inside - sleep 

I barely go outside anymore. It’s like I’ve lost the social aspect of life. I only go out for work and with my mum when she is off work but that’s it. I feel so lonely and isolated from the world now. When I see people my age (21/M) look like they are having the best times of their lives, breaking rules and socialising.

I really hope all of you are well or are going to be.
I don’t know what’s happening recently. This summer my ex-girlfriend broke up with me. I was devastated, even more when I learned that she was seeing someone right after. Suicidal thoughts, had to go to therapy.
Now we’re in quarantine. None of my friends are talking to me, I’m always the one reaching out.
I talked to a few girls I met on tinder. The first one, it was going really well, even just as friends, but she ghosted me. Same for the other one. And the last one, we talked so much, it was really nice having someone new and being really talkative with. But just today, she became distant. I asked why, she replied “Oh sorry. Go back on tinder” and ghosted me.
I’m just losing hope guys.. I’m glad I have my family and I love them so much but what about social life ?
Everyone is being really mean for no reason, and I mean everyone I had an interaction with.

2559,Vespid90,1605132783,1,"My biggest dream is to love and be loved. To get married and start a family. After I finally moved out of the parents at age 23 I've started to live with my girlfriend, whom I thought will be the one. Later I found out the hard, she was as abusive and egoistic as my father was. That relationship ended 3 years ago and since then I was chasing my dream of having a SO. I'm 30 in a week and I'm lonely as fuck.

I've met a lot of girls past those 3 years, but every time I was rejected. Usually it was accompanied with sentences like ""I'm not ready for relationship"", ""Don't worry, you will find someone"", ""You deserve better"". I believe it's usual stuff, but normal people, just keeps going and focus on themselves during times of being single. Unfortunately I'm not one of them and it's living hell for me. I'm so deprived of love, intimacy and close connection to someone, I honestly lack reasons to keep going.

I know it's not my fault. I consider myself a good looking, smart, sensitive and nice guy. But it doesn't matter because after every rejection I fall into a pit of darkness I crawled from. It takes months to sort my shit again and start meeting new girls, only to fail. It's a vicious cycle of hope, happiness, pain, sorrow and anger.

I've trusted only one girl enough to tell her about my past. She has responded with words ""I've never met someone more deserving of being happy and who suffered so much in his life"". Yet, she has left me for another guy.

I'm so fucking lonely. The pain is unbearable and I have no hope of ending it. I'm sentenced to be lonely. All of this, because some alcoholic dickhead decided to not to use protection over 30 years ago. What is more, same asshole destroyed not only his life, but also mine. Since I moved out, all I do is trying to squeeze out as much as I can from my remaining years on this world.

I've never had anyone reciprocate the interest I've shown in their lives. The people that do stick around tend to use and/or abuse me.

When I turned 22, after a crushing betrayal by two friends I was foolish enough to feel close to, I just kind of gave up. Since then, I've watched myself grow more and more reclusive. More and more agoraphobic, more and more of a neurotic mess, more and more mentally ill. Trapped in the negative echo chamber of my own thoughts. COVID didn't change my lifestyle at all. 

My career prospects are great and I go to an Ivy League grad school right now. I work hard. Damn hard. But sometimes I wonder, is any of it worth it? What am I working toward? My life is empty.

2570,Ditch-baby,1605125613,1," Content warning: mentions DV

29 F, slightly above average face attractiveness, decent body big butt.

Grew up with an extremist father, misogynist, loved putting terror into his children and giving me no freedom.

So I was set up to make bad decisions, not know how to act in relationships.

I’d say from 18 to my early-mid 20s it was my fault that, I would always fight with men and demand too much from them.

I had a baby with a man that was abusive in every way from age 23-28 and finally got away a little over a year ago.

Okay, the last few years I put a LOT of work into myself, reading about psychology, women’s experiences, abuse, did some anger management, and I matured so much in general. 

So I tried casually dating some people, and holy f\*ck.

Feels like everyone just.... uses me! 

The worst part is, they feel like they have to deceive me to have sex with me. Like they have to pretend they like me and want a relationship. 

The last one I met in June and he laid it on THICK. At first I wanted to write him off. But then, I really thought he liked me, and he treated me with so much attention and romance that I let myself catch up to his level. He said so many things to me that you shouldn't say to someone you just want to have sex with. I treated him very well, but didn’t smother him. Never gave him trouble one time. I really was tricked into thinking he was different.

2.5 months into it he meets up with me to say “I’m not ready for a relationship.” me: “I didn’t do anything wrong” him: “you didn’t do anything wrong” me: “how do you feel about me” him: “same way I always felt about you.” 

So basically he didn’t even give me an explanation, those answers are not explanations.

Why did he have to trick me for 2 months?

Anyway, as much as I want someone to love me, I’ll probably never trust anyone again and I’m taking a vow of celibacy because I can’t stand these men using my body and my kindness like this over and over and over.",lonely,Queen of getting used.

Those who stalk my profile probably already know about her, so I'm not going to waste your time. In short I used to (and unfortunately still do) obsess over her, and I have problems with other relationships in my life as well.
The main reason I hate her so much is because I just. Can't. Stop. Thinking. About her. Like for example I kinda hate one of my classmates because she was a close friend of her. Or whenever I see a person who dresses in all black I immediatly think about her. Worst of all is that I don't know why she is so important to me. Like, she has many flaws that I absolutly hate: she's whiny (used to talk about how big of a POS she is to her friends), she's lazy, she was often mean to be, and she was just a cold person in general.
And she also has an effect on the relationships I have. For example if someone doesn't like me, I always think how they would  love Ann if she was there. And it makes me fucking sad because I am never going to be Ann. I will never have cool friends like Ann does. The only people who I consider ""friends"" are always either 
a) just as patethic as I am 
b) an outcast
c) both.

So, um, does anyone else feel similarly? Do you have any tips how to solve my problem?",lonely,"I feel really bitter about an elementary school ""friend""",2020-11-12 04:03:27

My parents separated when I was in 3rd grade and I moved schools and that seemed to be the point in my life when I started experiencing true sadness. Even though I had amazing friends growing up I would find myself lonely crying in the shower for some reason. As I got older and into middle school and high school I found myself friendless. I absolutely hated walking to each class on my own. I also grew up incredibly poor to the point I had to steal to eat sometimes. I was able to change my lot in life when I joined the Army at 17. It took something that drastic to force myself to make friends and to feel like a person again. However, I felt like I didn’t belong in the army. I was into Anime, video games, and MTG. Everyone else was all about getting jacked and shooting guns.  After I got out I found my fiancé who I have been with now for 8 years. I have the best relationship with her and she takes care of me so much. Now I am a truck driver and I can feel the loneliness coming back. Maybe most of this Isn’t important, I could go into more details about it but that’s not what I am here for.  I really would like to talk to each of you that needs someone.

2650,hailey5959,1605069029,1," 

I(23/F) broke up with my ex around 5months ago. it was an obviously toxic but didn't wanna accept for a long time. we only dated for 9months and all the people who know about relationship issues told me it's one of the best things I've done in my life. so I don't regret that we broke up.

I was so lonely, to be honest, so I was looking for a man who can love since a month.

I actually found some guys who were willing to take care of me thankfully but at that time, I was JUST lonely and took therapist regularly also my counsellor told me to not date somebody until I can recover.

well, I'm better than before. not that crazy on looking for a guy. but I've been talking some guys as friends and I don't know some of them.

what I'm saying is, I am of course still lonely.

one of my friends told me that I just need a dick.. and I agreed. I just wanted to have sex with somebody but I'm gonna do due to many worries and JUST DO NOT want to give my body to somebody. what if I start falling in love somebody after just one night stand.. you know what I mean.

one of the guys I'm taking seems to be a good guy. even though I'm not from an English speaking country, I CAN talk to him over 5-6 hrs and we have a lot in common. he has a healthy mind and nice to women. compared to my ex and him, this guy is way better.

I gave so many things so easily in my last relationship and my ex told me he took me for granted and I deserved all the things he hurts because I decided to keep the shit relationship.

since I've heard that, I'm trying to be more careful (when I liked a guy, I just approach. it's not that difficult to be close with somebody to me. so all my relationships were so easy to be broken. because we didn't put many times for the solid foundation.)

but... I don't know I thought I've recovered already even my therapist told me I still NEED time for a relationship...

but. I feel like the guy I mentioned is a good guy but I just want to need my time? I usually spent all of my time on my exes because I thought it was love and it's just what love is. but I don't think so right now.

I can't quite put my finger on what I want to say actually. I'm lonely yes, but I think I need time to be alone. I have so many things to do for my career path and am not willing for a long-distance relationship. but, the guy seems to be a good person. but don't wanna hurt.

do you think I still need time to be by myself?

I get confused and can't tell how I feel to even my close friends...

have you ever felt like that before? if you have, how'd you manage?",lonely,I am probably lonely but don't wanna spend time with somebody for text and call for some reasons..,2020-11-11 15:30:29

I try so fucking hard just to be worth someones fucking time but I never am. I'm cheated on, I'm lied to, I'm never fucking enough. Why? Why do I continue on like this?
I dont feel like me anymore. I'm not the happy kid I used to see when I looked in the mirror. When I look into the mirror anymore all I see is a fucked up mistake of a shell of who I used to be. I used to have so many goals, so many aspirations, that should have been easily attained, but something suddenly changed; I don't know what it was, but it changed, and it changed me with it. Suddenly nothing mattered anymore, I didn't care as long as I wasn't alone, but it caused me to feel worse when I wasn't alone, as though I felt they were there to make me feel better and nothing more. I'm not sure if I can ever be who I used to be anymore, maybe I could if I didn't have the crushing anxiety that if I were to talk about it all, that I'd lose something, a part of myself, so instead I do this. I type out or write out my problems secretly hoping someone will notice, that someone would genuinely care, but I hide it all so it can't happen. Maybe I'm scared of being genuinely happy again because then it'll be that much worse when I'm happy again. Maybe that's why I sabotage my own happiness, time and time again, so I don't have to feel the same heartbreak I used to, when I was myself. Maybe that's why I sabotaged the greatest relationship of ever been in, over something that I knew couldn't be true, something that never even matters in the first place. That's why I turned to alcohol for so long, thats why I rely on nicotine, they numb the overwhelming, neverending thoughts, and sadness, and dread, and anxiety.  They say alcohol is liquid courage. It always gave me the courage, the power to fight off these ailments. Nicotine just takes the edge of my every day life, helps me stay calm when everything just seems to continually crash down around me. But the nicotine,  the alcohol, is slowly losing its edge for me. Slowly losing its ability to loosen me up, and make me feel better. Should I talk to someone? Probably...

My reasons for not joining a while ago are endless. I think it’s because of the lack of confidence, support, friends I had growing up. My peers didn’t like me because as a black girl I acted “white” to them. They would call me stuck up, make fun of me for being skinny, made fun of me for being dark skin, didn’t like that I wasn’t aggressive. What really broke me down when I was in the 6th grade, we had an awards ceremony. When I got called for my awards nobody clapped for me.

As an adult woman, I still feel those same issues I had with my peers in grade school then are relevant today. I see a lot of people expressing hate for “dark skin” in social media. Black girls/women who don’t act “ghetto/ratchet” are marginalized. People who are not aggressive or rude don’t have a huge following on social media.

Makes me apathetic. Go get your ego boost from some other loser. All I am is a corporate slave. I can’t give you nothing.

And what’s with the lack of empathy? Is the only response people have when someone is bleeding their heart out, all you can tell them is “ work on yourself. Find a hobby.” That’s it?

2688,That_Sad_Throwaway,1605054268,1,"So I’m kind of tired of talking to my friends about this because it feels like something I shouldn’t still be upset about. But I just wanted to let y’all know about something that got to me a little more than it should have.

So for the past couple of years I’ve mostly been alone, and I live alone with no roommates. And that’s not something that ever really bothered me because usually I like myself a lot and don’t mind my own company. Prior to that I had been in some unfulfilling relationships that didn’t really bring me the kind of intimacy I desired. So I really stopped putting effort into trying to find someone and focused mainly on myself. I kept the dating apps but didn’t give them much of my focus and attention. The dates I’ve gone on from there have been wholly underwhelming and I really don’t like the dehumanizing aspect of the apps where you start treating people like just an option.

So I was back visiting my home town (about 5 hours from where I live) when I decided to turn my apps on for the hell of it, and matched with this girl that seemed very cool. But I had to return home before going on a date, so I figured it wasn’t something that was going to happen. But to my surprise, we found ourselves talking/texting every day. This girl really seemed to get me in a way I had never experienced before and vice versa, and we quickly started ramping up communication with each other to where it was rare to go more than 20-30 minutes without talking on some platform. We were really investing our time and effort into each other.

And we got deep in our discussion topics. We talked about deep emotional scars, we talked about philosophical and spiritual beliefs, we talked about our moral compasses, we talked about our failures and inadequacies and insecurities. And we continued to focus our attention on each other without flinching even after showing that kind of vulnerability.

And after a couple of months, I was able to come back to my hometown and we finally went on our first date. And it went well! We were able to bring that energy to real life, we set up a future date while still on the first one, we were focused and attentive for almost 5 hours (I don’t think either of us got our phone out or let the conversation dwindle the whole night), and we ended the night with a kiss. Everything was pointing in a good direction.

And then. She gradually started backing away. Each day she seemed to give a little less than the day before. Which really was extremely confusing because usually I can tell if someone isn’t as into me as they hoped on the actual date itself, but that wasn’t the case here. We clicked well in person and the attraction was there. I gave her two opportunities to let me know if something was wrong and each time she said everything was okay. And then she continued to back away. Until she finally went 5 days without saying anything to me at all and I was forced to call it out as what it was, a lack of interest. Ghosting.

And I just...man. It hurt. And it’s been a few weeks and it shouldn’t still be bugging me, especially because we were never even really dating. But when you let someone get a peak that far into your head and then they follow that up by treating you with such little respect....it’s hit me different. It has really made me feel alone and honestly unloveable. It’s exacerbated some emotional scarring that I didn’t even truly understand was there, and it’s making me feel as though I can’t approach my next attempt at dating with anything other than skepticism. Because it didn’t matter how close we had gotten, it didn’t matter how genuinely we connected, and it didn’t matter how happy we consistently were in each other’s company no matter what platform that was. She showed me I didn’t really matter to her.

I know I’ll be fine, and I know I’ll probably end up where I need to end up. But this situation hurt and I needed to let someone know that it’s cut me a little deeper than I care to admit to those around me. It’s flipped a switch in my head that has made me feel less comfortable being alone. And I realize this is probably a sign that I have some issues with my emotional immaturity that I need to deal with, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less.

I have no friends, I used to a friend group some a few years ago but we were never that close and so we kinda drifted apart. I have never had a close friend, I don't know how to maintain a proper friendship. No childhood friends. I was the only child, never was close to any relatives like cousins either. All of my life has been tainted by this feeling of loneliness.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm 20 now and I struggle with alcoholism/substance abuse. My mom raised me alone and she struggled with drinking everyday when I was growing up. That was the coping mechanism in our house. She introduced me to liquor when I was 14. It was like the magic cure to my worries.  I quit that for a while, when I smoked weed every day but I've managed to cut it out now since it worsened my mental state very much and my habit was also too expensive for me. Now that I've cut that out I just can't deal with my life sober so I've turned back to the drinking. Being in school hurts me to see these groups of friends just having fun and living their life. Then I come back to my empty apartment and I just have 0 motivation for anything but escapism. 

Nobody ever calls or texts me. I used to ask people from the friend group out to hang but they never responded back. They all have lives of their own. I'm not that interesting or ""close"" to them. It hurts so much. There's so much I want to share, feel together with somebody. When I come home I feel invisible to the world. It's overwhelming.

I don't want to waste my life and potential drinking it all away but I just can't manage more than a few days sober. The boredom, loneliness, sadness and all just gets to me. I've tried AA/NA but most people there are in their 30's atleast and have partners/families, different life situations. I can't relate. I have no idea how to approach anyone.  I feel like I have nothing but baggage to offer. I'm stuck in my shell.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just so tired of it all. I feel like an old cranky person inside. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel like all of this is my fault somehow. I want to change but I'm running out of places to turn to. I cannot afford therapy right now.

I've also noticed he seems to be trying to run me down, today he referred to me as 'small tits' (I am very slim due to hyperthyroidism, I have little boobs, yes) which has badly knocked my confidence as he knows how self conscious I am of my slender figure...

I have a lot of ideas in my head... but i guess sometimes things dont turn out the way you want them. Always when i try to tell someone about these problems, i am immediately stated the fact that there are people who suffer from worse conditions than yours, which kind of make me more depressed. There is so much more to tell.... so much to share.... yet all alone.. all lonely. I want to thank all of those who read this that they took out the time to hear what i had to say...

I've put up with a lot in my relationship, but it didn't matter to me. I recently moved and thought I would have to be in a long distance relationship, which me and my girlfriend were fine with. The week before moving though, she started to act a little strange, but I didn't want to point it out. Yesterday I found out that she was cheating on me and told all of her and my friends that we broke up. It turns out she was only dating me for sex and that's basically the only reason she's dating people. It honestly was one of the worst feelings I've had when I found out. One of my friends told me because he was dating her and said that she just used me for sex, showing messages to prove it. I already struggle with depression, mostly because of family, and this has made my depression worse. It's only been a day since I've found out so my feelings are still really hurt and I just love the fact that she never really cared about me and was willing to throw me out and find someone new just because I moved.

He went to jail various times, but only when it was reported, 90% of the time it was not. My mother was a victim and couldn't ever manage to pull away. She went a bit nuts over time unfortunately.

2767,hgilbert_01,1604991561,1,"Hi.

Please bear with me; this is my first time posting to this subreddit, so I hope that I am not breaking any policies. I would like to express that I have been contending with significant loneliness as of recent. I'll delve into more detail below.

So, I hope describing my general personality and state of mind doesn't come across as attention-seeking as that is not my objective; I guess I simply feel the need to express this, please- if that's okay. I consider myself to be a highly introverted person; I greatly value my alone time as it provides me with restorative comfort, as well as time to enjoy my interests and hobbies. I almost always quiet in person- being quiet is a state of emotional and even physical comfort for me- I prefer being a listener and it is what I am good at in social interactions. 

Ok, time for transparency; please forgive me if I am a little too aggressively oversharing information about myself with random individuals who I do not know on the internet... I have had a rocky history of getting an established Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis- basically, conflciting opinions between different institutions, but a lot evidence seems to point towards me being on the spectrum. I also contend with really significant anxiety, both in the general and social forms. 

Ideally, I seek a platonic friendship in which I can comfortably be quiet around somebody; please understand that the other individual wouldn't need to be quiet - as long as the alternative isn't too intrusive - , but it is being okay with my silence that I yearn for. I yearn for the experience of ""being alone, together"" - such as doing our own thing, but simply being comfortable in each other's presence or even enjoying common hobbies and interests together. I will also admit that I yearn for the experience of I, an introvert, ""being adopted by an extrovert"" - it have experienced it before and it was kind of pleasant, but as long as I had my alone time too.

2770,xjrsc,1604990318,1,"In the break room, or with co workers, or talking to people online, all I can ever talk about is how miserable I am. I'm lost when someone asks me what's on my mind, or why do I look angry/worried/quite because all I can reply with is ""I'll be fine"" or open up on how I hate every aspect of myself. I avoid these social interactions because I know all I can do is take others down with me. When in a group everyone is happy together but as soon as the conversation turns to me I have no choice to bring the mood down, ""I have no friends"", ""I've never had a girlfriend"", ""I was bullied growing up"". I can't answer when they ask me my Halloween party stories, my relationships, things I do for fun... I don't even like video games anymore. I come home and sleep and feel sorry for myself while I write these posts and delete them morning after.

There is nothing interesting about me, just hate towards myself and people can see this. When speaking to me they talk to me like Im a child, like I need to be fixed. They feel sorry for me so they speak to me as if thats their good deed for the day. I'm incredibly self aware of myself and they treat me as if I'm so socially inept that I can't realize they are talking to me as if I'm a toddler. I'm a fucking adult for Christ's sake, I have no learning disabilities, no mental disabilities, Im a perfectly healthy adult but I'm treated like a subclass human.

I swear to god my cat is the only thing worth living for, everything brings me to tears and I can't function on any level of okay. Its been more than a decade since I've been okay.

My brother cut me off for an unknown reason and even though my family is upset that he did that, they still want to act like everything is normal with him so he doesn’t cut them off too. So after days of arguing with my family to just stand up for me a little bit with him, and them all saying they won’t, I just now finally told them I need space from them.

2784,ChonkyCharley,1604982209,1,"     I am just your everyday average joe.   and am really having a hard time connecting with people.  I enjoy powerlifting, going for walks, talking to people. I crave love, but I never ask for it.  I love people.  I love my family.  I have things MADE for me right now!  I ha e two loving parents who care about me and I love to the moon and back.  I have a goon of a brother that makes me laugh as we share good times.  I made it into a good college.  I graduate within the year, and have met many people on this great gift that life has given me. I am truly thankful for all the things, big or little in my life.  
     I just can't shake this feeling of emptyness.  It is not depression, I can't be depressed, but this thing within me screaming to get out.  So I decided to write it on a Reddit Post, here to seek some advice.  Course I don't need it, but I would be most greatful for the words that you have to say. 
     Most of my life, I have been a very loving and caring young man.  I have been taught growing up that everyone is equal and demands equal respect for fairness whichis my entire moral being.  I was always the positive outgoing guy that everyone loved.  I get along so well with people and have actually been in some good relationships although mine may seem trivial because of how young I am, but I digress.
     My friends I love to death, and I mean that.  I just wish that I could keep them.  Now I'm not pushy, I don't presuure anyone into talking.  I respect that you have your own life to attend to and hey, I totally understand.  What makes me sad is when I feel like I always ha e to go out of my way for my friends and they wouldn't do the same.  I have tried finding new, better friends.  But nobody seems to want to converse with me?  What am I doing wrong? I know I am good enough, I know my self worth but jeez man would it hurt to initiate a conversation every once in a while.  I feel like I am bearing all the weight of these friendships on my back.  Trying to keep them alive.  I just want to talk and nobody wants to.  It makes me feel like I don't  matter to anyone which I know isn't the case because I do matter.  It hurts everyday.  And when i do find a good friend, they do the same thing as everyone else.  Its getting harder to always be happy but I force myself to.  Because pissing and moaning about it wont make .y situation any better.  I feel like that if i use any sentences more than 4 words everyone's minds just melt down and they stop talking. 
    I recently met this really great young lady and she was so respectful,   we were talking and when i thought we were having a nice refreshing intellectual conversation,  she just went cold.  I understood that she must have been busy and told her i would leave her alone if i was impeding on anything and she said that i was fine but she had to go.  I acknowledged this and stated that we'd have to talk again because i thoroughly enjoyed it.  Never heard from her again.  I thought,  ""ok, she isn't right for me.   I will leave her"" which I did, but I noticed everyone does this.   Am I boring or something?  I don't know. But I am TRYING my hardest to KNOW.  
I feel like a ghost, like I don't matter to people if I am there or gone.  
    I could talk for hours and I just wish I could find that person who wanted me for me.  Or even a friend.  I haven't given up, but its just so hard.  I am fine.  I am focused on what's in front of me but its so,

Lonely.

      It's something I have been thinking every night now for years.  It boggles me how all the people I create such great bonds with can be so detached.  It sometimes makes me wonder what's the point?  I just try and try and try.  Reaching.  Reaching for anyone who would just acknowledge that I exist.  I want someone to love.  To love romantically that will hold these same feelings i have.   Another hand to hold.   Someone i can vent to and can vent to me.  Someone to watch the stars with.  Someone to go for walks in the forest with.  Someone to go hiking with.  Some one to hug, to tell them I will never let go.  Some one who reciprocates.  It feels like its so hard to find.  But i search and search.  A lonely limbo
   Sometimes I cry.  I will not lie about that.  I just barely manage to scrape by every day,  but I put up this mask.   Mask of happiness to hopefully help people through theirs. Because I am a people lover.  I want people to be happy.  I always ask people how they are doing,  if we can do something.  Nobody wonders about me and its ok.  It just hurts.  I never forget a smile,  that is true and its hard to forget.  I spend countless, sleepless nights just looking at the moon and thinking about her.  The right one.  
   And people will occasionally ask how I am so happy all the time.  I lie.  I tell them it is because I have a great life,  a roof over my head and a great family, which is true.  I just guess im invisible to everybody.  You know,  i know im not depressed but i think about it.  Then i think about my family and how much i love them and how hard it would be for them.  So if you see someone you love.  Hold on to them.  Never let go.  Life is too short to be shallow to people.  Love life.  Don't hate it.  Please for the love if God don't hate it.  It makes your life harder for everyone else and yourself.  
    Because my petty problems are nothing compared to a lot of other peoples'.  So i think to myself,  ""i have no right to complain about this"".   That's the only thing keeping me tied anymore to this green earth.  My family and loved ones which i am so fortunate to have.  
Some of you may think i just need to get my shit together and you are right.  A lonely fucker like me who has it made shouldn't be complaining.  I just thought I needed to get this off my chest.",lonely,What is so different about me?,2020-11-10 15:23:29

2790,brainblast8008s,1604980508,1,"Growing up I've never really had any friends, and have had to always hang around with my brother and his friends when I was a kid - to which I could tell he got annoyed so I typically stayed away and stuck to myself for most of my teenage and child life.

Even when I made some ""friends"" in secondary school they often never wanted to do anything with me at the time, and as time went on we naturally drifted apart. I used to harm myself alot around 15 - 17 years old because of how lonely I would get and hated myself

At 20 now and even at uni I don't have any friends, no one asks if I wanna hang out with them and the one time I ever had a girlfriend she literally laughed at me when I told her I don't have any friends since she had alot. It really fucking hurt my feelings but I swept it aside at the time cuz I took it as a joke or whatever.

Anyway, even though I'm basically used to being alone and enjoying my own company for the most part, I still get so lonely all the time. My brother literally told me he doesnr like most of his friends yet he treats them better than he does to me, and last year he once brought his friends to our house but got into an argument with my parents saying how he didn't want me in the same room as them and wanted me to stay in my room away from them. Like what the fuck?? Eventually he was made to have me in the same room but it really pissed me off so I didn't say anything most of the night in fear I may accidentally embarrass him further. He doesn't know i heard the whole thing but I did and I know for a fact he's ashamed of me for no reason whatsoever and it hurts alot since he's my brother and I have no friends at all. 

Even recently when his depression got alot worse due to COVID restrictions I started really being there for him, literally always asking how he was and making sure he was feeling good (cooking meals for him if he was down, encouraging exercise, giving him hobbies such as the piano to occupy him, reading up on alot of depression/mental health books) all so he didn't feel alone during this pandemic. And what does he do? He treats his friends way better than me, I've heard the conversations he has with his friends and I wish he would even be HALF as fufkinf nice to me as he is to them. 

It hurts since I genuinely feel like im trying to make our relationship work since I want him to be my only friend but even then he doesn't care about me at all. I've honestly considered self harming again alot recently since its giving me alot of anxiety and shit.

I sent three texts today, yesterday I kind of ended up in a haze where I typed a lot about my experiences with life drawing and some man I used to be friends with who said I’m unsure of my lines and that my drawing lacks self esteem. Her response was being a bit of a devil’s advocate, she already knows I don’t like him and she’s justified or excused ‘given reason to’ his obnoxious and pretentious comments before... to be fair there was a point to the man’s critique underneath his pseudo psychoanalysis, my lines are little faded and not clear cut. But I was sending a lot of texts just trying to work through my feelings, yearning for an in-depth conversation, we’ve texted each other before having in-depth conversations. But she texted me, telling me she was busy, out for a walk and yeah I should have thought that through and I wanted to make it clear that I don’t think people have to reply instantly but she felt she had to remind me. She told me that I am stressed out and it’s stressing her out and she’s only telling me this because I need tough love. I don’t think I was that stressed out, I was about a 5 which is usual for me and then after that text my stress was bought to an 8. Whatever, she’s not obliged to always make me happy/validate me, that has to come from within. It wasn’t stress which makes me text too much, it’s my autism which makes me info dump but because I’m aware of it I apologise and express regret about what I’ve done which only ADDS to the annoying amount of texting. I apologised about texting too much and she texted ‘I’m banning you from apologising now’ and changed the subject. It’s like even my most redeeming quality is defective. 

I wish I had more friends to talk about this with, didn’t just rely on my mum who has an obvious bias. I feel selfish for how much I’ve texted, so maybe it’s good if she decides she no longer wants me in her life, friends come and go and I’m too sensitive about that rejection. It’s just difficult to meet new people at university with everything that’s going on right now and I guess I’m someone who can be quite co-dependent. 

The last conversation I had was about asking her to read my script because she said she would read it this weekend but she didn’t do that. I’ve read her book and all the short stories connected to her universe and some other short stories that are unrelated, she hasn’t read any of what I have written. She puts it down to her ADHD and she’s like ‘oh you know me I’m just a little bit flakey, that’s one of my quirks haha’ and it kind of pisses me off and I sort of feel wrong for feeling that, I know I haven’t been a very good friend either",lonely,I think I’m an annoying and needy friend,2020-11-10 14:15:40

She was pretty much my best friend after that we got to know each other very well and everything went swimmingly i was very happy cuz i actually had someone to talk to who understood (we were the same age) so she kinda understood everything too. But then all of a sudden in December 2019 she just stopped talking and blocked me on everything. I dont know the reason or maybe she thought i was friends with her for some other reasons??. But ever since ive been very insecure and just heart broken at the fact that a friend did that to me less my best friend. I just tend to stay away from people because i will never know what the reason was and dont want that to happen ever again ive been dealing with depression even before but hanging around with these people made me feel happy and every since this incident ive felt nothing but saddness and negativity.

  Since then, I’ve moved on to a new relationship with an amazing girlfriend.

But I’m to go from coming home to the person that you love every single day to seeing your significant other 2-3 times a week has been a system shock for me.

2839,hookrapids,1604956219,1,"When one grows up in an unstable household, since a very young age it tends to speed up their mental development, thus lose their innocence at a young age. A person with such a backround, may be called an old soul, and they usually have a hard time connecting with their peers.

Well, as you can propably guess, this very thing happened to me. Mom has been an alcoholic since I was five, parents got abusive both physically and verbally, and ended up divorcing when I was about 8. Ended up living with dad, thus not having the active loving and caring hand of a mother, for the rest of my childhood and teenage years. Got largely rejected, and bullied at school so was dismissed the privaledge of strong friendships, and the belonging in a friendgroup, as a kid.

When I entered middle-school, I had already seen it all. Violence, gore / sexual stuff on the internet, addiction, true emotional pain, loneliness, existential thread and god knows what else. When I was presented with the opportunity of befriending those middle-school kids, I honestly would've felt like a pedo if I did as I was in such a different emotional level. Thus I yet again ended up with only shallow friendships and further isolation, throughout those years.

At some point, during elementary years the only way I could cope with the immense loneliness and meaningless in my life, was through gaming. This lead to my ever lasting League of Legends  gaming addiction, where I'd spend 12+ h just gaming away, thus wasting most of my freetime and hollidays in such a manner.

Now, that I'm 17 years old and on my junior year in high, it feels like I've finally come to a point where I can sense people of my wavelength around me, but as I've just spent most of my years gaming, watching series / movies, there's really nothing going for me anymore, and I can't even fathom befriending any of em' the way I'm right now, as they have healthy hobbies, strong lifelong friendships, actual goals in life, belong in friendgroups, perform at school, etc... . 

I've got nothing like that going for me, and I'm quite awkward aswell. The usual distaste I've developed for human communication and connection, throughout the years of avoiding it, isn't really helping either, coupled up with higly likely having depression.

Guess, I'll just end up being a loner forever. Maybe someday a nutcase aswell, if I already ain't that is.

Making friends, dating, making money, liking me, my body, liking others, making my mother proud, exploring my talents, keeping distance from any addictions, developing emotional control, being consistent with my principles or even having them are just some of the things that I have solemnly failed to do.

It is not for a smile or act of sympathy here and there that I stop going to bed, every day, thinking that I don't belong here, to anything.

I already masturbated, the gambling money is gone, so I can only wallow in cheap and fat food, even if the only hunger I feel is for life. The last time I celebrated my birthday, I still believed in Santa Claus, in God, well, I held innocence, which, perhaps, is what is needed to succeed.

little information about myself: 
m/23 
single for over 7 years now
missing every single body touch/hug/...
best friend in the military and in another country, mostly no contact here
not too many friends, nobody to talk to about this topic 

at the moment i am sitting in my bathtub and my eyes felt like i filled it with my tears. i got my heart broken again from the same girl. 

throwback five years: we met each other on a dating app, everything looked fine. but the contact disappeared after a few weeks. two years later we chatted again and said we will see us soon. a few days later i sat there like ordered and left at the post office. 

last years: we talked again, but i was out of town, we also talked about feelings. obviously we felt the same for each other. i came back and a few days later she disappeared again. heart broken as fuck.

i tried to manage it to forget her, deleted pics and text messages and also voice messages of her beautiful voice. 

throwback four weeks: she added me on facebook and i asked her if she did a mistake on this one. she said no, now she knows what she really wants. all her female friends blame about her boyfriends and what kind of assholes they are. she told me i would be perfect because i am nice and lovely and would stop the earth from turning for her. but on this day she got tested for covid-19 and was facing a two week quarantine. ok i will survive two weeks. we planned meeting at 0:00 after this „prison“. this should be a sunday, on saturday a verbal fight grew up and she said the second test is positive. so two weeks more. 
i really have a hard time believing this. a friend told me he saw her car next to her work, but i don’t know how serious this information could be. 

on the other side, i live with my father together. he is unemployed and an alcoholic. i never got this attention, only for money since i work almost 15h a day. at night i struggle to sleep because of all those thoughts.

People actually mean to tell me that the scrawny nerds burying their face in a textbook 24/7 at their school were getting laid all the time, FOH. It's quite evident through the ways that women behave that they simply do not view intelligence as a masculine trait. You are literally better off being stupid as a guy if you want to get laid.

My favorite counterargument is ""wElL iNtElLigEnCe iS aTtRaCtiVe, BuT oThEr ThInGs NeEd To Be ThErE aS wElL."" Great, thanks for proving my point. If you need to see a bunch of other traits in a man for intelligence to matter to you, I got news, intelligence isn't one of your priorities. Those other things are what you find attractive.

And I want to emphasize that there's ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS. Women can find whatever they want attractive, it's a free country. But lying straight to the face of men and acting like their intelligence is simply good enough to be attractive to women is cruel. Men need to be taught that focusing on things like grades and academics will not make them attractive to women, but instead alone, and eventually suicidal and depressed.

2859,GeoWtf567,1604946156,1,"Hi,
I’m a teenage girl and honestly idk what to do. Basically since secondary school I just feel like so unimportant and out of my friend group. Like now I’m at college but it’s even worse cause none of my secondary friends went to the same college as me and it was fine at first when I made a few friends but now they’ve gone off with other people and like have separate group chats with them and stuff so when I’m around them, I literally have no idea what they’re talking about so I just go off by myself. Like I don’t want to have to ask to be put in their group chats and introduced to all these other new people that are coming into our original group because if they genuinely cared and wanted me to, they would’ve. 
Also with my secondary friends it’s fine when I talk to them all individually but as soon as we talk in the group chat I’m just completely lost cause they have a whole set of separate inside jokes and stuff and it really hurt on last Wednesday cause they all went to the arcade before this new lockdown was put into force on Thursday and they never even asked me if I wanted to go. And they keep claiming that they’re still my friends but it’s like ??? Cause this is the third time they’ve gone out to do something fun then eat and they didn’t even ask me. 
But it’s so odd cause in primary school I had the bestest friends and it was a nice even mix of boys and girls whereas now I only have 1 guy friend and we were all so close but it’s just like after primary school I was never able to get a proper friendship group that I never felt out of place in. I don’t even know what to do when it comes to friendships now tbh I’m just gonna have to hope uni is better and I actually make good friendships where I don’t constantly feel excluded. But could any of you suggest why I’m consistently being left out? Like I don’t think I’m very annoying and I try to see listen/read/watch all the things my friends like so I can understand them more and be able to talk to them more. 
Like the only thing would maybe be I have very low self esteem but I don’t know how that’d affect my friendships cause it’s not like I put my other friends down cause I feel shitty about myself too",lonely,Hello,2020-11-10 05:22:36

You can really find all of these things in a good novel. 

So yeah read fiction. Walk through another persons shoes.

Its not ever going to fully substitute a real life of your own, but who knows maybe it could spur the courage within you to reach out more and be more vulnerable.

In a world where everyones trying to get ahead and better their careers and whatnot, non-fiction can sometimes add to that obsession. It's nice to put the neurosis away and just go somewhere else entirely for a while.

2900,rivalslayer,1604924563,1,"&gt; “A meal eaten alone and in silence is no pleasure. So I fell into the habit of reading while I ate. In that way I can lose myself completely for a time. The days I don’t read I feel like a barbarian brooding over a chunk of meat” - Richard E. Byrd, Alone.

I remembered the quote all of a sudden, when I realised I have gotten into the habit of eating in the kitchen, over the sink, gobbling up sandwiches and hastily made curries breathlessly. I was just finishing my turkey sandwich. German black bread is usually very tasty, but all I was tasting was dry mush, all the tomatoes and cheese barely registered. I got concerned with the numbness of it all. I wondered if I had become Byrd’s barbarian.

Civil societies take solace in leisurely activities, like dinner, watching theatre, going for a walk etc. I was doing pretty much all of these, but with no pleasure. Everything was dry like the sandwich, a chore, that I knew I had to do to keep myself sane. It was no secret Northern winters are tough, specially when one is alone, and with a pandemic going on, but this was the first time that reality drilled into my bones. The unavailability of human warmth dug deep into my psyche like an open crust mine peeling flesh off Mother Earth. I was bleeding, figuratively.

I fell on the bed; The pillow was still cold and wet. I realised it was wet from my tears. I noticed the faint faint lullaby from Olafur Arnalds’ new album was playing on the stereo. My feet were cold. I closed my teary eyes. 

I was looking at a fjord. It was foggy. J was standing right there, few feet away from me, next to the cliff. She looked at me, and smiled. I invited her to take my hand, she didn’t take it. She turned back and started walking away. I turned my attention to the fjord. It was cold; My feet were cold. I looked down and saw myself barefoot, in my pajamas. My feet were cracked and bleeding, as if I had walked miles in this rocky terrain without shoes. Someone was playing a violin in the distance, it was a sweet sound. I took a step towards the cliff and looked down. The water was calm and milky white. Then I heard my mother calling me. I turned around and saw my mother looking at me, cautiously. I saw my father, taking a photograph of me on his old analog camera. “Let’s go home”, my Mother called out, “It’s cold out here.”

2904,lon82143,1604917990,1,"I met my girlfriend back in 2018 when she was on student exchange in Ireland, she travelled to Ireland from Australia. We got on really well and saw each other the following summer, then met each other on holidays at the start of this year in Bali. That was in December into January. We planned on meeting again in Ireland this year in May and she was meant to stay here for 3 months and then I was meant to go to Australia. Of course none of this happened because of the draconian border arrangements they have, but I don't want to get political. We we're going to travel all over Europe together then travel Australia at the end of 2020 into 2021. Same was meant to happen next year. But even next year this won't happen for a multitude of reasons. 1. Because of the fact that she doesn't know when she can see me, she has purposely made herself lose interest in me because she said it's hurts too much to keep a long distance relationship with someone you don't know when you can see. 2. Even if she chooses to see me next year their border will still be closed. 3. She is very busy next year and doesn't want to travel for longer than a month however you can not travel from Australia unless you're travelling for over 3 months which isn't possible for her. This however was not the case back earlier this year, had it been, I would've seen her by now.  She has applied for numerous exemptions, all were denied.

She has lost a lot of interest in me and we have had so many arguments and extended periods of ignoring each other. The relationship has started to become pretty toxic, nothing is working out anymore and I've become lonely and started to feel depressed. We are back in lockdown now in Ireland so it doesn't help. I have a job to occupy my time but it doesn't help. It seems like it would be a better option to stop talking to her rather than to endure the pain of not knowing when I can see her next. To put things worse she has been really harsh over the whole situation and doesn't make things better. She blames me for the reason we don't talk and blames the border situation but the whole reason we are rarely talking anymore is because they are banned from leaving their own country as if they live in North Korea.

2905,earthsdisaster,1604917100,1,"So.. I have a lot going on in my head lately and have not found a reset button.  Throw away account for obvious reasons..

About 2 months ago, I got drunk and made out with my girlfriends friend.  I am 25 and the friend is 36.  Highly inappropriate but we made out for 10 seconds and I felt extremely guilty afterwards and still till this day feel guilty.  

The next day it happened, my girlfriend found out due to her friend telling her that I was drunk and attempted.  My gf forgave me told me it was a strike one and to never do it again.  So forgiveness happened but I still feel like an asshole.

Moving on....

5 months ago I lost a friendship with my best friend who made a terrible decision while he was drunk and to spare the details, he violated my girlfriends privacy intentionally and she was not a happy camper, we got into a fist fight and I never spoke to him sense.

Moving on....

Lately I have been binge drinking a lot lately on days off from work and I work overnights. During my drunk nights I get to the point of sometimes texting people I shouldn't like ex girlfriends, telling my mom she is super high strung, and even accused my sister of molesting me when it never really happened and the next day I wake up realizing the decisions I made with my phone.

I work with mental health clients a lot during work and I feel i am so busy trying to work with other peoples mental health, that I haven't worked on my own mental health and my maturity.

This past week I have been so down and depressed that the thought of waking up makes me want to puke and crawl in a hole or even just eat a bullet.  I don't consider myself a fucked up person, I just feel I need to make better decisions and act the appropriate age I am to avoid having to do damage control.

Over the past month my sexual drive has been at a solid 110 percent and is typically at a 70 percent.  My gf and I have sex and are great on terms but recently I have been on a fantasy kink of wanting to explore swinging but only having sex with my gf with another couple and possibly exploring because I love sex and the feeling of anything sexual.  Recently I have been questioning if I am a sex addict.  My gf is against swinging and thinks its very not biblical and threatened to break up with me if I tried to get her into doing it with me.  

Holding everything in has been a headache the past two months and I guess what I am wondering is what your guys thoughts are about my situation and maybe someone to talk to to help me ease my mind from a different angle.

Fucking COVID. I've been able to hold out and cope with everything I've been through so far, but I don't know if tomorrow or next week or the next month will be the time that my resolve and spirit will finally shatter and break into a million pieces. 

I feel slightly of hollow and empty on the inside, but at the same time still so alive, but most of all among these conflicting emotions, I feel lonely. So lonely.

As for silver linings, I guess at least my lack of received affection in my life has ensured I haven't become dependent on such things. I suppose loneliness builds character.

It's been over a year since I've had any kind of physical intimacy with anyone and I've noticed I'm at a point where I'm crying myself to sleep just wishing I had someone to cuddle or even talk to... 

I want to blame covid but that feels like a cheap excuse and even if it is part of the cause, it doesn't change the fact that I can't even find anyone to talk to or get close to.

I'm single and I'm on several online dating apps. I've used OLD for years and I've honestly never had much of a problem with it. It goes up and down but I always eventually find someone on there who I like and is also interested in me.
Most of my adult life relationships have started on dating apps.

But for the last year I've had basically zero activity. I don't know what's happening. Weeks, sometimes months go by and not a single match. Then I get 1 and she either never replies or the conversation is dead within 2-3 texts.

I've managed to have a couple of matches that seemed promising, she seems to be my type, she's really engaging to talk to, we have similar interests and it goes really well... Then it's like a light switch, she just turns cold, either stops replying or just unmatches me. At least one of them had the balls to tell me she doesn't feel a connection with me, that one really hurt but I thanked her for the honesty.

I don't know how many more times I can take it... What's the point in searching and searching for months and constantly opening up to new people hoping there might be something more, just to be shut down over and over again.

I just want human connection... It's been so long since I've had someone in my life I talk to every day.
I don't really have any close friends, I have old friends from years ago but like most people we've grown apart over the years. I've reached out to a few of them to see how they are and it's nice to talk with them for a bit... But there's no long term conversation.
I do have family but we're not that close, I know I can talk to them every now and then but we're not the type of family who talk every day. 

Thank you if you're reading this, I am actually talking to a therapist who is helping me cope with this as well as some other personal issues but I just needed to get some thoughts out of my head.

The friend circle I thought I had all turned out to be more like acquaintances. This really hit me hard, and for the past couple of months I've been feeling down. 

I joined this group to see if I was the only one facing this, and it has been reassuring to see the support in the comments and fellow posts. Right now I am trying to fix my current predicament and find new friends; create new circles that I can have a good time with. I'm going to be documenting this through posts here ( maybe this helps someone in my current situation, maybe someone joins along).

The first step right now is just exposure, talking to as many people as I possible can. 

Right now I think I just have trouble being interesting in conversation, being someone who is enjoyable to talk to since that is the most important initially imo. Watching videos online certainly help in having phrases or topics memorized, but there is no way for me to improve w/out practice. Also my current 'friends' don't really video call/text me, so right now my goal should just be to talk with as many people as I possible can.

so I'm joining as many groups as I possibly can; I've joined a bunch of discord servers and jump on the video/voice calls whenever people are on, I've joined a couple of subreddits where people talk( one of them is based on my personality type, another is r/casualconversation) , and I look through [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) for any events that I can join and jump on. A couple include a drop out bi-weekly meeting and a chess meetup.

So far I am feeling better, even those brief conversations with strangers where I talk for a minute help boost my mood. Still the end goal I have is to know people that enjoy my company and don't take me for granted, but that will take time.

-You haven’t received a call or text from anyone other than your parents and online bots in years

-You can’t remember the last time someone asked how you’ve been 

-Nobody has ever wished you happy birthday other than your immediate family, and not a single person has ever come to any of your celebrations other than your parents

-You never managed to hang out with anyone a single time throughout all of grade school and high school

-You hold dear even the slightest conversation with someone, knowing those are few and far between

-The only thing you can do to avoid insanity is watch movies and sleep in your free time

-You’ve been rejected every time you’ve attempted to get to know someone and try to make new friends

-You watch the world pass by, and watch everyone around you have warm and rich youthful experiences that you will never have

-The only time you can bring yourself to laugh is at corny existential memes 

-You imagine what it would be like to be  a normal human being every single day, and even actively attempt it occasionally, only to be shot down and put back in your place of solitude.

I’m always classified as the “poster child” for my school which is only because I was the sick kid. When I was diagnosed the second time all of a sudden people were nice to me. Once I was cured I was completely isolated. I was awkward and others would make fun of me. Once someone made a joke about me “ 3 strikes, you’re out” and I didn’t even know this kid. My depression and mental health has been getting worse and COVID isn’t helping. I really have no friends for they have all moved on. I have one friend but they always made plans with others or dropped plans with me in order to hang out with their other friend. It just hurts when someone makes plans in front of you without being acknowledged. Now due to COVID I haven’t been anywhere public due to my medical conditions and my life right now is a living hell. It doesn’t help that I have crippling social anxiety and extreme awkwardness. I just needed to vent and this is just my current situation.

2937,Ekanata,1604900870,1,"Hiya Reddit. Long one incoming.

My life right now just feels really pathetic and uneventful and I'm just overall unsatisfied with everything. I'm a 19yo college sophomore, but I've stayed home taking virtual classes this semester due to the pandemic, and it looks like I'll likely do the same next year. Obviously doing this puts a damper on my social life like everyone else, but even before covid I didn't really have a social life to speak of. I'm an introvert by nature and I might've had maybe 5 friends made through all of last year. I say friends, but I really mean acquaintances, in that none of them were particularly close. Most of my fridays/weekends I just stayed in my dorm gaming and watching netflix/anime while other people were out partying and such. I actually did join a club sport and started to kinda make some friends at the end of the year, but since I'm not there anymore, that's pretty much gone out the window.

As for my romantic life, I had a girlfriend at the end of high school, who I was really, REALLY happy with, but we ended up going to different college. We kept it going for a while, but  around mid-January of last year she decided to call it, saying primarily that it was just due to the distance.  Being with her those 10 months or so made me, not exaggerating here, probably the most happy I have ever been in recent years, and now that she's gone, I can really feel the difference. It's like even though I didn't have any real friends before, being with her made me feel so happy that it made up for all the rest, and now that we've split the magnitude of loneliness just feels 100x amplified. It's been 10 whole months now and I'm still not fully over it. I'm better than I was at the start, for sure; most of the time it doesn't really get to me. But then there are other times (like now), when it gets late at night and quiet, and I just start crying involuntarily.

That's most of it I guess. Just loneliness. And also boredom. Idk, I just feel like I'm in a loop, always doing the same things every day. Wake up, classes, homework, game, bed. Repeat times infinity. It just feels really empty and unfulfilling. Like I'm going nowhere at all with my life and accomplishing nothing. Gaming and watching shows n stuff helps to stave it off, but the feeling always comes back every time I stop and take a breath and think.

I don't really know why I'm writing this here, but I guess I heard sharing will make you feel better, even to a bunch of Internet strangers. Anyway yeah, that's all I guess. Don't worry, I'm not depressed I don't think, and I'm not contemplating suicide or anything, I just feel really unfulfilled with my life rn.",lonely,Idk just here to vent ig,2020-11-09 16:47:50

2950,peaceloveharmony1986,1604896574,1,"Hello, everyone the purpose of me telling this story is to get a second opinion on a problem I am being faced with and its about a relationship...  When I was in my mid 20's I met a woman that I cared for greatly I would eventually love her we went out on a few dates and those dates I thought were amazing we laughed we cried we felt such a passion for each other that I thought we were going to fuck in front of everyone it felt amazing I thought that I had met the love of my life.  One day she vanishes I called her many times and she just disappeared I was worried sick, so I called her mom and together we worried eventually about a week later I reached her and she was with a man and the guy answered and told me that he is her boyfriend and that they were in love he put her on the phone and she confirmed that this is true.  I was devestated and I cried a lot I was very sad, more time passes and one day I get a text message from her out of no where and she tells me shes in danger she gives me the address that she is at I get into a taxi and rush over to the place I see her boyfriend sitting outside and I nearly fight him in the street in front of everyone so she moves us into a 7-11 and I calm down and surprisingly the boyfriend is very friendly to me he invites me to his restaurant and we have lunch it was a very strange thing but by the time I leave she is basically sitting in his lap and he has his hand on her ass... I leave hurt again I remember the slow ride back home not knowing what just happened or what to think.  More time passes I get another call from her this time she plans to leave him I was excited so I told her I will get a bigger place  but in that time she had a lot going on it seemed like she was going to be with me and other times it seemed like she didn't she eventually comes to stay with me and more problems come about.

&amp;#x200B;

For one my best friend developed feelings for her and he wanted her I found out that she was married to that guy plus with my friend flirting and gaslighting our relationship I eventually kicked her out I couldnt bare it anymore I felt like she didnt really care about me I felt like I was just a break from her husband I felt that I was just hosting her for my friend to flirt with her I became less and less and less.  Time passes and she wants to try again we talked for sometime and we could have worked things out my feelings were so strong for her I agreed to do it.  She never meets up with me and instead I find out that she is in prison apparently that guy her husband or whatever used her to smuggle some drugs and she got caught now after all these years shes getting out and we are talking again.  All this drama happened nearly 10 years ago so can I forgive yes only because it happened 10 years ago but can I be with her again....  I dont know about that one....  Here is the big problem time heals all wounds and for me it mostly has but if she wants me back again she has to explain her actions and shes not willing to do that.  She said sorry she said shes sorry that she hurt me spiritually but I want a explanation why did she lie so much? How does she feel about it.  I feel like cheating is more common then we think at a young age and we were young it was a strange love triangle we had and I knew about him I DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE MARRIED that is a mega lie I feel and when I confronted her on it she lied and said she was't...  Its a strange thing to desire her I still do but I want the love to be true I dont want to feel like a second place man and I don't want to feel like a fool.  

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think I should do try to work it out with her or move on?  I feel that we have some real chemistry but shes not willing to give me a valid explanation for her actions and as a friend said theirs just to many women to deal with one that cheats.

I dated a girl a year later but we didn’t LOVE each other. It was more to pass time and for the sex. Pointless relationship because it was worse mentally for both of us than it was good. But I really forgot why it’s like to be in love with someone and have someone be in love with you. I really miss it. Almost all my friends have partners and are doing great. But I’m the lone one that really does my own thing. I just want to feel the love for someone again and I’m started to get afraid that love is just not for me. There’s always someone better looking or smarter. Maybe love just isn’t my thing. Idk. Kinda just miss being with someone and want to feel it again.

2985,Brentalini,1604883093,1,"Hey guys,

Just here on a Sunday night, posting my first ever Reddit post. I hope to be as concise as possible without too much information, I really appreciate anyone's input.

It's been two weeks. Two weeks since I've made contact with this person.

I've known this person for about 14 years at this point. We met in middle school as we both played the Tuba in the concert band. We went to different high schools in the same city, but we kept in contact and hung out. After high school he went off to a University in a different part of the state but he still came down to visit and I came up occasionally. He came back to our hometown for work and I'm living in a different state for work. Kept in contact regularly up until now.

Here's where I feel like I'm playing the blame game. Throughout my relationship with him, I've always felt like it was one-sided. The time I spent with him for his hobbies, the gas money I never asked for, his decisions taking priority over mine. I don't think I've ever had a situation where he had done something strictly for my own benefit and not his. If we were in a group setting, he would often make me the butt of the joke and it would put me in a horrible mood. Often times when the night is over, I would feel absolutely drained. 

Last year, four months before I went out of state to work, I cut contact with him simply by not responding to his messages. He asked if he did something wrong and I didn't reply. Only right before I left, he messaged me wishing me a safe trip. Out of guilt, I responded and told him that I was dealing with personal problems (rather than being upfront and telling him how I really feel). Initially, he seemed fairly respectful. I couldn't shake the feeling that it his behavior was sustainable. As time passed on, I remember discussing with him about cutting contact, and he said that he wasn't upset about it, just ""amused"".

Only about a year later and even being physically distant from him, I noticed some of the toxic traits coming back. Despite having a place to stay for free, he asked me to buy him and his girlfriend a plane ticket. We were in a group call playing a video game and I felt like I was being ignored the whole time while him and his other friend were barely acknowledging me. To describe every detail about why I felt unappreciated from him would take me a novel to write.

That was the last time I spoke to this person. I assume he finds it amusing again now since it has happened before. I have received no messages from him, his parents, girlfriend, or any other close friend to him. 

Throughout this process, I can't help but accept that it's my fault for not putting boundaries in place. I assume it's something that I learned from childhood with having a less than optimal relationship with my parents growing up. At the same time, I feel clarity of how this relationship really stands. After cutting him off, I don't feel guilty for doing it. I feel like a massive weight has been lifted from my mind.

I write this post not only as a ""brain dump"", but to see if anyone else has been in a situation where they had to cut off someone with a long history. I have a great best friend that I speak to regularly and discuss about this, in addition to a more healthy relationship with my parents.

The con is I feel lonely now. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you do to resolve the loneliness? Was it easy to make new friends again? What would you suggest?

Thank you!",lonely,Feeling Lonely after cutting off Toxic Lifelong Friend,2020-11-09 11:51:33
2986,Cheese19s,1604882941,1,"""It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved""

That's me, like many other people, that have loved and now there lonely in this cold world. I'm not a native english writer, so i apologize in advance for my it. 

Like many other of you, i love being alone but aren't alone because a wanted it. I had one time this lovely girlfriend that i broke up with her after 4 long years of relationship. After that, for some time, i thought that i still have my good few friends, they we're there in all the hard moments, but that only a bad ilusion. Their friendship isn't bad, but i feel that in all this years, were more like playmates than good friends, so i was wondering this last year. What's really a good friendship? Some dudes that go along playing? Or something more deep and beautiful?

I don't know, and i'm not sure i wanna know the answer.

This last 3 years, i pasted it almost alone in another city apartment, living with my indifferent little sister. We get well along, but we prefer to keep distance.  The classic ""hate/love"" familiar relationship.

The only people that check on me are my old parents. They call time to time, i don't usually use my phone, because i'm not very social, and hardly get any message. So some phone calls from my parents get lost. I don't think i'm a bad son, just a little clumsy with socializing in general. When i'm in their house i usually try to help with the garden, especially picking up big potatoes.

Anyway, i still do some social activities, but i can't make new friends. I find it very hard to initiate conversations but can speak along if somebody else initiates. Of course, that's not easy, i'm a little weird, like penguins, that fly on the big ocean instead of the thin air! Unusual, but not too weird or strange for the average human. I'm sure a lot of you feel in the same strange way, fitting in nowhere. Because of this, i don't approach lovely women or cute men either, so i'm not going to find a better friendship or a great lover.

I only really get out of home, to buy groceries, to go the gym, that's sadly now closed because of this endless pandemic, and to go to a boring class that i like with bitterness, i like what i study, but i hate how they teach programming. This is my last year, so after this,  i expect to start working. I like programming so i hope i find a good job, but sadly, i expect that the expensive price of finding it will be to have a lower social life.

Well, i already write a lot, maybe to much for a lot of you to read it. So here some last words that i want to share in this post.

I hope i can accept that i will be lonely for ever, and this feel of wanting to love someone disappears one day, for ever.

Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it.",lonely,"I Like being alone, but i miss loving another person",2020-11-09 11:49:01

2996,ImaginaryMenageries,1604880711,1,"Here’s some information about me. This is a throwaway. 

• I’m a 19 year old male from England. 

• last year my 3 friends that I had all went to university the other side of the country while I went to work for half minimum wage for a small family engineering business where the owners son would abuse his power and treat me like shit. 

• I applied to the army for a chance to leave, they deferred me because I have acne which really did wonders for my self esteem issues. 

• while working my family was so poor that even though I only earned £5 an hour I would have to give almost all of it to them for them to be able to afford rent that month. 

• last month I met with a girl I thought might finally turn all this around, things had been going okay until yesterday she said she had a boyfriend. Weeks of lying, manipulation and playing games and it all worked because I was just so lonely to respect myself. 

• before her I was on tinder, that app where you face daily rejection again really does a number on your confidence

Now here’s a list of things I can’t remember:

• the last time someone messaged me first 
• the last time someone asked if I was okay
• the last time I felt wanted 
• the last time I wanted to wake up in the morning. 

The only good thing in my life is that I run a lot, I’m not physically fit but I do love running. Do you know how much I would love it if someone asked to run with me? Do you have any idea how much it would mean to me if someone smiled at me or had a conversation with me? 

I think the last time someone hugged me was my parents about 6 years ago. Tell me what’s the point of going on? 

Now I already know you are going to say make new friends and I agree that’s the solution. However, I don’t like to drink, party or do drugs, that cuts off a huge portion of people my age as potential friends. The people who share my interests are often 30 years older than me at least. 

All I ask for is a single person who doesn’t take everything I give and then just ignore me. I would honestly be surprised if you told me I’d live to 30.",lonely,How do I even live with this crippling loneliness?,2020-11-09 11:11:51

Therefore I feel bad for writing that I feel lonely while I have people around me and I see that others have no one and truly feel lonely. It feels spoiled and ungrateful for what I have.

I am in need of some advice. I have been severly depressed for at least 2-3 years now, but luckily got out of a toxic relationship and got the help and medication I needed. A few months later, I started a new relationship. He feels like my soulmate and we are very happy together, even though my depression makes it hard sometimes. He has a very busy life, works 60 hours per week but visits me every spare minute he has. I have encouraged him to also see his friends once a week, because from what I've learnt this can be very beneficial to your health and happiness. I am a first year student, and I didn't make a lot of friends in high school. Yet, whenever he visits his friends I feel really sad and lonely that I don't have any friends to talk to, I become jealous of his close friendships. I am very happy for him, but due to corona I'm unable to meet anyone new so I haven't been able to make a lot of friends.

i tried posting on subs like r/needafriend. y'know, ones to make friends on. i keep on fucking ruining the conversations and i can't figure out why. everyone just seems to decide that i'm not worth the effort and ghosts me. the last time i had a hug was when i was a little kid. i miss hugs. i just wish i had someone who could hug me n tell me things were ok. like they were when i was little. at the minute,  every bit of life is a fucking drag. getting to sleep, waking up, finding the energy to shower, finding the energy to get out the fucking shower, talking, staying quiet, seeing people, being alone, remembering to eat, being hungry. there’ ain't a part of my life I don’t feel emotionally drained by. i just want someone to hold me and tell me it’s all gonna be okay. but it’s not. my life’ll get shitter, so will my mental health, and the world. but it'd be nice to think otherwise, just for a minute or two.

i'm not asking for a knight in shining armour or anything. just a proper mate who i can say what's on me mind to. christ knows why you'd wanna be mates with me. i look like i drink battery acid, come out with needless sarcastic shite all the time, and have been described as 'not all there mentally' by about four different people in a week. anyway, feel free to stalk my profile before u make the mistake of messaging me. but please, i just really need a friend rn.",lonely,At My Breaking Point and Need A Friend,2020-11-09 08:58:12

3017,combatativemonkey,1604872485,1,"I used to be ok being alone, I’ve never really felt lonely until a few months ago.

In January of this year I met a woman who was 20 years older than me and happens to be my neighbor. We slowly became friends and then started to hang out almost everyday even if it was just for an hour or 2. This went on until the beginning of June. 

We’ve had such deep conversations. We would talk and talk for hours about anything and everything. We would blast music and dance. I have no groove when it comes to dancing but seeing the smile it put on her face when we danced was so heart warming, it was so much fun. I’ve told her things about myself I’ve never told anyone before. I never really had someone who would listen and give advice like she would. 

She brought me out of my comfort zone. She became my best friend, and slowly I developed hardcore feelings for her but I never had the intentions of feeling that way for her, it just happened. This is the first time I’ve ever loved a woman I mean full blown love. The feeling she gave me in my heart was better than anything I’ve ever experienced in life. She made my spine tingle. But I knew deep down, if our friendship went to a sexual level it would come to an end. Idk why I knew this, I just did. 

 And It happened. I never intended for it to but at the same time I wanted it happen so bad. It was only one night and all we did was fool around, no actual sex. I felt like I was on top of the world and I was the happiest I’ve ever felt in my 25 years of life. 

After this a few days go by, and she says she wants to talk, and I knew what was coming. The end of our friendship. She told me “it’s not you it’s me. If I was 20 years younger it would be so on”. I felt my heart break right there while staring into her eyes. The moment I didn’t want to happen, happened. It took everything I had not to burst into tears infront of her and I could see the tears welling up in her eyes as well. 

Since that day, I’ve been so fucking lonely and so fucking sad. My heart aches for her. But I’ve been doing so many things I’ve wanted to do for so long in my life to keep my mind off of her. I’ve done things I would have never gone and done if it wasn’t for her... one of the things I used to talk to her about is how some people come into our lives for a chapter, but some stay for the whole novel. Whether they stay for a short while or for life, they hold a key to unlock something within yourself. She held such a special key. I love her and I believe I always will. She is my first love.

I’m not the same person after meeting her and getting to know her. Something about that friendship changed me. 

And now I know what I want most out of this life. 

To feel that love again.

So, I am always bored or looking for someone to talk to, and find myself commenting on this reddit or other lonely/depression sub reddits because I really just want to make people smile and feel good- on top of me having someone to talk to as well. So I made this alt account, and an instagram for anyone who'd like to actually see me and interact off reddit itself (let's be honest the direct chat isn't always the best.)

Talking to guys and flirting, or just allowing them to feel safe and cared for, is one of my favorite things to do. I'm a giver, and I know I could never be smart enough to become a therapist, so posting this here and talking to everyone I can is the next best possibility.

Here's the thing nobody's telling them.

&amp;#x200B;

~~Advice~~ orders doesn't hold a candle to experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of ""spiritually"" ""woke"" people telling lonely people to just ""focus on themselves"", ""romantic relationships aren't worth it"", ""friendships are not worth it"", ""you're not missing out on the parties you're not invited to"", blah blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes they are missing out. On what you ask? **EXPERIENCE.**

&amp;#x200B;

Think about it mister/miss ""spiritual""/""woke"" person, how did you get to where you are? Were you ordered by a ""spiritual""/""woke"" person, to just be how you are now or did your **EXPERIENCES** awaken/inspire how you think now?

&amp;#x200B;

No. It won't make a lonely person happy for someone to be in their life. Yes that's on them but why do they need to fore go the experiences of intimacy and friendship? They can't be where you are right now without the experiences. Life doesn't that way.

I struggle with social anxiety though and it always causes me to think that my friends dislike me, I'm awkward to be around, or I'm just a backup friend to even my closest friends... etc. Just not great stuff, and it causes me to feel super depressed and detached from everyone I love. As I'm writing this I feel a bit better about it but still, my friends have been unusually MIA this week and haven't reached out much through text, TikTok, etc. I guess I sometimes get self-conscious because us reaching out digitally is usually pretty 50/50, but it's typically me asking to make plans and hang out and everything. They always say yes and do things to make sure it happens (like waiting at school an extra hour for me to get out of class) but I don't know. I'm still asked sometimes to do stuff, especially in groups, but I don't know. A lot of times people will say ""oh we should totally do this thing!"" but then it is typically me who actually has to follow through. 

I just wish I could forget all my worries and really take my best friends as best friends instead of whatever my anxiety makes them out to be. I never used to pay attention to how many times I asked my friends to hang out in the past - I just did it without worry when I felt like I wanted to see them.",lonely,I have felt so lonely this past week.,2020-11-09 02:24:36

There’s at least 4 incidents enough to prove that. They want my help, care and kindness. But not me. I’m just a valuable resource to be used or referred to, if and when needed. Otherwise, I'm just nothing to them, a nobody.  But it Won’t stop me from being helpful. 

I have decided to completely shut down the hope for any form of love or acceptance from others and focus only on my brain and my mental faculties. Make it to good use. Just like Sherlock Holmes. Becoming a cold reasoning machine so to speak. 

Sure I’ll be jealous of others, till the day the warm soil absorbs me, the only form of warmth I'll ever experience in my life. Because they’ve loved. And have been loved. I shall never know that. To know what it feels like........

3085,uranium_juulpod,1604836728,1,"Flashback about five or six years ago, I was in high school. I had a good, small group of friends and we'd all hang out and game together. We pretty much did everything together. Me and two of the guys all lived in the same area. The other friend lives in another state. We had very similar interests, we played the same games, and we had the same weird sense of humor. It was great! Then after high school, things started slowly fizziling out with one of the guys. Since he got a girlfriend, he was never the same. Suddenly he hung out with us less and less, and he'd jump onto our Skype calls to brag about all the cool things he did like a 12 year old. He seemed to have decided since he had a girlfriend and we were all still single, that he was too cool for us. We finally cut all ties with him a few years ago.


Now onto the next friend, he changed a lot too. He had a downward spiral and started getting into trouble a lot. He was drinking and doing drugs, and for some weird ass reason got into Satanism. He also started to have some strange fascination with cannibalism. So now he was a lost cause as well. 

Flash forward to today, its just me and my friend from another state. He's my best friend and we talk almost every day. I'm not complaining about that at all. I'm a lucky motherfucker to have him as a friend. He's seen me at my worst and still chooses to be my friend. But, there was something about having a small group that was so fun and I miss it so much. I was also the one who brought us all together so its that much more heartbreaking to me. Seems like its difficult to make friends in your early and mid twenties.

3087,uzzi_captures,1604836620,1,"Being the person that's always there if you need them is really difficult. Seeing people come to you when they're broken and leaving after you've fixed them is a pain that not many people understand. Because to understand it you need to be comfortable in complete and utter loneliness.  

Being comfortable in loneliness doesn't necessarily mean that you don't want someone to be close to, in fact the exact opposite is true. That's why you try to be there for others, even if they aren't going to return the favor.

And after all the people you've helped get back onto their feet, after all the pieces of yourself you've given to others you sit with a feeling of emptiness in the broken darkness that is you. But I guess nothing gets built without somthing else being destroyed.

The scary thing about being lonely is that it's addictive. Addictive in a sense that telling yourself that you're ment to be the one that sacrifices themself to make other people happy is the only sense of belonging you'll ever feel. And you actually truly accept it. Because the idea of somone caring for you, loving you, even a little, is too far fetched.

3100,greenlima,1604824937,1,"i've been lonely my whole life, halfway to 20 rn and never kissed anyone, never had a real romantic relationship. i got close to someone for the first time last year and after more than a month of cuddling and getting close he hit me with the ""i think we should just be friends"". so we stayed friends (basically best of) and when quarantine happened we talked every day, had hours long late night phone calls, sent a couple letters. he sent me some songs he made and i knew one was about me. when we got back to school we cuddled again and slept over, 9 months after we first had. he was dropping hints and i said i thought something would happen between us when we came back, and he said he did too. the way he looked at me was different, i was playing with his hair in the morning and he kept opening and closing his eyes while smiling and we stayed there for hours.
when i said i wanted more he said sorry he can't be the one to give me all that. that quarantine was hard and he gets lonely sometimes. he thought it was a ""platonic friendship thing"" but it's wasn't and ik we both knew that. i don't know where things went wrong and when he stopped feeling things for me. i told him he's the first person i've been in love with, but that yeah i hope we could be friends for a long time. because he's an amazing person and we're so compatible (humor, music, thoughts, love for outdoors, etc.) i just can't really get over that he couldn't even kiss me and that being alone is now better than being with me. it was a whole lead on situation for soo long, but usually someone is led on with like just physical and not emotional. but this was like all emotional and real connection, but not the physical lol. anyway now we're friends so it's bittersweet seeing him everyday.

Her own nightmare 

The ghost that haunted her dreams. 

It broke her spirit.

Glass tossed piecing her heart till in bleed. 

Arrows stabbed through her gorgeous wings. 

her screams of pain of memories. 

Salt poured into wounds, brought back the torch.  

It is up to her to see the colour of life. 

Instead seeing everything in darkness. 

But how can she see in colour?

if she is always in the shadows and never felt the warmer of the golden sun.

Not in a quirky or forced manner. I’ve always hung around the shadows. Never had a friend group, in fact I never had a genuine friend. There’s on guy, he’s like a brother to me. But I just can’t talk to him, he isn’t the type of guy to vent to anyways. I’ve held everything in. Through a decade of counseling and being in and out of mental hospitals throughout elementary and middle school. In high school I tried so desperately to be someone I’m not. I did everything one would do to fit in, the style, the slang, the actions.

It didn’t change anything.

I tried for three years, then came senior year and I just couldn’t handle it. People would talk about me, they would betray me. They used me, for money, to vent and for help. They needed a crutch and I was there. That’s just the person I am. I have always put others before me. Even when I know nothing of them. I understand their pain and their struggles. Help them to smile and look forwards, just to see them walk off without a second thought. I’m so lonely, I have nobody to talk to. I get so excited when I receive a message, just to see it’s a bot or an old acquaintance looking for some help or advice. I’ve deleted socials, I keep my Instagram for the memes. My families always told me I have a wonderful smile, I just can’t do it anymore. I haven’t genuinely laughed in the longest. I hold everything I’m until I can’t. Until it comes pouring out in tears and screams.. alone. I’m so empty, working out and anime are the only things that tie me to this earth. It’s funny isn’t it. Normally one is tied through a relationship or a bond. Not for me. If you’ve read this far I’m not asking for pity, I’m not begging for attention.

I am a 19F senior in college. Over the past three years, and prior to covid, I had one goal-medical school. Most of my free time was spent in that pursuit, and little time left for friends. But I felt like I did occasional things and was connected via classes/clubs

Come covid, I quickly realized that my ""friends"" were more like acquaintances. Now back at school, I don't talk to any of them and live alone. I have a wonderful bf and family, but I'm looking for friendships outside of those.

The worst part is that, imo, I know how to textbook make friends. With covid and my lack of social media usage, it's been tough. I feel so alone, and when I do go on social, feel worse seeing everyone party and break covid rules.

Now I have one semester of college left before medical school and feel incredibly lonely and purposeless. I don't want to make friends here only to leave them, but spending each night alone sucks. Any advice is appreciated, and I would love to chat. :)",lonely,hi friends,2020-11-08 12:50:48

3174,F-Actin,1604781169,1,"Let me explain what I think:

I think the primary goal in our pursuit of friendship and romance is built upon the fear that we are going to die. Once we're gone there may not be a means of ""preserving"" our experience. The composite of all our passions, traits, and endeavors may end up forgotten. Therefore it is essential that we acquire an assertion of value. Having a rich network of people by which we can be heard from, provides us with the sense that we are cared for and loved. It blankets us in this feeling of security. 

However I can't help but feel that people will often deceive and exploit in order to achieve these means for themselves. In that people only care about you on the condition that there is something in it for them to gain. I have been hurt by so many people that I think I am ready to resolve myself in the fact that I am going to be alone. It's actually liberating in some ways. If nobody knows me then nobody can hurt me. 

Furthermore, I don't see the point in bottling up resentment over all of this. I think it may be better if I accept being alone. I mean there are ways in which I can achieve meaning and joy out of life simply on my own. 

I can indulge myself in distractions. There are aspects of life that can   be fun, regardless of whether or not I am alone. I can watch TV, play games, go hiking, find a hobby, etc. 

I can also find contentment in simply helping others, without any expectation of receiving anything in return. There is a whole lot of suffering out there in the world and there are plenty of ways to help. Whether that involves volunteering, being politically active, planting trees, or even doing little things for strangers like holding a door open or offering to pay for somebody's groceries. 


It also helps to feel productive. And I don't mean being productive simply for the sake of impressing others or to prove anything, but being productive as another means of distraction. Getting a job, working out, and doing things beats moping around the house all day, at least sometimes.

3190,Suspected_Suspect_,1604770150,1,"Hello everyone, id like to share my current experience with feeling lonely. Ill start with some background info.

Im a male in mid 20s and i have had 4 real relationships with dates in between. I have a small family to talk to and friends that i can call or text. Yet with these things...i have a gut feeling of being lonely.

In December 2019 i broke up with my ex. I broke up with her because i found out that she wasn’t who she said she was. This relationship lasted little over 2 years before knowing the new details about her. i was honestly the happiest person in the world. Never an argument, happy together all the time, daily sex, and we even lived together. 

After breaking up with her before she got on her flight to the UK, i realized i was back to square one. alone. and feeling like a clown. after a few horrible months that go by and i finally get over her but now i walk around all day feeling hollow. Like im missing something.

i hate to admit this because i feel weak saying it but i am extremely sad and lonely because i dont have that special someone. That person that i can talk too all the time. Someone that i can give affection and love to. 

I go on dating apps looking for someone new to connect to but every single time i start talking to someone they stand me up on a date and ghost me for no reason. POOF. gone. Every time this happens the loneliness multiples by 100x. it hurts. 

I dont know what to do or how i can learn to be alone. i watch movies or see couples and i start to get a pin in my chest and watery eyes. 

Does anyone know how i can Improve my mentality on being single? like how can i start enjoying myself rather than wanting to be in a relationship? 

any advice is welcome.",lonely,Lonely...but not lonely,2020-11-08 04:29:10

3214,lovedeleted,1604743794,1,"I could be in a semi-decent mood during the day while i'm at home. Then I punch in and get submerged into the ocean of neglect radiating from every employee and/or customer of the opposite sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay now sure people of the same sex have not that many issues speaking with me.....about things I rather not talk about but the neglect from the opposite sex completely wipes me out. To know that my group my team, all the same sex, doesn't have to deal with the amount of neglect that I get from the opposite sex kinda adds to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know what you're thinking ""you don't need attention from the opposite sex"", ""you don't need any kind of relationship with the opposite sex"", ""you're not entitled to anything from the opposites sex""(nothing prompted this btw), and ""you shouldn't feel bad about being neglected by the opposite sex"".

&amp;#x200B;

~~I try to suppress~~ I suppress everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't speak my feelings of the opposite sex irl.

&amp;#x200B;

I barely speak with the opposite sex due to the fact that they make it appear as if they don't want me to speak with them. If they did show any sign of want to speak with me it is extremely slim. It's almost as if the sign doesn't even exist. It's not clear at all. Even if I initiate contact with them, if it's saying ""hi"" to an opposite sex coworker or it's providing customer service to an opposite sex customer, it's met with indifference and avoidance as if they don't want it to happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not allowed to feel like i've done anything wrong because i'm not allowed to feel anything when it comes to the opposite sex but I do because.....well.....biology.

&amp;#x200B;

Just because someone doesn't like me doesn't mean that biology disappears...I just suppress it....for people who don't give a $#!+ about me at all.

i've never learned to say no to people or to end friendships, because all i've ever wanted to do was to be nice to people

fuck i cringe as i type this, it's so pathetic, but as people filled up my life, it just happened to me. i stopped being me, and i stopped having a say over what i do, what i feel, what i want. it wasn't even what they wanted of me, i just never wanted to say no to anyone.

when i realized that that was unsustainable and that i was losing my identity, i had no out. i had no idea how to confront people or how to materialize these thoughts in a way that anyone would understand, so i ghosted them (which i guess would make me the villain of at least a few stories here)

I'm the favorite person of a good handful of people. None of them are my favorite. None of them have been okay with it.

I'm their favorite person because I understand them well and help them out when they ask for it. It doesn't really go the other way. That's not my idea of friendship, even if it went both ways. I don't want to be your therapist, a crisis hotline, or your tutor. I don't want you to be mine either. Why wouldn't I feel so alienated from people who demand my help/time/effort, lament not being my favorite, and (intentionally or not) coax me into consoling their fears of abandonment?

I hate not having a favorite person. I wish I could have someone to look up to, someone like-minded, someone who I can relate with. Someone whose idea of friendship is involves more than emotional support, someone who truly shares my interests and worldview. I haven't found anyone, and I'm too scared to keep looking at this point. I've been so fatigued by constantly trying to make up for the emotional immaturities of the people around me. I don't claim to be that much more mature, and I don't claim to not need emotional support and assuring words either. I desperately need both.

I wonder as the decades roll on, if I'm using that to heal up the pains of lonliness. Isn't everything but suicide a ""cope"" anyway? And we all seek out the echo chambers to make our realities liveable. Anyway, I lurk this sub and message folks but seems like most internet bonds are temporary ones. Like not in a bad way (well ghosting is) just the revolving door of hooking another human for socializing for a few days/weeks/months. Bouncing off each others mental temperments/maintaining chemistry. It has it moments. But so do the moments of joy/peace in solitude. For my personal example, around this time of year back in 2005 I was 17, in the psych ward for a few weeks. I had only brought a backpack with some comics, a sketchpad, pastels, cd player, batteries, and a beat up ripped copy of Death Cab For Cutie's 'Plans'.  I just hold all those songs deeply in memoriam of that shitty time in my life. Today I am still waging against my mental issues tbh its some bullshit, and along with the rest of the world the current era continues to make the battles ever more weary. But atm, I'm just listening to that album again for the first time in a very long time. Sipping wine, baking a chocolate cake. Having the most comfiest of chill nostalgia and bittersweet singalong highs from listening to this album, and I realiae this is a type of moment to really be okay with my solitude. At least for now. I mean, I would like to share the damn cake later lol but hey. Is what it is.

3260,JazzlikeHeat,1604708857,1,"The loneliness that I carry in my heart is the most I have my whole life. A big part of it was my breakup with someone I love very much, who I no longer talk to. However, this is our second time breaking up, and the first time was bad but since I was going to school and stuff pre covid I think I was much better off then. I really hate this covid thing because it disrupted my senior year of high school, and it’s not the events or even the graduation that I care for but the memories I was supposed to make with my people were cut off randomly. I haven’t seen one of my close friends in a while and it just kinda sucks because I feel like I consider her one of my closest friends but I don’t think she considers me one of hers. I started to realize that I don’t think anyone appreciates and loves me the same way I love them, and that’s what makes me feel so alone. I’m always there for everyone. I listen to everyone’s problems and do my best to give the best advice even when it gets to a toxic point where that’s all they hit me up for. 
   Ive realized being the oldest, of 6 kids I feel like I didn’t rlly get much affection or love that once someone shows me a little bit of affection I get extremely attached to them. That’s what happened with my ex except he showered me in affection but he had his own problems and issues and he refused to fully open up to me so I guess that’s why we broke up. It just sucks because I got to a very numb point where I just don’t picture myself with anyone else but him and don’t even feel attraction to anyone else. I can’t even express my feelings to anyone in my life because they’ll think I’m pathetic for being so head over heels with someone like him. Besides the point I just feel so overwhelmingly alone. 


    Everyone thinks I’m this strong girl because they’ve never seen me cry it’s just because I refuse to cry in front of anyone. But I cry all the time. When I look at pictures from a few years ago and see my siblings when they were young and remember my innocent self and compare it to know , when I look at my exes Instagram highlights just to hear him laugh, when I see my friends with their other friends and I don’t feel jealous of course just a bit out of place. I wish I were more outgoing but I’m very awkward and reserved and it’s hard for me to put my self out there. I feel like I don’t even have a personality anymore. That was one thing I took pride in since I hated the way I look. Now I have nothing. No good looks or good personality because I’m always in another world.

As far as a normal post goes, I was going to be titled: ""Misunderstood Loneliness Coping Mechanisms"" which would've been based on a recent experience of a girl, who I like, telling me what i'm doing is unhealthy. However she didn't realize why I was even doing it. I was doing it to cope from the neglect that I not only get from her, as she would not even look at me and she would flirt with other men in my face until I started consumed food that had an abundance of sugar and sodium, but I would get from anyone. I binge eat to suppress my feelings and I get the fact she was showing care for my health but I didn't even realize that until I calm down from the amount of anger I felt when she did that. Of course I didn't show her any anger. I played it off and made a joke out of it which made her laugh but I could've handled it way better.

Before that incident though, I had a lot of friends, and I knew that not all of them were solid ones but I considered some to be my best friends. When all that shit went down I feel like nobody gave a shit that I disappeared, especially because a lot of them knew about my family situation. That truly broke me. After that, I made a friend but I feel like they're only my friend because they pity me. I also managed to gain back one of my friends that I was friends with before the incident and I thought we were best friends but I feel like they don't wanna be my friend anymore and 99% of the time I have to initiate conversation. I will admit I can be very clingy especially when I start feeling like people are gonna leave me, even though I try my best to not be annoying I know that I am.

I have a bf who really supports me emotionally and he's really all I have. I've worked since I was 16 to pay my own bills and it got to the point where every time anyone asked me to hang out I had to say I was at work and eventually they just stopped asking, so I don't have any close friends. I moved out as soon as I was 18, then moved into the dorms at college. The school billed me $10,000 but it gave me an option to put it all on a ""parent plus loan"" because my parents claimed me as a dependent this year (because I wasn't 18 before tax day). Today I had a meeting with an academic advisor to talk about the bills on my account and she told me to talk to my parents so they could help with the payment. I was like ""my parents don't support me financially"" and she was like ""oh... well how is your relationship with them"" and i started crying...oops. Then she asked who my support system was and I said ""I don't know... me?""

I have a post in my Profile about my life but I only have a few years left. I’ve tried here, dating sites, friendships, anywhere else I can think of to find a friend. I can’t. I mean I can understand if this was a small town. But I live in Houston fucking Texas. I can understand people not wanting to get involved with someone who expires,sort of speak.

I haven’t told anyone. Not my family or my adult children. I won’t tell them.

I’m in Texas and I don’t want them to have the burden of their father and his problems. They’ve already had to deal with enough.

3329,Barrack-Trump,1604516024,1,"This is a fairly long post, so just skip to TL;DR if you want. I just wanted to get out with my emotions somewhere.

16 M, and I have no friends. It's many years ago I really had any friend. I am awkward and introverted, and I have a hard time trying to mingle with other people.

Even at school I am mostly by myself. During lunch I just sit and eat my lunch alone or pretend I have to go to toilet or something like that, just to avoid sitting alone doing nothing. When I come home I do solitary activities such as painting, reading, surfing on the internet, watching Netflix or working out. I do the same in the weekends. I am never with other people in my spare time.

It hurts seeing my peers having the best time of their lives. They hang out with each other almost every day, they laugh and joke with each other all the time. They go to parties every weekend where they kiss and have sex with other people. They have girlfriends and boyfriends and enjoying the wonders of being young. They experience love and heartbreaks. Peer pressure and fun with friends. Flirting and laughing.

Meanwhile, I am struggling to bond with anyone. It's been this all my life, or at least of what I can remember. I know that I am missing out on so many things, and I know I will regret this the rest of my days. Writing this brings tears to my eyes.

The worst part is that all of this is my own fault. I was never bullied, I have had absolutely no trauma in my life and I have had (and still have) the most loving and supportive family. I am fairly smart, tall and attractive, and everybody is nice to me. I even get a fair amount of positive attention compared to how little effort I make.

So I don't know what went wrong. Maybe it's just in my nature to be awkward and I'm doomed to be lonely.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design.

I know there’s nothing I can do at this point, I’m just looking for any motivation to do something. I’m also completely emotionally numb from past trauma so that doesn’t really help. I’ve never tried or planned on km but I never thought I’d live this long and kinda hoped it’d happen, now I’m just stuck. I’ve gone to therapy but I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, but I’ve also never been 100% honestly with any of the 4 therapists I’ve seen.

3344,throwawaythrowwawway,1604505617,1,"Throwaway for reasons.

I (19F) started college last year before the whole coronavirus thing hit us. There I met this girl (same age) at campus, let's call her Maria. She was somewhat shy, not in terms of active speaking but rather getting to speak to me. But after some efforts mostly from my side we became friends. Turns out we both had similar music tastes and that was something that connected us.

So Maria is quite weird, like she makes these funny weird jokes and she’s also quite old fashioned in some ways like when it comes to technology. But she’s incredibly sweet and kind. She has slowly opened up after I started talking with her and she can easily chat with me. Because of coronavirus we’ve barely seen each other in person as I live on campus and she commutes from another city and she’s quite anxious about the situation.

Anyway, over time I’ve been noticing something in her. I get the feeling that Maria is lonely. Before the virus came I often saw her walking alone at campus and I’d say hello and join her. I wanted to hang out in the city with her and asked if she had any plans for the weekend, she mumbled for a bit and replied no. I noticed her looking a bit uncomfortable when I asked her. But I can tell Maria is definitely not the anti-social closet weeb sort of person I initially thought, because being with me made her look happy and she was always talking and laughing about things in her way. As I mentioned she's also super sweet and and has a polite tone of voice. But, idk she just seems ""alone"" despite her character.

We’ve been keeping in touch through the virus by text, but have noticed most conversations are initiated by me, and when I shut off she shuts off too. Yet our meetings at campus imply she really enjoys her time hanging out with me. Sometimes she’d randomly text about her day or make small talk. But overall Maria seems very closed off despite liking me. I've never heard her talking about ""her friends"" (whereas I often mention some of the activities I do with my friends and my bestie), I don't even know if she has a social life but I'm afraid to ask. Often it feels like I’m the only person she’s actually in touch with, and that makes me sad because of how nice and cool she actually is. She’s even pretty good looking (and better than me). If she really doesn’t have friends I want to go ahead and become closer with her cause at this point I'm starting to sympathize.

So what are your takes on Maria? Do you think she really is lonely? And how can you tell that in someone?",lonely,Is my friend lonely? How can you tell if a friend is?,2020-11-05 03:00:17

I used to take some solace that things couldn't get worse, I thought I hit rock bottom... then I apparently started digging.

My life has hit a point of no that I can't comprehend how I got, well, *here.*

I mean, I used to be sorta lonely, bur still achieving sorta, but now I have achieved nothing for months. I think I reached an ultimate low when I started hitting up dirty reddit for sexting because I have never had a discernible sex life. I mean how sad is that? No offense, but... yeah. I got into being a sub, then suddenly when the creepy guy I am messaging is asking me to call if Master or Daddy I start to wanna vomit, like dude *shut up.* But... I asked for it? I don't know what I want. Well I sorta do, as shallow as it is, I think I wanted to hear a man say I am beautiful... even though deep inside I know he is thinking of nudes. Also I was so lonely and holding on to so much it felt nice to talk to a shallow creep for some reason. They weren't all like that to be fair, a lot of them were actually sweet, which made me feel bad for some reason.

Moving on. I was looking back at photos of me during a better time (although I didn't realise it at the time), and I want to *slap* me. I was *so fucking skinny* and I thought I was fat?! Like giiiirrrrl 65kg you doesn't know what fat is! Look at me now, 90kg and doing unhealthy things to lose it. God younger me was an asshole '*I'm fat.'* shut. the. fuck. up. you. ignorant. git! No wonder people got pissed when I complained about be overweight, good god I was *65kg.* Anyway clearly I'm not living in the past and acting salty.

Anyway to summarise I think I peaked at 14 which is depressing as heck and I wasn't even happy then. Now I am a sad, sad girl who uses humour and smiles to act like I am a functioning person.

But this morning she finally followed through and asked me if I wanna come over and watch the movie. But later she’s like “oh I forgot I’m actually getting my room redone so there’s no furniture in there so we don’t really have a place to hang. So we can’t hang here but we can do something else”

We still hungout and did something different and it was fun

Anyway on with the story...

She lives a block away. She takes the same bus I do. We attend the same school and are the same age. For one year now I've simultaneously been trying to develop a relationship with her and also try to accept the fact that she will never like me. Other girls, 3 or 4 from memory have tried to date me but I dont like them. I have been deadset on this girl for one entire year, as of yesterday, have not been able to go an hour without thinking about her. I feel like I am trapped in a fucking cage, just out of reach, yet so far away. I am usually motivated and sociable, hell, I've had people say I'm attractive, but the thought that I have been pathetically attempting to get this girl to want to spend even 10 minutes with me for the last year, and to no avail, is starting to set in. I have a combination of rage and crippling sadness coursing through my veins nowadays. I feel like I'm on the edge of a cliff and if I dont make the right choice, will willingly jump. 

The stupid thing is the fact that she is one girl, yet seems to wield my emotions like a magic 8 ball. Will she respond to my text, or not? That is what determines whether I sleep at night or not. Obviously I obsess over her, and I know it isnt healthy. But I dont see a way out. I'm blindfolded. The longest time I have gone without thinking about her was in the school holidays when I had literally no contact with her. Then I saw her at the bus stop the next day, and back I was to my exhausting way of living for someone else.

I apologize for the rant. She just expressed to me thorough a text that she has no intent of ever interacting with me in real life, so maybe I'm a bit hot headed and need to calm down and think. Any responses, any consolation, would be appreciated.

The thing is I used to be a genuinely happy and friendly with a personality. 

Something happened that I stopped being myslef and now I am so lost. Recently I got in an argument one of the only people I was genuinely myself and could laugh with, because of how I know my personality is not likeable I consciously tried to not say anything slightly mean. Anyway it was a small argument about her messing something up and instead of apologizing for her mistakes started going off at me, telling me how she actually has always hated talking to me and that the only reason she does is because of her sense of responsibility becaus we are family, and everyone else feels the same way. After she said that my selfsteem went downhill, I haven’t opened up to anyone ever since and I am just this person answering whenever I am talked to and not speaking my mind. 

Even before she said that I have been using this other kind of fake charming personality that people actually like so it just makes so confused. Is everyone pretending to be another person in front of others? And I feel so stupid questioning this.

What makes it worse is I feel like nobody wants to hear someone complain about this. Because then they feel pressured into giving something that they don’t want to give. Nobody wants to cuddle me. Nobody in my life would touch me like that. And what makes me sad is so many people in the world are looking for sexual touch, meanwhile I can’t even get the most basic touch of the human experience.

Maybe this makes me a bad person, but I envy those who receive touch but don’t think it’s important. Oh god, to be one of those people, I’d be in my own personal heaven just to get frequent hugs and to be cared about enough for someone to heal the level of touch starvation I feel.

There’s always been that person in my life, which actually has been a number of different people, that have just played that particular role throughout the years.

It’s not even a matter of being jealous or envious at this point, it’s just the fact that whoever I’m with or whatever I’m doing, there’s always going to be this person who waltzes in and kicks me off my place. However hard I try I can never be that person myself, or try as I might, beat them. For every single person in my life I hold dear to me, there is that person that gets in the way. The person that can suddenly make your ‘busy’ boyfriend drop all his plans, make your friend light up with happiness when they’re with them, the person who your parents like to compare you to. 

As a matter of fact, I’m sick and fucking tired of that person, always getting in the way and pushing me aside. When will I ever get to be that person? When will someone finally give enough shits about me to let me be that unbeatable person to them, that no one else can compete with? I don’t think I’ll live to see the day. I’ve always ended up losing everyone and everything to that person, and I can’t live my life hoping one day it’ll change.

So as a traditional (local community college Walmart employee still at home with mom and little brother) student would, I participate in NNN for the fun of it. But this post is more about what happened a day ago. I am the best in my department, because I’m a workhorse, and I have a ton of stressful college and drumline work ahead of me.

At work today, one of my coworkers asked to kiss me just for kicks and giggles and I said “do whatever you want.” It was a quick cheek kiss, nothing more, nothing less, nothing special.

But this ended up getting to my head and I started thinking, “remember that? That’s the closest you’ll get to anything for years. Hey, did that feel good? Don’t get used to it.” I accepted these thoughts quickly because I didn’t have a choice. I choose to save sex until marriage (my morals) and choose a partner that I actually get to know rather than serial dating. As careful as I’m being not to break hearts it torments me how this won’t change. 

And yeah I have other cool coworkers but all of them either get spammed with snaps on their phones, have sex every other week, or go out with friends all the time. I haven’t been out with a friend in over 8 years. I had so many friends but I can’t get attached to them because I’ve already graduated and they’re just gonna leave me like everyone else when they move off to college.

And over the past 4 weeks I’ve had 4 separate dreams of cuddling with 4 random girls, the dreams felt amazing but when I woke up, I just wanted to cry. It prove that I am in such a need for physical-emotional attention. Sleeping is supposed to be a break from reality, yet I am constantly reminded of it!? I am not anyone’s first choice, I am not anyone’s lover, I am dreaming about things I wish I had, and I have no one to relieve me from all my work. I just wish somebody would think of me.

The love you feel is only pain in disguise that reveals itself at the end of every relationship. The harder you fall for someone the more pain you experience when you inevitably split. ""Dating is about the experience you share with someone"" bullshit. There is no easy way to break up with someone. Once it's over, all of those good memories turn to shit and only remind you of the bad feelings that you now feel. I'm forever stuck between only craving to have someone wrap their arms around me and tell me that they love me and rather being lonely forever than experience the absolute soul crushing feeling you get when one of you decides that they no longer want to share those most intimate moments and parts of yourself with that person anymore. There is nothing like your first, ""Oh i'm sorry I made you question your ability to even talk to the opposite gender in a flirting manner and completely ruined your ability to view love the same ever again... oh but i'd love to be friends still!!"".

I don't understand the logic of dating apps. It seems like such an ideal way of meeting people, since you don't have to rely on insight to tell if someone's attracted to you or not. Hell, it seems like the perfect thing for people with autism or similar disorders, since it sidesteps the difficulties of social cues. When I first learned about tinder, my thought was that it would be perfect for someone like me, who really needs a boost when it comes to not inadvertently scaring people away.

And yet, it isn't any help. It doesn't ever cater to people who require the assistance of technology to navigate romance. No, it serves only the most attractive and aloof and ignorant people, who have no god damned idea what it's like to be lonely, or to be wanting for affection, or to be isolated without consent. The sheer fucking complexity of trying to match with other people is staggering--every word always feels like the wrong move, and there's no sense of etiquette or respect or rules to follow.

Every conversation I have on dating apps ends abruptly. Matches won't even bother to unmatch with me; they'll just ghost. It would be so easy for them to just leave, or to give some brief, wordless indication that they don't want to continue, but they don't. I just wish someone would tell me what I'm doing wrong. Hell, if they outright told me ""you're hideously unattractive and you have a narcissistic personality"" I'd be thankful. At least I'd know where to start.

It wasn't bad enough to have people not stand to be around me but it was definitely an immature phase I went through. So through the beginning of my junior year I started getting made fun of and it really wore me down. I completely shut down and tried not to talk to people / avoid social situations as much as possible. This included going to the library during lunch and if the library was closed I'd sit in the bathroom stall. Class presentations were hell and I rarely held conversations with anyone. I didn't know how to interact with anyone and was extremely self-conscious when talking to anyone. I'm not as bad today but it's definitely still there.

The college atmosphere was definitely better but my well-being did not really get any better. I'd just go to class, eat lunch alone, then go home. I would've joined a frat but it's just a money dump. Then COVID hit and I lost my job and my social life remains deprived. It goes deeper but there's no point of picking every aspect of my personality.

Instead of sharing advice, I'd appreciate hearing from like-minded people who were stuck in similar situations and what they did to help themselves. Thanks for reading!",lonely,Hi,2020-11-03 13:10:00

Now I’m at the lowest point I’ve ever been in my life (bare in mind I’ve had depression for years). I couldn’t move down to where I was living last year as college is 100% online so it’d be a waste of money. My old friends seem to have all moved on and have so many other friends. We still meet up occasionally but not enough for me to feel like we’re still a friend group. I feel so lonely.

And this guy who I hung out with and I told him I appreciate him reaching out and he was like 'ah ok'. Idk do people just want to keep things light? Do they want to just pretend you're all good and they want you to be cool, and have these cool things going on. Like if you have nothing to offer then it doesn't matter? What is the point then.

for the sake of clarity I will be using fake names. I’ve been feeling pretty sad lately.
I am in a group of three friends , I would say I was super close to Eve and I was kinda close to Lindsay. Lindsay and Eve would hang out through me. I’ve always preferred my relationship with Eve tbh since Lindsay did a lot of shady and hurtful stuff to me. However, I’ve always felt like the friendship ( mine &amp; eve) was not reciprocal I feel like I would always bother her to hang out. But each time we hung out it was great time, I guess she’s not a great texter and all. Eve and Lindsay had a dispute earlier this year then they randomly became friends again &amp; they gotten closer than ever. 

They started hanging out w/o me posting on social media which is fine but kinda hurtful. Then when I would hang out with them, Lindsay would literally go on about what they did together &amp; their future plans &amp; whisper in Eve ears right in front of me . It’s so freakin awkward, I stop communicating with Lindsay for quite a while. However, I decided to hang out with them because I was bored and the same exact thing happened and I further realized how close they are and I’m so jealous ......

because I’ve always craved that type of relationship with Eve for years, yes we were best friends but I’ve always been insecure if she really liked me because I felt like it was always burden when I asked to spend time. Now she’s always hanging out with Lindsay. I’m just kinda sad because this is beyond my control.

I don’t think it was cuz I was uncomfortable I think I was just jealous. I’ve never had a boyfriend before and I just wish I could experience love and closeness. It doesn’t help that I’ve been struggling with self love and trying not to keep all these bad thoughts out of my head like “you’ll never be happy” “you’re never gonna find someone that genuinely loves you” “you’re a literal piece of shit all guys will do is try to use you”. The last time I hated myself this bad was when I was overweight in middle school but now I’m healthy and I like my body but it’s just my face that I don’t like. Sometimes I think I’m pretty and other times I feel like I don’t have a chance of someone ever genuinely thinking I’m beautiful. It’s not fun feeling like this on your birthday, especially when you were happy and feeling yourself and then all the sudden you want to be alone and cry. I just want a hug... a really long hug",lonely,"Sad on my birthday,,, need to vent a little :/",2020-11-03 03:30:16

I found a girl recently. We talked every morning to every night for a month and everything felt mutual. We would talk on the phone almost every night. We would hang out and laugh and just be there for each other. I was happy.

The last few days she's been ignoring my texts more and more often, claiming she was distracted or just forgot. And just goes to bed without saying a word to me.

I'd made a lot of good memories and had a lot of fun experiences with them, but unfortunately I matured much quicker than most of them and have began to realize the kind of people I want to surround myself with, them not really being it. I've been just striding through life alone, working full time. I'm friends with some females at work, both in relationships. But I don't ever see them outside of work. TBH I don't really know why. I feel at this point, I don't need many close friends. I'd be ok with spending most of my time with my best friend. Unfortunately for me I'm also quite impatient, so waiting for a natural friendship to sprout that I can truly call a best friend is hard to just sit back and do.

Not got much going for me. Been beating myself up a bit too much about how I am 25, and have never been romantically involved with anyone, not been intimate with anyone.

I spent too much of my life hating on myself, and letting the way other perceive me weigh me down.


Just long for intimacy too damn much lately, can't take my mind off certain things, the only way I can feel like I can get through it is if I sleep through it.

All I’ve ever learned from people is how to be shitty. It’s made me shitty. I mean I try to do things that I believe help others as much as possible but it doesn’t seem to make a difference in the end. 

    So as a shitty person I think the best thing I could do is go and find an island to live on, or a cabin on top of a mountain over looking a small town. Maybe even a farm in the middle of nowhere. Self sustaining and what not. 

    I like animals. They’re fairly simple. They don’t plot against you. They don’t spread lies for fun. I don’t like humanity and if I could I’d wipe us all out with a push of a button. All I’ve seen from humanity is misery. But since I don’t have that button I’d be content with being alone. 

    I just need to do something big that makes me a lot of money. Like one really good movie or rob a bank. Take my money and disappear. But as most things it’s just not that simple. Sorry for the long post. Just wanted to put it out there I suppose.

Depressed?

Never had a girlfriend?

Not even a kiss?

Introvert?

Suffer from anxiety/ low self esteem?

I may get downvoted for this but it's totally random and I decided fuck it.

If any of the above apply to you, you felt how I felt (I'm in my early 20's now).

I'm going to try to make this as short as possible because there's a lot I'd have to talk about.

I suffered with all the points I made but I very slowly tried to progress after years and years. Little by little, it took a lot but I was fed up of going through the same shit every day and I thought logically. Sitting there crying about how shit my life is, wasn't going to change fuck all. Get up and do it, I don't care if it's just a walk in your front lawn and going back inside, start somewhere.

Most of the people that are depressed or suffer with these points just want to be with someone, or in a relationship. You need to fix yourself up first.

Seriously, if you're a virgin, it's not a big deal (yeah that probably offended you). I know almost everything about how the mindset of my past self but reading other people's perspectives on it throughout the years made me realise how much of an loser (can't use the i word so i'm replacing it).  I was. I wasn't a hardcore loser at all, very mild. Like one of those that felt like I deserved something good just falling out of the sky.

It doesn't work like that. It matters if you don't like small talk or if you just can't be bothered to put your energy into people or tasks. I know you probably think you're going to ""act fake"" or something like that, I used to think that way. But let's be 100% real, when you see all those people out there that can hold a conversation or you know, just say to you, ""Hi, you alright?,"" they're the ones that more people appreciate being around. Not some edgy, depressed always sad person who thinks that they're entitled to others' attention.

Honestly, if you're that upset &amp; can't take it anymore. Just say fuck it and pay for an escort. I can almost guarantee you will suck ass at fucking him/ her and you may probably even regret it due to the cringe. Your hand does a job 10 times better than most of the sex you have. However, it is a good experience and  you will learn from it.

If you're already 20+, I advise you to stop waiting and letting it come naturally because you may end up in the 30+ forever alone subreddit xD Let me be real here, even IF you got that 10/10 hot ass chick, whether it's just a hook-up or something that may become a thing. What the fuck are you going to do? What will you provide? How will you even handle it? Are you going to take here to places and show her into your life or are you going to say ""I don't know"" and let her take charge? And I don't care how much porn  you've watched, you're going to suck ass in bed.

Fix yourself up, get that confidence up and just say fuck it. There's so many guides on YouTube and reddit on everything you can do to improve yourself. I'm aware it's very cliché and it takes a very long time and many cringe or failed experiences, but the results are golden. The thing is, if it's not working for you, you need to ask yourself if it's really not working for you or if you haven't done enough. It doesn't matter if you're weird, own that shit. But don't be that guy that's always feeling sorry for themselves because they're a ""loser.""

Before you complain about ugliness, you can't tell me you haven't ever thought, ""How did she go out with him?"" I know that mindset :) He worked for it and did it right, be him, not the one that's jealous of him. Try and think in this way, the brighter way of looking at things as opposed to the pessimistic evil approach. Oh and random tip, don't be an overly nice guy, it doesn't mean you're changing yourself or being fake. You must understand society to understand what I mean, make sure you show courage and that you won't just be told to do shit by people, have some self respect.

Sorry if I explained this in a way that sounds harsh, I tried to be very brief but also to the point. If you do suffer from any of the key points, you may have read all of this and still not really took what I said seriously, but I guess only you will find out for yourself :)",lonely,Are you a virgin?,2020-11-02 11:53:25

I always could get along with everyone at school but it never went past that, after school I was always lonely, I played video games a lot but once I completely stoppd I realized how hard it sucks, got no one to talk to, laugh with, enjoy my time with etc and got nothing to do at home too

i do have some people that I met at school etc on social media, and watching their stories where they enjoy their time together with their friends just hits me really hard, and dont get me wrong its not that I dont grant them that, that just reaffirms my loneliness, i even say it to myself occasionally, what the fuck... i literally speak to no one and i literally have no one and i literally cant laugh

and it already hurts me now when I fast forward 10 years from now and look back to this time... and realize that i can never go back to my youth, the time you are supposed to have fun

I guess that human connection is something I’ve yearned for a long time now, and it’s something I’m starting to doubt I’ll ever feel.

It’s not just surface level loneliness though it’s like existential. Not many people, where I live anyway, have the same kinds of thoughts or emotion I guess which I do, not that I can see anyway.

Third was to go out with an older woman on a date that i really didnt feel any connection. Last but not lease is to go out with a group of people i met a year ago (that ditched me aside) and go to a halloween house party. Turns out my crush has canceled on me right when i was about to leave my house, i even got the new iphone so we could take good pictures because i had such a wonderful day planned for us both. The hookup also canceled even tho she claimed she really wanted to see me and that im a catch and she hopes im around if her new date isnt as expected.

Now that I finally live alone however, I do miss having that personal connection. I miss trying new things together, I miss watching TV or movies or playing games or even just laying together enjoying each other's company. Hell, even going to the grocery store is something I actually enjoyed because it meant spending more time with someone I loved. I enjoy being alone, we all need alone time at some point or another, but every moment of life is just that much sweeter when you're spending it with someone you love.

I have tons of people around me, revolving in my life somewhere. And yet, I feel so completely alone. Like a solitary island in an ocean filled with archipelagos. I’m no one’s person, and no one is my person. I’m so..so lonely.

At first glance it seems I’m the farthest thing away from loneliness: I’m decently popular on my social media. I get along with everyone at work. I don’t have any qualms with my family or other acquaintances. But after all of that is done and over with, it’s just me..

I don’t have anyone that I can just hit up when I feel like going on adventures (before covid). 

I don’t have anyone to call on when I get in sticky situations. 

I don’t have anyone to laugh with, cry with, fight with, make up with..

 I don’t have anyone to celebrate my successes with, to share my fears with, to get excited with..

I don’t have anyone to have meaningless talks with, to contemplate life with, to just..converse with

When things get overwhelming I don’t have anyone who will tell me “It’s okay you can let your guard down you don’t have to pretend to be tough. Relax you’re safe”

In high school, I made SO many friends through common involvements and constantly being in practice/rehearsals with other people. If we both liked music or theatre or dancing, we jived well (pun not intended but I guess I’ll leave it). I hosted bonfires with 25-30 people at them, got invited to more parties than I could count, I considered literally 10-15 people to be my close friends. Moved away to college, was lonely as fuck at first, but I floated between a couple solid friend groups. These morphed depending on who I lived near/connected best with etc, but I always had 5-10 people I was constantly talking to, along with like 5 close friends I kept back home.

Now I’m 24 and 2 years into my career in a new town. All of the people I work with are either older than me and busy with a family, are engaged and constantly with their S.O, or have completely different interests than myself. My boyfriend and I lost a few common friends because they were very shitty people. My best friend has a ton of friends she spends most of her time with in her new town/at her career. I barely ever talk to my other old friends and I feel like we don’t even know each other anymore when we do try talking. I feel like I only have my boyfriend but I don’t think that’s necessarily healthy for anyone. 

People say to join a club for something that interests you, but I genuinely don’t feel like I have a strong enough interest in anything specific anymore. I love live music, but I’ve really faded out from being able to make friends in that community because that hobby was a money-sucker. My only hobbies are listening to music, reading, and going for walks/hikes.

How the hell do I make friends now? Why does life become so damn lonely? I almost look back at high school and college with frustration now, feeling angry at how those times made me think making friends came naturally in life. I used to think I was likeable.  I’m now at the point where I’m convinced I’m too awkward and negative and I’m fucked for having any new friendships for the rest of my existence.

I have spent 2 years trying to lose weight, and dating is a small reason for me trying to lose weight.  I’ve lost 90 pounds and trying to lose more. I’ve gotten over my mental hurdles and learned how to help myself when something comes my way. I’ve done dating apps since covid hit to try to reach out, only to get no matches. I do still try to use dating apps since I’m not comfortable going out with so many cases. 

I feel like most of my feelings of being lonely has been because of the culture I was raised around and a lot of my friends getting married in the past few months. I’ve always been told I need to get married as a young child, and I now joke about being single for life while those around me tell me that people like me get married fast. 

Some things I need to improve: moving to a location more options. Getting new clothes after losing weight. Telling myself things are okay and I’ll be fine. And so on. I do what I can to remind myself being single is okay.

My best friend/person I am closest to has her own family and significant other to spend holidays with. She has asked what my plans for the holidays are and I lied and said I was spending it with a male friend. I think she only asked because she knows I dont have family or anyone I am too close with in my city and she felt bad for me.

Currently I live with two girls that I dont know. They were friends of friends of friends and needed a roommate at the time that I was looking to move out. They party and do drugs a lot, which is not the scene im into. I go to work and come home and dont interact much with them other than that. I know they think im weird and I dont want them to know I am going to be alone tonight. So I am sitting in my parked car around the corner of my house waiting for them to leave to a party that I overheard them talking about yesterday. I feel embarrassed walking in to see them getting ready, just for me to go to my room and close the door. I know that they wonder why im always by myself, even on holidays.

Sometimes I just wish I didnt exist. I have nothing to live for. All I do is go to work and come home. I have “friends” but none of them reach out, check on me, or invite me to spend time with them. The one person I am close to lives out of state, too far to visit regularly. Sometimes I regret leaving my abusive family, maybe if I hadnt left Id at least still have my siblings.

Yes, I'm very much lonely, but so much of it is because I just can't seem to find people that don't feel like complete aliens to me. And it turn I'm sure I seem like one to them.

I just look at the culture all around me and in the world in general, the ideas, the behaviors, the tendencies and it's just maddening because it all just seems so absurd, so irrational, yet I seem to be completely isolated in this perception.

It's not about wanting everyone to think or feel like I do but the overwhelming strangeness of everyone and everything I was able to find in life is just so deeply isolating. I really feel like I'm an alien born in a human body because nobody influenced me to think and feel like I do (for somebody to influence you they have to be important or matter to you in some way and yeah, no, that just didn't happen), I was just born being like this.

If a genie offered me a choice between like a serious romantic partner and a large circle of friends and a caring family, all ""normal"" people, and just one distant friend/acquaintance but that actually felt real, somebody that felt like a small little in the middle of the insane darkness that's mankind, I'd take the latter a million times over.",lonely,It's like I'm an alien or everyone else is one.,2020-11-01 13:51:21

Technically, on paper, I've got ""a lot going for me."" I have a quaint little studio on the beach all to myself, am going to make about 55k this year (it's not a bad living for a bachelor with a 500 square foot apartment.) I've got a steady job with good healthcare and remote flexibility during the pandemic.

But I'm dealing with a chronic urological condition that is pretty much debilitating. It's a persistent moderate pain that does not allow me to do many basic things, such as go for a brisk walk across the street on the beach. I have no idea if this is going to improve or if I'm in it for the long haul.

I'm reminiscing back to last Halloween. I was on a cruise ship with family and friends and had a one night stand with a girl who was out of my league. I was really on top of the world at that point. Dressing well and feeling good. That weekend was basically the last time I had a good time. Needless to say I've been single since then. All my friends keep in touch over text. Nobody really wants to meet up anymore. It's been a whole year of near total isolation, and the pandemic, no matter what your politics on it, is miserable for everyone. It's so depressing that we're going to have a zoom event for New Years Eve. My gosh.

I have basically 4 immediate family members left. 3 are down here (one is my 90 year old grandfather whose in a nursing home.) The other is my mom and stepfather. They are the only things keeping me from a total mental breakdown. My brother who I love very much is 1,000 miles away and I basically see him once a year.

This one game server where they micspam anime and video game music was so fun. The only thing is they said offensive things like they constantly said mean things about autistic people, and for some reason every time I played they would bring up Chris-chan and make fun of him.

When I told them that I have aspergers syndrome and that I get bullied a lot and that trolls harass me, they at that game server too started to harass me.

It went like this:

 A) I was liked in that server a lot and I felt happy cuz people bully me everywhere else online and offline and they even played on the server on my birthday gifting me steam games then 

B) they kept saying \[really offensive stuff about like autistic people and stuff, better if I don't say it since its so offensive\] then 

B.5) they KEPT bringing up Chris-chan CONSTANTLY over and over, making fun of him for being autistic and being glad that people document his entire life for being autistic then 

C) I was being bullied so much I spoke up to them cuz I thought they were my friends, saying I get bullied online and offline for having aspergers myself then 

D) The nice guy there told me the main mod there has all of my social media accounts bookmarked ready to make fun of me then 

E) I kept joining and people were talking bad about me behind my back and then saying ""oh shi\* \[CrocoSMRPG\]'s here"" then 

F) My mod powers were removed and people.. it was seriously a running joke where people would say ""I can't believe I lost my admin to THESE GUYS."" and no one ever talked back it was a running joke people said over 200 times at that server. I said it myself after I lost my mod powers to joke too since it fitted, and one of the mods there said ""yes \[CrocoSMRPG\]"" then 

G) people admin abused me renaming me to very rude names and casting blind over and over on me so I can't see then 

H) I stopped playing late last year cuz they kept doing that then 

J) I kept complaining a lot of fridays to the nice guy there that I wish I could join. Then the nice guy there asked at that server's Steam chat for me (I didn't ask them to.) about if I could join and they showed me that conversation and then I felt sad tonight about it.

What you really need to know about me is that I live for emotional and psychological connection. I want to care for someone deeply and comprehensively, and maybe have someone do the same for me. I'm missing both sides of the coin and the loneliness and lack of purpose is crushing. It's like a tightness in my chest where I've got so much to give but nowhere to direct it. I have depression and PTSD but I try not to burden others with it. Meaningful connection is the cure, at least for me, but getting through each day without it is a challenge. The world is a really big place but I've gotta believe the connection I want is out there somewhere. I can't just sit back and wait for it to come to me, because it won't. What a world that would be. I'm an INFJ by the way, if you're into acronyms.

My interests include writing, music, movies, video games, exploring nature and deep conversations about life, love and loss. And anything to do with space, I guess. Space is cool. I've been having a real hard time enjoying any of those interests or even being motivated to get out of bed in the morning because the one thing that makes any of it feel fun or important or meaningful just isn't there, and I can't fake it. It's like a house without a foundation to stand on.

If you are looking for something similar, send me a dm. I think I work better with long messages rather than instant messaging. I don't discriminate against anything, so elephant people from Mars are welcome to reply, as long as they're 18 or above.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. It means the world to me that you'd even consider me.

I'm simply looking for someone to talk to on the good days, and the bad. I've been single for over a year, and I'm ok being alone. However, I would like to talk to someone that's looking for the same. Music is my escape from the world in a sense. Everything is so chaotic throughout the day, but I usually always have one headphone in to drown out some of the noise, if that makes sense. 
I struggle to sleep at night, so I tend to seclude with my headphones in and often times drift away with my mind elsewhere. 
I have spotify with many different playlists that reflect all the different types of moods I get in. You can always tell my mood by my music choice at the time. 
I'm hoping someone out there shares a comparable mindset. I'm an introvert, so I stick to myself most of the time. This does not mean that I don't still crave conversation. I do have people in my day to day that I talk to, but it more so just feels like we all all just going through the motions. I'd like to talk to someone new though, a stranger, someone with some mystery behind them. I want to hear about your life, your interests, your struggles. But most importantly, I want to talk to someone that actually shows interest. 
I'm in Arizona, so hopefully we could be around the same timezone. I'd prefer if you dm me though, feels a little more personal.

Well thats what I've been dealing with the last week and I don't know how to feel about it anymore.Last Saturday was my last day at work and as I said goodbye to everyone my crush is the last person who came to talk to me right before I left. I gave her a love/thank you letter with some chocolates as a way to tell her how much she meant to me. Even when I told her I liked her she smiled and told me she wasn't looking to date anyone because she wanted to focus on her classes which I was ok with and I still wish her the best of luck with that. Last thing I told her was I wanted to keep in contact even after I left so she writes down my number and SC on her phone, I obviously felt excited to think that maybe I would truly get to see her more even after im gone. As I was getting ready to leave she comes up to me and she starts putting her arms out to hug me, I was scared to say the least I've actually never hugged a girl before so I backed away from her just a bit until she tells me, ""its ok, its fine you don't have to worry about it"". We hugged and the best way I could describe it, my emotions were numb all my self hatred was gone and I truly felt like I could like her all over again . After that I jokenly asked her if we were going for the hover over the shoulder type of hug, she doesnt say anything but look down and smile. We said our goodbyes and as I watched her walk away I couldn't help to feel like I didn't want to leave her alone I wanted to stay but how can I. The whole ride home I was just oblivious to one fact about this whole situation but i was happy so damn happy and somehow I felt like things would be alright between us so I ignored it. When I did get home I spent the rest of the day moaping around, the reality is that after that day I wouldn't see her ever again and the chances of her texting me back were next to none. Every hour that went by I counted it and told myself that thats how long since I've seen her. Worst I imagined what if a better looking guy, more charming, and knew how to play his cards better than I did swooped up and took her I couldn't do anything worst I though of myself as a burden on the face of the earth and I'm pretty certain she's all but forgotten about me so why can't I do the same? As of today than im writing this its been a week since I last talked to her and although I'm no longer expecting a text from her im just wishing her well no matter what but that hug still resonates with me I still think of it as ""why she hugged me in the first place I mean I didn't mean anything to her or did I? Maybe thats why she came over a couple of times to see me even when she had her own work to do.""
