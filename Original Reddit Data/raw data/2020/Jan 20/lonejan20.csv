5,NicoTheCatto,1580466370,1,"This is my first post on reddit so i hope i fllow the reddiquette well enough

I'm a 17 yr old asperger with an abnormaly high amount of empathy, i always look out for everyone and always try to help, but i'm not exactly sure why's that. Aspergers aren't supposed to behave like this from every material i've ever read about.  
Even if there's this large discrepancy, the several tests i took are quite insistent on me being an asperger, even if in a slight aspect. Or maybe it's just wrong, to be frank i dont really understand myself well, but again, who does? it doesn't really matter that i'm asperger or not, normal people can be awkward as well.

Anyhow, the problem is that wanting to be an extravert while acting like the total opposite by default isn't great. But i mean i can live with it.

I can't push myself to be an extravert since loneliness isn't an issue for me. thanks to ""years of training against my several handicaps"" (which i'd rather just call growing up, but my mom seems to want me to believe i'm a special snowflake), i can handle myself really well and being alone just feels... meh to me.

Being with people isn't that great either.  
I don't exactly feel at ease with others, they say it's cause i can't relax and i'm always on edge but i wish they'd teach me how to not be on edge.

So, if you were brave enough (or caring enough) (or bored enough) to go through this boring post, can you please tell me if there's anyone else like me? i dont think they'd want to meet me since i hardly see how i could cope with myself, but at least they may have some advices about how to deal with all this.

9,floewrboy,1580465081,1,"you may see this post in another sub, sorry, im just trying to get answers.

so a little context, im a dude, a 9th grader. going to graduate later this year.

 2 weeks ago, everything felt very normal in school. i still had some (not much) dude friends, i hang out with girls sometimes, but usually when they invited me to chat or something. and frankly i really didnt mind having just a few friends. things felt normal albeit i felt much lonelier than last semester, but i kinda got used to that at the time. 

and a week ago was when it got worse, some of my classmates (another group of dude friends) who i was not very close with was teasing me with a obvious intention of bullying me. that in itself was strange. i knew those particular people disliked me, but they usually kept it to themselves and/or just plain avoided me.

its this particular week, when it was much, much worse. it felt like i hit genuinely rock bottom. it feels like ALL my dude friends are avoiding me. if i try
to get into a conversation they wont even reply to my questions, during lunch pretty much every one of them was teasing me, and it really, really, destroyed me. 

i dont know why they suddenly start to avoid me this past week, i felt like i didnt do any wrong to them. 

please help me. i felt like ive done what i could, trying to talk to them again, helping them with their school work, and generally trying to be social to them and nothing worked, they just seem to avoid me still. 

ive gone through 3 years of middle school with all those people, it felt like i really built something. felt like i finally had friends, because prior then i was a very quiet kid.

it feels like i built a house with all my blood and sweat, and seeing it burn to the ground, and there‚Äôs nothing i can do about it.",lonely,it feels like everybody‚Äôs suddenly trying to avoid me this past week.,2020-01-31 21:04:41

32,GeneralWalters421,1580444931,1,"This is a kind of complicated situation so it may be a very long and ranty post, but essentially I am feeling very lonely, and have not had any friends since primary school. A week ago I turned 18, and apart from some family who felt obligated, I  got no birthday wishes. I didn't even have a cake or anything. The whole ordeal was pretty depressing, and 18 is supposed to be a big deal. It's not really because I'm terribly shy, in fact I enjoy public speaking and have made acquaintances in class easily enough, I just never really get to the actual friend stage, This is due to a bunch of reasons including my parents having a rough divorce forcing me to move around the world a bunch, plus me having Asperger's.

I'm now in university, and I've meet a girl who is the first person I'd really call a friend in such a long time. Essentially I meet her in class, and found we shared lot's of interests, so I invited her out, something I never really did before. Long story a bit shorter, I clumsy became friends with her, and was very awkward and immature many times, despite this she stuck by. I even told her about my Asperger's, and she assured me that it's fine, as she is pretty shy and socially awkward herself. Were both shy and nerdy history students, and I generally really like her, and relate to her, like more than I have liked anyone before...

So yeah, I have kind of fallen for her... She's 3 and a half years older than me, and is generally much more mature than me. And frankly I'm pretty certain she does not feel the same way about me. However this is not even my problem. I would like to be in a relationship yes, but if I'm being honest I'm not even sure I'm mature enough to be in a relationship. What I'm really looking for most, is closeness, something I have never found in a friend before so I guess I was looking for in a relationship. Along with this stability and longevity, because I want friendship that won't die as soon we change classes, and something I don't feel like I constantly maintain on my end. 

The problem is that I'm not really sure how much she likes me, even as a friend. A few days ago, I went to the theater with her, and I've sorta suggested doing something else in the coming weeks, but I want to be with her more, and spend more time with her. The thing is, she's not super willing to do things that much, mainly because she's just busy with school (as am I), and I think I have gotten obsessed with her. I'm not really sure what to do though, as she is pretty much my only friend, and as pathetic as it seems, the only thing giving me some much needed purpose to life as of late. I would like to be honest about some of my confusion, and even my feelings with her, but I also don't want to make her uncomfortable, or ruin the friendship we do have. 

In terms of making other friends, and not just relying on one, I know, but frankly I have no interest in making surface level friends to hang out with, I just want one or two close ones. Like I already get basic social interaction in school, so that's not really a problem. It'd just be nice to at least get a wish on my birthday I guess... I don't know what to do, I can't give up on this girl, or just abandon her because ""it's not working out"", it is working out, it's the most a relationship has worked out with me in many years. The problem is that I am not fulfilled, I would like something more but I don't know how to get it.

TLDR: I am very lonely and have not had close friends since primary school. Now that I am in university I meet a girl been the first actual friend I have had in such a long time. Were both shy and nerdy history students, and we have been texting and hanging out quite a bit. I generally really like her, and relate to her, more than I have liked anyone before, and I have kind of fallen for her. But I don't think she feels the same way, nor do I think I am mature enough for a relationship. I'm confused on what I want, but I think that I am really looking for closeness, stability, and longevity, whether it's through dating or friendship, but I'm not sure how in both cases.",lonely,"I (18M) feel very lonely, and am desperate for some form of close relationship whether it's through dating or friendship.

33,born2B_ironic,1580444848,1,"Years ago my beloved one suddenly broke up with me, without further explanations, and that really did hurt me so much. Besides that, the then beloved one persuaded most of my close friends to simply ignore me or worse. In a week I lost the love of my life and a bunch of friends.  


For months I walked like an undead, this was probably the darkest time of my life. It was like if I was dead and nobody really give a fuck. Then I moved some 900km away to a new city that I hated from beginning, utterly alone. As friendships are hard to me to start, I kept alone most of the time and engaged only in casual small-talk.   


Solitude can be a blessing thing, though. Deep wounds are slowly cured by the time as it pass, and each day I discovered a new reason to smile. Spending my time reading, cooking, writing, caring for myself, and suddenly I realized the wounds was cured. There were scars, indeed, but no more pain.   


As the time goes, a lot of cool people get around me, and now I am probably much more beloved by my new friends that I even had been before. Some of the most beloved persons I met years after that dark broke-up. And it is like if I've been a ghost for a while and then reborn.   


For those who are right now in their deepest darkness, alone, suffering, it may pass and you will be better sooner than realized. In truth, I can not simply say the things will be magically better with time, sometimes they just don't.

I've NEVER been in a relationship before. No kisses, no handholding and definitely no affection or love from anyone...
I turned 20 and I already feel like I'm gonna die alone, never having the joy of having someone by my side, raising children or hell... even being supportive when I'm on the edge and I wanna fucking kill myself. I'm totally fucking drunk right now btw, but I can't take my father's stories anymore about him having tons of girlfriends... I just can't...

I never even had a chance with anyone....  I just know that it's not even worth trying because noone in their right mind would ever date my ugly fucking fatass. It's like I'm a hideous monster and every single woman is a fabulous princess that gags from the sight of me...

Someone please fucking help me. I don't wanna be alone. I don't want this. I fucking hug my pillow to feel like someone's there for me. That's not fucking normal and I know it. I should just end it and that's it, no more problems. No loneliness, nothing... Just the bliss of not having to live another day on this fucking planet alone and suffering. It's torture seeing everyone around me being happy and accepted with simeone who loves them. And here I am not even loving myself and noone else loving me either.


Quick disclaimer: I'm not actually gonna fucking kill myself, it just feels good to say it and let it out of my system anonymusly, couse I'd be locked up in a mental hospital if I said this shit out loud irl... yeah I know, this isn't healthy but neither is being alone for my entire fucking life, so fuck you.
I'm sorry about that, I really shouldn't be using reddit to deal with my problems at 3 am while drunk as fuck, but drunk me is probably the most honest me so at least that's a plus.

47,Pa_rzival,1580434942,2,"Oy, This is a long one.

I was ostracized most of my life. I didn't fit the cookie cutter I suppose. I was this average spazzy kid who evolved into an average loner that no friend group would accept. There was, as always, a girl. Lets call her Jem . Jem didn't laugh at mean jokes, she was kind and read books she didn't have to. She seemed sad a lot. She was moderatley popular and had a friend group. She was pretty too. Nothing special, long legs, skinny jeans, long and curly dark brown hair and a nice but average pair. She was smooth and rubenesque, all curves and a small/cute butt. (I have vowed not to deny myself the simple pleasures of daily life, please do not judge me). She got her braces off about a year ago. She happened to be one of the only ones I was fond of in my childhood. There were plenty of hotter, cuter and nicer girls in my class but she was special. She was funny and yet sad, ad very literary. She was one of the greatest writers I've ever known besides myself. Just before our last year at school together, we exchanged numbers. We agreed to meet over summer for a date, after I came home from my grandparents. But something happened and maybe if I hadn't mentioned it to her I wouldn't be writing this. A few things happened really, she would describe it as ""the nova effect"". When I was up at my Grandparent's my gran ended up in the hospital for 3 weeks while a few surgeries were done on her heart. Not just this, but I was told to keep it from my parents back down south who would apparently be too upset if I told them and bring me right home. I'm a bit more grown now and I would tell them if I was mature as I am back then. But I agreed, because I still though grownups knew all. My parents tugged away at me and every day I refused them, while Gran got sicker. I also happened to be going through lifeguard training, which was especially grueling in 106 degree heat. I had also just been diagnosed with anxiety. I had quite a bit to complain about, and I dumped it all on her at once. What I didn't realize was what she had just come out of. Her parents had divorced many years ago and her stepmom, frankly, is an asshole. She worries a lot about her dad too, who works too hard. She was just discovering herself and what she wanted out of the world when I vented all my frustration and sadness on to her and it damaged us. She was really into self care and all that and before I knew it I was outta there. My date was cancelled. I wallowed in self pity for a few weeks until we started talking again, and met up one day for a day at the beach. We talked and decided to be friends and support each other through what we were going through. And for a while it was great, we were strict friends who cuddled a bit sometimes. We weren't romantic but we were close and enjoyed each other's company. (Not like that). We walked around town a lot and read our self-written stories to each other in high places. For a while, I was in love, but not the romantic kind. We had a deep, stable connection where we had managed to understand each other when most around us could not understand themselves. We walked around nature, malls and the forest and just talked and messed around. One day, she said she had a date. And I was happy for her, I really was. Lets call him Wilson. Wilson may as well have been a male clone of Jem. He lived far away and we bonded on a lot of subjects, one of them being Jem. They are really cute together and I'm still happy for them. But eventually, me and Jem drifted apart. The breaking point was my birthday which I spent at her house, and while we had a ton of fun, watching a movie together in bed as ""just friends"" when one of them has a boyfriend is strenuous. A few weeks later we agreed to break it off. Though I and only I know I did it for her. All I ever wanted was her to be happy, and now she has that I guess. But when I logged back on to Instagram for the first time in months today and the first thing I saw was them kissing on that same beach our friendship began, I threw up. It still guts me to this day. I miss you a lot J.M. high school is hard enough without you. No one will ever replace you, even if she Stars. (inside joke). Jesus Im crying now.

yesterday, i got broken up with by the guy i thought i'd be with forever. i loved him, i loved his eyes, his smile, his personality, his laugh, just him. i was really in love with him. but in his eyes, i was just a distraction and i don't know if he ever really did love me, or if he just wanted a pair of boobs or an ass to look at. i really don't know.

the day the breakup happened, i knew it was coming. from the days before, he was acting really dry and put absolutely no effort into talking to me, and because of that, i got a little angry. i would take longer times to answer his snapchats, which would usually only be an extra maybe 5 minutes before i responded, but that would lead to him not responding for hours. at that point i just knew it was happening and i started crying for days on end. a few hours before our breakup, i was crying to my friends about the whole situation and ended up missing one of my classes because of my breakdown in the bathroom. i went to my friends' house afterwards and tried calling him but he wouldn't answer. he said he couldn't call. my friend got angry and sent him a long paragraph about him being and asshole n whatnot, he got angry at not only her but also me. in the span of 30 minutes we broke up. 

i went home crying not too long after, i spent my night crying in my bed, not leaving until the next morning (today). when i woke up, i cried. sat on the bus, i cried. got to first period, i cried. second period, cried, and so on. when i got home, i just got so drained i couldn't even cry for more than 5 minutes. i'm currently crying while writing this, i feel so alone and i miss him so so so so much. i miss talking to him, i miss hugging him, i miss everything about him. he was my first everything, now he's my first one gone.",lonely,i miss what i had.,2020-01-31 12:21:32

I have no people that I text, no people I message, no people I visit, no people I see in public and say hi to, no people to talk on the phone with, no people to play games with, no people to go out with, no people to tag in funny memes, etc. Just no people.

In highschool, I met a few people I would call friends, and have since lost all of them, and have never made any more. The more I think about it, the more I realize that the friends I had in highschool were more relationships of convenience- we sat together, so to pass time, you talk to the person next to you, but once class is over, that relationship doesn't go with you. But since then, I dont even make relationships of convenience. I see people come into work, be there a few days and already better friends with everyone than I will ever be.

I try. I do. I try to spark up conversations, join group conversations, show an interest in other people, etc. But still I end up working places for several years, and still have made zero friends there. I try online and it doesn't work either. There is just something about me that doesn't allow any sort of friendship. Thats why I'm not posting in any of the make friends subs bc I know its impossible for me, even if someone went out of their way to try to make it happen.

Most of the time, it doesn't bother me. Or at least I can keep the loneliness at bay by staying busy and not thinking about it. But sometimes it really gets to me. I wish I was normal. I wish I knew exactly what to do or how to act or what to say to make someone want to be my friend. I wish I knew even how to be a friend.

A little context, I've been struggling with a bad breakup for over a year now. Well today it finally happened, I saw she's with someone else. And I'm happy, I'm so glad she found someone. But it just reminds me I'm still alone, and I felt sad. So I turn to a group chat with my two best friends and share the news, they're sympathetic and understand. But then one of them says he's weirded out by the fact I 'stalk' her profile, when me and my other friend go against him he suddenly grows all defensive and claims we're ganging up on him, calls my other friend a brown-noser and says we're both 'delusional', then mocks me saying ""boo-hoo"" etc. 

I felt really hurt by this, he's meant to be my best friend, I've known him most of my life and we grew up together. And when I'm struggling with something, he's not even the least bit empathetic. So of course I then ask for him to not be a cunt and I try to explain my situation, and say he should be more supportive as he's my friend. He then mocks me for this too, saying ""don't pull the 'muh friend' card on me"" and ""congratulations you have my opinion and not my support""

I just feel like an idiot for thinking he'd ever properly change. For context, he's never been in a serious relationship or even properly dated anyone. Yet he makes fun of me for something he wouldn't even understand.

I want to tell him i'm done being friends, but then I just lose yet another person in my life, and soon I'll just have no one at all...I know I shouldn't let people walk over me, but I'm also scared of losing a best friend, and I know for a fact he won't apologise for this.

Hearing everyone's stories on Reddit has inspired me to want to help others. I've dealt with a lot of past depression/anxiety/homicidal thoughts myself, and this has all driven me to want to change the world. My goal is to help impact 1 billion lives. With this, I've created the opportunity for people to write me their stores of what may have impacted your life to cause mental illness of any sort. I'm hoping to capture as many stories and tell the world so we can help others through their toughest moments in their lives.

Would anyone be interested in sharing their story to me? This story will be told to the world on my channel I created which I hope can help others achieve the help they need to get through these similar scenarios. I would love to hear your story and maybe one day you can save the life of another. We can all help each other and help put an end to the stigma of remaining silent about our problems.

You can send them to my personal channel email at [shatteredmindstories@gmail.com](mailto:shatteredmindstories@gmail.com)

Do all of these social people just have no internal chatter going on in their heads, so they just talk all the time by default? Social people talk non stop, about anything, they go to social events (even if they don't want to) and go on breaks and lunches with each other. They have to be around people 24/7. And i'm not exaggerating here. Like 80% of people at least, always have to be talking. 

Growing up i was never like this, because i was always inside my head. I have to be under the influence of something to turn those voices/thoughts off. I'm extremely intellectual and can't relate to surface based conversations. And if i do i get tired of them very quick. But i notice other people do this constantly.

I'm at a point where I look at myself and actually understand why I'm this old and this lonely. And then I go online, like you did, to find someone to at least talk to this week, outside of work... And there's you. And that other guy. And that one. That one.. And.. Oh my, we are so many. And it's a problem that will last for a long long time that those who don't fit in the perfect pattern of society - house, relationship and a dog - will never again fit in. And the more time goes on, the more I have the feeling that I (or we) are screwed. I can't seem to shake that feeling.

All I'm saying to you young ones.. Go out. Do anything to not end up old, lonely and without much perspective. Like me, kinda..

73,Skimtomato,1580413462,1,"I've always been a loner in romance and have friends who I am really really close with. I'm always the one to host at my place the pregame before we go out to bars and even before being 21 (which I am now) my place was still the hangout place. These people are here for me and have been there for me for years and I'm thankful for it. However, they're all guys and some have had relationships and some haven't and I never have.

I've dealt with social anxiety and didn't want it anymore so I exposed myself to uncomfortable situations over the past 4 years of college and think I completely got rid of it. Even now, I'm in a class that is like an open office internship 8 hours a day twice a week. I know there for sure I beat my social anxiety and I'm proud of that. I would have hated this environment a few years ago.

However, I've never been in a relationship, never kissed, never held hands and I've pretty much been fine with that for a long time. But now I want to change that and have been trying for the past couple of years. I don't really let my friends know cause it's my own venture and sometimes it becomes a bit weird since we don't talk about girls other than celebrities and some of my friends are behind in having even ever tried to be in a relationship.

I've had crushes, I've gotten to know girls, I've asked girls out that I knew, I've asked girls out that I didn't know. I've handled rejection and it doesn't bother me. I've learned from times I've been creepy and times when I'm being annoying. I've learned when girls that go to lunch with me just do it because they're friends and then reject me afterwards when I try and further it. I've done it all on my own until this last girl where I told my friend who has had multiple girlfriends to learn everything about what I am doing and point out what I'm doing wrong, if anything.

This newest girl I first had a crush on and tried asking her out before we really knew each other and she just ghosted until we had class again and said sorry she was busy. So I said ok and didn't care. But then I tried to just be friends with her and we have more classes together this semester and I'm more comfortable around her and she is with me. It's not awkward anymore.

I told my friend about it and he guided me on what to do as I told him everything we did or talked about to get some help on what's going on. I also can confidently say I have asked girls out that are out of my league and this one I thought was *in* my league which made me want it even more. What I see in the eye contact and the occasional comments led me into thinking she isn't the type to just say yes to a date and had to get to know me first which we've now done. We've had lunch together because of that 8 hour class and we've found each other before and after class to make sure we can sit together.

Now my friend, acting as a voice in my head through tons of texts guided me on what to do. And now I asked her out and felt like she was actually interested but might be busy and will let me know. That was on Monday and yesterday I brought it up because it's the last time I see her till next week and she said she forgot to let me know and just again said she'll let me know with less interest.

I'm not typically lonely so maybe I'm not meant to be on this sub because I have friends and even though I've never had a relationship, it hasn't *really"" bothered me but it has bothered me. Yet this time is different and hurt way more than I thought it would.

I've dealt with social anxiety, I don't think I've ever had depression, I've practiced what to do with girls and I know I'm not creepy or a nice guy anymore. But I think even my friend was surprised in thinking that the stuff she said to me was showing there could be something.

What I do share with you all though is that when there's one I think I can make something with, that's already 100% a necessity in my mind. I don't want to say oh well anymore. I'm no longer frustrated and mad, now I'm just sad. I thought for sure this was it, I thought I was actually about to know what it's like to be in a relationship and with someone that I actually feel attracted me first by her looks then personally became even more prevalent with what I knew I wanted. Yesterday is the first time I actually just hugged my pillow and instead of saying to myself ""this'll be another person soon"" I just actually shed a few tears. I've gone through frustration which I knew wouldn't help me and I've gone through not caring which I thought would make it easier but now I'm just starting to feel hopeless.",lonely,I have friends but this is about a relationship,2020-01-31 06:44:22

85,spiralfungus,1580399689,1,"Okay, so i decided to post something on here just because why not.

In this paragraph i'll give my starting experience, if u don't care u can skip to the next paragraph. I've been lonely ever since i can remember, i'd say starting from the 4th grade of school at, at the age of 9 year old. I had really strong troubles in making friends, i reckon it was because my personality was strange and annoying. Growing up my  family never really show that they cared about me, I live with my mother and sister. My dad was an alcoholic and caused problems that a typical alcoholic would cause, when i was a small child aged 2-3 perhaps ,apparently he had hit my mother and chased after my sister in drunk rage. He was an angry fellow, i remember him always having temper problems. My family had originally moved out of the city he was since my mom found a job somewhere else. He ended up saying he was sorry and moved back in with us shortly until having to get a job in another province. The real reason he couldn't stay with us however is because he didn't get along with staff and employers and his alcoholism had partly to blame, although i'm not entirely sure. I'd say he left the house when i was in my second or third grade of school. He seemed to like me and treat me ok however my mother and sister treated me like I was a black sheep. My sister is 8 years older than me by the way. I could go on and on about the details of each grade but i'll think i'll fast forward and summarize it. My family that i live with (mother and sister) knew another language which i was not taught as a child reasons partically because of my father,that being gujrati . They would shame me for not knowing it and being unable to speak it and would speak among themselves ignoring me. My mother would let my sister get away with emotionally and physically abusing me on a couple of instances, which although may have not been much it did stick. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically since I was young i had strong trouble making friends and i've been painfully lonely. I did end up making two somewhat good friends, but  we don't hangout out much due to lack of shared interests, and they have their own friends as well. I basically haven't developed as a person due to problems in my family environment and mental issues so it makes me simply unable to connect with other human beings. I feel sick everyday. Once i met a girl online and i thought we kicked it, but then it stopped because i'm such a shallow person being unable to express anything since my life has been painfully boring and monotonous. In less than a few months time she stopped talking to me.This girl made me feel happy for a bit .I've gotten over this but i feel very empty inside and to be honest i don't have any real happiness in life. At the moment i also have some physical health problem that burden me, to be exact severe eczema which makes me extremely itchy and unable to engage in any activities that require concentration. I'm bed ridden and very sad. I could go on and on, but i'll just stop here. This is my bit.

90,Sebastiano93,1580395618,1,"* Have you ever found difficult to interact with people?
* Have you ever felt like you don‚Äôt fit into your social circle?
* Have you ever thought that you are missing something by being lonely?
* Have you ever thought that you would like to be considered more?
* Have you ever thought that you deserve good and faithful friendships instead of all those fake friends?

We are humans, we are meant to stay with others and is normal to feel lonely if we don‚Äôt have anyone. We need social connections to feel good.

Someone find it easy and some do not.

Someone has a lot of connections and some do not.

But at the end, in our old age, what we will remember are just our good memories that we have shared with faithful friends and loved ones.

Make good friends may seem difficult, but if you know where to look and how to choose them it will be a lot easier.

&amp;#x200B;

*I would like to share with you guys some advice that helped me a lot a few years ago:*

&amp;#x200B;

* Realize that *you can‚Äôt be friends with everyone*. I‚Äôm not saying that there are good and bad people, I‚Äôm also not saying that this is an excuse to not be respectful with each other, but we are all different and we can‚Äôt get along with everyone, so don‚Äôt demoralize yourself if it doesn't work with that person or the other one and just accept that.
* *Know what you want*, don‚Äôt try to be someone you are not just to attract others, otherwise you will get just fake friends. Instead be yourself and make sure to know what you really want for YOU and whom YOU are looking for.. You will be surprised on how many people you will know that agree with you.
* *People are not bad*, they just think about themselves first, like everyone else does (and yes, you do it as well). Just when you start to know someone and you build a strong connection with this person he will put you as one priority as well, but you can‚Äôt expect that if you didn‚Äôt build something with him first. We all have to reach that trust with each other.
* In the end, *we only regret the chances we didn‚Äôt take*, thinking too much about something will stop you from doing it. So if you want to do something, if you want to say something, if you want to speak with someone, if you want to go somewhere.. JUST DO IT, you have nothing to lose but the chance to be happy, otherwise you will wake up one day thinking ‚Äú*what would have happened if...*‚Äù without ever know the answer.

i stayed over at a pals house last night, i use to live there with him and my very loving partner - who i broke up with in november. i was laying on the sofa drunk and sad when muscle memory took over and I had the distinct feeling that i was waiting for midnight,  when my partner would come home from work nudge me awake with a microwavable lasagne in hand and a soft kiss on the head - every weekend on the exact sofa. it only lasted for a moment but it was so strong. i do miss him very much, but i still think i did the right thing ending it so clean. im just so fucking lonely. i didn't realise how casual all of my friendships were until i was alone. idk im just drunk and full of emotions and god if i don't tell someone i will just collapse.

I love dogs! They are my heart and soul. If you love dogs too, let's share pictures of our dogs, and stories.

I live in the Eastern part of the U.S., near the Great Lakes. It's snowy, icy, and cold, but I love going outside anyway. I love Natural Beauty, snow, ice, the Ocean, the stars, the Moon, the Universe. I love life, and feeling alive.

I also love 420. I am a 420 guru yogi, I practice hypnosis, meditation, yoga, and positive, healing psychic energy.

I am addicted to Psybient Music, it is the music of my soul.

I believe friendship is magical. Friends help me in so many ways. I am addicted to positive people. Life is cruel, painful, and unfair, but positive friends help us carry on, stand up, and face the crisis, the best way we can.

To be my friend, you have to have something in common with me. You can be any age, gender, race, location, but we have to have some common interest, for the conversation to build on. You have to be willing to share something about yourself, and trust me, just a little, so a friendship can grow.

I love hypnosis! I've hypnotized people in every corner of the world, using online video like Messenger. I would love to hypnotize you, to feel more confident, motivated, to heal pain from the past, and to help you reach your goals.

Hypnosis is the opposite of small talk. We both express our spiritual side... We talk about our fears, pain, and dreams. It's magical, and it's easy to make a special friendship through hypnosis.

Always had terrible social anxiety as long as I can remember. At probably one of the worst points possible my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me. Online communities and video games were 95% of my social interaction for the better portion of 2011-2017. I used to believe avoiding my anxiety was the way to go, thinking I was saving myself all this trouble. Around 2016/2017 (age 16/17) I began to just feel discontent with just about every aspect of my life. All the things I used to enjoy I slowly began to hate. Slowly grew more and more depressed, while my family was oblivious to it all. 2018 I started university, yet I am again partially handicapped by my situation in a way seeing as i commute to school  (30 mins away) rather than live on campus. Granted, the school is majority commuters and extremely introverted as is. With that being said, however, I am not only telling myself but also being told how I will make so many new friends, and all the things I will experience. First semester I literally talked to no one except for my one class group for a project. By this point I pretty much completely hated myself. I have been deprived, whether by my own actions or others, of all social contact for the better part of a decade. Humans are, infact, social creatures. This lack of socialization has ruined me. I am incapable of making simple friendships with others let alone anything meaningful which at this point is the only thing I crave. Into 2019 I tried very hard to push myself out of my comfort zone, and to attempt to actually socialize. This has yielded essentially 0 results. One thing I have yet to understand is how people are so easily able to make friends with people. I will get to a class and watch as people sit down and after a week of classes people have their friend groups within classes whilst I am stuck sitting alone watching. People don't make an effort to talk to me never have, which leaves me wondering why that is the case, what is wrong with me that people never approach me to simply introduce themselves as I see others do on a daily basis? Regardless, at this point i am atleast attempting to talk to people and socialize. 2019, start of sophomore year. I am sitting waiting for my second class of the semester when this very attractive girl comes up to me, noticing my motorcycle helmet, and invites me to ride with her (also a biker) sometime. Of course, I was ecstatic at this opportunity. Since then I've become quite close friends with her (her words) and this makes me feel good about myself. But still it is lacking, and I feel great discontent. I continue through the semester, putting myself in VERY uncomfortable situations in an attempt to be more social. This act of forcing me out of my comfort zone, with my anxiety, has lead me to a point where, in addition to the 'normal anxiety symptoms, i feel sick nearly every day, coming home only to vomit and be miserable. In addition, if I feel any emotions at all, it is that of pure sadness, then anger. Yet, I push on and continue to force myself.  Through the semester i make ""temporary"" friends with my physics lab partners, and maybe 1 more friend, all of whom I only see in class except for 1 occasion they dragged me out to lunch. Once the semester ended I lost contact with all of them except the ""biker chick"". As of 2020 so far this semester seems to be a repeat of my first, having not talked to a single soul in the 3 weeks that have gone by. Despite this, however, I have heard back from one of the friends I made last semester asking me to hang out multiple times as well as the ""biker chick"" and have hung out a few times these past weeks with plans to do it more. Seems like things are getting better Right? Ive established a few friendships, finally, after 9 long years!! But no. I still feel a great discontent. I have developed feelings for this ""biker chick"" but I am terrified to express it for fear that it would cause the demise of our friendship which, in it's current state, I GREATLY value. If that werent enough, i then get caught in my head and remind myself that in a few short months uni will be hald way over, and what do i have to show for it, 2 friends and a lackluster 3.27 gpa? I beat myself up mentally Every day over this, and Every day that goes by I hate life a little more. The last thing I think at night before drifting off to sleep for the past 24 months is the thought of not waking up so I wouldn't have to deal with the shitshow that is my life. Although I do not consider myself at risk of commiting suicide, i often contemplate a world where I did, or simply one without me. At this point I do not know what it will take to make me content with life. What is it that I crave? friends, acceptance, meaningful relationships? This is what I thought it was after depriving myself of social contact for so long, seemed logical enough. I feel as though I will never rid myself of this feeling of discontent, and that terrifies me. I have barely gotten myself through the past 2 years and can't stand the thought of another day. I am sick of hearing ""you're not alone"" I am sick of hearing ""you will grow out of it"" or ""you're just shy"". I am sick of everything that is my life now, and this is only the surface of my problems seeing as it doesn't even take into account the Shit I receive from family among other things. I try to downplay how I feel.

 Although I may describe it as discontent, or simply sadness, the feeling is much stronger than the wording may let on. In addition this greatly simplifies most all situations.

Not sure what I intend to accomplish by writing this. Perhaps hoping it has a therapeutic affect on me seeing as i have no one to talk to about things anyways.",lonely,My Thoughts to words (mumbo jumbo disorganized af),2020-01-30 18:06:13

117,wedragonsarereal,1580364230,1,"Gonna preface because people like to jump down my throat about being in a relationship and being lonely. You need relationships outside your partner. I have not had trouble with people wanting me romantically, or more realistically in most cases, sexually. Not at all the same relationship as a friendship. - Rant

Ever since really early childhood I have been unable to make and maintain friendships. I was outgoing up until the second grade but I lost my best, and closest ever friend in a tragic kidnapping/murder at 7. Ever since then I have plummeted socially, becoming completely isolated. I can't make friends, and any time I managed, I have ended up manipulated and literally abused in my high school friendships. They would literally hit me and use me as a walking ATM. I don't mean a nudge on the shoulder, I mean a slap or a punch for getting out of line. Not to mention the emotional, and verbal abuse.

Anyways, anyone else who I began a friendship with disappeared after weeks or months. Suddenly not wanting anything to do with me. I went to sushi with a group of people, and after that one time they started saying it was cancelled.. It wasn't. Yet they still asked me to buy them lunch with the money I never had. When I could not, which was most of the time, they would suddenly remember this thing they all had to do and leave.

I have tried not caring what others think, going with the flow, initiating, but no matter what everyone leaves me. I've sought advice from therapists and worked on myself for years but nothing helps. I find myself wondering now ""What is so wrong with me?"" I do my best to be kind and considerate, I value their interests and try to engage on things they like to. No one ever wants to hear about me though. No one cares.

I have never had successful friendships with women, and every man I thought was my friend ended up to be just trying to sleep with me. Everytime I thought the friendship was going well they would ask  ""So.. Would you ever date/have sex with me?"" and not be able to handle no. Despite me not being single since 13. (multiple relationships, basically I was always taken when they would ask this sh\*t) Then break off the friendship because of me saying no. They would go all r/niceguys on me for not putting out, ending my relationships, or giving them what they wanted.

My boyfriend is a bit of a social butterfly, in an ambivert way. He has had the same loyal friends since elementary, and swiftly made friends in college. He is the center of his social groups, in every chat, invited, no. Practically begged to attend every get together, event, party. I go with him to some but his friends see me as like an accessory they have to agree to so he will go sometimes. He doesn't try to rub it in, but hearing and seeing everyone dote on him, getting calls right after starting a phone call with me to leave in 5 minutes to hangout  with some who called him out of the blue. It feels bad. It just makes me feel pathetic and awful. 

Hell I had a few people to hangout with because I was in a convenient place and I brought him and they wanted to hangout with him more than me. I literally got told after I moved a bit away that the only reason he hung out with me was because I was right down the street and it was easy. Last time we were supposed to ""hangout"" I arranged it and then last minute he asked me if someone else could come, I reluctantly agreed. He then drove to pick this person up who lives really close to where I live over 4 hours before he got me, hung out with them all day, invited 2 people who actively talk about how much they dislike me, after telling me they weren't going to be there. Didn't tell me they were there and then the girl acted like a c\*nt the entire time, literally turning away from me and making faces from the second I got there. Immature much. ALSO he picked up the other guy, and made me ride with complete strangers. Needless to say that bridge is burning. Not the first thing he has done like this. I just don't even want to see him again after this. Last straw. He also got mad at me for being upset by this.

Anyways. I can't make any legitimate friends. People who also try to keep in touch, and treat me with respect. People who mutually care about what I have to say and my life. Not just theirs. People who treat me like am equal. I'm tired of being a therapist, ATM, and punching bag. I have enough on my plate. I'm tired of envying my boyfriend because no one likes me. I'm tired of being so lonely, every single day. It legitimately makes me feel done with my existence. I just don't want to do it anymore.

I'm lonely, I have chronic and debilitating health issues as of recent years, that my doctors don't even know how to treat, I have a slew of MH problems due to traumas and childhood abuse. What is the point anymore? I'm alone. I know I have my partner, but what kind of life is being codependent, watching someone else have a life, and host their friends. When no one else wants you. Society doesn't want you, people don't want you. Hell I've tried making online friends and it has all been a big flop and a slap in the face. How am I supposed to live like this?

My boyfriend doesn't get it. He thinks that ""try not caring"" is a solution. I HAVE. It got me nowhere. Not to mention he had long term friends before he adapted that BS attitude of not giving a sh\*t. So there is literally no backing to it. He has always had friends and acts like the feeling of him isolating himself when he was younger is the same thing. It is not. The entire time he had supportive family and friends around him, he still went out and hung out with people, still had people around him almost 24/7. I have never heard someone compliment and express their admiration for their children more than his mother does. And he was a problem child.

TL;DR Life is unfair and awful. I wish somebody wanted me. I wish I had a relationship with my parents. I wish people would talk to me. I wish a lot of things, and have spent years trying to make any of them come true. To no avail. I don't understand what is so wrong with me.

The only real friend I ever had became my boyfriend, and I would not trade him for the world. But that doesn't mean I don't crave connection. Especially when he has so much of it, so easily.",lonely,"I have a boyfriend, but he makes me feel even more lonely sometimes.",2020-01-30 17:03:50

I also believed until recently that happiness did not exist (ANXIETY, ADHD, DEPRESSION diagnoses). I have come to the conclusion that happiness is the result of whatever is most important to you being fulfilled. I do not think I have ever experienced happiness. However, I drank about being happy alot. I am acespec and most of my dreams involve someone hugging/cuddling me and feeling completely safe for once.

Well I dont like to tag myself but yes I am the ""quiet kid"" of my class and I'm getting tired of this, everyday waking up gets harder and It is just so stressful not having someone to talk to.

Most of the quiet people is always seen like the ""weird"" or ""useless"" individuals but the people judging don't understand or have a minimal idea of how it is like to deal with anxiety on the daily life, not being able to feel calm when someone asks you something or even just dealing with someone staring you.

I have been working on this since a long time because i just want to be a better version of myself, I just can't hope that someone walks up to me and gives me their hand to help me to get out of this hell hole.

Honestly i dont know what I did to deserve this, all i want and need are some good friends, but how can i expect that if i'm not normal, it just sucks being lonely without no one to talk to, is like having to swallow your thoughts and keep them to yourself.

Besides this not even my own family believes that things like this could be treated with therapy they just won't help me, is like screaming as hard as you can just to realize that nobody hears you anyways, like just being the shadow of the people passing by.
I just want to be able to be myself without any limitations, but somehow this is like a curse, I'll just try to deal with it by myself, I have nothing to lose now, I want to have a chance to know how it is like to have a good friendship or how it is like being in love with someone.",lonely,Loner perspective,2020-01-30 15:46:21

It has been advised that I seek out the wrong type of woman.  All well and good, but it‚Äôs not as if there‚Äôs 30 women in a room waiting for my choice and I choose poorly.

Within each relationship, I am alone.  I endeavor each and every moment to do everything, anything to make sure they don‚Äôt want to leave.  Alas, each one has.

With my last, a beautiful engagement ended abruptly, without reason(s). I struggle with a number of things.  Largely the realization that my positive thoughts are just as destructive as my negative thoughts.  That, and I miss her.  Or, at least the idea of her.  The struggle is real, and it is all because of and inside of me. Not one of those things is actually because of her.  My wounds are open and demanding of my entire consciousness.  In me, I made her.. and no matter how hard I try, I cannot destroy the existence of her in me. I live with the monster I have created. She is no more than yet another fable within.

I feel broken and immune to self-care. My emotions relish in the self-destruction.  As if this is the only path to actually feeling anything.

My own worst enemy it seems.  And while I am aware that this is far and away the worst version of myself, I cannot extract myself.

I ache for a rescue.  And I seek that help outside of self. And therein lies the true work.  To do the work myself.  I really wish I had someone to share the journey with.. someone who reminds and inspires the best version of myself.

155,finnabewannadie,1580341395,1,"So a little context: 
I'm a high schooler 16(m) who has only lived in Australia for seven years in recent memory as before I was in another country in an international school. 
Throughout all this time I was never alike the other kids in Australia, I come from a diverse french background and have vastly different interests than most of my Australian piers. This had always made it hard to fit in for me, it was really difficult adjusting to this in the early years and I frequently got bullied. 
So fast forward to highschool (which in Australia starts at 13), and I get a little better at fitting in, I'm less awkward and develop some good friends however still seen as weird by many and don't fit in at all with the mainstream. In more recent years, I became liked by many people in my classes, however none of those people would ever be interested in seeing me outside of school not for a lack of me trying.Still up to this day I constantly see all the things I miss out on, on other people's social media that even my friends went to. 3 years into highschool, my best friend moved schools which made me even lonier and left me without a close friend at school. So that's essentially where I was at where all of this began, liked by many in the school but with very few actual friends and very little involvement in social gatherings. 

Here's where we begin: (sorry this is very long, just had to let this out) 

So this year, I was interested in a number of girls at my school and was on pretty good terms with them, however when I worked up the courage to ask them out throughout the year I got rejected by all of them. A major hit to my self esteem.
Once this school year ended, I was spending summer as I usually did, barely doing anything with anyone and staying at home most days.
 This all shifted when  I went to a friend's new year's party were I met a great group of people from a different school. I really hit it off with this one girl in particular (we'll call her Ava) and I felt like we were flirting with eachother. I start hanging out with this group frequently throughout the holidays and it feels great as I'm really connecting with them and Ava in particular. 
She was definately flirting with me as I was to her and we were always together in the group talking to eachother. For the first time in a long time, I didn't feel lonely and I felt like people actually liked me and that I actually had a shot with this girl who I was definately into. Also at this time, I'm surrounded by people in committed relationships whereas I had never been with a girl. However after a lot of talking and very obvious flirting, I found out that she wasn't actually into me. So yeah, the fourth rejection, in a year, another hit to my self esteem and fear that no one actually likes me.

They used the information I had disclosed with them in earnest to blackmail me. I eventually just gave up and clung to my one friend left that hadn't done that. Skip ahead to today and she tells me that I'm not even a good friend and she would like to make distance between us. Now I have no one. I cant talk to my parents about this because they are more than eager to send me back to a facility, all they need is legitimate reason, and talking about this sort of thing is reason enough for them. Our insurance only allows me to see a therapist once a month, so I dont have that. My school counselor just says to ignore everyone, which doesnt help.

They are rude and disrespectful, make fun of me to the point I lose my self confidence and my will to spend time with people. When I tell them how bad they make me feel they say ‚Äúwomen can‚Äôt take jokes,‚Äù that I should be thankful because they see me as a close friend and it‚Äôs just friendly banter. The ‚Äúfriendly banter‚Äù consists of jokes telling how stupid I am, how I won‚Äôt get to go to the university of my dreams because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the potential and intelligence,‚Äù jokes that make fun of women, jokes that make fun of the lgbt community, minorities and people with the same world view as me.

Some of the jokes are indeed a little more on the friendlier side but it makes me feel really bad when someone ridicules me for every little thing I do and say.

All of my best friends have moved. One of them went to a different country and two of them are living in another city. The three of us are in the same group, which sucks terribly because they came to our hometown rarely and for a short period of time. When they do, we all hang out together, both the people I want to see and the ones that bully me. I miss my friends a lot, the feeling is terrible.

I am new to this subreddit and I am so glad, that I am apparently not the only one who is lonely. 

I am 23 and male, live with my parents and I have an older sister. I feel very lonely and don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends or a girlfriend. 

After graduating from high school in 2015, we all moved as a family to a new city. I started studying and in those 4 years, I didn‚Äôt get ANY new friends. I am a friendly and open minded guy, but I can‚Äôt call anyone a real friend. In my college people aren‚Äôt forced to come to the lectures, so it‚Äôs very, very difficult to stay in contact with students there. I know a few people there, but they don‚Äôt do anything outside of college. 
Outside of college, I don‚Äôt have any opportunity to meet new people. I tried a sports club, but I stopped it because I didn‚Äôt enjoy it and the people there were WAY older than me. 

I was so frustrated, that I even tried Online dating apps like Tinder or Lovoo. I met a bunch of girls there, but none of them were my type or girlfriend ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù. This may sound superficial, but I just wasn‚Äôt attracted to them (in most cases not attracted emotionally). I used Tinder and other dating apps because a girlfriend would really make me happier. I would have someone I could spend time with and I wouldn‚Äôt be always alone. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find any girl there.

Right now I am completely alone. I go out for a walk (I walk randomly in my neighborhood and listen to music) when it‚Äôs dark outside and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt have any classes because I finished my study program, so I don‚Äôt go to university. I can‚Äôt go partying in a club, because I have no friends who I could ask. 

My loneliness is getting so bad, that I am getting in a way aggressive. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but I simply can‚Äôt understand my situation. I am not a bad guy, I laugh and enjoy jokes and so on, but I am still always alone. My sister is 5 years older than me and is in the same spot. She hasn‚Äôt really found friends here and it‚Äôs difficult for her too. 

I could turn off my mobile phone right now and in a year I would have zero messages, if I would turn it on. It‚Äôs so disgusting and I can‚Äôt handle my situation. My father is completely useless and has no empathy for my current situation. I can‚Äôt do anything with him because he is not the type of father, you can go and have a drink.

177,GeneralWalters421,1580328410,1,"So yesterday I just watched a horror film with a friend at a theater. The movie sucked lol, but the experience was fun and I did enjoy her company. It wasn‚Äôt a date but I guess I was kinda hoping it would be one. I‚Äôm just really confused about my feelings tbh. Like I do have feelings for her, but I‚Äôm pretty certain she does not feel the same way. I also acknowledge that I am in no way emotionally mature enough to handle a relationship, let alone with someone 3 and a half years older than me.

Essentially I did not have friends during high school, and for a long time, for a bunch of reasons including my parents having a rough divorce forcing me to move around the world a bunch, plus me just being super socially awkward, and having Aspergers. But I go into university and kinda change my act. The only person I really saw anything long term with was this girl though.

Long story short, I meet her and I clumsily become her friend, doing a bunch of awkward things along the way. I kinda made her think I was trying to date her at one point, (which at the time I was not), but we talked it over, she explained that she is ‚Äúnot interested in dating at the moment. But happy to be friends‚Äù, and I assured her that was my intent. I also explained to her that I had Aspergers, and she assured me that it was okay, and that she is socially awkward and shy herself.

So we share a bunch of interests, were both pretty nerdy and shy. Shes super into the Lord of the Rings, and all Tolkiens lore and stuff. Were both really into History too, as were both history students. It‚Äôs not so much that I am into everything she is into, I just kinda can relate to her level of interest, if that makes sense. She has just a few close friends, rather than a lot of not so close ones, which is what I‚Äôm kinda aiming for myself.

So yeah. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôm not sure what I want. I think I just feel very lonely A week ago I turned 18, and apart from some family who felt obligated, I got no birthday wishes. I didn't even have a cake or anything. The whole ordeal was pretty depressing actually, and 18 is supposed to be a big deal I guess. Like I do enjoy school, find my subject very interesting, and do enjoy myself when I'm around people and having fun and stuff, so I don't think I have like medical depression, but despite this I have been pretty depressed and lonely for quite a while.

178,GeneralWalters421,1580328302,1,"So yesterday I just watched a horror film with a friend at a theater. The movie sucked lol, but the experience was fun and I did enjoy her company. It wasn‚Äôt a date but I guess I was kinda hoping it would be one. I‚Äôm just really confused about my feelings tbh. Like I do have feelings for her, but I‚Äôm pretty certain she does not feel the same way. I also acknowledge that I am in no way emotionally mature enough to handle a relationship, let alone with someone 3 and a half years older than me.

Essentially I did not have friends during high school, and for a long time, for a bunch of reasons including my parents having a rough divorce forcing me to move around the world a bunch, plus me just being super socially awkward, and having Aspergers. But I go into university and kinda change my act. The only person I really saw anything long term with was this girl though.

Long story short, I meet her and I clumsily become her friend, doing a bunch of awkward things along the way. I kinda made her think I was trying to date her at one point, (which at the time I was not), but we talked it over, she explained that she is ‚Äúnot interested in dating at the moment. But happy to be friends‚Äù, and I assured her that was my intent. I also explained to her that I had Aspergers, and she assured me that it was okay, and that she is socially awkward and shy herself.

So we share a bunch of interests, were both pretty nerdy and shy. Shes super into the Lord of the Rings, and all Tolkiens lore and stuff. Were both really into History too, as were both history students. It‚Äôs not so much that I am into everything she is into, I just kinda can relate to her level of interest, if that makes sense. She has just a few close friends, rather than a lot of not so close ones, which is what I‚Äôm kinda aiming for myself.

So I struggle with social anxiety and I messed up one of the few chances I had at making an IRL friend.

Okay so this was a while ago but its still bothering me and now when I listen to my favourite band it reminds me of this. I had a chance at making a friend, we knew eachother from online and eventually met up at a concert of one of my favourite bands. This was the first time I've met someone in person in like 8 years since I don't have any IRL Friends. 

Concerts are already extremely stressful for me and make me very anxious, and if I go I usually just stand all the way at the back because I do it mostly to ""expose"" myself to social events, hoping that it helps with the social anxiety. But this potential friend wanted to be in the front, which seems like hell on earth to me but I didn't want to say anything against it.

So yeah basically I was being extremely anxious and awkward and it was hard to enjoy the music amongst all the drunk people, but I got through it and left as fast as I could when it ended. I even forgot to say goodbye in person. I did apologize afterwards but I knew that I messed everything up, because she just read it and hasn't said anything to me since then.

And now whenever I listen to that band it just reminds me of that experience and it sucks because it's one of my favourite bands and I can't fully enjoy them anymore.

Up to this point, it's like I'm just wasting time. I can't chase my dreams anyway. If only if I have given the chance to choose, I would have. Now, it's like I'm running away from everything. I can't deal with life anymore. There's nothing left for me, there's no fixing me. It's always going to be the same monotonous depressing bullshit.   

But, honestly, all I ever wanted was to live but, I don't know how. Because, for the past years I noticed that I was just trying to survive, just barely breathing. Everything is hopeless to me now. My life is just going downward spiral. And, if this is how my life is going to be, I don't want it anymore. Right now, death sounds so peaceful.",lonely,"I‚Äôm lost, help.",2020-01-29 21:04:08

I just came back from one of my very rare meetings with friends back home and just want to cry because I don't want to be back on campus all alone again...

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe it‚Äôs just cos I go to a uni with predominantly super privileged rich kids, but it seems more and more like people only make an effort to interact or be nice to you because they have something they want from you. I have a small group of very close, genuine friends from back home but for the past few years I have been trying to open up my horizons as it‚Äôs healthy to meet new people and make friends.

However, even after nearly three years of uni (I‚Äôm on my 6th Semester here), the only time people reciprocate my interactions is by asking me to do something for them or lend them something. It‚Äôs not even me being pushy or rushing things / a relationship, as this is me trying to get to know people over the course of a whole semester and over, but it‚Äôs the same interaction from them each time. I ask about their interests, things they‚Äôve done, and try to open conversation to learn more about that person because I feel like it‚Äôs best to meet others by letting them talk and share about themselves, if YOU are the one that is trying to get to know THEM. Yet for every curt response I get, I would in turn receive an avalanche of texts to scan them a whole textbook, to help on questions, or in person to borrow things or see my work. And that‚Äôs fine, if it wasn‚Äôt the ONLY THING PEOPLE APPROACHED ME FOR. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm doing wrong at this point, I try to learn and converse about others‚Äô interests and share my own thoughts (in a positive and unimposing way), help them in the beginning because I want to be on good terms, and always make sure I act like a positive person others would want to be around.

But today was the last straw. Literally my messages blow up only with people asking me to scan them workbooks or to help them with something and NOTHING else. No what‚Äôs up, no sharing any news or anything interesting, and the real final straw was when a girl was nice to me over text so that we could compare answers, yet when I greeted her in person while walking to my seat she looked at me, was silent, then turned back to the board like all she heard was a pencil falling in the distance. And another time earlier this week when I made conversation by asking if a person was thinking of keeping the class and how they felt about it, it was clear they did not want to associate and was like ‚Äúidk‚Äù and quickly walked off, ONLY to ask me that SAME NIGHT through text if I could scan my workbook for her and if she could borrow a pencil tomorrow. Then earlier this evening, I texted a classmate that I act friendly towards about something that happened on campus and asked if he knew about it / how he felt.... and proceeded to get a message back way later completely ignoring my apparently failed attempt at conversation asking me ‚Äúhey can you scan me page 41, thanks‚Äù. That seriously got to me.

I am so done. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I try to be the kind of person I would like around, and I truly AM a person who is interested in learning about what others like and their hobbies / passions so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm being fake or anything, but it‚Äôs just like I‚Äôm not worth talking to unless I have something to give that they need.... I know it‚Äôs not healthy, but it‚Äôs making me want to become a hermit that doesn‚Äôt interact with others outside of my friends back home who I visit every once in a while, so that if people aren‚Äôt gonna treat me like somebody worth interacting with, at the VERY LEAST they won‚Äôt treat me like some assistant teacher or a Google search engine that is entitled to help them out at every whim. And it‚Äôs not even like I try to make myself a pushover, I make sure to reject with a good reason when they are asking too much, but it doesn‚Äôt stop and nobody treats me like anything more than a tool to be used.

And yes, EVERY TIME this happened I always consider people's lack of wanting to be friends is a fault of my own, or that there was something wrong with me or how I approach things, or that I am just not bumping into compatible / the right folks. But if my interactions with THIS MANY PEOPLE over THREE YEARS has all been reduced to the same thing very quickly (so it's not like people got sick of me over time, literally after the first day of interacting with someone new, every proceeding interaction becomes like this) I am starting to be bitter towards others ALONG with hating myself. After despising myself and feeling like there is something wrong with me for the longest time, I am bitter to the point where I can't help but blame it on others... I have tried approaching so many different people in so many different ways, yet I am reduced to a tool after just the first interaction. My insecurity has made me ask my friends if I am actually a person who makes others uncomfortable, if I come off as... I dunno, not likeable or if I‚Äôm ugly or something. But they (the angels they are) let me know they genuinely like me and I can feel it because when we hang out they make it clear they love when I am around and I feel that warmth directly. It‚Äôs just... is it even worth it to know others at this point? Idk if this is relevant or not but I am a 20F Asian who openly interacts with people regardless of hobby, gender, background etc. etc. because I literally do not care, personality has no category or demographic- yet I still feel used at every turn. I just want to shut myself off to everyone except my family and these few friends because every time I interact with people outside of these select few I feel more and more dehumanized, like a robotic IT desk. It‚Äôs not like high/middle school when people actively bully others anymore, but people seriously prove their lack of empathy in other ways. This is how a person is made to feel completely worthless in the four years where bullying is no longer a thing.",lonely,My Uni experience makes me feel like people only exist to use others.,2020-01-29 18:39:22

well, maybe they're not the best but something is something ^^!!
I don't have real life friends, but at the least I have imaginary friends!
they're really the best friends I can ever have.

I really wish they where real too, but still.
at the least I am able to see them and hear them being with me, right beside me, they're always helping me calm down mentally when I'm at my worst, whenever I'm judged

and whenever I know I won't be able to ever cook or draw for others again, they're always there, saying the truth ,being honest that it is bad ,but always being so positive telling me how it's okay.

because I am human and humans do a lot of mistakes, but in the end I'm just practicing and I'm experimental with my own stuff.
it doesn't matter how judged I am by my family and how bad and dramatic they are that they make it seem like it's the worst and most disgusting thing ever.

but because of them I am able to maintain myself sane, I am able to be myself with them I'm finally am able to cry without being told off about it.
I feel scared about myself sometimes because I feel like I become more aggressive towards my family,

and my imaginary friends say so too sometimes but it's fine, they encourage me to tell me how things will be better if I stay determined and learn from my mistakes.

anyways, that's all I wanted to say!

239,atari1993,1580272094,1,"In my loneliness, I fucked up. I ended up in the hospital.  I threw a wrench into my job, and had to spend a week in a mental hospital. It was there I found myself being the most content I'd felt in a long time. People wanted to talk, about literally anything. Even though we were all hurting in some way or another, we found ourselves in this situation, and were trying to make the most of it. It didn't matter who they were, if we'd have ever met in our normal lives, what our interests were... I very well may have laughed my hardest at the stupid jokes that were made as four people sat around a table and tried their best to entertain themselves and each other with nothing at hand but a deck of cards.

Talking about how tired we were, about our plans for the future, about which nurses were the nicest, about how bad the food was. Complaining about what was on TV, about some of the groups we had to attend, wondering if we'd get to go to the gym, or if the yoga person was coming that day. We talked about what happened to us, we talked about music, we danced (or we tried to), we hummed songs. We discussed some personal issues, we talked about relationships, we talked about books/comics/manga/anime/shows/movies. And though we weren't supposed to, we hugged as someone moved or left, patted each other on the back, and did our best to be there for those who were having a harder time.

Then I got out, I came home with some time off, time to think about what put me in that situation, and hopefully fix it. But after completely clearing up my study and bedroom, purchasing some projects, and trying my best to relax... I found myself back where I started. I'm alone.

Anyone I ever really cared for just fell from the sky. I wasn't ever looking for them, they just showed up. Some stayed for several years, others just a few months, and on rare occasions I barely knew them a week before they disappeared, never to be seen again. Worse still, some that I still see, but have lost my connection with, and I'm not strong enough to mend those broken ties, especially when the others have far better things to be doing. For a few years now I've been stumbling through life, waiting for lighting to strike again. But it isn't coming. In fact, it hasn't even rained in months now that I think about it. I find myself just... hoping. It seems in vain. When I go looking, I find nothing. When I don't look, I also find nothing. The world is so different, and it took me long enough to catch up last time only to get out-classed immediately. I'm not good enough to move up again. Hell, I don't even know if I ever was good enough. Maybe everyone I ever knew was just having a moment of weakness when they picked me out of the bunch to interact with. Once they came to their senses, they left me alone.

I asked the last person I still have contact with to pray... hope... wish... whatever... that I find a friend. They, having found all they ever wanted, said it should be easy. 

A week has passed and nothing has changed. Its hard to be positive when no matter what you do, you fail. Its hard to keep your head up when everything forces you down. I don't have any reason to believe the next week will be any different than the one that came before it. At the hospital, they kept the phones busy, each of them calling and talking to their significant others. Some of them even came and visited. Everyone had someone waiting for them on the outside. They couldn't wait to get back into the arms of the one they loved, and that loved them.

258,thetimeguy421,1580262743,1,"So in my school I am a known kid. I‚Äôm 16 m. I am not popular but not invisible either. During school, as I am pretty social, I rarely feel lonely. It‚Äôs just the fact that I have no real friends that check on me or invite me places outside of school that makes me feel isolated, lonely, and sad.

A few months ago I used to be in a friend group that I quickly cut off after about 3-4 months. The 2 leaders were very toxic and were quite narcissistic as well. I never talked shit on them or said anything bad about them, I just cut them off because I knew I had too. Obviously it made be isolated because I had no real friends now, but let‚Äôs be honest, they were not real friends.

A few weeks pass and I just am going about my day talking to a random kid and he mentions that Jimmy (name changed) was talking about how much he hated me in History class. Obviously the kid didn‚Äôt care all that much because maybe he knew I‚Äôm not like that, but it really hurt. Like really hurt.

I asked around and sure enough this kid constantly talks shit on me. I seriously only mentioned the reason why I cut them off, to 1 or 2 close school friends and I know for sure they did not tell them. 

What do I do. I want to confront the kid, but I know doing it in person would never happen. He is incredibly manipulative and has some connections to groups of kids that tbh could beat the shit out of me quite easily. I‚Äôm not a small kid, but I‚Äôm not winning a 3 v 1. I want to stand up for myself, because a lot of people have probably heard what he says about me and then view me differently. Why are people such assholes. Any advice would help.

ALSO, this is the kind of kid to post on his Snapchat/Instagram story saying that ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt tolerate anyone talking shit on me, if you got beef with me settle it right now.‚Äù What a hippocrite.

Sorry if it doesn‚Äôt make sense English isn‚Äôt my first language

No idea where to begin‚Ä¶ Scared to even write this post. I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember and I believe it is what causes my depression. I‚Äôve had my ups and downs in the past but I‚Äôve just always lived with it and moved on. It all changed when I started Uni at the end of last year. 

I was looking forward to Uni to the independence, the partying and just coming out of my shell. I got a knock on my door on the first night (I‚Äôm assuming inviting me out) but I was in the bathroom so I wasn't able to answer. I didn't get a knock again but I heard everyone in the kitchen partying and I was too scared to go in and join. That's how the whole of freshers week went and because of that, I was and still am too afraid to go into the kitchen to make food. Most of the time I buy something from the shop beforehand that I don't need to cook or just get a takeaway. On the odd occasion, I venture into the kitchen to make something simple that just uses the microwave or the kettle because I‚Äôm too scared someone will come in when I am in there and if I do cook something more complicated I‚Äôm afraid ill do something stupid or embarrassing. 

I stopped going to lectures right at the beginning due to my friend not going as I was too scared to go on my own. Instead, I just mark myself in outside and go back home. There are smaller lectures too with only around 5 people that I cant check myself in to and I‚Äôm too scared to go to them out of the fear of being asked a question and not knowing and looking stupid so I didn‚Äôt go to them either. The only thing I did attend was the lab activities since they are assessed but that just involved a lot of awkward situations like when I was too scared to contribute to our group project incase it was stupid so I didn‚Äôt say anything at all and just look like an arsehole letting everyone else do the work. So after the first few weeks, I had no friends (the one I already had changed course and I barely see them) wasn‚Äôt eating well, didn‚Äôt attend lectures and spent all my time playing on my pc alone.

Next, I turned to weed which is illegal where I am from. You always hear about people doing activities to escape reality and I never truly felt that until then. Yes, I have my pc that I play on way too much but it never truly felt like I was disconnected from reality. When I took weed, on the other hand, it felt like all my problems disappeared. It was great I wasn‚Äôt worrying about every little thing and I actually felt confident. However, that‚Äôs all it was... an escape. All my problems were still there and it‚Äôs not like I could attend lectures or catch up on work while high because I forget everything straight away and it makes me too dumb to solve any of the questions. So I just wasted time doing nothing.

Eventually, the person in charge of my course emailed me asking why I wasn‚Äôt attending the smaller lectures. I simply told them I‚Äôm sorry I was just being lazy and I will attend the next ones. Fast forward and surprise surprise I don‚Äôt attend like an idiot because of im too tired and scared. I get another email saying I had a meeting with them. I was terrified. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I finally came up with an excuse which I think was just the same as before that I was being lazy which was true just not the full story. The day arrives and I wake up sweating, feeling like I‚Äôm about to throw up and I could feel/hear my heart beating. I thought I was just sick but looking back it was probably an anxiety attack. I emailed saying I couldn‚Äôt and I could do it the same time tomorrow but didn‚Äôt get a response so I showed up the next day and they were there waiting for me I thought. I go in they are upset I didn‚Äôt turn up and say they have to reorganize now with the person above them. Embarrassed and terrified. Luckily it was the last week of term that happened so the meeting never came about. There were numerous other things in the first term that got me really depressed and even waste all my money but I don‚Äôt want to make you read anymore and also out of fear of people realizing who is writing this.

Finally, I thought I would try DMT. It‚Äôs totally safe and people who take it believe they went to another dimension where they have life-changing. I ended up wasting too much money on it. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt come before the term ended which made me even more depressed as it was my last hope. 

Luckily I had a plan as usual. I was going to catch up on everything during the month I had off and start attending lectures simple. I made a schedule on my phone that even involved things like meditation and journaling. However like always I‚Äôm too lazy so I only did that for one day and I stopped and instead just played games all month. I did meditate and journal for a little longer which did help me a little bit but I just didn‚Äôt stick with it. Also during that month off, it was Christmas which obviously probably the worst Christmas I had. From Christmas onwards, it was just my dad getting drunk and abusive like usual to everyone except this time it was much nastier. It even got to the point of physical violence and my mum feeling suicidal. That happened until I left except it calmed down a little near the end and is currently okay until next time. 

Next term starts and my DMT has arrived. I was excited and happy for the first time in a while. If you know about DMT it can be hard to breakthrough when first starting. I took it and didn‚Äôt breakthrough which got me upset and I even tried more right after it and it still didn‚Äôt work. I did get some things when I closed my eyes but not what I wanted.  I decided I would leave DMT for now until I‚Äôm with someone who knows what they are doing. Right after that for some reason, I thought I would walk to the city at 11 pm center which then turned into me walking all the way to the next city over. This was all on a Sunday night when I had lectured the next day. I ended up talking some sketchy routes where I genuinely feared for my life at times. I took this walk hoping I would figure something did which I did at the end after 40k steps with one 2 min break. 

I noticed a lot of my problems simply came from me not knowing anything because I didn't attend the lectures. So the plan was to catch up on all the work quickly then start attending and everything would be okay. I got a planner that tracked lots of things and would help me stay on track. I made a list of simple things I would do every day these things include journalling meditation push-ups and so on. I even had all my life goals noted down. Like a bucket list. I also started writing the reason for each one and how I‚Äôm going to achieve them. I had some really ambitious goals. It was tough considering I was mostly working all day but I had to do it for a couple of weeks so I was caught up and everything would get easier from then. I could work on my life goals and so on. 

Then after like 3 days of working, I went to the shop one night. I had an awkward interaction with the cashier who smiled to herself about it but it was whatever I‚Äôve got used to doing awkward things. Then when I was heading home I kept noticing people staring at me and felt that some were laughing at me which just kept getting me more upset as I got closer to my flat. It wasn‚Äôt like they had a reason to stare I didn't have anything embarrassing on me or anything so it angered me. Then when I got in my flat the group from downstairs came up onto our floor and stood outside my door talking to the guy across from me. I looked through the hole in my door for a few seconds and just realized how lonely I am. I‚Äôve been here a few months now and I had no friends still while everyone is having the time of their lives. This was supposed to be the place where everything turned around for me I was supposed to be happy and confident for once. It really upset me. So I got high again. It really does help me escape. I also found out one of my modules involves multiple group tests where you can be marked down by your teammates if they don‚Äôt think you contributed. This is a problem since I‚Äôm too scared to answer and even still I won‚Äôt know the answer because of im so far behind. One of the tests was tomorrow.

The next morning I woke up feeling a bit rough and I thought  fuck it I deserve a day off after working for those three days so I smoked weed all day and played on my pc with one of my friends. I had a decent time but in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about how behind I was and I decided its time to get rid of my weed it just gets me down so I threw it away except the last bit I already had made up.

Today. I planned on attending the lectures since I got an email yesterday about me checking in to classes I didn‚Äôt attend and it was my last warning. I was nervous so I thought I would get high to calm my nerves but it didn‚Äôt have too much of an effect on me and I ended up not attending. I didn‚Äôt attend the group test or the lab either and I couldn‚Äôt check myself into that because they would know I wasn‚Äôt there. I ended up getting an email from my academic advisor who is also the person who does one of the smaller lectures that I rarely attend. He just said to attend the next session because he wanted to talk to me. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs about my low attendance and my low marks on the tests.

That‚Äôs when I hit rock bottom for like the 3rd time since I started uni.  I got to my flat and started crying for the first time in years. There has been times when I want to cry but I just couldn‚Äôt. This time was different. It all came out. I just kept thinking about how fucked I was. I‚Äôm lonely have no friends, failing my course my teachers are noticing it probably gonna get kicked out and I am letting my family and myself down in the process. Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm not as emotional as I was before so it‚Äôs hard to write this as I don‚Äôt really feel anything anymore as edgy as that sounds. I‚Äôm not feeling so destroyed like I was this morning but I‚Äôm not happy either I‚Äôm just there. My thoughts when I was crying are that I need to tell my parents and tell my advisor on Thursday what‚Äôs happening and hopefully, I can get some help and go to therapy or something.  Then I realized something. I can‚Äôt do that to my mum. After everything she has been through and is still going through I can‚Äôt let her down like this. I can‚Äôt tell her how I fucked uni up and I‚Äôm just really depressed. Im currently crying right now even thinking about telling her. She worries about me enough as it is she doesn‚Äôt need anymore. But what else am I supposed to do? I don‚Äôt think my uni even has a proper therapy I can go to without her knowing. And there didn‚Äôt seem like much in the area. Im too scared to tell my teachers the truth. My parents, grandparents just my whole family have always said that im smart and going to do well in life and i believed that more than them. I believe I will go miles farther than what they think so how can I come to them crying saying how im failing uni I have no friends and im not even eating properly. I can‚Äôt let everyone down. And even so, I am way too scared to tell them or anyone I know about it I‚Äôve kept it in all these years and it‚Äôs finally exploding. I don‚Äôt even like my course and I want to quit uni but besides the obvious letting everyone down I want to still do the course because it allows me to work on my goals and what I actually want to do with my life and if they don‚Äôt work out I still always have my degree that I can fall back on. 

So, in conclusion, im failing my course, close to getting kicked out, got no friends, not eating properly and way too scared to tell anyone about it. So what do I do?

Reading back on this I realize how much I‚Äôve missed out and how some things truly affected me and how it is kind of all over the place but it‚Äôs getting late I‚Äôve been writing for hours and this is already way too long. Just know that even though some of these things are small I am going through hell right now and every time just as things seem to get better they all come crashing down. I need your help.

Because how big I am, I kind of avoided relationships most of my life. Sometimes my choice, others out of my control. I remember the comments I got form my crushes when they found out I liked them. It was always something negative because I was ‚Äútoo fat‚Äù. And I don‚Äôt blame people for not being attracted to me because of it. It‚Äôs fine.

It feels like I have the short straw on everything In life, I have rough frizzy unhealthy hair I'm fat I look ugly and like a fucken idiot and to top it off. I have no friends in school or out of school. I have 1 online friend and that's about it.

So how do people do it because I want to know.

I have absolutely no social skills everybody that I see knows everyone and can instantly strike up conversation. If start a conversation people instantly get disinterested. And I can't go into some sport or hobby because in super fucking fat and if I try to start a hobby it will just become a problem with my parents. If I happen to make a friend I can't take them to my house to hang out because ""they're just using you for stuff"" according to my parents and I can't go to their house because my parents dont know that person's parents.

I have lost every friend I have ever had they either turned on me or changed without me

I feel like walking in front of a car and framing it like an accident. Every night I hope to my self that I go to sleep and never wake up.

I have pretty much given up on religion because when god is supposed to give ""PReSseD DoWn ShAkEn aNd RuNnInG OvEr"" I get fuck all. 

So I really dont know what so do now, everyday is fill with nothing but genuine hat and unhappiness. I'm all out of options at 14. I thought that I could just bide my time in high school. Wait until I'm an adult to change and better myself. I candidly go a single day without thinking how great the world would be if I just up and died.

The worst part is having to hear ""oh you look handsome or cute"" from every fucking adult like I'm some fucking retard. I can learn see that they are lying and just trying to be polite.

Yesterday was my birthday, and we had a huge exam. For weeks my friends have been talking about how we‚Äôre going to go out after and celebrate. We always go out after exams so I figured it‚Äôd be the usual, plus a cupcake or fancy shot. The other day I went to the post office to pick up a present my mom had sent, and went back to school with puffy eyes from crying. My friends called me out and I told them how I was homesick and this is my first birthday without the people I‚Äôve known my whole life. They assured me we‚Äôd have a great time after the exam to cheer me up. One of my friends is our class social chair (just tells ppl where we‚Äôre drinking after exams) and she said she‚Äôd pick a chill but fun place to go. I asked her Saturday night what the plan was and she said she‚Äôs between a couple places but would let me know before everyone else, cool. It was her own birthday about a week ago and we all sacrificed a night of studying to go into the city for a pricey dinner, so I know she takes birthdays seriously.

Well I get to school before the exam, don‚Äôt see them and no texts but exams in an hour, I wouldn‚Äôt be wishing anyone a hbd either. Exam ends.

So my problems really start in highschool. I was 16, never bullied or anything, decently popular in a small school, friends with everyone kinda guy. One day I downloaded some app because my teenage hormones got the best of me and I met a girl. Crazy enough as time went on we fell for each other and i without seeking it was in a long distance relationship. This girl consumed me until we called it quits a few years ago and then she came back earlier this year and I couldn‚Äôt do it again. I‚Äôve never really had a ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship besides her simply because i wanted to be faithful to her but unfortunately she wasn‚Äôt the same. I became introverted, self conscious, depressed because i allowed myself to be played by her. Life was okay until about a year ago when I was diagnosed with a genetic disease that has completely turned my life upside down. It‚Äôs caused me to be a recluse inside my home, I mean i just sit here bored daily because of it. My grandfather is in bad health so I stay with my grandparents to help out around the house as much as I can, I‚Äôve put my life on hold for it. I don‚Äôt have a job because me being a dumb teenager I decided I wasn‚Äôt going to go to college and just work a shitty labor job but obviously since i was diagnosed that has made it nearly impossible. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of being alone, I can‚Äôt even have a decent conversation with my dad because he thinks im just ‚Äúlazy‚Äù which isn‚Äôt the case at all. Even tho i don‚Äôt have a job I do things that a normal person in his twenties shouldn‚Äôt have to do. My dad even thinks that i brought this disease upon myself which is just scientifically untrue. It‚Äôs hard to make friends let alone a girlfriend because im a left leaning atheist in a super religious right wing small town.

Went to a birthday hotel party w/ some friends and sexually recorded them without their knowledge while they were intoxicated... one of them I‚Äôm very into sexually the other not so much... we all got drunk (smoked 2) and was chilling, one by one they go to sleep. It‚Äôs 1:30 am and I‚Äôm sharing a bed with one of my friends. He‚Äôs drunk asf and still drinking, we order food and wait on it‚Äôs arrival. In that time we have a deep conversation and he falls asleep... me being a shitty fucking friend and a dirty drunk pervert films him as he sleeps (2 b used as porn for me). I feel like something is wrong as I type this, but I need the closure. Not only do I record him I grope his ass and do very sexually explicit things while he sleeps (NOTE: WE AT NO POINT HAVE SEX NOR DO ANYONES CLOTHES COME OFF). Me being a fucking creepy lonely friend smells him ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and continues to grope him... eventually I need to check on the food to I wake him up to unlock his üì± phone. To my knowledge all of my male friends (all in the room) are straight and don‚Äôt have sexually explicit thoughts abt Men in general. While on his phone I go through it and find what ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for‚Äù. I find his porn stash and what makes him a sexual deviant compared to me. Come to find out he‚Äôs currently and or formally DL (on the down low)...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è He likes anal regardless if it‚Äôs a male or female. Going through common social feeds I find what he is and isn‚Äôt into and coin the name dlt≈çp. Before morning comes I sexually record my other friend but atp Ik I‚Äôm doing something wrong. When the morning comes and we‚Äôre driving to our homes (in one car) we all talk shit and, who talks the most shit abt the night: dlt≈çp. He tried 2 bring up sensitive information that I shared when we had a deep conversation but I immediately shut it down saying ‚ÄúI havked you in your sleep asshole‚Äù. Arriving @ my house I send only one piece of critical info: the username which he will probably never forget. He texts back 15 min later saying ‚ÄúOh shit .. I just realized what u saw‚Äù

321,WhothefuxamI,1580196394,1,"Yesterday on my first therapy session I brought up the topic of my loneliness. I talked about me being unsociable, shy and a loner. I talked about never being in a relationships and never having close friends, just in school/work, but when I'm out it's over. 

And my therapist asked if I want to change that. If I want to find friends, form relationships. And the truth is I don't know. I often dream about having a boyfriend, I think how nice would be to have a circle of friends I could go on vacation, have fun but also have deep conversations with. I feel lonely when I don't have anyone to cuddle when I'm falling asleep, I feel sad when I don't have people that I would be so comfortable with, that I could be 'real' around them 

But it feels nice when it's only imagined. I'm not really cut for all of this and I don't know if I would actually feel good having these. I know that lack of this meaningful relationships is in a big way on me. I avoid people, I run away. I'm not even close with my own family, beside my sister. I can't open to anyone. I don't know if I want to.

And I don't know if it's just my low self-esteem and I just give a vibe of being reserved and not interested or maybe people do actually find me not interesting and not attractive by any means. But I never really got anyone trying to get closer relationship with me. And everyone always seem to already have their own place, their own associations. And there's no place for me. 

Does anyone else also feels like this?",lonely,I'm not sure if I want to be alone or not,2020-01-28 18:26:34

I'm decently attractive, articulate, and people seem to think I'm funny. that said I never did all the normal coming of age stuff where people learned to date. I didn't go to any school social events in highschool, didn't date any until my mid-20's. I honestly wasn't very social at all when younger.

However I got my shit together. I worked my ass off, got in therapy, and turned my life around. I'm in a much better place now. however due to my loneliness when I was younger, sometimes I would try and make friends with people I met online. Those friendships sometimes turned flirty turned....something else. I grew up very religious and was ashamed of my behavior due to the nsfw nature of it. I would eventually tell these women that i didn't want to do this anymore and we would stop talking. I would delete all my accounts so in a moment of weakness I couldn't go back to them.

This patter progressed over the years to the point where it became a cycle. I would talk to someone, i might even really click with them and like them, but because I got to know them in the context of either A) talking with them about sexual stuff or B) On an account that I used to talk to people for that reason.

So I would eventually get to the place where I am now. I don't know how I feel about sexual stuff. I just want to feel open and free and be able to safely explore. I look for women to talk to online who are open to that (and in a few hours my post history will probably have examples of what I'm talking about in it).

Then I feel guilty and delete all my accounts. Reddit accounts and discord accounts are completely gone and unrecoverable. so I lose contact there. Email is easy to recover but I can't receive any messages when its scheduled for deletion (which takes 30 days and I NEVER make it that long before reactivating it). Same story for skype, if I talk to them on there then its all good cause I'll be back within a few days, a week max.

I don't know how to fix myself, i don't know how to be better. I just want to feel someone talk to me.

I am the type of person that shouldn't be having dating problems. My friends joke that I'm the most likely to get any action if we go out. I'm funny, people laugh at my jokes. I went to a out of town conference not to long ago and people who lived in the city invited me over to there house to hangout, they complimented me , told me I was funny, smart, ect. Not in a weird way but I heard multiple people say that. Yet where I live no one sees me that way, no one complements me, no one (certainly no women) want to know me.

His father died when he was a baby and his mom abandoned him to get remarried. He was raised by his uncle, who was poor and uneducated. He never saw his mom again till he was a teenager, this deeply affected him. It made him very insecure and angry. The marriage between my parents was arranged by their families. My dad was rich at the time, so there were no complaints. After their marriage, my dad ghosted for three years. No letters or phone calls, nothing. This was a sign that he was not ready to be a family man, but was allowed to simply come and claim his bride after three long years. He made my mom give up her job, her friends and basically everything she knew when he took her away. My mom felt strongly commited to honoring her family, so she complied. My siblings and i were born and things seemed peaceful, until he went broke shortly after. Losing his wealth made his paranoia, insecurity and anger issues worse. He started locking us up at home, my mom included. There was a time i was locked at home for a whole year This affected my siblings and i deeply. We were cut off from children our own age, so we became awkward and unable to communicate effectively. Even our dressing was different. At school, we were outsiders and were bullied.

Basically nothing has a meaning anymore, everything just feels superficial. I can barely keep track of days since they are always the same.
Christmas, new year and my birthday felt just like all of the other days, I can't even see the ""line"" between every week, month or year anymore. 

Feels like I'm living without a reason, with no satisfaction, pleasure or anything, Just endlessly walking in the same void.

I have been feeling really lonely the past few months and I was wondering why I have been feeling this way. I have a loving and supporting family but that is about it to be honest. I know that i might sound ungrateful but believe me when I say I am. My parents have always provided for me. I have never had a best friend or a serious relationship. Once had a toxic relationship and felt like shit. I have 4 friends who are better friends with eachother than with me. I have no people texting me and it feels that no one cares about my well-being while I have been there for certain people. I also feel really insecure about myself eventhough people have told me otherwise. I've stayed up nights thinking about my 'lonelyness'. Yet this isnt the problem. Everyone I've ever come across told me that I am a socially gifted guy and funny. However when it comes to real 'Friendship' I dont have anyone.  Has anyone else ever had this problem? If so, Advice is really appreciated!!!

I get nervous, I feel stupid and super self-conscious. I've decided to suffer through that cause I might feel better about them in time? With more experience? But I'm just not happy about things. My family lives overseas, so that's always a source of anxiety for me. I don't want to move back, but I do really miss them. I just don't feel like there's anyone around me who loves me unconditionally,  like my parents do. No family dinners, Birthday celebrations, etc. It's really hard sometimes. But I've learned to live with that. My 2 months relationship just ended. And one of the reasons they mentioned was because I'm ""sad"" which is true. Not all the time and I thought we were having fun together, but he ended it. I feel hurt, rejected and ""broken."" It sucks. I do have friends, but some of them have husbands/boyfriends, some have family around and I just don't. And I just don't want them to feel bad cause they can't help me. Ultimately, it's my battle to fight. I've reached out to the local Facebook group hoping to find a women's group, but all I got were retreat suggestions. I then said that I'd love to get together for a happy hour or something if there are any single ladies around as I'd love to make new friends. No response.

Musically, I want songs that feel like loneliness. If it makes you feel like you‚Äôre the only one in the nighttime and that there‚Äôs no one else in your life, I like that kind of stuff. A dark key, a slower pace, minimal instruments (guitar, piano, violins) and a beautiful voice. For example, a song that musically feels lonely to me is Work Song by Hozier.

384,alexandra7903,1580167699,1,"Bit of background info about me is that I was born in a very dysfunctional family in a corrupted Eastern European country. My parents had moved to England ages ago and I decided to stay with my grandparents in Romania up until 2 years ago. It had been great, used to have a lot of fun with my friends out, loads of parties, school was going well. Somehow I decided to move to England to my parents which I hate.To keep it short: they skip work, overspend, been here for ages and still live in an old rented house in a council estate...yk that type of person.

When I first came here I met this guy on a language exchange app trying to exercise my language skills and maybe meet some new people. We ended up in a long distance relationship. We see each other a few days every month. We get along so well, his parents love me. However, my parents make it difficult to see each other and often make big arguments out of this and talk me down for having a bf at this young age.

I have NO one else here, I speak to some people at school but it's superficial and I feel extremely lonely, it feels like hell, nothing like it used to be before. I still talk to my old friends from Romania and visit them on holidays but it's not the same.. I feel like a complete freak here, from a very confident person I ended up wondering if I really am weird or there's something wrong with me.

People give me dirty looks in classes because of my accent and I never go out, 99% of my time is spent in my room studying, drawing, watching Netflix or YouTube. I'm really scared that if my bf breaks up with me I'll end up being suicidal or turn this into a chaos considering I have no one here. I don't like being so dependent on him... I just wonder, if he likes me and I get along so well with him, why do others at my school despise me? What is wrong with me? I'm so confused

I just want my life back and stop crying every minute of the day.Should I just go back to Romania and give up on the chance of going to a good University here ? Are personal relationships the most important? Is it worth it to risk my teenage years for a better chance to education ?Any kind of advice would be more than welcome, I just feel desperately lonely here and I don't get it why it's so hard to make some damn friends in this country..

I won¬¥t elaborate. Bottom line result is, from a very early age I fully understood that my life and circumstances where not as good as others¬¥. I couldn¬¥t explain and didn¬¥t want to share. Bad move because I had so little common grounds with other kids in the first place and now I also didn¬¥t get to share all the stuff growing up. I wasn¬¥t at the parties, at the sports club, I never had anyone over at home, I didn¬¥t go for driving lessons, or on student exchange, didn¬¥t tell my first crush. This perpetuated into young adulthood. Getting myself into a career and stable life took me time well into my 30s. Coincidence had it that my high school was mostly better off kids and they, again, share this classic path, college, student life, travel, career, marriage. Even if I where better at maintaining contact I am obviously on a different trajectory and they never seem to cross much. I fall silent when people share similar memories, they have all these reference points they seem to have come by and know, and I dont. Plus, my version is uncomfortable. No very fond memories. Like you would disturb with your difficult and complicated experience, so you shut up, like always. ""No, I don¬¥t remember this driving coach, I couldn¬¥t afford it"". ""No, I didn¬¥t have a high school love"". ""No, I was too confused to go to college"". Who the hell wants to be the person who says that. This has really been crippling to my personal development, like a thick glass wall between me and other people and ""the good life"". I know it¬¥s totally neurotic but it¬¥s still real to me.

My heart starts racing, suddenly everything seems pointless. Its almost like jealousy but 1000 times worse. I think about my future and that just makes everything worse as i know im probably never going to enjoy my life as much as the imaginary people on the screen are.

I'm curious if you are lonely in a certain point or stage in your life, or if you've always dealt with loneliness? I think some people might be more sensitive to loneliness than others and want a deeper connection in relationships than others. I was cleaning and came across old journals. Reading through them I saw that I always felt like I'm not quite connecting with people as deeply and consistently as I'd like, so there's definitely a theme of loneliness throughout my life. I moved a lot as a kid and so whenever I made a friend group, I would end up moving shortly after. That was the start of it for me, however I started moving so early in life it's possible I have a personality prone to loneliness that would have been there whether I moved or not.

40/African American/F/unmarried but in a relationship 

I have been actively trying to find a real friend for at least 2 years. I just turned 40 at the end of last year and I realize I have been trying to make friends since elementary school and I usually fail. I say usually because I had a great college friend and she dumped me because of a misunderstanding. I called her, emailed her and texted her then I found out her reason. I apologized for my part and hoped we could mend things...she decided not to and I respected her decision, but I cry all the time because I miss her. She hates me for some unknown reason.

Turning 40 just makes it sting more that I am friendless. I am only worthy of being peoples associate but no closer than that. I have tried to cultivate new hobbies and I haven't found anything I enjoy. I try new things a lot because people think something is wrong with you if you don't like sports, outdoor stuff, or drinking much.  I have Lupus so a I prefer chill activities that won't leave me exhausted or  ill. Most of the time, I suck it up I go to baseball games, outdoor festivals, bowling (I'm bad at it, but I try). No one my age near me seems to like the things I enjoy like: Cooking classes, Gaming, Horror Movies,  B-Movies, Cartoons, Trivia.  Maybe I'm too immature for most adults my age since they have families?  

I'm starting to not enjoy myself at any events I attend because everyone seems so ""clicky"". I always ask people out and no one accepts so always go out alone.  I think am developing an anxiety. No one wants a new friend if they already have them and are adults. 

I actively mingle with people when i go out. The interacting is always pleasant, but never results in any long term friendships. no one ever calls me even though they ask for my number sometimes or already have my number, no one ever visits, texts or asks me to hang. I call people, throw gatherings, try to keep people entertained, cook for dinner parties, invite people out and all that. I figured I needed to be a friend to make a friend... and after this long, I'm tired of trying. I make sure not to come off desperate, clingy, rude. I KNOW people like me, but I don't know why people font want to be in a close friendship with me.

I have joined groups that I have a lot of interest in )and even ones I have little interest in) trying to chill with like minded people. The problem is either I am too weird or the people have enough friends and don't want me new ""applicants"".

Thanks for reading :). I just feel no one wants me and needed to share where I figured ppl could relate.

TLDR: I am friendless, anxious, sad and NEED a friend. I know I am well liked/accepted but I don't know what I am doing to keep people at ""associate' level.",lonely,I'm Bad at Making friends. Loney and becoming discouraged and depressed.,2020-01-28 03:33:05

My case is not even close to what some people live through, but I am lonely. I am touch craved, I am slowly going more and more numb to my environment, I am slowly becoming a shell of a person. The loneliness seeps further into my bones, and with it a feelings of despair, abandonment.

I realised a few things.
1. I have never had a friend, who has wanted to stay my friend, more than like 2 or 3 years. They always walk away to someone else. Even then, we aren't friend-friends.
2. Whenever I do make a friend, I am always the ""in case of emergencies"" or ""filler"" friend for them. 
3. I have never been checked up upon. You know, the cursory ""happy birthday! How are you doing?"" or the ""hey! What's up?"" texts. 
4. If I initiate something, it always falls through.

1. Meditation is key for anyone who is feeling lonely the reason is because you build the gray matter in your brain that strengthens happiness and dopamine to the correct levels

2. You need to take long walks in nature, alone! There are living things all around us appreciate them and appreciate that you are a live along side them. 

3. Defeat fear by being grateful in the moment! It is almost impossible to be fearful of your loneliness if you are grateful for the things you do half the fact that you can see , the fact that you can hear the,fact that you can smell, the fact that you‚Äôre able to read this are all amazing grateful blessings that should not go on noticed!

4. Demand a higher standard of yourself and make a plan to attain that higher standard. Whether your skin is colored green, you have one eye, you have no legs, and or you were insecure about your social skills none of it matters. There are 7 billion people on this planet that I feel lonely and you deserve to be around them the first you must love who you are. And the best way to start loving yourself is to demand more of yourself and love the process of getting there!

5. My favorite way to defeat loneliness is helping others even if you feel lonely get out into the world and enjoy helping. Gandhi one said ‚Äú We find ourselves when we lose ourselves in the happiness of others‚Äù 

6. Write in a journal every morning before you do anything after you wake up. Write down your emotions, fears, exciting news, and end with a positive affirmation. DO IT EVERYDAY! It takes 2 mins

7. To anyone who is lonely know that you are not alone they‚Äôre amazing things looking after you and within yourself that loneliness is powerful embrace it and start loving who you are when you‚Äôre with your thoughts.

Like anything, what you practice grows! So, practice this again and again until it becomes an adaptation response and live stronger, happier, healthier and with a purpose!

426,its__Jason,1580137545,1,"My birthday is in a few weeks ( turning 21) and now i am just sick and tired of being sick and tired. I have never dated a girl. I have never kissed a girl. I have never had sex. I just want some sort of intimacy. I went to the strip club last month and i was disappointed not because of the strip club it self but because i didn't get the level of intimacy i was searching for. When ever a stripper came up to me when i was at the strip club , i couldn't help to think that every conversation they was trying to have with me was fake. Obviously they are there to make money. I don't blame them. I am just frustrated because i am trying everything i can to get some sort of intimacy. I was thinking of getting an escort but i decided that i would get the same amount of disappointment after everything is said and done. 

During the beginning of the year, i decided to try online dating apps. I used Tinder, Bumble and Ok Cupid and i have gotten no success. I had a few people match me but i have a felling they accidentally swiped right on me when they saw my picture. So overall, i haven't gotten any success from online dating apps. Because my birthday is in a few weeks, the one thing that would make me happy is if a pretty girl i know wanted to be my girlfriend just for ONE DAY. I know this sounds like a pipe dream and this will probably never happen but this would may my year if i got a girlfriend for a day. 

If i had a girlfriend for a day, i would want to do a few things for that day 

* I want to be hugged and touched. ( I don't want a 2 second friend hug or a side hug, i want a full 10 sec hug) 
* I want to go out and do something with her like go out to an amusement park or a water park.
* I want to cuddle with her and sleep in bed with her. I want to wrap my arms around her and have her be my little spoon.
* I want to have sex and want to experiment like everyone else 
* I want to kiss her (never kissed a girl) and tell her ""I love you"" 
* I want to go to the mall with her and tell her how she looks with every outfit she tries on. 

That's a lot to do in a 24 hour period but this a list of things i would want to do with a girl

In better news , me and a couple friends are going to top golf for my birthday so i guess i have something to look forward to. I guess at the end of the day, i have 3 friends from high school that are my ride or die type of friends and i am vary thankful for that.",lonely,Just another lonely vent,2020-01-28 02:05:45

Boy was it hard.Especially to tell this to someone who you liked so much and who left you and came back an year and half later.

Reddit made me feel that I am a better person than her because the fact that she came back to me means I am good at showing compassion to someone and that I should direct it to someone who deserves it.The main thing was the realization that I miss being loved rather than I miss being loved by that person is.Once you know that,you are already on your way out of loneliness.Thats what I feel atleast

I keep knowing I'm the guy who is sitting at the bar quietly. Not knowing what to do.

And when I go home I am metaphorically punching myself in the face for not trying to talk to somebody. 

If I'm so attractive or nice as people tell me that I am then why do I feel so lonely because those people that tell me that rather be with someone else. Why do I feel so unloved and so untouched or so unnoticed. 

This is the worst feeling in the world. I feel like people are just lying to me to make me feel better because they feel bad about me being unattractive or not what they want or not what anyone would want.

444,_QWERTZUIOP_,1580121107,1,"So last year my gf broke up with me. She not only was my girlfriend, she also was my best friend and we talked about everything. When we broke up, I was devastated. But no one seemed to care. I know many people, we do jokes and laugh occasionally, when we meet at university or other activities. But we don‚Äôt meet at other times. As soon as I am at home, I am alone now. I am only 19 and while others go out on the weekends, I either stay at home or work. I almost never get asked, to go out and do something. A few times a year, I get invited to birthday party‚Äôs but that is because we invite each other to our birthday party‚Äôs. When I am turning 20 in a few months, I won‚Äôt celebrate my birthday this year. Since I don‚Äôt have enough good friends to party with. When I am not celebrating, others will stop inviting me from time to time.
It just hurts immensely to have almost no one, I can connect with on a deeper level. There is only one person. He called me the day, my relationship ended. I was so glad, someone cared, because I suspected he would be the only one. I texted him about my problems and he answered. Even though it took him some time, since he is very busy. Over time, I noticed he was the only one, who cared and the only one, I have a deeper connection with. But I also know, he has a best friend since early childhood and I don‚Äôt want to be his new best friend. I am not even jealous. I am just glad, someone cared and I at least have someone. Now I am trying to accept my fate. It is probably too late for me to get a best friend and good friends at all.

454,anlin_2001,1580115376,1,"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit ever. I made this account so no one could trace it back to me in real life and to exclusively post here because I do not want anyone in my real life to worry about me. See, I have been chronically depressed for years now. I was diagnosed back in my last year of middle school, I am a freshman in college now. I was never really supported by my family when we found out because they are Christian(not really sure what sect anymore) and follow the bible in a very cult like manner. I was just told that I could pray the pain away and my life would just get better and for a short time I believed it but nothing got better. I had very personal problems with my parents which resulted in a lost of mistrusted and emotional abuse. (not to mention physical abuse as a child before age 13) I would get called spoiled, retarded, ungrateful, over dramatic. I wasn't allowed to cry or have opinions. I couldn't question what they said or did or else. I was spanked up until 13 as discipline but had things throw at my head, been choked, punched, had a knife head to my throat once, and had to eat soap until 16. They justified all this by basically saying that I was a little shit (granted I was) and they only punished me because they loved me so much. Around age 17, I  started standing up for myself which started with me admitting that I was an atheist which resulted with my mother crying violently and screaming at me to get the car while to speeds close to cliffs and and trees. She was so angry that I thought she was going kill me and her at the same time. She didn't but ended it all with screaming at me, ""Why do you hate me?!"". My father on the other hand made my feel bad by writing me a letter describing the times he had fucked up with me and blamed himself for my lack of belief. \[TRIGGER WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULT\] I don't want to talk about this too much because it still hurts me, but I was also raped at 17 was victim blamed by my own mother. I can not explain how much that hurt me and I still am learning to cope with that. Fast forward, I am now 18 and am struggling to hold myself. I now have a loving boyfriend who lives quite few states away (he knows about my episodes and my toxic family and is very supportive) and I don't want him to know that I've been struggling with my mental health more than usual. I am ashamed to admit but I wrote a suicide note tonight and thought about doing it while he slept on call with me. I feel so bad for even just thinking about it. I already hate that I place so much stress on him already and don't want him to worry about me. Not like he can really do anything right now to stop me and I don't want him to feel like its all in his hands. I don't know what to do. I can't do therapy because my parents will find out and take me off the insurance and I don't have money to spend since I am college student. Not to mention, mental health is not so great in the bible belt. I don't even know if anyone will read this or even care, but if anything this will be the only trace I will leave of my suicidal thoughts.",lonely,How do you title a post like this?

When i was younger i would have been able to brush it off and get back out there but at 34 i feel like i am so over the hill. As much as i want a group of friends to hang out with lately i haven't wanted to even venture out the house as i feel like such a waste of space.

Which gives me possible hope of her wanting more. But at times it's like she throws it in my face she doesn't want anything more than what we have.

It started with a beautiful, so fucking beautiful and sweet, charming girl that I met here on Reddit: she is all that I mentioned, but she didn‚Äôt (maybe still don‚Äôt) believe that, of course she has the same problem about self-esteem like some of us have here. 

I thought I could help her, cheering her up and saying all those things that are truth about her, and we tried to be friends... but I had a crush on her, so strong, and of course I ruined it. 
Making it simple: She said that she couldn‚Äôt return those feelings that I have... and also we couldn‚Äôt be as close as I wanted. And I feel so terrible.

I thought I wasn‚Äôt enough for pretty girls with perfect lifes... but now, I notice that I‚Äôm also just a piece of shit for beautiful, sweet girls that have the same problems, and think that they are  nothing, when that‚Äôs all bullshit.

I‚Äôm so boring, I know I‚Äôm ugly as hell (even if all the girls that I‚Äôve met, say that I‚Äôm ‚Äúcute‚Äù, but i know is just for pity) and I have nothing interesting, I could say that I have no personality... just a living piece of shit.

I want more for me, I really want it: a beautiful, charming and loving girl, even I wish I could get married and having a beautiful baby... but now I see that I‚Äôd never have it... and it‚Äôs ok, hurts as hell, but it‚Äôs ok.

I accept that I have to be miserable on the emotional way, I accept that women will always love the intelligent one, the handsome one, the successful one, even if that woman has self-esteem problems. 

‚ÄúTry to be with someone that is better that you‚Äù, the girl that I mentioned knew that, that‚Äôs the reason that she would be better with someone else, and the reason that nobody could love me.

I hope that girl would find someone that could offer her all the fucking love, and support that she deserves, because she deserve it a lot, she really deserve it...

A very enthusiastic good to know person who anyone can talk to. And a impassive young man who doesn‚Äôt like to be with others. One of them I haven‚Äôt thought of people‚Äôs opinions of either one and my past actions which has led to consequences of people‚Äôs views over me. I am trying to be impassive. Just so people don‚Äôt view me as the person they view me now. Which is a young annoying kid who hangs out with people that scream in the halls, yes I do have friends, of all different categories, I‚Äôm thinking whether I should choose the overall perspective of myself to detach myself away from friends. To create more memories with people who I think would have this view on me. Or should I stay with my friends and keep on being viewed as I am now. Which I do not want to be viewed as.

I am here because I have mostly succeeded in this. But there is still a side of me that shows that I don‚Äôt want others to see. I‚Äôm not sure if I want people to know me as the impassive person. Or the person who is strange. Or the person who is enthusiastic.

Maybe I have a personality disorder because all of these show at different times. Actually. I take that back. Maybe I have different moods around different people. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm tired.

Why am I posting this on r/lonely? Because I feel as if I am. No one at my school has seen the things I have seen on the internet. I say in full honesty of myself and the opinions of adults and others that I am more mature than a majority of people at school and outside of school. I have tried to hang out with certain types to experiment with a new personality. But I see others and envy them because I am not as good looking or as great as them. 

I want to be good at something. And anything. I want to have a great skill in something and be able to press my impassive emotionless part of myself to it. To be viewed as a person. As a character who I want to be.

494,ethanmundahl,1580093582,1,"First off, before we start, please don‚Äôt go looking me up or my wife. I want this to stay here.

Hey guys, I‚Äôve seen this subreddit a couple times and I see that my experiences are nothing like yours. I grew up getting girls all the time. I met the one I love very young, in 8th grade (2012). We started dating my sophomore year of high school (2014) and we got married just last August. I‚Äôm turning 21 next month.

My wife has lots of mental issues(PTSD, survivors guilt, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and some other personality disorder) But for most of our relationship that have been for the most part manageable. But for a significant amount of it she has been in charge. She gets so angry all the time about the littlest things and she takes it all out on me. I‚Äôve made mistakes in our relationship but I have never cheated on her. I love her so much. But recently I don‚Äôt think she loves me. I‚Äôve always known that she is bisexual. And she always told me if we broke up she was going to go back to girls forever. Well within the last two weeks she has been really struggling with her feelings about girls. And she has asked for space so she can figure them out. By that I mean she wants to experience being a lesbian with no distractions. She kicks me out of my own bed and my own apartment because I‚Äôm a distraction.

Just last night she texted me while I was spending the weekend away at my dads that she misses me and she‚Äôs sorry for the way she treats me and that I deserve so much better than her. I think she is making a change for the better. But I come home tonight and she won‚Äôt talk to me. She is throwing things. Yelling at me. Insulting me. And now she has locked herself in the bedroom and is posting snapchats about her being a victim. I confide my feelings in myself and one or two other friends. But for the most part just me. 

She wonders why I‚Äôm not the person I used to be but that‚Äôs because she has ruined me. I used to cry a lot but now I haven‚Äôt cried since 2017 when my dog passed away. I don‚Äôt want to lose her and I don‚Äôt want to look for love elsewhere, as tempting as it would be to get with a new girl. I just wish she actually treated me like I matter to her and not like she is only putting up with me for the rest of her life, if she chooses to stay with me after this soul searching she is doing.

I‚Äôve contemplated ending my life a couple times. I have a concealed carry pistol in the night stand. But I really don‚Äôt want to die. And I can‚Äôt drink my feelings away because I have a liver disease. And I‚Äôm not into weed. All I can do is make myself numb and stop thinking about it. I want her but she won‚Äôt let me be myself.

I've let my health go due to money issues caused by her spending, but one of her reasons for leaving was because ""she cant just continue to watch me die"".  Im sheltered and now ... broken.  

My day since I was a kid consisted of going to work, coming home to her, making a meal, and then just hanging out.   She had her own issues with self image so we didnt go out much.  But when we did, it was memorable and special.

Im so very lost.  I just want her back.  I know thats not happening ... she left with some guy from several states away because she was so miserable and won't even answer my calls or messages.

I just dont know what to do with myself.  Being alone is eating me alive.  If this is what my life is going to be like ... coming home to quiet nothingness to cry in the corner ... I don't know how i'll do that.  These have been 3 of the worst nights of my entire life.  I tried going to the store and just walking around but I started crying and had to leave.  I have no interest in bars or drinking, but thats all this area has to offer.  Walmart and some bars.  Not enough money to leave.

I guess thats why im here ... there isnt anywhere else for me.",lonely,"Alone, Scared, and Venting",2020-01-27 12:35:16

505,undeadknowledge,1580087226,1,"First time posting on here...Right now as I sit in my house trying to count my blessings and being grateful for the life I have, it hard to deal with because I‚Äôm alone.

I was married and got divorced 1.5 years ago after being falsely accused of physically abusing my ex. After paying the court, I resorted to smoking and drinking everyday. Around 6 months later I changed course and moved to Florida from NY, got a new career and built my house.

Fast forward now, im establish at this new job - house is all built, i compete in triathelons, im a avid plant collector, no more smoking...but I have nobody around.

My family criticizes me for being to weird...they say i need to be more social and put myself out there but whenever i do i get rejected and/or ghosted almost on a weekly basis.

Relationships dont last in my life, they never have. At the best the ppl that stay around will use me for money or whatever i could supply them with. 

Im a genuinely good person according to everyone but for some reason dont have any connections with anyone. I feel like i can come and go without anyone remembering. The people are around me suck, the ppl on dating apps are even worse. The only place to meet ppl my age is in the club and that totally isnt my thing so im left to repeat the cycle of work, train, sleep....day in, day out and im getting tired. 

Im getting tired of peoples lies...im getting tired of trying to be the best version of myself because at the end of the day does it matter? It doesnt help me that i have a house paid in cash with no debt. I could live in a box under a bridge with one pair of clothes and be happy - ive done it. It doesnt matter that i have food bc ive gone days without it before. It doesnt matter that im smart bc it hasnt really gotten me anywhere in the true sense.

I wish i could just fade away and be a forgotten memory in peoples minds...or better yet just completely erased from the face of existence bc honestly this life isnt what ppl make it out to be",lonely,M26 alone on another sunday,2020-01-27 12:07:06

511,PM_ME_CLEVER_STUFF,1580084665,1,"My day started waking from a dream... or nightmare... Whatever. Anywho, in the dream I was paid to break into a correctional facility and break someone out. I think it was $100,000 by the mob. Anyways, I kept running around walls, in corridors, while being shot at, and, it was strange now that I think about it, the police didn't chase after me... They just stood still and shot at me when they saw me through a door way or whatever. Eventually, after who knows how many times of laps of getting shot at I ran into a police officer. Correctional officer? He shot at me until his clip was empty and we tussled, and a female officer came over and pointed a gun at me-- too close, she was shaking, didn't want to shoot me-- and I disarmed her and shot the male police officer I was tussling with. Well, tried, the safety was on, he rushed me, and at the last second I shot him in the neck, point-blank, when he was close to me. The female's face blanched and I took her hostage and decided to just escape. While we were going towards an exit she revealed that she was committing fraud and was scared that she'd be investigated after the incident. I replied like I understood her predicament of guilt and  anxiousness and brought her out with me. I, for some reason, had a bike-- an avtual bicycle-- as a getaway, and I woke up after looking away and hearing her scream for help.

Then, I realized that I was in darkness, my room. Cold and lonely. Messy, because whenever I decide to change myself, clean up, better myself, I always fall back into a cycle. Anyways, I woke up feeling as lonely as I always am, but never feel. I decided I should go for a walk, do something. I subconsciously walked towards the church. I didn't go, the service was already over. I eventually found a place out of sight, a snow hill with no one around, and laid down. I looked at the cloudy sky, felt the coolness pervade my body, the wind on my face, and the silence around me. I cried, well tried to, for an hour until I picked myself up, put on a smile and walked home like nothing happened.

I tried to visit some friends. I tried to read. But, nothing. Nothing could make me feel as if I was part of the world. I went home, crawled into bed, my dark room, and tried to pray to God. I prayed about all my problems. I prayed for those around me, so that they may be happy. When I was done, I could feel even more clearly the silent emptiness around me.

It always happens. I have this stupid fucking blink, a 'waking up' of sorts, where I can feel myself, the space around me, and an emptiness in my gut. After all my smiling, my laughing, my whatever, I just feel empty. After trying to worry about those around me, be accomodating and supportive, I feel an endless fatigue. But, I can escape to a certain extent. I read books. So the world in those books can draw my attention away from myself and allow me to see a better world, one of imagination. Still...

Anyway, my rant is done. Sorry to those who actually took the time to read it for some reason. Also, the dream may be off topic, but I had it and you know.",lonely,My Sunday,2020-01-27 11:24:25

I understand people sometimes post as a means to vent, without really wanting advice because they already know the standard advice. They've been told plenty of times to find hobbies, to meditate, to exercise, social groups, to get out there and meet people, and generally improve upon themselves in order to gain more self confidence.

For many people, even the actions considered self help tend to be too daunting and overwhelming. Depression, suicidal thoughts, and general feelings of worthlessness and despair are rampant. I understand. I've been there. If you are currently going through such a situation, please seek help. If you do not have insurance or otherwise can not afford to see a counselor, psychologist, or other mental health expert, please seek public services that are far more affordable or free. Your life is worth it. YOU are worth it. You can not expect your life to improve if you keep doing the same things that net negative results.

Living an adult life of complete isolation due to extreme events of abuse throughout my coming of age era. 27 years old and completely unaware or interested in the society around me. Recently met a female co-worker over a year ago that jumped into my life, only to abruptly jump right back out and leaving me with the final comments that will haunt me forever. When I asked her why she's done with me so suddenly without any signs, she stated ""I was confused the entire time I was with you. I now know that I would rather be single, than to be anything more than friends with you from here on out."" I never wanted a relationship due to my mental state, and knowing what it would do to me if I were any more heart broken. Here I am, raped for all I'm worth and at what appears to be my final moments of rationality. I created this account and post because I felt that I needed to express this to any other living being out there since I officially have no one in my life.

I know people as acquaintances but not really know them well enough to consider them as friends. Heck being a guy I'll just get a lot of backlash by friends and family if I say anything so I've been dealing with it. It's also been 1 year since I broke up with my ex. She's been the only girl I was close to. She broke up and immediately went for another guy after and it really broke me. I've been shy my whole life but somehow I'm confident in public speaking which just makes me wonder if whatever I'm going through is actually considered to be social anxiety or something because others are worse off and I feel no one's gonna bother because ""you don't have social anxiety/depression/wtv"". No one texts me at all. My only notifications are from group chats and all of which don't involve me. People say I mean a lot but there's someone else they'll pick over me. I'm somewhat popular but after school I'm just back to being lonely. No one cares. I'm just the temporary friend just to fill up the space and that's it. Had suicidal thoughts before and I still do. Not helping for the fact that even if I share this info with friends for a while they'll care but afterwards they won't. Maybe is cuz it isn't real? Maybe because I'm just attention seeking? Heck would I know but I'm actually suffering and being lonely isn't helping at all. Sometimes my mum asks me if I'm lonely but who would tell their parents the truth? I'm keeping it to myself. I think people forget I exist as well. I just hope for someone to care that's all. Like actually caring and there and basically be a friend. It's impossible for me  friends unless I stalk their social media to gain info and then talk to them online. Irl is harder for me.

555,agentinks,1580044873,1,"I've always been an intensely private person because I don't think people care about anything that doesn't provide an opportunity for gain. Every conversation I have is weighed by how often I think I'll see the individual and how much I think they care about anything I have to say. It makes being real with anyone impossible. I don't think people care about the things I do and I don't know where to find people that do. It's become much worse since I battled cancer in 2016 and was diagnosed with stage 3, now stage 4, Congestive Heart Failure in 2017.

The list of things I can do is slight. I isolate myself and push the few people in my life away by lying about how I am, how I feel, what I need, because I don't think they care. I have a long term girlfriend I know loves me that has devoted her life to pursuits I am completely uninterested in and told her I wasn't interested in when we first got together 17 years ago. We have no intimacy and all the things I've tried to do to bring it back have failed because she doesn't believe we have a problem and won't commit to changing anything. She has given me freedom to find intimacy outside of our relationship and I don't because I don't think I can find a woman willing to see past my troubles to the man on the other side.

I don't want to live the life I do and I am trapped in it by my health and lack of assets. I am in an age gap relationship. I have no credit, own nothing, can't work, can't get disability or assistance because we are common-law, have no one I can fall back on for financial help should I leave and don't have a pension or any other financial related things to fall back on.

I've talked to therapists and councilors to no avail. I have been on an anti-depressant for eight years. My cats keep my alive. One is so affectionate and serves as my only true companion. I am working on an art project I don't think anyone will care about because the few people in my life show no interest in it and that sometimes kills my own passion for it.

I want to go out and drive but don't because I have no where to go, no one to see and can't linger when I get wherever anyway because I can't stand for long or sit for long unless the chair is perfectly comfortable.

I don't know what to do to improve my situation and worry one day I'll logic out suicide and commit to it.

Writing this has been difficult and while I don't think anyone here will care I am going to post it because I've written something like this a hundred times before and deleted it.

Well, many reasons. It‚Äôs not the same for everyone. Some of my friends are exes, people I can see on various social medias getting on with their lives, enjoying life, moving on, and I don‚Äôt want to get in the way. 

Some of them have a tendency to gossip, and I know that - if I ask them for help - it‚Äôll end up with other people within hours.

There‚Äôll always be one piece of evidence pointing one way or the other, and once again I‚Äôll be lead astray either by hope of despair.

When I‚Äôm alone, I can push it all away. It‚Äôs almost like those people I worry about don‚Äôt exist anymore, or only exist as a passing thought or memory, at least.

Now that I finished University, not a single person that I considered a friend has even tried to reach out to me, and you one could argue that I could be the one trying to start a conversation and I know, I just wish it could be different and be that kind of guy that people constantly invite to places.

I don\`t know what to do and I never felt that bad in my life. I need help... I had a big depression the last two weeks and I found the reason...

So since August last year I started an education and there was this girl/ woman which fascinated me from the first day on. She is warm, friendly, supportive, real and so cute. We haven\`t got into contact until october her rabbit died and I was there to help her because I once had rabbits too. That was the point we got into contact. So we talked more and more and I saw how an angel of a person she is. She was helping me when I was down and I was helping her when she was down.

I think you guessed it... From my side feelings did grow. Because I am lonely since years and I never had such an awesome support in my entire life...   
Now there¬¥s the big problem... She is in a happy relationship and I **will not** interfere into their relationship. In addition I am good friends with her boyfriend and I am not the type of person to ruin a relationship. I don¬¥t want to tell her because if I do I don\`t know how they would react and I don¬¥t want to lose them.

The last weeks I cried a lot and was super depressive because there is this amazing person but it can\`t be and I don¬¥t know how I can emotionally deal with that... I have an anxious attachment style and I obsessed with her... I can¬¥t get her out of my system... On top of that I will be in school for two more years now.  


This situation bothers me a lot right now. Was anyone of you in a similar position? How did you feel? How did you deal with that?

How do I help my girlfriend?

Hi. I‚Äôll try to keep this short. This girl I work with and me started dating 7 months ago. When she first began to work there, she had a boyfriend in jail but they broke up and then we became a couple a week later. She is 19 and I‚Äôm 25, so a lot of her issues probably are due to age. Anyways, everything was good in the relationship. We spent all our time together and loved being around each other. She was with me every night and pretty much all the time because we worked together. Other than her snooping  through my phone in fear that I was cheating on her, there was no problem. She said she was so in love with me and i was and still am in love with her. However, as soon as the ex got out of jail I figured out she spent a whole day and night with him, while ignoring me and saying she was out with family. I told her what I knew and broke up with her. She denied ever seeing him, but felt things were different and it wouldn‚Äôt work because I don‚Äôt trust her anymore. We kept hanging out though and she expressed that she loved me and wanted to work things out. After about a week, I just didn‚Äôt see the relationship going anywhere because my trust was fucked up, so I told her I was going to Miami for three days and then she flipped out. She felt like I abandoned her and didn‚Äôt love her anymore and went back to her ex.

After two weeks, the ex already fucked up and she was calling me back. We started talking again for two weeks and the first time we hung out I realized two other guys (one another ex boyfriend and one I‚Äôm not sure who he is) were texting her. Once we started hanging out again constantly, I no longer saw any other guys texting her except for the ex she had broke up with who blows up her phone all day everyday on fake numbers because she blocked him. She acted like she wanted to be in a committed relationship again, but I wasn‚Äôt willing to commit because she had just broke up with her ex and I wanted to make sure there was no mix feelings. Now it has been three months since then and we are always together just like we were before. I asked her last night if she wanted to be committed again and she said no because she was afraid I would leave her because I didn‚Äôt want to commit for so long (still not owning up to the fact that she saw her ex in October and that me leaving was really her fault) and I told her I didn‚Äôt want to commit to someone who likely had mixed feelings for two men, but now she seems to hate him so I‚Äôm more comfortable with commitment.Then she understood and said she wanted to be in a relationship again, so now we are a couple again.

I love this girl to death. She  is my first love and took my virginity. I know, a late bloomer I am. But it seems like she can‚Äôt be alone. She always has to be in a relationship. She even said when she is alone she starts having bad thoughts and she tried to kill herself twice before. She has no friends, doesn‚Äôt like to go out in public unless it‚Äôs for work due to social anxiety, and just likes to be in bed all day with me. I‚Äôm not sure why she decided to see her ex that day, but maybe it‚Äôs because younger guys will say stuff like ‚Äúwe will be together forever‚Äù where I‚Äôm older and more realistic and would say stuff like ‚Äúif we are still together in three months...‚Äù which she would point out and it would make her feel insecure. Or maybe it‚Äôs because we are interracial (I‚Äôm white and she is black) and she has expressed concern about how her mom would act towards me. She definitely has low self esteem and I believe abandonment issues and that‚Äôs why me leaving for Miami triggered her so much. All her past boyfriends have been terrible to her. The first one cheated on her, the second one was physically abusive and almost killed her, and I‚Äôm not sure what this last one did. I know I‚Äôm taking a huge risk of getting my heart broken again, but I love her and I just keep in mind that she probably does love me but is very damaged at the moment so anything can happen. We even got matching tattoos with our initials while we were not ‚Äúofficial‚Äù which was her idea. I know, it‚Äôs crazy lol. It‚Äôs just so sad that she is this way because she is absolutely beautiful (she models on the side) and is funny too. What type of issues do you guys think she is dealing with and what caused them?

I‚Äôm going to have 30k cash saved up by my birthday and I‚Äôm deep into real estate. I‚Äôm working towards doing redevelopment full time.

I'm decently attractive, articulate, and people seem to think I'm funny. that said I never did all the normal coming of age stuff where people learned to date. I didn't go to any school social events in highschool, didn't date any until my mid-20's. I honestly wasn't very social at all when younger.

However I got my shit together. I worked my ass off, got in therapy, and turned my life around. I'm in a much better place now. however due to my loneliness when I was younger, sometimes I would try and make friends with people I met online. Those friendships sometimes turned flirty turned....something else. I grew up very religious and was ashamed of my behavior due to the nsfw nature of it. I would eventually tell these women that i didn't want to do this anymore and we would stop talking. I would delete all my accounts so in a moment of weakness I couldn't go back to them.

This patter progressed over the years to the point where it became a cycle. I would talk to someone, i might even really click with them and like them, but because I got to know them in the context of either A) talking with them about sexual stuff or B) On an account that I used to talk to people for that reason.

So I would eventually get to the place where I am now. I don't know how I feel about sexual stuff. I just want to feel open and free and be able to safely explore. I look for women to talk to online who are open to that (and in a few hours my post history will probably have examples of what I'm talking about in it).

Then I feel guilty and delete all my accounts. Reddit accounts and discord accounts are completely gone and unrecoverable. so I lose contact there. Email is easy to recover but I can't receive any messages when its scheduled for deletion (which takes 30 days and I NEVER make it that long before reactivating it). Same story for skype, if I talk to them on there then its all good cause I'll be back within a few days, a week max.

I don't know how to fix myself, i don't know how to be better. I just want to feel someone talk to me.

I am the type of person that shouldn't be having dating problems. My friends joke that I'm the most likely to get any action if we go out. I'm funny, people laugh at my jokes.

I can‚Äôt help it, especially when I love the person. I would give my heart and soul to make the people I care about happy.
Especially when they are down, I would go out of my way to do little surprises or give little gifts or send little letters to just make that person feel a bit better, even if it only works a bit.

I don‚Äôt do all this because I wish for something in return, I do it because I can‚Äôt not do it. 

However, I can‚Äôt help but wonder how no one would lift a finger for me. I don‚Äôt think I have ever had a proper surprise or a little cheer up gift. And if I seem happy to everyone, well they won‚Äôt bother asking if I am ok.

Trust me you feel like you are on top of the world because you do what you want and have all.the time to eveluate anything and everything.
The demons are here, OVERTHINKING, nothing, absolutely nothing ever seems right, It gets scrutiny.
Then here comes in One dreadful thing, you cant talk to nobody, you Just cant tell your crush how you feel and even if you told them, they wouldnt take you serious. You seem Lost and miserable. Nobody wants a looser - thats what you seem in their face, a Person with no social skills or purpose.
However much we like being alone, we have One thing we want, somebody we can trust, someone we can listen to and care for, someone for whom we can stop the world for so that they know and feel loved, alas, its one thing that we find difficult to get.
Nobody can elude loneliness however strong you are, time comes when your body wants to be next to another, those cuddles in spooning position as you listen to all the have to Say are heaven on earth.
Its never about sex, its about love, the feelings, the emotions, the relationship itself.
Having someone you know that loves you and can come to you and tell you everything will be fine, someone Who gets on your nerves and still you laugh and joke together. Wonderful isnt It!
Why cant i ever find someone Who understands me, Who wants to be with someone Who speaks less and listens more (boring, they say).
Someone you Will lay in bed with and forget about the troubles of the world.
Someone with whom you Will sing all those wrong lyrics in the shower.

688,throwaway93637282,1579928472,1,"You ever meet someone that's just like.......the literal definition of a dream come true! They give your life meaning. They make you feel like you're actually something. They make you feel......happy. And you want to reciprocate that feeling. You want them to be as happy as they can with you. You want to support them in every way possible. You want to see them strive. It almost seems too good to be true. Someone this amazing chose you and you chose them. It's a miracle. It's perfect.

You try everything you can to make them happy......and then one day they just leave. You got into an argument with them and now they're gone. Just like that. No talking about about it, no fixing it, no working it out. You don't know what happened. You want to find out what went wrong but everyone you turn to for help just lies to you. Along with that person leaving, so do friends. You're lost in your own problem. What the fuck happened? 

All of that love, all of that time, all of that affection. Was it worth it in the end? Maybe you could've done more. Maybe you did too much? idk. Was it worth it in the end? 

A few days go by and they're devastating to say the least. Full of tears, pain, and loneliness. Then a few weeks. You're losing sleep. You're becoming skinnier. Losing the person you cared about most does not help your depression  in the slightest. Why would it lmao. You see this person from time to time. It hurts....quite a bit haha. You see them happy...... but with someone else. Already? But they're happy. That's all you wanted, right? You got your wish. Good job. Now what? The person you shared the best memories with......now they are a memory themself.

A few months have gone by now. You feel like you can finally grow now. You're a little motivated to better yourself, focus on yourself. You start going to the gym. You start going out more. You try to be happy.....but you can't get that same feeling as when you were with that person. Something always feels missing. The pain has gone down a bit but you still feel it. You can't help but feel like the breakup was your fault. No matter who tells you otherwise, you caused the breakup. But you're okay now. Just gotta do better next time, right? If there is a next time. You doubt yourself so much, but you try to stay positive. You want to become something. You want to be okay. You're doing all these things but you can't find what's missing. 

You see this person for what you're pretty sure is the last time. They don't smile when they see you. As a matter of fact, they almost scowl at you. They don't like you. What did you do? You think back to what you could've changed but doing that only made you feel so bad. All that pain comes back again. You've tried your best to not think about it. You've tried your best to be happy for all that time but something that small just ruined it. How did someone that did everything for you and you didn't everything for them, how did you get them to hate you that much in so little time?

You remember all the fun times you guys had. All the smiles. All the laughs. All the love. Everything. It feels like a dream almost. How were you THAT happy. You didn't deserve to be that happy. Maybe it really was a dream. It was too good to be true, right? 

Or maybe.....just maybe it wasn't a dream. You could have that all again. Just not with that person. You just have to keep moving forward. Don't let anything stop you. It's a bit cliche but it helps to think that you're worth even the slightest to someone. Family, friends, fuck it even people you don't even know yet. You're somebody's dream come true.

&amp;#x200B;

My life has just sucked for such a long time. I never really thought about it when I was younger, because I would just play my video games and I'd be content. But looking back, it just all sucked so much. My parents separated when I was pretty young, they tried to get back together a couple times for the sake of me and my sisters but it never really worked out. They would get into fights a lot. I remember once my dad left the house and my mom screamed at me to go with him. I was naked at the time, just wearing a bedsheet. She was angry so I couldn't say anything and went outside. I didn't want to chase my dad though, being very ashamed of being naked outside with nothing but a bedsheet to cover myself. I just kind of sat on the porch for awhile and cried. I felt guilty for not doing anything as my father left. I don't really remember what happened afterwards, but it's a traumatic memory for me I only recently remembered.  


&amp;#x200B;

School was the worst. From kindergarten to 11th grade it was all the same. I would move a lot so I was usually the new kid at school. I was too scared to talk to other kids, so I wouldn't really make many friends. I was bullied a lot by so many people. Some people picked on me because I'm mixed race, some people would pick on me because I was poor, and I'm sure some people picked on me simply because I looked like an easy target. If I ever made a friend, it was usually with the one other kid that no one in class liked. Usually they would be a hyper active kid that people would consider weird. But they were usually the only people that would approach me and be nice to me. The bullying would usually get worse after that. The other kids would pick on me more for being friends with that kid. If my friend was weird, than I'd be called weird. If my friend was gay, than they would call me gay. These friends were usually poor and from broken households like me, so I guess we'd just gravitate towards each other. But I moved a lot, so I'd always lose contact with my friends and have to start again in a new school where no one knew who I was.

&amp;#x200B;

The bullying wasn't as bad in high school. I still had bullies, people who would push me around or break my things, but it didn't happen anywhere near as often. Still though I was so used to it that I was just really afraid of people. I would never speak in class unless the teacher asked me to and I did my best to avoid ever interacting with anyone. There were a few guys who would try to talk to me and girls that told me that they liked me, but I was so afraid of those people. I never talked to them so how could they like me? I would tell myself that they just wanted to get a reaction out of me so they could laugh at me in my face and humiliate me like others would in the past. I don't know how many people were genuine and how many were fake, but I wish I had tried to talk to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of my Junior year of High School there were two guys that insisted on being my friends. I ignored them a lot at first, but we all walked the same way home so I couldn't really avoid them completely. They were nice and helped me to get out my shell. They introduced me to some clubs and helped me to make new friends.

&amp;#x200B;

My senior year was probably the best time in my life. I made a few friends, I even somehow had a girlfriend. I loved her very much, but I didn't know anything about dating. I just tried to do everything I could to make her happy. Looking back it was a very one-sided relationship, I would literally walk miles for her but she never really tried to understand me I don't think. She was my first sexual partner and sometimes she would want to have sex when I didn't want to. I had a very hard time telling her no, and sometimes even when I said no she would still push herself onto me anyways. I didn't think a lot of it at the time, but that was definitely wrong. I just had the idea in my head that as a man I wasn't really allowed to turn down sex. It was very confusing for me. And after about a year of us dating she told me that she couldn't truly love someone who didn't believe in God. That really, really hurt. It felt so out of nowhere, I had always been forthcoming about not being religious. I never said anything negative about her religion. I would go to her youth group and help her with anything she needed, regardless of my own beliefs. But I guess that wasn't good enough for her. I broke up with her after that. She apologized and said she wanted to get back together, but I just didn't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of my senior year I found myself in another complicated relationship. I was dating a transman, which wasn't something all of my family or friends could understand. I didn't completely understand my own feelings, but I was very much in love with him. It was difficult though because he was bipolar and had a very short fuse when it came to his anger. I tried to help him be more patient and understanding. Once again I found myself not always wanting to have sex, but my partner pushing me into it anyways. There were situations I found myself very uncomfortable in where I would try to say no, but he wouldn't really listen to me. Again I didn't think about it a lot because I figured having sex is what I'm supposed to do as a guy in a relationship. This relationship ended when I eventually decided to break up. The relationship was really troubled. He was very codependent and didn't want me to hang out with my friends. He was very stubborn and would get into arguments with me just so I'd spend more time with him. He wouldn't really listen to what I had to say or understand how I felt. But the actual catalyst was that when he got really angry or embarrassed he would hit me. I'm ashamed to say it took him hitting me multiple times before I tried to leave him. I used to think it would be so easy for anyone to leave an abusive relationship, but as codependent as my boyfriend was, I wasn't exactly Mr. Independence either. I like being alone, I'm an introvert and very shy. But at the same time I do seek people that will make me feel like I matter. Like I exist.

&amp;#x200B;

After high school things really went down hill. My friends that I had in high school slowly drifted apart. I don't talk to any of them anymore. I got really depressed and pretty much escaped into my video games. Years passed by and I really didn't do much. I tried going to community college and flunk out pretty hard. School had always been easy for me before, but I had never really learned actual study habits. So when the material was actually difficult for once I kind of buckled. I don't exactly have any money or anyone to support me so school is a thing that just isn't meant to be I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried working in a few different jobs. Things usually start off really good, but later down the line there's usually some sort of misunderstanding between me and my employer. It'll be something that sounds really bad, but is 100% just the other person misunderstanding the situation. Though it's my own fault, I'm not good at speaking up. I want to try and clear up the misunderstanding but I just can't find the courage to do so. So I've been fired multiple times over some rather stupid things. It's my own fault, if I wasn't such a coward I'd prolly do quite a bit better.

&amp;#x200B;

Well around when I'm 21 years old I start getting messages from an old friend I used to talk to in a video game forum. We talk a lot about games and somehow it turns into something more personal. At some point we start dating even though we live on opposite sides of the world. A year later I've saved up some money and decide to move to Australia to be with her.

&amp;#x200B;

This was a really tricky relationship. At first she was so kind and shy. But she lived with this family that were very sexist. Like women are expected to do this and that. I would clean up after myself, cook for myself, do my own laundry. It just made sense to me, that's how I was raised. But the family didn't really like any of that. They were also rather racist and made a lot of jokes at my expense. I was in a foreign country also living with them, so I just put up with it and tried to always have a smile on my face. I did what I could to help around the house and help with all the animals. They had chickens, rabbits, horses, everything was very rural. It was a kind of living I had never experienced before. Even while helping out I was usually teased for being a small guy and having soft hands.

&amp;#x200B;

But eventually my girlfriend and I moved to the city, just the two of us. It was really, really tough because a lot of people would try to take advantage of us for being young and me being a foreigner. My girlfriend was also bipolar and would occasionally have episodes where she would either become seemingly emotionless, depressed, extremely angry, or exceptionally happy in a fake feeling way. I always tried my best to help her through these episodes and prevent her from any sort of self-harm. With time she became more confident and the episodes were a lot less frequent. But she also became more mean with time. At first it was just verbal abuse, calling me things like fat, ugly or stupid. I still have a complex about my weight despite actually being underwight my entire life. Later she started physically abusing me. Punching, kicking, pushing, and literally headbutting me. I used to tell myself that she was just having an episode and that I shouldn't take it personally.

&amp;#x200B;

After we had been dating nearly three years she decided she wanted to have sex with other people. She wanted me to be her boyfriend, but she wanted to have more sex. Just like with my other relationships I couldn't exactly keep up with her sex drive. She used to get really mad at me, because we used to have sex a lot in a single day when we first started living together, but nowadays we'd only have sex once or twice a day. I felt guilty for not being able to make her happy, but it was also just really difficult for me to want to have sex with her. She was just so mean to me that a lot of the joy I used to feel just wasn't there. I also always felt ugly since that was how she would tease me. But if I thought I could prevent an argument or calm her down I would give in to her sexual demands.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want her to have sex with other people and was able to say as much. But it didn't really mattered what I said, she decided to do it anyways. That really, really hurt. I had left everything I had ever known to be with her, I had devoted my life to her. I didn't really know what to do at this point in my life, I was just so broken. So as usual I pretty much just stuck to my games and tried not to think about how much my reality sucked. I should of left her and gone back to my own country, but I didn't. I thought about it a lot, but I was without a job so just buying the plane ticket was pretty difficult. I was financially dependent on my partner. I would find myself telling me that she still loved me, that she spent so much money on me and thus she clearly cared about me a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

But it wasn't really getting any better. I had made friends in the city, but my girlfriend started fighting me everytime I'd try to hang out with them so I just stopped leaving the house. I started telling her no when she'd want to have sex, it was hard for me to have sex with her when I had no idea who her other random sexual partners were. But as usual me saying no didn't really mean anything, she'd still push herself onto me anyways. I wouldn't fight back, I felt like that would just make things worse. We were fighting a lot back then, but I couldn't really find it in myself to break up with her. I remember once trying to talk to her about how I felt, trying to get her to understand me. I was crying so much, I was a complete mess. She just looked so disappointed in me, she really just didn't care. She just started having sex with me while I was crying, not caring at all about how I felt or how many times I told her no. She told me that I was useless and that the only thing I was useful for was for getting her off. That all I amounted to was a dildo. That was the worst moment of my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just so broken and had no spirit what so ever. It wasn't until a really random event until I found the motivation to leave her. I wanted to go hang out with my friends one day, and she really didn't want me to go. She told me that we were drifting apart and that we didn't spend enough time together. She wanted to apologize for how she'd been treating me and just make the day about us. I, the fool I am, agreed with her and cancelled my plans with my friends. Not long after she got a call from one of her friends and decided she wanted to go hang out with them instead. She left and it just made me so angry, I finally had the motivation I needed.

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to get a ticket back to my home country, but it wasn't instant and I'd have to wait a few days before I could leave. I didn't tell my girlfriend and was hoping to hide the fact I was leaving from her. Eventually she found out anyways and so we got into a bunch of fights. Many of which including her being physically abusive. I wouldn't hit her back, I remember once just being in the shower crumpled on the ground as she kept hitting me. She's smaller than I am, and I'm not a tall person myself. I'm sure I could have overpowered her if I tried, but honestly most of the times she hit me it didn't really hurt physically. It was really just emotionally where it really stung. The fact that I had told myself I would never date someone who would hurt someone, and yet here I am for the 2nd time in a relationship with someone abusive.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got my stuff sorted I left her before it was time for me to leave. I was homeless for a day, which wasn't exactly the best but I didn't want to be anywhere near her. I had maybe two people I could have maybe reached out to, but we were never really close. I wouldn't know how to explain to them that what I was going through. Especially since my girlfriend was friends with these people. I don't think anyone would believe me. She carried herself very differently outside then how she was at home. She's such a tiny girl who looks even younger than she is, there's just no way they'd believe me.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back to my home country and my younger sister took me in. She could tell I was very depressed, but she wouldn't really question me. For the first year I had reoccurring nightmares and spent most of my days just crying alone. Eventually I found a hobby related to gaming and started doing that. I make a little bit of money, but nothing a real job wouldn't do better.  


&amp;#x200B;

I used to go to these video game tournaments at first. I did pretty well and could win some money, but as time went on the community started becoming really toxic. Eventually I stopped going because I couldn't put up with some of the people there. I became a recluse and don't really leave the house much. I feel guilty because my younger sister has been letting me live with her for a good few years now. She always tells me that I'm not a bother and that she's glad I live with her. She says I really help out and that she doesn't know how'd she get by without me. Sometimes I believe her and sometimes I feel like she's scared I might kill myself or something. I've never thought about doing something like that, I'm just too scared of death. But I'm not exactly excited about life either.

&amp;#x200B;

For a couple years I tried to repress everything that happened to me in Australia, but eventually I kinda snapped. I'd just start crying all the time over everything. Like if I just dropped something I was carrying I would start crying, it was really bad. I tried to get therapy, but I don't have a job so it wasn't something I could keep doing. I grabbed onto what resources I could though. I have a few coping mechanisms I use to keep myself going day by day. Some days I actually am pretty happy.

&amp;#x200B;

But I guess it being a new year has just made me reflect on how my life isn't really going anywhere. I'm going to be 31 soon which feels so old to me, but I feel like a failure who hasn't accomplished anything in life. I don't have any friends that I still talk to. I don't have anyone that I can open up to. There isn't anyone who understands me. My sister has some inklings of what I've been through, but I've never opened up to her completely. I just don't want her to see how broken I really am. She's such a busy person who works so hard. The last thing I'd want to do is ever bother her.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel so alone today. I wish I had someone I could share my pain with. I wish I had someone who would ask me what I've been up to. I wish I had someone who could see how much certain things excite me, and share that excitement with me. I wish I wasn't afraid of women. I wish when a woman was being nice to me and smiles, trying to be kind, that it didn't give me nightmares about the things I've been through.",lonely,I just want to express myself,2020-01-25 12:48:42

718,sprst1298,1579899815,1,"To start of, i was never an attractive guy, atleast i don't think so, but i have my way with words and have been considered a guy thats fun to be around with.  
  I was in a relationship with a girl since i was 16 (had a few flings before that) until 3 years ago, and we were great for a time, lived together, traveled, got engaged, planned out our whole life ahead of us. 

  Until, it turned out, that was all an illusion we fed to eachother because we were to afraid to break it off, long story short, a few months before moving to a different country and getting married, we broke it of. 

  After that, these 3 years have been an absolute downwards spiral for me. I am majorly depresed (not only caused by the breakup, funny enough, i think i am pretty much over that for quite some time now), and don't have a single thing in the world that makes me happy.  
I am now, almost pretty certain that i am a FA. 

  I cannot seem to find a partner. i think i met, like, a total of 20 people these past 3 years, i have no idea how people just ""meet and the rest is history""

My confidence is nonexistant, i hate myself, i can totally understand why no one would want me as a partner. I gained some depression weight and am now a 26yo uglyish guy, who also has some nice man boobs to back it up.  

I tried online dating, and man, does it suck balls for guys that arent super hot. It can be weeks until i get a single match. 
A few days ago, i matched with a girl and we spoke for hours, she seemed really interested, and i was so happy that i almost started believing there was a supernatural force that looked upon me....and then i got ghosted the next day, completely out of the blue.  

For three years, i had sex maybe 5 times with 2 girls i didn't find neither physically or mentaly attractive, and all of that was almost a year ago, and i was used to having sex about 4-5 times per week. 
I feel so insecure about myself that i cannot take my shirt off in front of a mirror, let alone someone else.  

I am sure that it's not 'bad luck' or something, and that i seriously lack the qualities that make me worth anyones time, let alone a person i would find attractive.  

I see myself becoming (or i already became), a sad pathetic troll who will never experience joy. These past few weeks i have been seriously crushing on my long time friend, or to be exact, my tattoo artist that i only see once every month or so, and sometimes gather the strenght to send some funny response to a ig story of hers or something, and i feel that my pathetic little brain is trying to imagine something happening between us just because she's friendly/polite, but i know she is and always will be wayyyyyy out of my league.  

I am obsessing over her while also knowing it will never happen, she's beautiful(like, seriously drop-dead gorgeous, and i'm sure she darn well knows that) while i'm a skinny fat retard who can't ever find a partner, let alone someone that out of his league.  

We agreed i will cook something for her next time we meet, and my brain is again trying to imagine her having some tiny amount of interest in me, but the truth is, i am sure she is being either polite or completely platonic. But a part of me still want to feel like i will not be FA, and it hurts when that realisation sinks in.

  I don't know what went wrong with me/my life, but it sucks knowing it will most probably never get better.

I got a huge promotion and a hefty payraise a week ago, and i still feel like an utter failure, i havent felt even a second of joy when it happened. All o feel is the terrible, consuming loneliness and self hatered.

I have no one else to really turn to.  I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I have no real friends, just people who are ‚Äúquasi‚Äù friends that I cannot turn to.  I‚Äôm almost 30, and I know comparison is the theft of joy but seeing people who I used to be friends with enjoying life on social media and even people I was never really friendly with living life really breaks my heart.  To be honest, I‚Äôm insanely jealous.

I have tried to do things with friends and I am almost always ignored or no one wants to do anything.  I have tried dating but seem to always get ghosted.  On top of that, I have major trust issues because of constantly being let down on top of being abused as a child.  

I was recently offered a position in October for a job I was trying to get for years.  This week, st the last second, the offer was rescinded.  I thought I‚Äôd get this job and that I‚Äôd move out, start going on more dates because I‚Äôd have money coming in and start trying to find new friends.  But here I am, unemployed, and I just want to go to sleep, which I will probably do.

The only people I have to go to are my parents.  My mom and I just got into an argument over everything because I went to her and she said that she‚Äôs been having physical and mental problems because of me and my problems.  the three of us constantly clash because I am constantly around the house due to my inability to get a job or maintain a friendship and have something to do.  Yet when I stay in my room too much they always criticize me when we fight about it.  

The truth is nothing brings me any pleasure either.  Even when I sleep I wake up often or have nightmares.  I am in treatment but nothing seems to work.  I wish someone would just put me out of my misery, since I won‚Äôt hurt myself.",lonely,I wish someone would put me out of my misery,2020-01-25 07:37:28
721,u141724,1579897759,1,"Hi, I'm sorry if this is going to be a long post, but I want to get the most out of it as possible.

I moved out of my parents' home this August to go study for my Master's degree in Amsterdam. So far I won't say that I'm doing that badly, I feel somewhat successful at university so I certainly can't complain about that. 

Last year I felt very excited about the move, I thought I could have a fresh start and finally get over all the social problems I had back in Rome, my hometown. Granted, I've never visited a therapist, so I don't know whether I have some kind of condition (I've always managed to cope with it so far, but most importantly it felt way too embarassing to ask my parents) or not. I also moved here with one of my dearest friends, though we unfortunately live 50 minutes far from each other, so I'm not able to spend as much time as I want with him. On the other hand, I also get the feeling that I'm losing my connection with my best friend, as she is still back in Rome and now we barely talk, except when, from time to time, one writes to the other, although we usually have a conversation which goes on for at most 30 minutes and then ends there. And this hurts me so much, as she has been the only person with which I've completely opened up in my entire life. 

But as the title says, I feel like it's impossible for me to express my feelings to another person. I've never been able to confess my love/feelings towards a person I might be interested in, and sometimes I'm not even able to express a liking towards some person when I'm talking with someone else (. I somewhat have been in a relationship with a girl for a year and a half, until the summer of 2 years ago, when I decided to fuck it all up because of a crush I got over this other girl I met in May. Since then, I continuously regret this decision, especially because I feel that she didn't deserve any of it and it was all my fault. I feel completely delusional about getting back with her, and from time to time I write her to check in on how she's doing, but I secretly wish of talking to her open-heartedly about what has happened, although I never manage to find the courage to do it (probably due to some fear of rejection). 

Moreover, she probably has been the only person who ever was interested in me (in some romantic way). I've always had self-esteem issues, ever since I was a child, and I've always found myself uninteresting to girls. I even tried online dating in these last months, but even there I've failed miserably. I feel so slow compared to my peers in this sense, and I can't seem to find a way out of this situation I'm in. I also feel like I have no one to share these feelings with, or at least to talk to when I feel miserable. 

I'm sorry if my post was all over the place, but I don't even know where to start when talking about my feelings or how I feel in general.",lonely,I feel unloved and unable to express my emotions,2020-01-25 07:29:19

724,The_Endless_Night,1579894950,1,"My life isn't easy. It never was. Sure, I know everyones' lives have ups and downs, is that right? So I have a question... Where is my ups? My life's going downhill since I was born, not even kidding. It never get better.And whenever it looked like it might, BOOM, another shitstorm. Mistakes of my parents haunts and hunts me. It ruined my childhood, and it's ruining me to this day. I can't blame them, really. I think it's some sort of family curse.

You see I was born as an optimist. You know, always looking at a bright side of life, cracking jokes whatever was happening. But life changed me.

Last few years was the worst. Every friday when I finally get home from college for the weekend, all I hear is bad news. Never something positive, just  bad news. And the best part? I. Can't. Do. Single. Shit. About. Anything. Because nothing depends on me. Handcuffed hands.

I used to think about future when I felt down. ""It'll get better. Focus on your school. Focus on your art. Focus on your career, your dreams, your desires. Focus on what you can accomplish in your life"" I was lying to myself. It won't get better, because of the nature of the problems. My art is heavily mediocre and easily replacable (doesn't mean I'll stop doing art. That's what saved me countless times), there is very little chance I can break through. There is also high chance I'll stay alone for long time.

Everything sucks here, everything sucks at school, everything sucks in my mind, everything sucks in my heart.

I am just lonely, depressed, self-hating piece of shit.

Can't talk about it with my family. Majority of them are involved, after all. My mum is depressed and broke inside, more than I am. Tried to talk to my brother, who is closest to me, but we have so different outlooks on life, our conversations and discussions lead to nowhere.

Can't talk to my friends. Are they, though? Majority of them don't give a single fuck about me. I am just good for them when they need something, when they need shoulder to cry on, or when  they have no one else around. Right, that one friend on bottom of everyones' list. It's a shame I realized their true nature so late.

I have few really good friends,  but they all have big problems of their own, and I don't want to bother them.

I know love could fix me. Yeah, right, everyones' have their own life goal, and I chose art, but I think love is the ultimate meaning of life, for various reasons. And I can't have it. I don't want to take to my messed up life another person I could love. Being with me means only problems, and you don't want my problems. It hurts. But I just can't.

So here I am again, sitting on my ass and crying like a little bitch, because this is the only time in a week I can freely cry.  I am once again looking through tears at this window in front of me, thinking of when I was one step away from actually doing you know what. It must be more than six years ago. I was looking down below, thinking if four-stories fall will kill me.

I don't want to. I try to be strong, for my  family. But I was for too long. I'm tired, so fcking tired. I just want the pain to stop. I wonder how many fridays will it take to do that second step.",lonely,This window,2020-01-25 06:42:30

It's also not fair to hold onto anger and treat people coldly without explanation in the name of your mental illness. I was only ever forgiving and patient and kind. And we agreed a long time ago to battle this shit together.

766,HungryAristocrat,1579844869,1,"Okay so Ill try not to make this too long but no promises. So after highschool I went off to University of pursue chemical engineering and as an introvert I had an extremely difficult time making friends, on top of that I am somewhat of a social out-cast so I felt like people just could not gravitate towards me for that reason. As passionate I was in biology, chemistry, and physics I realized I couldn't retain information as I use to be whenever I studied. It was weird I was reading the words and writing down the notes but nothing settled into my head. I ended up doing horribly in my courses, I was extremely depressed and lonely. The ironic part was as much as I liked being alone and to myself I still craved for friendship and a social life. Eventually my grades fell so low I got kicked out of my program and moved back to my hometown with my parents. The hard part is I share a room with my parents, my mom is an alcoholic and my dad well, he has no consideration that his daughter is trying to fall asleep while hes jacking off under the covers. 

When I came back home my family obviously didn't take the news well and I fell even more depressed now that I don't even have personal space at all, its a tiny apartment. My mom would get drunk every night and start hitting me and yelling at me and I would cry myself to sleep. Later the following fall season I went into a Computer Programming at a campus near my hometown and I really felt I found my muse. I was doing really well in school, but I started to face the same issue where i had a hard time making friends, I am pretty social I do talk but they sense the need to keep a distance from me unlike how they are with other people. Around the holidays while I was so close to wrapping up the semester with good grades my dad suddenly fell into a heart attack so severe his heart muscles were ruptured and blood started leaking into his lungs. The doctors said he was going to survive one day and another day it seemed as though it was hopeless. I emotionally shut down and struggled to get some of my major assignments done(which if you don't pass you essentially fail the entire course). I gave out a medical note to all my professors but for one assignment I was in a group for I was doing all the work which really annoyed me especially when they knew the situation I was in. I only failed on course because the professor only gave me a 2 day extension on the assignment which was extremely time consuming so the 2 days extension did nothing for me.  

So at the moment I am catching up on school but the problem is I'm craving for this happy place a place I can just go to to just escape my drunk mom telling me how useless I am. We're still living in a two bedroom tiny apartment where I share a room with my parents (my brother has the other room). I want privacy where I can work in silence without public. I am currently working and going to school but my area and surrounding areas are becoming extremely expensive to live in and moving out on my own would be impossible for me at the moment in terms of my financial situation. My mom is on welfare because she has to watch over my grandmother (who has dementia) 24/7 and my dad claimed to have not recovered from the heart attack even thought it's been a year.

Well, I believe them now. A few days ago I realized that because of my childhood, I'm not going anywhere. I'll try to explain: So as a kid, I always was in the gifted and talented, and basically came to expect life to be easy. Well now I've grown, and now I know that life is not easy, and that I am not smart as I thought I was. This has caused me to become really lazy and childish, since childhood was the only time in my life that I have been truly happy. ""But what does this have to do with dying inside?"", you may ask. Well, a few days ago I got in a lot of trouble for my brothers being little shits and leaving video games out, and my dad in his anger destroyed my favorite video game. And you know what? I didn't care. I am just so dead inside that it means nothing. It made my realize that I have no future, because of my lazy and childish ways. On top of this, my dad has been extremely strict my entire life, so it gave me the idea that I should just shut up and not talk. And now, I can't talk to girls. So guess what? Any dreams of being smart, successful and happy are gone. And that day I realized that I'm just a lonely, sad, stupid, unattractive kid who has no fucking future.

I just lost myself in some lucid dream. I was in a nice house, and some pretty girl came and curled into my side, grabbed my hand, smiled at me, and we just sat there talking about the things that have been bothering me lately. 

Once I realized what was happening, I made myself stay asleep just because it felt so nice to be someone else with someone that loved me. I knew who I was, but it's like that part of me was on a back burner. For however long the dream lasted, I felt important, and wanted, and loved. Like a man. Like I mattered.

Then I woke up.

For a second there was this warm feeling. I had been aware of my dream state, but I still tricked myself into thinking she'd be there beside me. Only for a split second. That's when reality hit me. I was back in my empty bed, in my empty apartment, in my empty life, and I realized who I was, and what my life consisted of. 

This was five minutes ago. Part of me is mourning the loss of someone who never existed. Someone whose face is slowly starting to disappear from memory, and whose influence with be meaningless in five more minutes.

I feel a special kind of loneliness right now, and I think I'm gonna head to the kitchen and have a drink or two.

805,repelsteel1,1579822703,1,"So. First of all, hey you! Never been on this lonely thing before.. after a lot of clicking came here and just wanted to say some words to you! I have been lonely in the past. Now i love life. U can do this too. 

You are not lonely. 

There are literally billions of people on this planet. 

So why are you lonely and what to do. 

The reason you are lonely, is because you separate yourself from others. Probably from early life or after some event. You did just not feel connected to the world anymore and did not know how or what to do about it. This grew and after a lot of years you literally trained yourself to this feeling. The feeling of being separated. Like everything in life, we master things trough repetition. You repeated this ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô so much that it became the standard go to in life, which is unfortunate. I believe everybody can feel joy, passion, life and gratefullness and that trough these new learned feelings the lonelyness wil evaporate. Slowly. Yes, some work needs to be done. A lot of work needs to be done. I know... your not used to working on yourself, but it will helpfull to your life as it did for mine. 

So. Stand up for yourself. Dont accept that feeling anymore. Know that deep inside there is a joyfull person. Someone that sometimes whispers these wonderful thoughts but never gets trough. Listen to this. Think these thoughts. You can come trough whatever you are going trough right now! Believe me. You can. 

Start off by doing something uncomfortable. Right now reading this. Go sit in a comfortable position and just try to smile for 60 seconds. Just do it and you will feel something change. Do it!

Try to speak to someone. Is it not trough this forum then go to a supermarket, train yourself in this! 

Stop masturbation. The feeling you get after cumming is so fucked up that it destroys your good emotions. Your brain will thank you for this, and good things start happening after two weeks! Just fucking try it. What is two weeks in a lifetime? 

Do some sports! It will give your brain nutrients and you can meet people..

They're all now doing couples things by themselves, it doing double dates and if I came along I'd just be third/fifth Wheeling. So now I've created this loneliness once again, which was why I first started making friends and creating friends groups. I yearn to be around people, but I've also created unfulfillment at my expense so that my friends can be fulfilled. And I'm happy for them, but no one really checks up on me.

I just feel I will never be able to make actual friends now that I'm working, its just extremely difficult. For example today I saw this guy around my age in front of me going home, have seen him around sometimes but work in very large company so its very hit and miss. Anyway I wanted to approach him and say hi but was concerned it would make him feel strange, as I was deciding within 30 seconds he had put his headphones on and that was that.

847,NNAPSTERR,1579799533,1,"I have everything, a loving and well off family, a good business (my father's), some friends and everything that i can dream of. My life is actually perfect but i am not happy. I got a big TV, a top of the line gaming PC and anything that i can ask of them.

Moreover my father has literally been forcing me to go out on a solo trip to any country I want (I am from India btw where the average income of a person is about $4000/year). 

I just never seem to be happy. My friends are not interested in talking to me, i am very insecure and need someone to talk to, just to get the burden of everything that's happening to me off my shoulders but the last time i talked to by best friend about me obsessing about my cousin i felt great relief and i had never felt better. It happens everytime i talk to her, i just feel happy even if it's just a 1 minute talk. But she isn't interested in talking to me. She sees my messages after 3-4 days, doesnt ever call, 80% of the time she doesnt pick my call but when she does she's like, I was sleeping, busy etc. But the thing is that it's been 10 months since we graduated and she isn't working, she's just at her home preparing for post graduate exam.

I just dont find happiness in anything now, i cannot even type anymore. My cousins (we live in the same house) make fun of me about the paintings that i have been trying to make for example, i made a painting of a cloud (absolutely beginner stuff and wasnt even good) but i was hella proud so showed that to her and she was very happy to see me doing painting) but after a few days we all were joking on the dinner table and she said "" the most expensive painting ever made was by me the painting of nothing but clouds"" and my other cousin started saying ""i have spent lavishly on everything, seeing towards my art supplies, my TV and my gaming PC although i am working at my family business and earnign every penny of it and spending them as i see fit). It just broke me.

I cannot make up my mind as to if my cousins are evil or i am or i am the one who's stupid/retarded/idiot because i manage to stray away my friends and make everyone not like me.

i am just tired. tired of everything. i want to die but i dont want to kill myself because my parents have already gone through a rough patch of their life and twice been clinically depressed so if i die/kill myself, they will just break into a million pieces. 

I dont know what to do. I am 21 and going to turn 22 in 2 months. 

i am now preparing for my MBA so that i can leave my hometown behind, get into an IIM (one of India's premier B-schools), get a job and maybe then i'll be happy or atleast, not sad.

I know for certain that i wont be getting a partner, because the only person that actually knows me is ME. I know what type of a person i am and why I should stay alone. 

I am just trying to bide my time till I am dead or my parents die so that i can take my own life.

Sorry this is all so messy and sounds stupid and it kind of does but i feel a bit better after writing my heart out. 

I cannot go to a therapist because they are very expensive here in my city and moreover dont know shit. they're just trying to make money off people.

 I'll try living in the moment at any particular moment of simply doing what is want. Be me. Good, bad, ugly, indifferent and practice acceptance.

I'm short, not even average short, I'm like , 411. 
 I'm old. I'm weird. 
Never had I faced being myself without being pessimistic.  
Or pity. Or trying to compensate because of said things. 

 I'm just so, so mentally, physically,  &amp; &amp; emtionallyel exhausted with my tunnel own  vision of loneliness!!! UGH!!!

  If that makes any sense at all.
My visual example:
Let's not close the door of the room per say to that part of me crying and depressed about as I cringe  in a corner, let's just leave the door open, but, the rest of me exit the whole apartment and go find something that will soothe that part of me. Or go to a movie. 
Or bring her back some chocolate. 
Let's allow her to cry it all out. Feel that way, yet not lie to her about  how ""the right one will coming along &amp; find her.""
Huh? Huh?

I'm not getting this out right. There are some Scholars &amp; Word Smiths in this community that can convey this better than me. 

Anyway, I'm going to be me unapologetically and get to know me. I'm choosing to not look for nor search for companionship. 
 Just go unbothered by other's opinions,  they're like butts, everyone has one. Some are insignificant, some are major. 
It's not yours so who cares?!?

I read through this subreddit EVERYDAY &amp; it's so, so very heartbreaking, the posts here. From 12 years of age to 60! 

I can't anymore!

 I wanted someone to love me but who the fuck am I?

851,never-mind-la,1579797059,1,"1. Haven‚Äôt realised yet - when you‚Äôre slowly drifting apart from friends and family, but in your minds it‚Äôs just you ‚Äútaking a break‚Äù or needing to recharge. You don‚Äôt realise that there‚Äôs a distance forming between formerly close peers, only realising later on. Or perhaps you notice this distance, and you don‚Äôt mind it. 

2, Denial - you deny feeling lonely, and try to be strong and Hold things up around you. Maybe holding onto the single close friend you have. But you‚Äôre constantly in denial. You‚Äôre feeling greater than you ever have! Lonely? No! You like spending all this time by yourself! 

3. Distraction - in an attempt to keep your mind off things, you distract yourself with entertainment, binge watching Netflix and scrolling mindlessly on social media to see what everyone‚Äôs up to in their Exciting lives. You burrow yourself in work, telling yourself that you are grateful to have all this free time. Perhaps your work improves, you become more hardworking, or the opposite. Eventually, you forget to take care of yourself and productivity may decrease. 

4. Defensiveness - your pent up and shielded emotions of loneliness creates a protective barrier around you. You don‚Äôt need friends, you tell yourself. In an attempt to not get hurt by people, or to avoid rejection, you isolate yourself even more and become defensive even when there is no real threat. You may lash out at the people who you still have, and are quick to attack other people so they cannot attack you first. In this period, you will most definitely feel miserable. 

5. Realisation - perhaps you finally acknowledge the extent of how lonely you feel. It has probably been a while now, but you realise you are lying when telling yourself that you can cope and live like this. This hits you really hard. 

6. Regret - accompanied by gloom and doom. you think back on all the times you weren‚Äôt as lonely, had friends, and regret all the decisions you made. This is the time when you remember embarrassing things you did years ago, and wonder how different your situation may have been if you made different decisions. You start to blame yourself or the people around you for the state you are in, and spend your days in fantasy of what could have been. 

7. Slow acceptance- you begin to embrace this part of you, but the desire for your situation to change doesn‚Äôt decrease. You still long for friendships, relationships and strong human bonds, but hope may be clouded with pessimism and grudging acceptance of your circumstances. Here you may start to become lazy and feel hopeless, hence accepting that things may never change for you. Perhaps you are optimistic for the future and wanting change, or you future could be so dark you can‚Äôt even see it. General numbness ensues, and at this point you don‚Äôt even know anymore. 

8: complex ending Somewhere during these stages you may meet someone and form meaningful friendships that break the chain of lonely, or you may have gotten your hopes up only to be let down over and over again. Hope chips away from you, as does your sense of sel-worth and confidence. You may have given up if not for the final breakthrough: the one where people start wanting to meet up again. They want to talk to you, hang out. You feel validated and loved, and a strong bond is created. You never knew how much you needed it until you got it, and you never knew how lonely you were until you weren‚Äôt anymore. 

Perhaps this doesn‚Äôt happen to everyone.

When I was out I asked for help from the rest of my family. I asked everyone. Some I felt were my best friends growing up. No one got back to me. It's been a week, and when she said I could ""come back"" I did since I had nowhere to go. It's not a good situation, but it's better than being a bum, which is never fun. Most of my family is kind of scared of my mom, since she's just like this and everyone deals with it. What really hurt is no one got back to me. They could have at least said no. I just came back to my home state and the whole time I was gone they said they would be there for me when if I come back.

It's not just my family either. I don't have any actual friends, maybe a few people I have online but I don't think they see me as a friend at all.

856,ForgottenTheOne,1579795161,1,"Hello,

I'm really sorry but I need to vent. It grew to quite a long story, so I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom.

I'm going to uni and currently live with a good friend of mine (we're both heterosexual males, just to clarify). We've known each other for 3-4 years now, we worked together at the same place (those were good times, had many good friends, we met often and I felt included - this bit is important) before starting uni together. 

After starting uni our group disbanded and kind of lost contact - everyone went to a different place in the country. So it's only me and that friend. He always was a social beast, fun to be around, confident. In the meantime I changed a ton from that guy who could do anything, to the ""helpful nerd"", studying and worrying about passing each exam and helping people with their homeworks. I never asked anything in return. I was alright with it, but I seriously started missing ""the group"".

Because of the amount of time I spent on studying my social and financial side (I'm not working currently, my parents are paying for the flat) took a huge hit instead. I went to few parties and I didn't meet with people often.

After my first year I got into a relationship with one of my old colleagues. She was great, but I had really little money and she wanted to go out all the time, eat at fancy places and was acting like a gold-digger. My friend told me to talk with her - and the whole situation ended with a break-up. That had happened a month before my next semester started (5-6 months ago). I got impacted by it really much. I forced myself to act tough. I didn't really have anyone to truly vent to (since the old group was gone, and I felt ashamed to vent to someone I see every day). I buried my emotions deep, hoping that with another semester coming up I'd be busy and forget about everything.

Obviously I didn't. My mental condition is in shambles and I've never felt lonelier since middle school. I still have ""attacks"" where I am so sad, that I just have to cry. I started to daydream and I cut away from everyone, just put on another mask that said ""everything is fine, thanks"". I didn't help others as much anymore and I developed a crush on one of my classmates (big mistake), but I don't talk to her much anyway, and I don't plan on making a move, because I'm almost certain she's not interested. Nobody is interested.

That's how I got to yesterday - I reached out to my crush and asked her if she needs answers for an upcoming test. She responded with ""I have them already, wanted to send them your way, but forgot, sorry"". Today I asked my friend where he is going and he said ""It's \[classmate\]'s birthday. We got our invites before Christmas. Are you not invited?"". Now I'm sitting in my room, tears in my eyes and listening to my friend get ready for a birthday party of one of my friends/classmates (who is a friend of my crush by the way). Everyone will be there and I didn't even get an invitation. Today is the day I realized that for more than a year I was thinking I had new friends, but I didn't matter to those people. Nobody asked me how I'm doing, nobody noticed that I'm at an all time low in the past 5 months. Nobody at all asked me ""You weren't like that before, what happened?"". They don't care and didn't care about me in the first place. They just cared about my answers, homework, notes and when I had to drive them from one campus to the other.

I even made a list of people that I'm sure care about me: my mom, dad, sister and an old female friend, that's very busy recently.

I thought that I reached rock bottom couple weeks ago, but it seems I wasn't even halfway there back then.

Tl;dr:

I was a helpful nerd, then I broke up with my then-new girlfriend, got really depressed and cut away from everyone.

Whereas I struggle to make friends she always seems to have someone reach out for her, even during her dark days. Last night she was feeling depressed, so she asked a close friend if she could crash on his couch and he actually allowed her to stop the night.

I always wondered what it must be like to have friends who reach out to you, who message you first and are actually happy to be talking to you. I asked her the other day out of curiousity if she ever gets messaged first, and she always had. She never had to be the only one to make an effort, they've always bothered speaking to her... and it just blows my mind...

887,-david-smith-,1579777071,1,"Around 3 months ago I walked out of a marriage that had been loveless for many years. It was an amicable split. She was my only real friend but she had no feeling towards me other than as a friend so I moved into a place of my own and get to see the kids regularly. 

During this time I had met a girl online. I had been depressed to the point I wanted to end it all and she reached out, helped me through a difficult time and we fell in love. We talked of closing our 4000 mile gap and being together. If it wasn't for her I have no idea how I would have got through.

2 days ago I discovered she was stringing me along and had been seeing someone else for over 2 months. I have no other friends I can talk to.

The last 2 days I have been a wreck. I can't eat or sleep. I'm constantly trying not to cry at my desk at work and I'm back in that dark place, contemplating taking the easy way out.

I keep trying to tell myself I can get through this. I try to convince myself I'll find someone else but it just doesn't seen fair to burden a new partner with my emotional state right now.

I wish I could be happy with being alone but it's becoming clear my problems are all caused by the fact i need someone in my life who I can love and who loves me.

To top it all off i'm totally broke. I'm working but i'm paying rent, bills &amp; tax on top of mortgage payment to keep a roof over my kids heads. I'm keeping myself alive but that's about it. I couldn't afford to take a new partner out if I wanted to. Who in their right mind is going to want to date a broke ass, middle aged, emotionally damaged  MF.

888,SuziStriker,1579776309,1,"Today didn't start great. My headphones snapped in two randomly while listening to music. A tree branch fell on my head while waiting for the bus. I accidentally overestimated how much time I had so I got to the place I was going an hour early, waiting in the rain, so that wasn't fun.

But that's not the main part of the story.

I attend a youth group of sorts, a weekly meet up of a collection of people aged around high school age to early adulthood. It's mostly LGBT+ folk, so it is (or at least was) a good place for me to connect with more people like me.

Let's meet our cast:

* D: probably the person I chill with the most there. We share a lot of similar interests.

* R: another person I know decently well there.

* V: Another individual there. Little sense of boundaries.

* S: a genuinely nice girl.

So, I should preface this by saying that I'm an obviously lonely person, mainly in the romantic sense. Because of my transness, I find it quite difficult to put myself out there romantically. This makes me come off on occasion as... somewhat desperate. The last sort of relationship I was in was an online one with someone in America, and being Australian I found it very difficult to keep up.

When I first started going there, it came to my attention very quickly that people were very touchy-feely there. Naturally, being lonely and desperate, I loved it at first. The person who would actively ""go for me"" as it were was V. At first, it was tame enough. Hugging and the such, but it quickly escalated to borderline sexual harrassment. Honestly? I kinda loved it. It made me feel wanted.

When S started showing up, I thought she was dating R, but turns out that wasn't a thing. So today I decided to finally put myself out there and mildly flirted with her a bit. A compliment here, a touch there, nothing major or serious, and she was enjoying it. That's when D and R came in, basically making fun of me for how ""desperate"" I was. I first played it off as friends joking together, but the more they did it, the less funny it was. Then D decided to tease me more throughout the day, and started being more affectionate towards S, who seemed okay with it. I'm not a jealous person, and nobody is anyone's property, but it made me mad because D made sure I knew they were doing it just to tease me.

Despite the teasing, at the end of the day I still decided to ask S out. She said, paraphrasing, ""yes, as friends."" That kinda broke me a little bit, but oh well, I've delt with rejection a lot, it's nothing to me anymore. At some point, however, a realisation hit me. The touching, the feeling, the affection. None of it was going to go anywhere. It was all... fake, in a sense. To me at least. This came to a tipping point where before we all went home, R came in and decided to domme me. Like, calling me ""good girl"" and holding my chin and all that. They knew this kind of thing appealed to me, but I knew it was fake, and it wasn't going to go anywhere (R had already expressed disinterest in me). So I finally told someone to stop. R, thankfully, did, and apologised, not realising how much it was affecting me.

All of this, however, just sent me off the edge. My ex cheated on me, it's one of the reasons we broke up, which already put me in a fragile spot when it came to physical affection (my main way of expressing emotion and feeling). Now, with all of that, it just of hit me that the affection people show me is fake. None of it is real. None of it was going to go anywhere, and even if it did, there was a veil of falsehood behind it. Is that shitty and presumptuous of me? Of course it is. Frankly, though, I can't care less. I can't take these chances anymore. I can't have my heart and mind played with like this.

And that, my friends, is how I gained a crippling fear of physical interaction. What was once my ""love language"" is now just a reminder of how shitty people can be.

I don't generally share my feelings as I am more a person that keeps things to themselves. Back when I was 21 I had a massive crush on this girl in college, there was something about her. Her beauty, her hair, her looks, her voice, her femininity just weaken my soul. We had a few conversations here and there but nothing seriously took off. I was so weak and so unmanly back in those days that I had no chance to take things off. I kept having these weird crushes about her that I could not get off my mind for several months to a year, it slowly disappeared. 

Fast forward 5 years later she pops into my mind. I dreamt that I randomly saw her from a distance she ran up to me and we made out together whispering saying how much she missed me. I was the most happiest person in my dream. I suddenly awoken from my dream with this weird emptiness feeling but at the sometime blissful. I can't explain it but it felt like my mind was in a state of nirvana then it all suddenly came crushing down that if I don't change and make the courage to go out and meet strangers in the real world I will forever be alone. 

Strangely enough when I was 14, one of my teachers said to me what my dreams are ? I simply replied to find a partner and have a happy family. Through out then I always had dreams with various girls that I have never seen in real life with imaginary kids of my own, it's not enough to remember clearly but just flash moments then it's all over.

He always wanted me around, but he didn‚Äôt really like physical contact to much. He would tell me I was unattractive because of how ‚Äúfat‚Äù I am. He would put me down. And demand things from me all the time. I took care of him. I stopped all contact with friends and even family for him, till it was just us. He never worked, I cared for him, took care of all the bills. I cooked, I cleaned. I did everything. He never appreciated me, he never seemed thankful for me. I loved him so much though... things would get physical and he would hurt me, choke me, push me down, when he started to threaten to kill me, I left. I called the police and got my stuff and left.

946,Keiono12,1579730341,1,"Hello, I consider myself to be quite a loner. I have friends and I am very close with my roommate, but still I have a hard time talking to them a lot of the time unless I am on drugs, whether it be because I am afraid to talk to them or I am just unable to due to external stress.

Something I am very embarrassed about is how badly I have wanted to have a girlfriend for most of my life (since like 3rd grade, I am a sophomore in college now) I have never had any friends that are girls and no girl has ever seemed to like me. If they do it is for nothing more than sex, I am just unable to communicate properly I guess I really don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been told I give off bad vibes, but I think that was a product of my anger. And also you may say that it is good that girls are attracted to me, but that doesn‚Äôt matter that much to me anymore. I want someone who makes me feel good and sex is only a physical pleasure (not even for me because I am never really comfortable enough around anyone to enjoy sex)

I used to be sad, then I was angry, now I am tired of feeling these things over something so stupid as a girl (girls aren‚Äôt stupid, just the desire to talk to one is) I met a girl at a party on a little over a month ago and she actually seemed really into me (long story short she wasn‚Äôt and probably just wanted to have sex) but she was making plans and stuff and touching me and all that sort of thing.  Everyone including her own friends were saying that she really liked me. After this I just decided I am done with girls, I am already extremely stressed about school and more important things, yet I still put importance on finding a girl.

I don‚Äôt want to get too deep into detail on the mental gymnastics I play and how I feel about love and what I want out of a relationship because honestly it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore.

My goal is to become a researcher so I have a ton of work ahead of me. I am already stressed as it is, I focus on my work, but sometimes I think about a girl I want to try to talk to, or I think about the girl that I recently met who didn‚Äôt like me the way I liked her (this stung very badly). I dedicate hours every day to school work so I don‚Äôt even think a relationship would be good for me, but I just want to know what it is like to have a person that you like like you back. It is just so elusive, I don‚Äôt value having a ton of friends, I just want strong bonds and I have wanted this bond for so long. 

How do I erase this from my mind. It seems like it is human nature to want a relationship, but I honestly have admitted defeat. Usually I just think that I am overreacting, but to be honest I don‚Äôt think that I will ever meet a new person again and be able to communicate with them. 

From the moment I wake up to the moment I can finally smoke weed after finishing my work I feel like absolute shit. I am a stressed out mess. I try to forget about girls, but then I‚Äôll see a cute girl and just think ‚Äúdamn I wonder if there‚Äôs someone out there for me‚Äù 

I am sorry if this is a stupid post. My mind is sort of scrambled right now and I am having a hard time truly expressing how I feel here.

I just want to know, are my thoughts normal? Is it normal to want to be in a relationship? I know that it is something that has to be natural I would never want to force my way into someone‚Äôs life, I just want a mutual connection so badly. I feel like this has to be normal. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt know how to get these thoughts out of my head. Sometimes when I‚Äôm really into my school work I can, or if I feel good about how I did in a class I may get a half an hour of relief, but still I know I have some deep seeded problems. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt want this to torture me my whole life.

How can I just forget about girls? I know I will never be able to be myself around them and to be honest I am not sure if they would even want to be around me. 

I honestly would be open to messages if anyone wants, because I can expand a lot more there and I would be more than happy to talk to you about how you feel as well (you could even just talk to me about how you feel tbh and your struggles) Talking these things out helps so damn much and I will really really appreciate any comments or messages.

That when their folks or older people in their lives talked about making friends it seemed more of a casual, normal thing to say they walked up to someone and starting to be interested in them (within reason), but when you yourself have tried the same thing, your peers just act all awkward and weirded out?

I can‚Äôt connect with anyone. I find a problem with every single person I meet and I just ruin everything I touch.

But he tends to act just like her in every shape or form. I'm mentally exhausted and I have mental issues like bipolar, major Depression, intermediate explosive disorder. I really wanted to end my life at some point and the state gave me a form stating I was mentally ill and I can't perform certain tasks. It's hard for me to get a job since I can barely see and comprehend situations. But they only need me to work so as they say ""you need to make me my money"" just so I can pay their bills and help them get financially stable while they tend to make me feel like I'm worthless. The sibling I'm staying with now has not had the best relationship with me so he burnt bridges with people I knew before I came back into his life so now I'm basically alone. I cry almost every night because I feel like I won't amount to anything and getting fired from Whataburger has made my family upset with me. They are threatening to kick me out by next month, so I think I'd be better off in the woods or isolated. I never feel safe here, whenever he wants to have a sit-down with me it gets physical. But I have no where to go and I only have 2 pairs of clothes to my name and 20$. He won't help me get my FAFSA so I can attend college, nor can I be drafted into the military because of my mental health. Anything can cheer me up at this point. It takes alot out of me to be suicidal, but at this rate. I feel like that's what they want, and I don't want to feed in. I'm done letting everyone get the best of me.

Okay, so basically I'm a 22 year old (F) that often gets mistaken for a high schooler. This is nothing new, I've always just looked younger than I am. I never had an issue with it, because I'm determined to dress however I want and not wear much make-up (because I really don't want to). So when it comes up, my family just laughs and we joke about it. My family even has a joke where they say I'm 4 years old, because, I guess, of my mannerisms (and my smell, they say) but I SWEAR I'm not doing it on purpose.

Obviously, like anyone in their 20s, I really wanna date. Back in high school and college, that wasn't a big problem for me. Boys liked me back.

I'm saying this as a reminder to myself: you've ruined all contacts, not because there's something wrong with you, that isn't the reason at all. You're just not letting your attention divert from how you must have something wrong, and it sucks out all the ability to listen to what they have to say. Shutting down conversations then wishing to have it back, it's just you realising that you were too distracted by your dumbass problems, to care.

977,httphongbin,1579685988,1,"Hi, I would like to introduce myself before we begin. I am an INTP female, around the age of 16-17. I usually don't care about anything and I usually do not feel anything much for things that I should care about. This also means that my approach to life is quite nihilistic. Before you talk about the bright sides of stuff, please keep in mind I have already thought about it so I would not want to hear it again. I also would much prefer practical, logical or harsh advice as I am stubborn af. (It's not that I have only thought of one thing and decided to stick with it, I have thought of many possibilities and things, and have chosen one notion to stick with.) 

So I would like to introduce you to my friend, whom I shall name as Onion. I met her in year 7 and we have been friends for quite a long time. When I first met her, she was very awkward and shy, usually not saying much. I was quite shy myself but I did not feel the need to say much. Accompanied with my rbf and dry sense of humour, it could be easy to misinterpret me as a cold-hearted person. Anyway, as the days passed, I found her to be a compulsive liar. Always making excuses or lying to sound interesting. I put it off but my friends at that time (we don't talk now) were talking about it too and I started talking about the things Onion did as well. (I couldn't tell her otherwise she would deny it and make up excuses again). This continued until year 8 I think, or so I thought. One day in year 9, I called her up and apologised to her for talking shit about her. Now that I realise what she's done, I wasn't really talking shit about her, I was just frustrated and just wanted to vent to someone who could listen. 

Anyway, we became good friends again and this year, something happened that made me realise that she hasn't changed at all. I was in denial for the past two years whenever she exhibited toxic traits. I denied it and I told myself that she probably didn't mean any harm or that it was just a mistake. But after discussing her behaviour to my closest friend, she told me she was being toxic. I am very insecure so I always believe I'm toxic, even though in my sane, logical brain, I know I haven't done anything wrong. So whenever she did something toxic, I just blamed myself and said I probably deserved it. 

But I'm just so frustrated and sad (not upset, just sad). I just want to be good friends with her but the way she treats me, it leaves me feeling so worthless. 

She has her good traits, such as being quirky, loyal and a considerate friend, but now, I can't tell if they're for show or not. I do even friggin know who she is anymore. (Bit of an exaggeration but I'm just so confused.)

So I shall start by listing out the things she has done that made me question my sanity. We had lots of fights or arguments back then because she always wanted to be in charge or wanted her way. I learnt in year 9 to just nod and smile whenever she talked and I avoided any types of disagreements with her because when she got mad, she just ignored people, and hold a grudge, even if she said she was fine a week later. I know when I get mad, I just isolate myself, get over it the next day and forget about it asap. (This is also a bad trait of mine as I would forget the ones who have done me wrong or hurt me constantly.) 

My mum took her overseas with us twice, so that shows how close we are. However, I feel like she's using me sometimes. Every time we go out to eat or something, I'm always paying, whether I want to or not. She sneaks in a ""can you pay for us together"" and then never does. She never returns the money she has owed. I used to have to chase her around to pay me back, and I just gave up because the process was tedious as hell. (I probably shouldn't have given up. But I just feel so scared if I make her mad. Hi I am a doormat. I just don't stand up for myself and I just usually tolerate any sort of teasing or bullying.) 

Another thing is, I made a discord server and added her in with my guy friends. She started dming all the guys and trying to be friends with them. I found out from one of the guys that he knew something I knew I didn't tell him and that's when I caught on she was doing shit behind my back. I shaded her in a convo (I said ""It's okay Onion, I would never send anything behind anyone's back, so don't worry) and she got really defensive. She started gaslighting me and attacking me and saying ""OMG I WAS IN A GOOD MOOD TODAY, YOU JUST DECIDED TO RUIN IT FOR ME"". I know I shouldn't have shaded her like that but I was frustrated at that point. She did it once in the past and she did it again. (**) Anyway, I wasn't even talking about her, I was just replying to her and she knew straight up she did something wrong (since she got so defensive about it). Another annoying thing she does is send ugly photos of me to the guys (or of others), and only send good photos of her (she's really pretty btw). Another bad trait of hers is that she is desperate for any guy attention, and she is willing to go to any lengths for it. 

**I told her about one of my family ""secrets"" (I would like to describe as) and when I was sick one day and away from school, she used it as a convo starter or to look interesting because she had nothing to talk about. (My friend told me about it so I was l really hurt). Like BRENDA, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GAIN FROM TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT MY FAMILY'S PROBLEMS? CLOUT? (Okay I should not be joking but hehe.) 

Look I know I have my flaws too. I am really forgetful and sometimes come across as cold or insensitive. I can't carry out conversations with some people and I just don't talk unless I'm spoken to. But I don't mean any harm. I have pure intentions (besides my sadistic desires uwu) and I would never judge someone and measure their worth with my standards. 

I also am aware that sometimes my stoic face can be misleading as I don't display any emotion. p+People think therefore I have no emotions. But anyone. ANYONE. With a fucking common sense would know that if you sent ugly photos of someone behind their back, or teased them so hard it crossed over the line, it would hurt anyone. So why do you think I would be fine with it? You wouldn't be fine if I did what you did to me, so why would you treat me like this? Is it because I look like I don't ""care""?

My other friend tells me that she's fine and she's a great person. And my friend who has been in a similar situation as me tell me to leave her BUT I CAN'T. WHY WOULD I SUDDENLY LEAVE HER??? My other friend tells me she's toxic and that I should just keep it lowkey now. I should probably try harder to talk to her about it but I just can't be bothered again. I am bothered by it but I also can't be bothered.

Not to get too personal, but I've only loved someone once

Is there something not adding up?

Has a childhood dream of true love ruined my perception of relationships in general?

Maybe I'm too naive, after all I'm not even 19

I try to believe any sort of relationship that's meaningful doesn't come from lust. However, all that seems to be a baseless assumption

I couldn't tell you if that's true, I haven't had any experience

I would tell friends, possibly family, if I could about these feelings, I just don't think they'd understand

How ridiculous is that, I couldn't conceive telling anyone else this, yet I'd like to believe someone online has the answer to these questions

On a side note, this is a page about loneliness, so much love to everyone on these pages

I couldn't speak from experience, but in reality, you shouldn't fall under the idea that you're completely alone

I try to commit to this facade yearly only to realize it's false

Friends and family go hand in hand, and if they really are just that, they'd never want to you feel that way

Once again, I'm naive, so I wouldn't take what I'm saying at face value. Just know, the world's your oyster. Fuck expectations and beliefs, whatever makes you feel good should never be out of the question

989,IrisTheTranny,1579672190,1,"New to this sub, so sorry if I'm not using it right, I'm just so lonely.

I don't know what's wrong with me.

I'm so sick of it.

I'm so sick of being alone, I'm so sick of having nobody to talk to.

I've been like this for my entire life

A lot of my teachers before I graduated said they thought I was autistic, whether I am or not I certainly acted like it.

And I started hallucinating and became delusional at around 8, so that effected my behavior to the point nobody ever wanted to talk to me. 

These last few years I've gotten a few people I talked to, let me just list how that ended.

2 friend killed themselves

I think 1 person actually got killed

3 Bad Relationships ending in a breakup.

4 people just vanished from the entire internet

3ish people I stopped talking to because they acted like they didn't want to talk to me at all

And like 80 fucking people SAID that we could talk online and then just completely abandon me. Multiple of those people literally promised me they wouldn't do that.

My Reddit PM history is literally a gigantic row of ""are you there?"" 

And that's not even counting all of the people who were just looking to fuck me then ghost me afterwards.

I don't understand. 

I like to help people... I'm always willing to talk when somebody needs to vent, it used to be all I did all day, just listen to people vent. 

And all of them would only ever talk to me when they wanted to vent, then abandon me. 

I really honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong, I can't tell if I'm too strange or aggressive, I always try to be nice, even if I'm a super aggressive person its never towards the person I'm talking to, like never. 

All my exes said I was crazy...  I never yelled at any of them, I've never hurt any of them, none of my aggression has ever been targeted at them, but I'm still too fucking crazy I guess

Though that's different. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, it's not like I'm boring, nobody has ever called me that outside of when I was too sedated to show emotion, I just don't fucking know what I'm doing wrong.

Some people say I'm super nice and kind, but those people only ever just vent to me and then leave. 

I should clarify I have no anger towards anyone whose vented to me, I was helping them, they have no obligation to be my friend when I told them I'd help them, they didn't use me, I agreed to help.

And I'm still always willing to listen, but it just hurts when that's my only social interactions.

I just want to have a conversation...

I just want to talk to someone....

The longest friendship I've ever had ended earlier this year,  and I still do not know why, in all seriousness he treated me like shit a lot of the time, but I was still his friend anyways, I knew he was in pain and I was so scared of being alone I never held anything he did against me, but then he just, abandon me, threw me away, like everyone else.

Nobody cares about me, I'm so tired. I'm so sick of being used and I'm so sick of being abandon.

I don't really date anymore since it's only caused me mental anguish. The thing about me is that I seem to attract a lot of girls. I do consider myself a handsome guy but this is like having a super power to attract girls but never really getting to take advantage of it. 

Everytime I try to meet a girl I always mess it up somehow. This time it only took a week. She used to come up and say hi to me. She would offer food/snacks to me and wouldn't take no for an answer. Always smiling at me. So I decided to talk to her. Turns out shes about my age and has a daughter the same age. I guess she realized that I wasn't what she expected or something I'm not really sure.

I just lost myself in some lucid dream. I was in a nice house, and some pretty girl came and curled into my side, grabbed my hand, smiled at me, and we just sat there talking about the things that have been bothering me lately. 

Once I realized what was happening, I made myself stay asleep just because it felt so nice to be someone else with someone that loved me. I knew who I was, but it's like that part of me was on a back burner. For however long the dream lasted, I felt important, and wanted, and loved. Like a man. Like I mattered.

Then I woke up.

For a second there was this warm feeling. I had been aware of my dream state, but I still tricked myself into thinking she'd be there beside me. Only for a split second. That's when reality hit me. I was back in my empty bed, in my empty apartment, in my empty life, and I realized who I was, and what my life consisted of. 

This was five minutes ago. Part of me is mourning the loss of someone who never existed. Someone whose face is slowly starting to disappear from memory, and whose influence with be meaningless in five more minutes.

I feel a special kind of loneliness right now, and I think I'm gonna head to the kitchen and have a drink or two.

Ive only been in one relationship, if you removed 3 or 4 days from my life you would remove all the physical in person interaction Ive had with a women romantically. I can talk to women fine, several friends are women and its good. but I just don't know how romance works.

Ive got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperienced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect .when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I literally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

I think one of my biggest frustrations is that, I feel like a creep by seeking out sexual stuff online. Whatever form that may take (interactive or not). I'm not sure how to seek it out without feeling a little slimy, even if I'm not actually doing anything wrong. I'm respectful, upfront, careful to understand and not cross boundaries. but despite all that there is a little bit of a feeling i get on sites like reddit or whatever when I'm seeking out anything, especially if it involves another person. I don't know how to shake that and thats actually what bothers me quite a bit. I know its not wrong to want to interact sexually, I know its normal, and I am very respectful in the way I approach it. But I always feel like I will be judged for it, or that I will be put in a box like ""oh he is just another guy who only wants in my pants"" even if I also want to know them as a person.

in a perfect world I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with my sexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embarrassment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word. Like she would be EXTREMELY kind and caring towards me without being condescending, but just truely wanting to help me get comfortable with sexuality.

I'm not stupid enough to think i'll ever find that though. I just.. i'm tired of trying at this point. Maybe I should just accept feeling guilt about it or just give up ever acting on sexual desires.",lonely,I'm a lonely 26 year old with almost no experience.,2020-01-22 13:47:17

Now, when you read self-help books on how to make friends they always tell you that you have to show a genuine interest in people. I can do that. The problem is, those people will show a genuine interest in me. That sends me into a state of panic. Especially when you're trying to make a female friendship, you won't really get asked about hobbies etc. that much: girls want to know where you're from, where you went to high school, where do you live now...   

I keep making shitty decisions that are hard to explain and put me in a position where I'm forced to admit I'm 1. miserable and have been for many years 2. a fucking moron. This sends me in such a state of panic, I become evasive, do my absolute best to avoid these people's questions, and begin to avoid them altogether.

1066,Fallout_94,1579598964,1,"This is a long one. Please bear with me. I need advice and I should tell the whole story first.

So the last relationship I had was 3 years ago. Had 2 adult relationships in my life, both times I was abused, mentally not physically, and ultimately I was treated like I was worthless. Since then, I haven't opened up to anyone, I haven't asked anyone out on a date and outside of basic hobbies and work, I'd been living life in first gear.

I made a post about this already, about how I met a girl around 6 months ago. She's everything I could want in a partner and more. I should say at this point, I still wasn't looking for one. I was just glad to have a new friend. We have lots in common, both good and bad, from the aforementioned crappy relationships, to enjoying the same hobbies, like art and gaming etc. We quickly became the best of friends. She's one of only 2 people I trusted to tell about my exes. It's the same for her, just me and one other. We could talk to eachother about anything and everything. It was like I'd known her my whole life.

Later, I fell for her. She said she had a crush on someone and all her hints suggested it was me. I said I liked her and I got bitten. She told me she 'had no idea I felt that way,' and that's as far as that ever went.

A few weeks later, she tells our gaming group chat that she has a date. It isn't even the same guy she had a crush on a few weeks prior. I'm not jealous, it's the opposite. I'm glad she's happy and I'm happy for her. I'm just... shocked that someone who's been hurt in the past can move on from one person to another so easily, and I can't shake this horrible feeling that she's setting herself up to be hurt again.

And at the end of it all, it's myself I'm pissed off with. As a friend, I love her. I just can't help liking her more than that and I know its stupid. I know nothing will come of it. I just don't know what to do with myself as she's one of my best friends. One part of me wants to cut her out of my life completely, forget her and move on. But not only will it make our gaming group awkward if we're online at the same time (group then has to decide who to play with and who to leave out), I'll lose one of my best friends. The other part of me is trying to convince myself I'll be okay and I'll get over her, but it's been a month already and I'm struggling with 'put a happy face on it.'

It's a very lonely feeling when women in their early 20s or 30s complain about their love lives when they just broke up with someone. Or your guy friend tells you how miserable he is after a few months of being single, and takes pictures of himself frowning so he can show them to you and say ""look how sad I look."" You don't say anything, because you're not an asshole, and this isn't about you right now.

I have had multiple people ask if I was okay today, I have essentially lied to all of them even though I don‚Äôt want to.  They said they were here for me and I said I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it.  If someone came up behind me and just hugged me for even a second I would literally cry.  I would literally be so overwhelmed with happiness that I could probably die right there.  But the saddest part is knowing that that will never happen.  Even though I know others are experiencing similar feelings to me, I still feel on an island, with no possible decisions to make other than hold it in and cry.  It hurts even more when you enjoy yourself somewhere, come home and realize that you really are alone.  You realize that all of these happy feelings are merely a distraction from the real issues inside of you.  I try to stay ‚Äúhumble‚Äù  and I get guilty about sharing my issues with other people.  As if I‚Äôm burdening others and get this feeling that they would like me less and would only pity me.  I can‚Äôt seem to form any type of deeper relationship with anyone.  I‚Äôm always the second option.  Not only that, but I have absolutely no connection to my family.  I could be in the same room with someone the whole day and not say a word.  There are times when I wish some answer or person was revealed to me that would fix all of these issues, but that would never happen.  I‚Äôm just going to be stuck in an eternal loop of ‚Äúhappy distractions‚Äù and loneliness.

Mystery and mischief danced in the reflection of the draping moonlight as the stars trickled down, almost like a bridge connecting earth to the unknown afterlife. Every street light was off, the incandescence of the night sky remained as the only source of light. Evil lurked around every corner in this dreadful town; no one dared be outside past sunset for fear of impending danger and formidable evil. The park was empty and desolate, the suspicious nature of this time of night held darkness and death, the only shadows that lurked at midnight were of creatures, unbothered in nature, and a lonesome, fear-striking figure that moved with stealth and an agenda. As the moment of action approached, the park grew eerie and strange, as if the surroundings were preparing for trouble. The insects and beasts that haunted the night-time scattered as if a sixth primal instinct struck them like a blow. The shadow inched closer to his destination with the strip of cold lethal steel pressed against his skin and the only sound to be heard was the was the blare of his heartbeat that harmonized with the stealthy tap of his walk. The time of ultimatum was here. This was the moment, place and weapon that would transmit grief into the hearts of many and shake a town to its core.

My closest friends are all in relationships, except for one who really doesn't care. I've tried to act for so long like I don't either, but these past few months have just been to much. 

I met this girl who is my best friend's girlfriend's best friend and I was completely blown away. She's all I could think about for the last 4 months, and I've spoken to her maybe 4 times. Every time, I die a little because I can't hold a decent conversation and I could swear she doesn't want to talk to me. I cannot remember these last 4 months  because I spent it in a Pinkerton fueled depression coma. I went to school every day, everyone saw my normal self, but my friends knew I wasn't fine. Some of them just can't handle my talking about it, and the others just don't understand. I'm scared that I'm driving them away, and I barely leave my room. 

The only thing that gets me out of bed every morning is my commitment to the swim team. But even then, my mind wanders. I can never escape my own psychological torment because I don't have the balls to just fucking say Hi. I don't dream anymore and I barely pay attention in school anymore. 

The best and worst part of my day is lunch, when I can see her from across the room, but then see her having fun with her friends, and I don't want to awkwardly walk up to her and be weird. My lowest point was just yesterday, when I was feeling bored and drew a shitty sketch of a picture of her my friend sent me. I showed one of my best friends and he said that it was stalkerish. I ripped it up into a hundred pieces and went to bed crying. I don't know how I can go to school every day and subject myself to the same torture. This may be the first time I've ever been in love. I've never had a girlfriend and I may just be desperate for attention, I don't know anything about myself now. I'll probably post this and go back to listening to my sad music, in my room, alone.

I'm not seeking help of any kind, I just needed a place where I could let everything out and not be judged. Who knows, Maybe I'll say hi tomorrow. I've been saying that for the last 4 months.",lonely,"I've got close friends, but I crave love desperately.",2020-01-21 13:22:58

I‚Äôm not lonely, I just don‚Äôt want to be with anyone but you. You have put it in my head for so long that I was just a lonely girl. That my feelings were just feelings of a rejected married woman who‚Äôs husband didn‚Äôt want to be bothered with her anymore. But after 3 years, I think I can finally admit that that‚Äôs not the case. Even though I truly wish it was just as simple as that. I wish I was just a lonely girl that wanted attention from anyone that would give it to her. Things would be so much easier for both of us if that was the truth. But I think we both know that‚Äôs not true. 

And honestly, for you, that might just be how you feel. For you I‚Äôm probably just filling a void that you have yet to find someone else to fill for you instead. But that is not my truth. As much as I wish I could walk away into someone else arms and be happy, I know that your arms are the only arms I want to hold me.

1104,SomeoneTalkToMe1,1579572292,1,"I'm 26. ive never had sex. Ive only been in one realtionship, if you removed 3 or 4 days from my life you would remove all the physical in person interaction Ive had with a women romantically. I can talk to women fine, several friends are women and its good. but I just don't know how romance works.

I'm pretty religious at times. Don't want to talk about that AT ALL. But its relevant for the next part.

I started watching porn when I was younger. about 4 or 5 years ago I started talking to women online, sometimes sexually. I just feel so absurdly lonely that I don't know how to deal with it. I just want to feel a connection with someone.

I got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperinced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect .when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I litterally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

That fills me with guilt. But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty womans voice tell me im not a horrible digusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself.

in a perfect world I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embaressment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word. Like she would be EXTREMLY kind and caring towards me without being condesnding, but just truely wanting to help me get comfortable with sexuality",lonely,"I hate myself, I hate who I am.",2020-01-21 13:04:52

1111,LtGeneralFish,1579564600,1,"I've been dealing with a lot more internal conflict lately than I have in the past. Before I honestly thought it was a low point in life, but I've been able to get to the highest and lowest point in my life all at the same time. I'm done with people always wanting something out of me, only keeping me around because I can do things for them but when I want something they're always quick to leave me behind or call me 'too clingy' to the past. I'm not clingy to my past, I learned to not trust people *because* of my past. So now, after a lot of time, I sit here at a crossroad in life, alone, and without a solid person I can call my own. A lot of people like to throw up into my face that '*other people have it worse than you, be lucky/be grateful that you're so fortunate'.* Do you really think, coming home after work, turning on a computer I paid over $1500+ for, just to sit there and stare at the screen for hours on end while absolutely no one says hello, how are ya, you wanna do some shit, is *fortunate?* Not trying to sound bratty, entitled, or even pushy. I'm just tired of everyone saying the same old shit, '*try new things, get out there, show the world!'* Easy to say when most of them have a lot more readily available funds and well established friend groups. I've tried joining clubs locally, getting involved in community service work, and plenty of other things I've done in order to try and get out into the world and experience it. So far, I've not met anyone that clicks well with me, anyone that's worth keeping around, or anything. Maybe my standards are a bit too high, there's a reason for that. I'm not ready to commit my effort and resources into another person, friendship or romantic relationship, and get shot down only because they use it to their advantage. So, upon recommendation from another so called '*friend',* I've taken to reddit on the off chance I might meet a new friend. I've got a discord I'm much more readily available on, primarily because I only check reddit weekly. My interests are vast in terms of what keeps me talking, and I really do enjoy deep conversation instead of small talk. I do both, but I like to get deep into something and talk for hours.

1130,pangulin,1579548359,1,"  After spending my weekend inside I decided at the very least I sould get put of the house at least once. My little sister wanted me to drop her off to meet up with her friends at a MLK celebration my city was holding. I decided we should walk because I don't like driving and walking seems to chill me out. 

  As we walked there she told me of how my parents are suspicious of her and my older sister of wrongdoings but never think I do it (They haven't done any wrongdoing to my knowledge). She said even though I've been the only one to do any sort if drug, but they don't know anything about that. She came to the conclusion that it's likely because I never go out with anyone because I don't have any friends. We walked over to where her friends said they were going to meet and I left so then I became alone again in a very social event.

  I didn't just want to go home so I stayed and walked through the celebration seeing everyone with at least another person. As I walked through I noticed many kids from my school were there but none I'd ever talk to and felt slight embarrassment from being seen alone. Some of them noticed me, they didn't say anything or give me a dirty look but their passing gazing made me anxious to be there much longer. I walked through the small celebration and quickly decided to leave. The food they were selling seemed good but I wouldn't feel comfortable being there much longer then I already was. 

  On the walk back home I didn't do much but look around and even if I had nobody to share the moment with the scenery of the area was relaxing and quite a change of scene from what I would've been doing had I not gone. Besides feeling a little anxious I do feel that going out was the right thing for my mind but the only problem I would have is lacking the confidence to stay and enjoy the events going on.

At my 20 years i've met a girl also with asperger thanks to my mother and her father and became friends, time passes and i've fallen in love with her to finally at my 24 years we started dating for our first time. We got together until at my 26 years because we went so inmature with the relationship, I made mistakes (like some micro-machism behaviours) and she didn't want something serious.

Since then i've made mistakes with my life: I've made wrong friends, I've took bad jobs that my bosses started to take advantage on me (like working more and paying less), i've got scammed on everything that I wanted to do and even started to visit hookers and wasting a lot of money, but I didn't turned the page with her, for me she's special and I cannot change her for anyone else so I tried to start it over, writing letters like before, buying plush toys or videogames, visit her family to stay updated with her situation and mine, but then this happends: Some days algo she called me to visit to her house, I went so nervous but with no hope after all, it's just to pass the time and start to chat face to face, maybe to try gain some confidence and maybe start beign friends again, and it was a good time after all..... until she told me that she got a new boyfriend. I've couldn't believe her, I keep my mind in blank trying to process everything, i've screamed, punched myself, until i've realized that I was still in her house and i leaved, not before telling her that i was happy and after all we can still be friends.

After all i've realized the following: Maybe she lied about it or it's true that she got a new boyfriend, but she told me that only to stop all this fantasy that I keep during 4 years since she break up with me. Right now i want to die, mostly i looked back and i've realized that at my 30 years i didn't everything that a young adult could do, like travel, work, being independent, being strong.

1140,ashdash100,1579539695,1,"As many of you guys probably have, I came on to reddit looking for friends. I went through all the hoops of having to DM people based off their posts or making posts myself only to end up with scarce replies or a ton of replies for one reason only. It‚Äôs a hassle, and a lot of people aren‚Äôt willing to make the effort, or if you‚Äôre like me, you won‚Äôt know where to begin the conversation, how to carry it on. Not to mention that the whole concept is like being thrown into the same room as someone random you‚Äôve never seen before, one on one, expecting you‚Äôll bond over something with them. I‚Äôve found that chat rooms can do wonders with ease of conversation and to become a part of that conversation. I‚Äôve joined r/lonely‚Äôs chat and enjoyed it. It‚Äôs great for finding other people in the same boat as you. I‚Äôm not as active in that community anymore so if you guys are looking for a friend, I‚Äôll link the chat below that I‚Äôm most active in.

I wish i was somebody's number 1 choice. I want to know how it feels to have a best friend that i could spend time with daily, but i feel like at my age it's impossible, most people's besties are childhood friends and i don't have any, i haven't had any irl friends since i was 12 in fact.

1156,EastCoastAA,1579519121,1,"There are so many other pressing matters I need to be working on. Real basic life stuff like cleaning myself up and figuring out how to get a job and a place to move to. But I've been spending more time feeling anxious and depressed than working on the basic-basic things like improving my health and getting a phone and all that.

I've met people nice enough to keep in touch with me online last year and years prior, but I always struggle to keep in touch and I'm not a very fun or happy person to interact with too... And the older friends I've made a couple years ago have been losing interest in keeping in touch with me. The one person that I actually locally know that I met in middle school constantly sends me mixed signals when they show signs of wanting to improve things, but then also show twice as many signs of wanting to keep me at arm's length. Which I guess makes sense, nobody wants to hang out in person with someone that's as much of a mess as me, but that just sends me in a spiral of loneliness and negativity and the only respite I can find is when I'm asleep or going out of my way to think and feel nothing at all.

I'm worried I'll keep failing to hold onto the connections with the nicer folk who keep in touch with me these days. I'm worried that me or my friend from middle school are going to grow too old to repair things between us, if we'll die before that happens or if one of us will just be physically beyond each other's reach if they finally make it out of this wretched city.

I'm too tired and burnt out to meet new people or put the effort into breaking through those introductory phases. Not to mention I don't even have the social skills anyway. I've never wanted a wide breadth of friends. Just enough to for them to always be there for me and for me to always be there for them. But I'm failing on both fronts with that.

I‚Äôve always felt like an outsider to everyone. Now I honestly don‚Äôt really think this as a bad thing, and I can appreciate myself for my differences, but I‚Äôve always had a difficult time connecting with people, except inside my tight friend group. 

Last year I got into a lot of very unfortunate situations, and I don‚Äôt think I made a lot of good choices and I ended up leaving the school at the end of the year with nothing. No friends, no teachers, no social environment, nothing. I spent my summer in near complete isolation in my own home wracked with anxiety every day, and it got really bad for a while. I struggled and fought and cried about it. But when I came out of it, it brought me to a realization about my loneliness. 

I realized that my life wasn‚Äôt going to wait for me to have my shit together, it wasn‚Äôt going to give me good friends, or just show me what to do,      I had to take them for myself. I have to be the one who puts out the effort. But obviously, sometimes your hard work and effort isn‚Äôt going to be rewarded, and that‚Äôs just how it is.

my anxiety has increased a lot because of this. since I text new people often asking for friendship, I constantly check my phone all the damn time. its seriously troubling me a lot, i think I'm addicted to receiving a reply because i seldom get replies. is it common?

1183,coeur_solitaire,1579495895,1,"I never thought I'd be on the internet, posting something like this.

I'm almost 35, and I'm completely alone.    
If I disappeared tomorrow, no one would notice except for my office.

Nearly 2 years ago I left my now ex-husband, ending an 11 year relationship.  I stayed with him for so long out of obligation, and fear that he wouldn't be able to handle his anxiety disorder without me.  He stayed with me so long because he was afraid of being alone, and I think on some level he thought that if he treated me poorly enough I would eventually become the kind of submissive woman he wanted me to be; but he didn't really love me, and I fell out of love with him ages before I left.

I have no regrets about leaving.  It was the best decision I've ever made, but because I was the one who left, I became the villain, all of our friends turned their back on me.... At 33 I was faced with rebuilding my entire life from nothing.

I've tried so hard in this time to try and put myself out there, meet new people, try new things... I even moved to a new city for a fresh start.

But no one seems to care.  I try to make new friends and make plans, then they flake... and if they don't, and it's been long enough that I think we've finally gotten to a place where I can open up to them about my past, and about what I'm struggling with, they disappear.  I've always been the first person to drop everything and help a friend in need, and I just don't understand why I can't find that support.

I tried therapy, but it doesn't help... I feel like they're just telling me things I want to hear, and I start lying to them.

I was trying to date again for awhile, but wasn't ready to get into a serious relationship, so I was looking for the wrong things, and meeting the wrong kinds of people, and was being treated poorly.  I know that it was my fault, and was due to the vibe I was putting out, I don't blame anyone else but myself for that.  But now when I think about trying to meet someone, all I can think of is that they'll think I must be a crazy person to not have any friends.

The only thing that was keeping me going was that I had a good career, at any office I've been at I was always considered one of the strongest team members, and I felt like I was capable of achieving something.  But my current boss led me on, got me drunk, and took advantage of me... and when I asked him if we could talk about what happened and clear the air, he toyed with my emotions and spun this elaborate story about how he had such strong feelings for me, and could see a future with me, but it couldn't go any further because he could never, ever, date someone from work... a week later he was dating the company's Head of Marketing.  

I can't help but think if he thought I had any value as an employee, he wouldn't have risked what he did.  I've never felt so disrespected both personally and professionally.  It's completely destroyed the thread of self confidence that I had left.  If he'd just been honest about it being a mistake, or a one-time thing, and worked to repair our professional relationship I would have been fine.  I'm a mature adult who can handle rejection, and I don't understand why he felt the need to lie to me.  When I confronted him about his lie, he tried to gaslight me, and now completely ignores me at work unless we're in meetings.

My divorce took such a toll on me financially that I can't risk going to HR about the situation, they would never fire him, and if they don't believe me and I get fired, I have no financial safety net right now.  I've been trying to look for a new job, but the market is just too competitive, and it's taking so long.

I feel like I have nothing left, and nothing to live for.  The only time I see people, or talk to people is at work, and that's been tarnished for me.  When I'm there now I'm just angry all the time, and trying to make sure that no one can tell that I'm not fine. 

The only logical explanation I can think of for why no one wants to be a part of my life, is that there's something wrong with me, and that I must just be a terrible person.

I've spent the better part of the past 2 years crying all the time.

I don't want my past... It was a different kind of loneliness that I'm glad I left behind... but I didn't want this either.

I don't remember what it feels like to be loved.

I ended a 5 year relationship not long ago so I forgot how important religion can be to people and how people are very prejudiced against others for their faith (or in my circumstances- lack of faith) but fuckkkkk dude.

Fuck. Why??????
So I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather just tell you about my religion and skip the name‚Äù
She says ‚Äúare you like Muslim or something?‚Äù (I‚Äôm brown with a beard)
Me: ‚Äúnah, but here‚Äôs what we believe...‚Äù
Anyway so I elaborate and go into a bit of the 11 Satanic Rules of Earth and start with how we completely go against any nonconsentual sex and boom she‚Äôs like super interested because no other religions say rape is bad. I‚Äôm in over my head because the more I talk the more she‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh my god, how have I never heard of this. What‚Äôs it called?‚Äù
I brace myself and tell her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go off of the name - I‚Äôll explain the meaning behind that just go off what I shared with you, please‚Äù she agrees happily.
‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs the Church of Satan, I‚Äôm a Satanist. But we don‚Äôt believe in god or Satan so it‚Äôs an atheistic philosophy‚Äù
She looks shocked (expected)
She goes on and starts floundering about how I ‚Äúlooked so normal‚Äù and ‚Äúact so nice and sweet‚Äù but then says she needs to go to the bathroom, I could tell she was a bit disturbed or disappointed to find out I‚Äôm not rockin for Jesus or whatever. About 5 mins pass and she isn‚Äôt back, then 10, 20....I take my hint and leave soon after.
She texted me today with a shit ton of bible verses followed by a barrage of highly insulting texts calling me mentally ill, a pedophile, manipulative and evil. And that I should probably dress differently so ‚Äúpeople know‚Äù.

1198,rootlessindividual,1579484429,1,"Unpopular opinion here.

Not trying to be mean or anything, but I think a contributing factor to being alone and not having friends is selfishness. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are other factors and a lot of people have different experiences in life that can definitely contribute to loneliness, but not thinking about others and expecting everyone to meet a specific list of criteria to get to be your friend is definitely going to lead to more time alone.

So this idea of selfishness being a cause to loneliness might seem controversial and should definitely be debated, but I just wan‚Äòt to share my thoughts and why I think this way, whatever it is worth.

Firstly, I read a lot of people suffering of loneliness describing situations where people don‚Äôt bring anything to them or don‚Äôt care about them. I think it is wrong to assume that people have to care about you or bring something to you. A better mindset would be to ask yourself : ‚Äú What can I bring to others?‚Äù Giving whatever it is you can give, be it time or friendly curiosity such as asking about their day etc. or buying a coffee or whatever, without expecting anything in return, will increase your value as a human being and I am 100% confident good people will notice your generosity and you will end up having something in return anyway. I know it is hard caring about others when you yourself deal with, for instance, general and mental health issues, money issues, etc. (I live with depression and anxiety for 8 years now and have a ton of debts at 28yo of age so I know it‚Äôs hard but it definitely helps to give oneself a sense of purpose and it increases his or her general sense of well being). Generosity is one of the greatest human qualities one can have, and should always be highly valued. The more you open yourself to others and offer a hand or time or whatever, the more people will want to be around you and inclined to give back their own time and kindness in return. 

Also, I read a lot about people suffering from loneliness finding it difficult to connect with people or that they don‚Äôt find ‚Äú the right ones ‚Äú. It is okay to chose your close friends but when you don‚Äôt have many or any at all, I think you have to be open to more people and give people a chance to get to know you and be around you. Everyone has a different personality and vibe they can bring, and we shouldn‚Äôt expect to have friends that are the exact copy of ourselves as only potential friend matches. I am an INTP type but I enjoy the company of extroverts as well as introverts : I know I can have easy small talk with extroverts and this gets me out of my comfort zone which is fine, and I enjoy having deeper and more meaningful conversations with the introvert types. I think it is an unfair expectation to yourself and to others to believe that in order to have some friends or to spend time with other people you should only engage in deep meaningful conversations with them. This level of interaction requires great amounts of energy and can be tiring for a lot of people; it is perfectly normal that the majority of social interactions you have with others on a daily basis are not too deep or meaningful. I myself don‚Äòt particularly enjoy small talk but I find it nonetheless an important tool to build bonds with people. If you want to have more deep conversations with people, it often first requires that you ‚Äúpoke‚Äù the other person through small talk and see if he or she is inclined to go further deep in conversation; it is not to be expected nor always desirable. 

I could make some other points, but I‚Äôll just address one other observation from lonely people posts, that is ‚Äú not having fun talking to people ‚Äú. Talking with others isn‚Äôt always fun : sometimes even there is confrontation, dullness, untruthfulness, etc. These things are unavoidable, and are normal. Again I think it‚Äôs unfair to expect interactions to be fun, sometimes it‚Äôs just a necessity, sometimes it brings you nothing (most of the times), sometimes it‚Äôs annoying, but I think the best way to think about this is to have no expectations whatsoever. If the interaction is dull and pointless, make it shorter; if you sense the other person has low self estime, make her feel special and give her confidence; if the person seems sad, cheer her up; if the other person has some issue ask if he/she needs some help; if you have nothing interesting to say, ask questions, be curious about their work or school related stuff, ask about their day, etc. When you do all these little things, it it increases your value as a human being and eventually people will also be curious about you and when they ask you how you feel and how things are, then it‚Äôs your turn to talk about what bothers you, hell, talk about you feeling lonely and bored if that‚Äôs what you want to talk about. Being honest and making the best out of these situations is key to having quality interactions. It takes time, listening to others, patience, and keenness to develop one‚Äôs empathy and social skills, but in the end your overall human being quality improves and makes it all the more likely you are less alone and people feel comfortable being part of your life.

That‚Äòs it for now, I hope it makes some sense to you guys. I don‚Äôt want to come off as trying to give advice or anything, it‚Äôs just my conception at this time of how to avoid being lonely and I think and feel this way due to my own experience of being lonely for years and then being less lonely after I made constant efforts to care about others and giving more of my time to others. 

TL ;DR  Selfishness is one of the reasons people are lonely and I think caring about others, giving your time, lowering your expectations and not expecting every interaction to be meaningful is key to being less lonely, increasing your value as a human being and attracting people around you.",lonely,VERY UNPOPULAR OPINION,2020-01-20 12:40:29
1199,Negative_Plastic,1579482598,1,"How many of you know the first and last names of all eight of your great-grandparents? How many of you can even name one? 

I can't name any of my great-grandparents either. Despite the fact that they moved to a new continent from Europe to start a new life for themselves, their children, and their children's children, they remain all but forgotten three generations later. 

I'm sure many of you have great-grandparents who immigrated to North America from Europe - impressive by most standards. And yet, most of their own kin does not do them the respect of even knowing their names. 

Then there's me - leading a life spent mostly in bed - if not in bed, then in a cubicle or in a car. I practice guitar, I like studying foreign languages, yet by all accounts, my life is utterly unremarkable. And that's by contemporary standards - given I'm still alive. Imagine how unremarkable my life will look in retrospect. 

I know I'm not the only one. I don't expect many people to leave an indelible mark on humanity. But knowing that my life is totally inconsequential, the mundanities of everyday become unbearable. Wake up, drink a cup of Great Value coffee, commute 45 minutes to work, whither by myself for eight hours in a cubicle, come home, cook, do laundry, sweep, wipe down the counters, run the dishwasher, shower, and go to sleep, just me and the knowledge that every day for the next 40 years will look more or less the same. 

The only reprieve comes at 66.5 when I can call it quits - if I'm one of the lucky - and burn all the cash I spent my entire life accumulating. For many, this resembles frequent trips aboard gaudy cruise ships, visiting countries with a GDP less than the state of Rhode Island, sipping overpriced cocktails with paper umbrella garnishes, magenta, cyan, canary, dotting the horizon like a Jackson Pollock painting, as the Oasis of the Seas meanders its way from port to port. You tell yourself you‚Äôre having a terrific time, as you snuff from your mind the memory of the dilapidated Belizean neighborhoods and impoverished Honduran children you saw earlier today, children who, too, were meandering in their own way. 

Without thought or effort, the sound of Billy Joel karaoke comes into focus, and for a moment, you realize just how utterly hollow this whole experience is. The effect is jarring - quite like when the lights come on after a concert. In one moment, a feeling of bliss, and in the next, a hyper-awareness of the world around you, a keen juxtaposition that takes your breath away into the humid Caribbean air. A lifetime of corporate servitude only to find yourself old,  most of your life behind you, spending your final years slurping lukewarm fettuccine from a cruiseship buffett, prepared by a young man from a Caribbean island you've never heard of, on a floating shopping mall with tacky orange carpeting and a dubious Egyptian theme. And you think to yourself *‚ÄúIs this all there is?‚Äù* 

Anyway, I'm just in one of those moods where everything feels pointless. I'm not gonna hurt myself, don't get me wrong. It's just hard to find meaning in this life. You spend a significant portion of your waking life at school or work. When you're finally in your mid-60s, you finally have some capacity to retire and enjoy the 15 or so years you have left. Your lifetime of work has led you to this. Still, a) many people cannot retire in their mid-60s, and b) even those that do have to balance leisure with an aging body and a slowing mind. I don't think I'm going to have children, and therefore grandchildren. I don‚Äôt believe in the afterlife. So it's hard not to feel like life will just be work, work, work, retire, spend your money on garish forms of happiness and entertainment, and then die. I might be remembered by my sister's children - until they die. But it's almost certain that I'll be totally forgotten within 150 years - at most a faceless name on a voting record that a descendant of mine might come across in an attempt to explore his or her ancestry. So I ask myself, what's it all worth? All the work? All the happiness, but also all the sadness? All the everything? Why are we here? Why does anything matter?

I have really bad social anxiety and after spending a day with people i always feels so drained and need some time by myself to recover, these days occur so often in my life, i just feel so much comfort and peace when i'm alone just because i don't have to act a certain way around people or constantly wear a mask. Even around my family i'm like this, i usually get up early before anyone just so i can spend some time by myself in the house and enjoy some peace and quiet before anyone gets up. How can i even find someone if i don't even enjoy being around people? Am i going to be a good husband when i'm older? If i do get married (that is a big IF) i know i'm gonna need a lot of days alone without anyone else just to keep my sanity and i don't think any girl would ever want someone like that and i completely understand that, i wouldn't want someone like that either. Why would anyone wanna be in a relationship with someone who's very distant all the time.

I've slowly started to accept that i actually might end up spending the rest of my life by myself and part of me feels okay with that because i've realised that this trait actually makes me quite toxic which won't be beneficial in any kind of relationship and i highly doubt i'm gonna change in the future, i don't have the motivation to do so but that other part of me just constantly hopes that i might find that special someone and have a loving relationship with them .

Here is an article from magic jack about benefits of voice chatting:

The intimacy of two voices in conversation and the emotion that comes through spoken communication are being lost as we switch to a text-only world. When we embrace the ease of texting and email, we risk losing something that makes us who we are as human beings. We risk losing our voices, and everything that they can say.

## Why Do We Talk in the First Place?

You might think that all this talk of losing our voices is exaggeration, but as [CNN reported](http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/22/tech/mobile/americans-prefer-text-messages/) as early as 2011, there are a growing number of people who prefer texting to talking to one another. In 2011, it was one third of all Americans; by now, that number is even higher.

There are scientists trying to study what we lose when we give up talking to each other. But these scientists, despite their PhDs, are having a hard time understanding what we may be losing in this shift to text.

So, why do we talk? And why should we keep bothering to make phone calls when [social media apps](https://www.magicjack.com/magicApp.html), email, and text messaging are making voice-to-voice communication so much easier to avoid?

## The Benefits of Talking

The benefits of talking to each other can be seen in a wide variety of social situations. In fact, there are so many benefits, that it can be hard to believe. There is nothing really wrong with written communication, but speaking can do things that writing just can‚Äôt. And when compared side by side, talking always wins.

Here are some examples. There is no substitute for spoken communication in situations when you are trying to discreetly get a message across by using your tone of voice. Nothing compares to talking when it comes to reaching agreement or when you are trying to give information during an emergency.

Talking is always quicker at getting the point across, adding layers of meaning through tone of voice. Also, talking invites response, discussion, and feedback on ideas, creating and supporting community in ways that text-based communication still can‚Äôt.

## Why the Telephone Is Still Relevant

The invention of the telephone was a major step forward for humans. It allowed us to transfer all the benefits of talking from face-to-face communication to communication over vast distances. Home phone service providers made it so that the written word would no longer have to stand in as a substitute for talking via the letter or the telegram.

It can be difficult to keep the significance of the telephone firmly in mind these days. We live in a time where people carry tiny computers with them everywhere we go. People still call these tiny computers ‚Äúphones,‚Äù but their ability to make and receive calls is now a minor portion of what they do. But without the phone, we would still be in a position where written communication, delivered as quickly as it is these days, would be the only form of communication possible over great distances.

## The Phone Still Matters

Home phone service providers and cellular providers are still a necessary part of the fabric of our society. The phone is still important in many situations where clarity, efficiency, and speed (not to mention emotion and meaning) are important.

Verbal communication and all the subtle nuances that go along with it is still the best way to convey meaning quickly, and with greater impact over long distances.

1239,jamieosl,1579439288,1,"I don‚Äôt even know what I want from this at this point. I‚Äôve never reached out or used Reddit before. This is not like me. But this hurt is too much to bear alone anymore. I just feel so much pain from the things I‚Äôve done. The things I‚Äôve said that hurt someone I loved more than anything in this world. I hate what I did. Yet I know how hard I tried. I miss my ex-boyfriend so much. I was verbally abusive to him throughout our relationship &amp; bulldozed his needs for the sake of meeting my own. 

I was emotionally manipulative without even noticing how bad it was. I was going through a lot on my own end but it ended up being taken out on him. I was so messed up dealing with so much in my head that I couldn‚Äôt even see clearly. I was so caught up in my own problems, my own pain, my own inner critic &amp; my own shame that it clouded all of his pain from dealing with me, that was right in front of me. I was in so much pain &amp; hate from all sorts of other things in my life (&amp; yes some from our relationship as well) that every time he finally did something even slightly wrong it would all be taken out on him. 

I hurt him. My words were so harsh, so judgmental &amp; so callous. I knew they were, yet my anger was so strong I felt in those moments like no force in the world could make me stop saying those hurtful things. Even after we talked &amp; I knew I was wrong &amp; that I was at fault at the thing we were mad about, I would be way too angry &amp; so incredibly defensive to even have it in me to even utter the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. It felt like I would explode if I did. Even knowing he‚Äôs right. I hated myself for being so selfish. Yet the pain I carried made it so I continued to be selfish. I had no patience, no understanding &amp; everything about me needed him to be perfect or it would trigger me. Now that I look back, I felt I NEEDED him to be perfect. I had no tolerance whenever he wasn‚Äôt, so I could feel better about my imperfect self &amp; my imperfect life that I was in so much resistance to. 

I was deeply ashamed of who I was without really realizing just how bad my inner shame was. I hurt the only person in my life that never judged me &amp; had so much patience for me despite how selfish I was sometimes. I‚Äôm just sitting here crying because I can‚Äôt take it back. I think back to how kind &amp; loving he was &amp; how I could ever do such a thing to him. I loved him with all my heart. Even though I hurt him in such horrible ways I still loved him so incredibly deeply. I wish I saw how my own shame towards what I thought were bad traits within myself was causing me to hurt my love anytime I saw an ounce of it surface within him. Now I see that I should have not judged those ‚Äúsocially unacceptable‚Äù traits that I was so deeply ashamed about within myself &amp; accepted them with kindness &amp; subsequently loved him the way he deserved. 

I don‚Äôt blame him for leaving me. I don‚Äôt blame him for not wanting to be my friend anymore. I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to be in a relationship with me either. I wrote a letter to him apologizing for all the things I did &amp; told him how much I loved him. He doesn‚Äôt know if we will ever be friends anymore. My heart aches so much every day. I cry myself to sleep. He doesn‚Äôt need or want me. I wish he could see that I can change &amp; that I‚Äôm working on myself so much &amp; will continue to because I want to love him right. He deserves it. I feel like I‚Äôve lost him forever. I wish there was something I could do, something I could say‚Ä¶.but there isn‚Äôt. I lost the most precious thing I‚Äôve ever come to know. 

If he were here, I would take his hands in mine, look him in those kind eyes &amp; tell him how much I love him. How much he means to me, that I would never want to &amp; never intended on hurting him. That I‚Äôm so sorry for the things I‚Äôve done &amp; how out of control I became throughout the course of our relationship due to my own insecurities. I‚Äôd ask if he‚Äôd forgive me for it someday. That my heart will always love him.

These days I‚Äôm quite depressed. I try my best to not escape from my life. I try to not burden the few friends I hv with my pain &amp; depressive moods because I can tell they‚Äôre tired of it. I try to accept what happened &amp; accept the fact he no longer loves me &amp; wants nothing to do with me. I try to talk to anyone &amp; everyone who will listen to me or talk to me. Because it hurts more to be both in pain &amp; alone. I‚Äôm sorry for this long post. I have a lot to get out. I guess I‚Äôm writing this in the hopes that there‚Äôs someone out there that cares. Thank you for listening &lt;3",lonely,I hurt the person I love the most.,2020-01-20 00:08:08
1240,Mphrdcr2019,1579439015,1,"I‚Äôm 19, currently in Japan and I have always been frustrated about how lonely I am, no good looks, can‚Äôt talk to girls. But being here makes it worse to deal with

A few nights ago I lost my virginity with and older Japanese escort (I have a thing for older women and like Japanese girls) Because I thought why not. She‚Äôs was a stunning person, both looks and personality. But afterwards I felt really depressed thinking about it, most likely knowing that she doesn‚Äôt love me and it‚Äôs just business. I didn‚Äôt know I was going to feel that way afterwards otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have done it. It‚Äôs hard not to stop thinking about it.
Japan, Tokyo specifically is really crowded with people and everywhere I go I always see couples and it‚Äôs starting to really bother me. 
If I could have any nationality of girl I‚Äôd choose Japanese hands down, even American girls seem less attractive to me now that I see so many cute girls here first hand. Seeing these guys with these really cute girls that I desperately wish to have makes me jealous, angry, and sad. Like I wish they die or something just so I don‚Äôt have to see them because it always reminds me about how much of loser I am. 

The other day I was hanging out with a native Japanese kid and he asks me to meet his girlfriend. We get to the place she‚Äôs at, turns out it‚Äôs her job and he brought me so she would be less mad at him because they‚Äôre in a little spat because he doesn‚Äôt spend time with her. He‚Äôs chasing her around the store and she keeps ignoring him trying to get away from him and he aggressively pulls me over to her when I‚Äôm trying not to get into their business and it made me jealous because she was really cute, and mad just having to be in the middle of their relationship problems. Like he should be damn glad he even has a girlfriend like his. I‚Äôd kill to have a girl like her to be mine.

I don‚Äôt have many friends, let alone know any women, don‚Äôt talk to anyone except family. All I do back home is sleep, watch tv, play games. And I don‚Äôt know how to meet people or talk to girls. Every time I think about myself, or see couples I can‚Äôt help but think I‚Äôm a lonely loser that will never get a girlfriend and live alone the rest of my life and it physically and mentally hurts.

Recently just going through a lot of emotions. I‚Äôve noticeably gotten suicidal thoughts, I will never do it though, but that really put it in perspective for me that I need help. All because I want love. I don‚Äôt know who to talk to and don‚Äôt want to talk to friends or family about it. 
I‚Äôm in Japan, supposed to be having fun and seeing the world but can‚Äôt do anything about these dark thoughts that I always have no matter where I am and it‚Äôs really making this trip terrible.

I chose to leave my EX because the relationship had gotten toxic. My goal was a separation of living and some counseling would bring us back together.We seemed to be in a better place than we had in a long time. I had even taken him to the hospital Monday and spent the night over there. We had talked about us spending the night at his house on Friday and I was so happy. I thought we were going on a really good track. Then on Friday I called to see what time would work and he was just out right rude and I was got rude back and huge fight started. Basically he has decided to move across the country. Keep in mind this is right after he asked for us to start staying at each other‚Äôs house again and agreed to a new visitation because I had a new job. Even though we were living in separate houses I felt like we were closer than we had ever been so this was really unexpected. Plus we have a 2 year old that he is very involved with and he wasn‚Äôt even planning on saying goodbye. Then tonight I am in tears and try to call him while we are texting and he says he has company, he doesn‚Äôt say who but I am assuming it‚Äôs another woman. We had remained exclusive during the separation and it‚Äôs really killing me knowing he‚Äôs fucking someone else. We were just at his house Monday. I stayed all night and it makes no sense to me how you can go from being in love with me and working things out to this with out any notice. There was no fight that tour us apart or anything. It‚Äôs not like he even said anything about it he just did it and now I am so upset. I lost the relationship with the person I am in love with, I lost my co-parent, and he is like my only family. I don‚Äôt know what happened we were getting along better than we had in years. I‚Äôm really fighting the urge not to go to his house and cuss him out. I just wish I had someone to talk to.

I thankfully work from home and have my own freedom, a great wife, but I can't say I'm happy anymore.  

Most of my days are spent alone.  Those that were once close to me, either had kids and is too busy to respond to a text even, or still partying like they are 18 in clubs, and I'm sick of being around drugs &amp; tons of alcohol.  Little things set me off, and takes me 30 minutes to hours to get back to calm. 

3 weeks ago for New Years I just quit a everyday habit of smoking weed for twenty years. I know my serotonin levels in my brain are fucked from that, but this lonely feeling grows as I get older a ok already.  

I'd never do it but thoughts of ending it all creep in my head from time to time,  when I get in these funks.  Today has been extra tough and it feels like I'm just weighing my wife down. She's always happy , I'm miserable.  Why make her suffer too? 

Some days like today it feels there's no way out, no way of getting better deeper relationships anymore.  At 40 we missed the train to make new friends I feel.  Everyone is caught up in their own lives and phones, that interaction seems fleetingly normal.

Reminiscing my life so far, I have always been lonely since my childhood. I don't have any siblings, which made it worse. The only friend I had was my neighbor but due to some issues between the families we stopped talking at the age of 6 and then reunited again at age of 10. Later, I made two more friends in 2015 and 2017. That's it. I have only befriended three people in 19 years.

Girls have always hated me for no reason and talked to me rudely. I can't blame them because I am very introverted and I never talked a lot back in school. However, a girl befriended me in kindergarten and the friendship lasted till second grade. She was the only friend I made in school till that point of time. I have acquainted a lot of people since then, but nobody really wanted to be friends with me. People that I thought were friends didn't even care about me in the end. I am a background character in people's lives who they can approach when they have no one to talk to or need some help.

In 2017, I approached a girl in high school for the first time in my entire life hoping to spark a friendship. I managed to get her phone number after a first few interactions. We used to chat everyday but she never wanted to spend time with me in real life as she wanted to attend lectures. Eight months later, she started ignoring my messages, started replying late and even started bunking classes. I soon realized that she got into a relationship with a guy from another class whom she met only three weeks ago. I never messaged her again. After graduating from high school she messaged me and even called me thrice asking me whether I had ""forgotten"" her. I blocked her everywhere and never heard from her again. The guy must have dumped her.

I befriended a girl again in college (2018). This was unexpected because all I did was solve her doubts regarding academics a few times. And then we developed a virtual friendship gradually. But in the end, the same thing happened. She started ignoring me soon. She was already in a relationship, so that wasn't the problem for me. Just like the other girl, she never wanted to spend time with me yet had time to hangout and flirt with other guys. I ended the friendship by telling her how she mistreated me. I was basically just a substitute for other people.

The fact that I don't have any friends who care for me the way I do hurts. Although I consider myself lucky that I have people whom I can call friends, the fact that I'm not a priority for any of them hurts. They are there to support me, but I feel that they're just sympathizing with me.

I have never had any type of meaningful interactions with women all my life. The conversations usually only last for 20-30 seconds. Girls have turned me down even for friendship. I have been blocked just for sending ""Hi"" to a classmate. I wonder what's wrong with me, because I look pretty average and I can talk confidently enough with people but nobody ever seems to be interested in getting to know me. I wonder how people around me get in and out of relationships so quickly.

At this point, I really crave for a strong emotional and physical connection with someone but I can't do anything about it. Every girl I come across is already in a relationship. Most of my acquaintances are in a relationship¬† or at least are close friends with females. After having so many bad experiences with girls, I don't trust anyone anymore. Even if a girl is interested in me at some point of time, I won't be able to pick any hints. If I get into a relationship, I will perhaps be a terrible partner as I absolutely have no idea of what women like. I can't spend money to make her happy by buying gifts or flowers. I feel like a total failure in life. I have tried to cope with my loneliness developing a lot of hobbies and that has helped me in the long term, but in the end, being lonely is just devastating.

I won't even need a lot of friends if I had a person who will love me to the core, someone I can tell everything about and vice versa. But it just seems impossible at this point of time. Now you'll probably tell me that I'm just 19 and I have a long life ahead, but as the years pass by the probability of meeting new people is decreasing as well. I'm in college now and the class won't shuffle till the final year. None of my friends will introduce me to their friends and I will probably become a freelancer in future so I don't have any chances of making new friends (both male and female) or getting into a relationship. Now I'm apprehensive to even approach people because I can't bear to see all my effort and time that I have spent go waste for people who don't give a shit about me.

1271,Ray0097968,1579410958,1,"I moved around a lot in my childhood and teen years so I never stayed at one place long enough to develop any good friendships, which I feel pushed me into getting used to being a loner and not really going out of my way to develop friendships, most of the time. When I was in high school I only really had one friend but we only really ever talked and did things in school. Once i was out, all I did was dwell in my room and play games. 

I moved to my college town about a year and a half ago, and nothing much has changed. I came in through this college program that forces you into many group situations so I did manage to make one friend, but apart from that, I continued flying solo. The next semester in the dorms I managed to make another friend in an unexpected way with a person that wouldn't normally make friends with a person like me so that was nice.

These two are still my best friends today, but they are very different from me. The first one is a very eccentric/more feminist kinda guy, I guess (don't really know how to describe him since he is a lot of things), and the second one is a G/Homie. Although we all get along and hang out, the differences in our personalities and core ways of thinking have left me feeling very alone on the inside. I just can't open up to them about the way i feel most of the time because whenever I do I know that they don't understand due to how different our wave lengths are.

I'm also overweight at the moment by 50lbs (go figure). Although i don't look like a fucking ballon, my belly and thick legs just kills my self esteem so much. I am changing things in my regular diet like less eating out and stuff which is helping me shed the pounds (already lost 10). Anyways this loss in confidence has just wrecked me to the point were I can't look at a woman in real life anymore without feeling awkward. It feels as if I don't have the right to look at them. I also feel like i'm Jim Carry in the Trueman show, where every where I am when in not home I feel the stares and see the judgment and dirty looks in peoples eyes. I just hate it. I can't go to university a day without coming back home feeling frustrated and angry at people (Don't worry, i take it all out on my steering wheel). The last physical relationship I had was when I was 17 btw so it has been a while now.

To be honest I just want the love and happiness I see all around me but all i'm stuck with is hatred and anger towards other people and my self. I'm just really lonely, man.

P.S. Sorry for the really long post with really poor grammar. Language arts was never my strong suit, that's why I'm majoring in engineering. I just needed to get this out.

1305,KSCWI68,1579391102,1,"All my life I felt like my dad never wanted kids. And I wasn't too hurt by it because my mom has always been so loving that it compensated for it.

- He's smart, interesting to talk to, pretty funny but TERRIBLE dad (and husband but I'll mention it later). He has never taken care of anything regarding my sister and I, despite him being jobless pretty much all our lives. My mom who has always worked was doing everything. She was the one making all the money, keeping the house clean, cooking like a chief, she was the one going to the hospital with us when we had health problems (we're both epileptic). My dad probably couldn't tell you what treatment we take for epilepsy, even though we've had it for like 15 years. He just doesn't know my sister and I. He doesn't know things we like or dislike, etc. And he has always been intimidating to me, because he has the audacity of being the ""parent of authority"", despite him being... kind of a loser ?

- The part that, I think, is impacting my relationships is this : OBVIOUSLY my mom isn't happy with him.
She's way too nice and tolerates way too much so she doesn't dare to say anything and leave him. Which is something I'd love. I want her to be happy with a man who can make her happy. But yes I grew up seeing my mom unhappy with a man who isn't helping her in any way. Zero affection towards her either. I remember seeing him touching my mom's hand one day and I was shocked because of how unusual it is. They would just kiss to say hello/goodbye but it has always looked forced. Just because that's what a couple does. 

- I have huge problems when it comes to trusting men. I guess the fact I grew up seeing one taking my mom for granted and exploiting her kindness made me fearful, and scared of relationships because I see what it could end up like. I'm extremely picky when it comes to men. It might have taught me to have very high standards because I don't want to risk being with a man like my dad ? Also, I'm still intimidated by men too. It's dumb but it's as if I wasn't seeing men as people who can be affectionate.

And yes, of course, these people do exist and we all feel like them sometimes, I don't think this whole community is like that. The posts about 'You can talk to me to make you feel less lonely!' are well meant and very nice, but I just don't think they work.
 
What we all feel, is feeling like we are never the first option. If we're lucky enough somebody does start a conversation with us, it's because they need something or the one they want to talk to isn't reacting. 
 
Loneliness, how I feel it, is feeling absolutely gutted when something fun happened on work or on school or anywhere, and you come home, and you have nobody you can talk about it with. 
 
Loneliness is checking your phone constantly for messages you know won't come.

1330,weirdopotatogirl,1579372558,1,"I'm in my 1st year of uni, and I already feel so lonely. I live in a dorm on campus, and don't go out much when I'm not at school. We don't have that many lectures during the week, so most of the time I'm just in my dorm room by myself, either reading for the next lecture or chilling out by myself. In the beginning, I thought it was nice to have a lot of time to study and relax, but now I'm really tired of being this much alone, I'm starting to feel lonely. I do have friends who live in the area, but they have their own things going on and don't have a lot of time for me anymore, I might see them once every other week or so if I'm lucky. I haven't really managed to make any new friends at school since I have kind of poor social skills, I have made one new friend, but she isn't always interested in hanging out. My school doesn't really have a lot of social activities and not really any clubs either, so I don't have a lot of opportunities to go out and be with people. I also don't have a boyfriend since I'm in love with this guy who lives kind of far away and who I rarely get to see. Even though I'm pretty sure we're not gonna end up together, at least not now, I just don't know what to do.

1333,TheApolloZ,1579368904,1,"Reminiscing my life so far, I have always been lonely since my childhood. I don't have any siblings, which made it worse. The only friend I had was my neighbor but due to some issues between the families we stopped talking at the age of 6 and then reunited again at age of 10. Later, I made two more friends in 2015 and 2017. That's it. I have only befriended three people in 19 years.

Girls have always hated me for no reason and talked to me rudely. I can't blame them because I am very introverted and I never talked a lot back in school. However, a girl befriended me in kindergarten and the friendship lasted till second grade. She was the only friend I made in school till that point of time. I have acquainted a lot of people since then, but nobody really wanted to be friends with me. People that I thought were friends didn't even care about me in the end. I am a background character in people's lives who they can approach when they have no one to talk to or need some help.

In 2017, I approached a girl in high school for the first time in my entire life hoping to spark a friendship. I managed to get her phone number after a first few interactions. We used to chat everyday but she never wanted to spend time with me in real life as she wanted to attend lectures. Eight months later, she started ignoring my messages, started replying late and even started bunking classes. I soon realized that she got into a relationship with a guy from another class whom she met only three weeks ago. I never messaged her again. After graduating from high school she messaged me and even called me thrice asking me whether I had ""forgotten"" her. I blocked her everywhere and never heard from her again. The guy must have dumped her.

I befriended a girl again in college (2018). This was unexpected because all I did was solve her doubts regarding academics a few times. And then we developed a virtual friendship gradually. But in the end, the same thing happened. She started ignoring me soon. She was already in a relationship, so that wasn't the problem for me. Just like the other girl, she never wanted to spend time with me yet had time to hangout and flirt with other guys. I ended the friendship by telling her how she mistreated me. I was basically just a substitute for other people.

The fact that I don't have any friends who care for me the way I do hurts. Although I consider myself lucky that I have people whom I can call friends, the fact that I'm not a priority for any of them hurts. They are there to support me, but I feel that they're just sympathizing with me.

I have never had any type of meaningful interactions with women all my life. The conversations usually only last for 20-30 seconds. Girls have turned me down even for friendship. I have been blocked just for sending ""Hi"" to a classmate. I wonder what's wrong with me, because I look pretty average and I can talk confidently enough with people but nobody ever seems to be interested in getting to know me.

At this point, I really crave for a strong emotional and physical connection with someone but I can't do anything about it. Every girl I come across is already in a relationship. Most of my acquaintances are in a relationship¬† or at least are close friends with females. After having so many bad experiences with girls, I don't trust anyone anymore. Even if a girl is interested in me at some point of time, I won't be able to pick any hints. If I get into a relationship, I will perhaps be a terrible partner as I absolutely have no idea of what women like. I can't spend money to make her happy by buying gifts or flowers. I feel like a total failure in life. I have tried to cope with my loneliness developing a lot of hobbies and that has helped me in the long term, but in the end, being lonely is just devastating.

I won't even need a lot of friends if I had a person who will love me to the core, someone I can tell everything about and vice versa. But it just seems impossible at this point of time. Now you'll probably tell me that I'm just 19 and I have a long life ahead, but as the years pass by the probability of meeting new people is decreasing as well. I'm in college now and the class won't shuffle till the final year. None of my friends will introduce me to their friends and I will probably become a freelancer in future so I don't have any chances of making new friends (both male and female) or getting into a relationship. Now I'm apprehensive to even approach people because I can't bear to see all my effort and time that I have spent go waste for people who don't give a shit about me. I have lost all my hope.",lonely,"Loneliness can build or destroy a person. In my case, it did both.",2020-01-19 04:35:04
1334,Napalmicide,1579368233,1,"I've seen lots of people writing all sorts of expressive pieces of expression here and I thought why not give it a try myself and see what happens. For some background I'm a 29 year old guy from Pennsylvania and I'm a somewhat nerdy guy into some nerdy stuff but also into guns and sports so I'm fairly balanced in things I am or can be into. 

I'm pretty much entirely lonely on the romantic or life partner front. While I'm very much a recluse in general it does not bother me much to not talk to my friends that much. However not having that romantic partner is an entirely different story I desire and crave the fuck out of that. 

I have found it impossible to connect with a woman long term because as I have become now I am very needy especially at first and that I believe very strongly that trust should be earned not freely given. I require effort and attention and priority. I have never met a woman who when given the choice between ""effort"" and ""disconnecting"" has chosen effort. As soon as a woman catches even a hint of inconvenience or that they will have to actively try and do something more than just showing up somehow I become worthless. Whenever I even start to remotely connect and it mutually looks like it could go any kind of anywhere I spend like an obnoxious amount of time pretty much warning her what she is ""signing up for"" like the fact that I'm a needy trust issue damaged shit is not in fine print but in like size 48 bold font on the top of the page. I do this for the explicit reason of having her know what shes getting into and whether to begin that journey. Somehow these obvious plainly worded explained enough to beat 10 dead horses explanations a woman will every single time blow by them take all of the attention and egoboost I throw at them and then wonder why I'm so needy later on. 

I have a significant amount to offer a woman especially emotionally as far as meeting any number of emotional needs. Like in terms of devotion, effort, attention and things like that I'm second to none. Women connect with that right up until I require the same in return and then all of the sudden there is a problem. I cannot tell you how many times I would hear at first ""yeah I'll be there for you"" ""I care about you"" and then when time comes for me to want to like see and feel that its ""you're too demanding"" or ""you're impossible"". What makes it worse is like they don't even try to satisfy me first they would rather water me down and just basically have me sublimate. 

Like over the years failure after failure I've like ""required"" less and less out of prospective partners and currently I'm at the bare minimum. My only requirements are that you actually actively give a shit and view your romantic partner as a central person in your life, are not anti-gun (as a gun owner its the only political requirement as say living in a state like California with an assault weapon ban would instantly make me a felon). However legalities aside all I really require is effort and a shared view of how a relationship should be. I don't really care how much our interests overlap (there cannot be zero so either an interest has to overlap already or be created) as I've had relationships fail where there was very little or zero in common but also like 100% overlap. I for the most part don't care about her politics save for one issue. Like literally why can't I find a devoted woman? These creatures are more of a unicorn than a true gamer girl or anything like that. Hell I run into women with all sorts of mental health issues.... bipolar disorder or like having been raped or some trauma like that in the past and that sort of ""baggage"" literally means nothing to me so long as she can put her half of the work into the relationship. 

I'm always getting fought on what I need. I'm always told I'm ""too demanding"" or ""impossible to please"". I'm always told to sublimate and just be more secure or whatever which is not how insecurity works at all... it isn't something that just vanishes into the air. Something has to come into that void of insecurity to create security. By the time I'm done fighting for the attention and input from her I need either its not nearly as satisfying as I had to beg for it like a starved dog or she simply disconnects and becomes an instant ghost. 

I have so much energy and devotion to give but I have nowhere to go with it and now that I'm pushing 30 its like if I don't connect with my person soon it feels like I should come to terms that it won't happen and that I'll be forever alone without a family or children of my own to raise someday. I've learned very much what really is required for a relationship to work and what isn't and while that helps narrow things down it also narrows down my already limited dating pool. Like where do I have to look and how do I have to present myself to find a devoted (single) woman who values earning trust and a highly connected highly intense partnership and believes in being accountable for her actions and believes in fighting for us and actually working out problems? Where do I find the woman who actually enjoys making her man feel wanted, desired, deserving and all of that?I really have no idea where to find such a thing but I will do damn near anything to get just that.",lonely,My form of loneliness,2020-01-19 04:23:53

1340,FindingRomeo,1579363037,1,"When I say that. Its not for any type of attention. It feels like you've come to accept it. Embedded it deep inside your soul. That even when you hear people say nice things. You know and just tell yourself that they're just being nice. Any compliments just goes over your head. You don't feel happy about it. I always give compliments. I always want to make everyone happy. But I guess I don't hear it enough naturally that i don't yearn for it anymore. Anything else just feels forced. I've told friends before about feeling ugly and unattractive. And they automatically tell me how I am attractive. That im fine. But I realized then that telling someone to get a response are all just lies to myself. To see how they react to me.  No one would tell you the truth anyway. And i lived that way forever. Its hard to change my mind set now. I know I am a good person.  I've never done anything I would regret.  I believe everything happens for a reason. I lived whole heartedly so I won't hurt anyone. But in the end, I'm always hurting. And no one will ever understand. I have no one to turn to. I cant trust that they wont judge me and think I'm weak. Like I have fought too hard alone for anyone to think anything of me.  Just because I share a little bit of what I'm going through to people, that doesnt mean they know the whole story. They start to frown and dont know how to react, things get awkward. Most would tell me how they've been through it too. And it's normal. As I tell them all these with a smile as if it were all just a joke. I guess deep inside I get upset. That they dont know how I feel. I know everyone has their own fight. I know everyone has their own struggle. But they will NEVER know mine. They will NEVER understand me. Dont compare our sadness. Dont take my feelings and trust so lightly. It's not about who's is greater. It's about how they would take me for afterwards.

Tell myself I'm used to being alone. I'll just have to live alone so i wont burden others. I'll keep my feelings to myself.... And that's how I dug myself into a hole. 

I've had people that I liked and had feelings for. But It was always just from afar. What's the used anymore. I'm just ""friend"" material.  I'm just backup and second choice. I know I make everyone comfortable. I know I keep everyone entertained. Because I also know how it feels to be left out and how it feels to be uncomfortable. I realized that because i am the way i am. People take me for granted. They stop trying. Because I'm so nice. they start to think I'm desprate for them. That i must like them soo soo much and i automatically get so turned off. I had like someone before and he told me he liked me too. Everyone knew about us including my best friend. But once my best friend became single they got together. They broke up and week later and he massaged me like nothing ever happen. (Bro ya know my bestfriend told me every detail of what you guys did?) And that was that. I felt like trash. Like I was just leftover. Just backup. Something people can come back to whenever they want because I'm nice. Just because I'm nice it doesnt mean I forget what you did. I'll forgive you.  But I'll never forget anything..

Like I've gotten rejected before and never even confessed! I was sooo confused! I've never even liked the dude. And he told everyone I had liked him. I was so embarrassed. He told me how he only liked me like as a friend. I am assuming some friends told him I must like him because I'm always being friendly. So me telling you good morning every morning when I see you. Being cheery and happy means I like anyone I make eye contact with apparently. I got self concious. When people started acting strange around me. They think they're gonna hurt my feelings. That's why I dont go around guys anymore. I give all my attention to girls. I make them comfortable and I flirt with girls. I'm still nice  to everyone. I just wont talk to anyone one on one. I've become so socially awkward with guys. It's not even funny. I cant be myself afraid they're gonna judge me. When flirting with girls, it comes so naturally. All my female friends knows I like guys though. 
They know I'm not into girls. I guess I can be weird around them and not be judged. I can also be weird around guys that I dont potentially like. Because I do things that turn people off all the time.
 For instance, walk and imitate a freaking gorilla, legs spread, Arms out, trotting across the room, because I was telling them how I carried my groceries in. 
I made jokes out of everything and no one takes me seriously anymore. I am glad I make people happy and keep them entertained. But it's also sad that I've become just a joke to everyone. I've done it to myself. I dont know. I guess I'm fine with it. At least everyone is happy. See how I feel about that?  Now's the real problem. I was fine with all that because it's not like I'm gonna marry anyone of them. I was fine with it.

And here goes my dating life.
There were many people that threw me away. After I expressed my feelings. No one tried. They dont care. They just want to get into your pants. And once they do they go on about their life. They dont care about you. If they dont even take the time to get to know you. They dont even take the time to freaking message you throughout the day because they're ""busy"". They dont care. They dont take the initiative to do anything. Ive been told once that they're too old for my insecurities....okay.. They only do something for you when they want something out of it. People telling you they'll be there for you. My ass. Nobody cares. People telling you. You've just been with the wrong people, that they're different. Ahhum. I've seen it all. From nerds to geeks, clubbers to professionals. It's all the freaking same. I hated guys. I hated everything.  I gave it all up. I stopped trying to find someone. That I'll be content with drowning in my own sorrows. Feeling lonely and empty. Everyday. 
I've been told once that they're too old for my insecurities.
I felt like it was all my fault anyway. I just shouldn't get involved.

Then I met someone by chance. No romance no nothing.  Complete chance. Someone far away. Someone that won't be able to hurt me from here. Someone that gave me all their time. Love and attention.
We went through soooo many ups and downs. It was all really just a fight with myself. He'll just be there. Always listening, always patient with me. I would break up with him every month when my emotions are at its peak. I would always tell him to find someone better. Someone more beautiful and smarter. Someone closer to him. Someone kind and innocent. Someone that is worth his time. How he deserve so much more. \(ToT)/ being overly dramatic all the time. I realized I could be myself around him and he doesnt mind.

But i still feel unattractive. Not good enough. I'm afraid he'll be embarrassed being with me. I'm afraid that itll all be the same. When he meets me. That he'll run away too. I'm afraid to have any hope. I'm afraid to try. To have found someone I truly want to be with but afraid that I will only hurt him. I just feel like trash. No one wants me. Why would he want me. No body cared.  Why should he. I don't want him to only stay because he felt bad or sorry for me. And just out of obligations. Everything feels like its crashing down on me. Like I don't deserve all this happiness. It's all going too well and itll be ripped right out of my hands. I'm not good enough for him.  I'm an emotional wreck. Im too needy and crazy. Im emotionally unstable. And I will only drag him down. It's too much for anyone. No one deserves to go through this just because I couldn't handle myself. Besides I'm just leftover. I'll never be good enough for anyone.  I'm sad and forever feel lonely.",lonely,Anyone just feel like you're not good enough? Sorry its gonna be a lonnng post.

 I do work, and I do my job fairly well, but when I get home all I do is play games and listen to music, music is my scapegoat to these feelings I have.  


Last year was the worst year of my life, everything went wrong, I lost so much that I just gave up  
I told myself that if things don't get better, that I would make 2019 my last year on Earth, and yes.... things did not get better at all  
To my disappointment, I was unable to end my life, I did not have the courage to do it, which makes my sadness stronger  


I hate being here  
I hate who I am and what I am  
I find it hard to ""Love myself"" as so many people say I should... But how can you love something so Broken?

1351,Argeeness,1579354547,1,"I'm sitting here feeling very single and lonely.
All my friends and acquaintances I know from when I was in school most are married and some even have children already.

OK given I had a major set back when I had my accident.
But I still really want to meet a beautiful and cute young woman, like so many I see on here.
I see all these guys getting so far with women and I have to wonder, what do I do wrong.
I know I'm not rich, but I'm a hard worker who always tries. Just can't seem to make a lasting connection with the woman of my dreams.

In my country, I personally find it very hard to get noticed and because I don't go out partying and drinking I find it even harder.
It's a perpetual loop I'm stuck in.
And not being able to go out really does not help.
I've tried a few long distance things but that doesn't ever seem to work out either..

I don't think I'm a bad looking guy, yes I'm not super skinny, or super fit. But I am tall at 6""1 or so. I have blonde hair and blue eyes.

Although I mentioned the accident. Well that's made everything more difficult for me. My speech is not perfect (so people underestimate me and think I'm dumb) and my walking is not perfect either but I'm a good, friendly, happy guy.
Yes OK I don't have a job, but due to my accident I don't need one. I think that makes people think I'm lazy.

I honestly don't know what I'm making this post for.

Was it always this way or is this a new millennial trend?

What I believe is that, for somebody to care about you, you should also be able to reciprocate. Human love and care is not like a phone maintenance app that sorts things out for you once you install it. If you want someone to love you or to care about you, you must also be ready to give back the same love and care to that person.

My adoptive parents have never been very affectionate towards me and constantly shame me for showing emotion as it‚Äôs too ‚ÄúInnapropriate‚Äù. The phrase ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù was more like an unsaid swear word and my parents were never affectionate towards eachother (explains the later divorce). They would only praise me for things like academics or sports. Not because they were proud of me just because they were Proud of themselves. extended family practically doesn‚Äôt exist, too many feuds and grudges that people just can‚Äôt seem to get over with. No kids my Age or even close to it so I‚Äôve never had a cousin or even cool auntie to lean on. I grew to hate compliments and the physical Affection my very body is starved of. Everytime people try to hug me or cuddle me I get this horrible, guilty, painful knot in my gut and I push them away. I push anyone that cares about me away even if I don‚Äôt want to because I‚Äôm so anxious on what my parents will say.

I'm 32, and I don't know if I really deserve to feel the way I do. I miss having a friend around. I am married and happy. I can talk to my spouse for literal hours. But I miss what it is like to connect with a friend over coffee or to go on a drive and listen to music blasting.

I'm a parent. I got divorced five years ago in the same year my dad died. The first people I lost were church people. Rumors of my divorce had already circulated in a matter of weeks, even though I only told my pastor and one friend. Those friends dropped like flies.

I had friends I partied with. A mixed group of men and women. I started hooking up with one and that person is now my spouse. The other people in our group partnered up a bit too but kept it casual. Honestly, I loved being with this group for a while, but going out gets expensive. Even when I didn't go out as much, we all found ways to hang out. But it's like the second I started my fling with this person and we decided to have a relationship, they were gone.

I haven't had a best friend that is non-romantic since I was 20 years old. I don't have someone I text or call when I'm excited, sad, frustrated, angry, celebratory, anything. I thought I did. There was one friend who I desperately wanted as my best friend, and it was only after their best friend ditched them that I was in line. It worked great till it didn't. This friend liked when I would hit the bar with her and I didn't want to party as much when I was in a good relationship.

The good friends I have don't live near me anymore. My family doesn't even like each other since my dad died.

I love hypnosis! I've hypnotized people in every corner of the world, using online video like Messenger. I would love to hypnotize you, to feel more confident, motivated, to heal pain from the past, and to help you reach your goals.

Hypnosis is the opposite of small talk. We both express our spiritual side... We talk about our fears, pain, and dreams. It's magical, and it's easy to make a special friendship through hypnosis.

I am spiritual, science-minded, I love beaches, forests, deserts, and especially animals.

I am business-minded, but friends and family are more important...

My closest friends are funny, sunny, and naturally chatty, ready to share a silly meme, or a special song, or just talk about a difficult day...

I love Netflix, especially V-Wars, Dracula, and Night Flyers...

I am a philosopher at heart.

After 8th grade i stopped talking to my best friend because i realized he was toxic and i didnt want to be the way i was anymore. After that i went back to school and for some reason i didnt know how to talk to others without him. Normally he would say everything and i would back him up, but now i had to talk on my own and i had no idea how to.  This lead to even less people talking to me. Now, junior year i have 3 friends, 1 of them i am fading away with because hes trying to be something hes not and i dont fw it. My other friend goes to a different school from me and my last friend i am scared to hang out with because im scared he might try and rob me someday. After i got jumped and robbed the first time i am really paranoid of new people now and it made everything worse. I live with my 18 yo cousin and he has his own big friend group and i always wish i could be like them or be friends with them. But none of them like me because they are too cool for me and i feel like my own cousin doesnt even like me anymore. Only one of his friends will actually talk to me but it is only small talk. He talks to me more than my own cousin. I try my best to have good intentions for everything but i somehow fuck it up and everyone strays away from me. I have never been invited to a party or even held a girls hand.

I have some nice clothes but nobody notices still. The only thing that really helps is weed but im not legally old enough to smoke it and my parents hate it. And after 4 years of smoking it almost everyday it doesnt even help anymore because it doesnt do anything to me. It makes me want to try other drugs but i am so so scared to because i dont want to be a bum begging others in the future, never the less i live in one of the coldest places in the world, being homeless would not be fun.

1485,hamartiated,1579232059,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2020-01-17 14:34:19

I literally woke up in one house to catch the bus, and then got off the bus at another. Kids on the bus sometimes gave me shit for it lol

But my mom keeps stalling plans for getting all my shit together, and I don't exactly have the money, or a license to do it myself. Everybody keeps giving me shit for it, and it's driving me insane, because like...what the fuck can I do? We literally don't have enough money for anything! I mean I've tried monetizing my art, or even making a web comic, but any spark of imagination I had before is just dead. It's gone. I hate everything I do. I hate myself, and fuck my best friend doesn't even seem to give two shits about me.

I love my mom, I really do, but this whole situation is slowly killing me. I honestly have to admit the only reason I'm alive is because my mom's birthday just passed, and my dog. My god damn dog guys, I love her to death and I literally cannot picture myself living and breathing without her. She's 11 and honestly overweight and a seriously believe that the only reason she's still here is for me.

I think I'm starting to push people away so that it's easier for me to end it all in the future. I see myself doing it, but I feel like I can't stop it. And I don't understand because there are people who've had it so much worse than me, who *have* it so much worse than me.

I'm so afraid to tell my mom how I'm thinking so I just pretend I'm fine, which leads me to believe that somedays I truly am, but then I'm hit with it. With everything. It just sucks. I feel like I don't have anything. I feel like the world just made me for a joke, and I just lie to myself to make myself feel better...",lonely,I hate myself,2020-01-17 13:53:45

Dissapointed by the lukewarm, flat, uninviting people who occupy the seats around my cubicle.

Tonight took the biscuit. I got drunk. I then decide to text my ex (been broken up since September, haven‚Äôt spoken since) and just went for it. I‚Äôm still hurting, and am angry. Angry that it ended and that I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in this black hole, being sucked deeper. See, when you‚Äôre me, in a situation of being isolated, your significant other tends to become someone that heals or patches that pain. She became that - to the point where I credit her for me landing my absolute dream job. 

I‚Äôm someone who is fairly civilised and quiet most of the time. But when intoxicated, it‚Äôs the complete opposite. Being angry, upset and depressed all at the same time led me to put out a few truths I wish I hadn‚Äôt, including why I thought she‚Äôd called it off. Spoiler alert: I was probably wrong on why, and it probably wasn‚Äôt her fault. Either way, no chance existed previously of us getting back together, and that hasn‚Äôt changed post-drunk text farce. 

I‚Äôm lonely. And it‚Äôs slowly killing me because I have no one to turn to 99% of the time. It‚Äôs literally me, with my own thoughts, being stupid. I hate this and I wish it would end. I wish I could have someone who cared enough to see what was going on, what my brain was melting on at work, who had said what. It‚Äôs not normal to be like this sure, but the odd scenarios growing up has left me damaged so I know nothing else apart from letting it all build up  and then taking it out on someone. 

I wish we were still together. I might‚Äôve said a million things I don‚Äôt mean, but I mean it pretty fucking much when I say I miss having a personal connection with someone, being able to say things unfiltered and most importantly, someone who cares.

Before the new year i was just lonely at the boarding school. I had no one and wanted to smoke a joint and have some happy time stronger at the weekend with a friend at home. But 3 times we couldn't because of various reasons. The 4. time was the new year's eve and that was a mistake because i invited a girl that had nothing to do and someone heard that i was making a party and came too. I knew him and it was our friend that just lived hours away and he came. The problem was that She was so fucking kind and gave me more attention than a dog. She even laid her head on to me because she was sleepy but the problem is that i was stoned and felt more than i should. I felt too much. She had social interaction with me but i didn't do anything. Didn't hug her or touched etc nothing. But i wish i could hold her ones in my arms. After they all left because it was the next day, the day was normal again. But not for me, I was somehow lonely and had a feeling that I am running out of time soon. I had that feeling for 3 Days with stress hormones replaced with happy ones. I knew i can't do anything and that she wouldn't want me, but still my body did it and wanted her. I messaged her that it was a mistake giving me so much attention. She said why? And i explained her that ""A man is starving for attention and every small compliment is enough to get interested in you"" She knew what's going on and said that she sees me only as a friend. But actually i just wanted a hug and didn't knew what i was saying. I just messed everything up. She randomly said in chat-rooms that something like love doesn't exist and I knew her and believed.

My parents are mentally abusive and can be manipulative sometimes and even when my mother was here when I was young, my childhood wasn¬¥t that great. My mom was very ill and my dad never showed me enough love. He always was on the computer playing his games, while I took care of my mother. Unfortunately she died and I was about 12 or 11 at the time. That is when my dad snapped to action all of a sudden.

I sometimes feel like they never want to deal with me because I am always depressed and have anxiety problems. When I started dating I felt something that I have always longed for. Sadly she broke up with me and that put me in a deep depression.

I was walking with him one day and wanted to be lovey dubby but then he told me that for homecoming, a girl asked him out to homecoming BEFORE we started dating and asked me if he could go out with her instead of me. This put shock and disbelief in me. I also felt heart broken that he would chose her over me. I broke up with him and also found out that the girl was my closest friend. I wish God would give me the perfect boyfriend and someone that will never treat me horribly. I pray to God to find me one and cry to myself about why my life is so bad and why I am so lonely. I cry about myself and ask why I am ugly and why no one likes me. I feel so heart broken and alone that it is driving me insane. Seeing the couples at school makes me feel worse and feel like I will never be able to have what they have.

1518,trash_jpg,1579204546,1,"Hello everyone,

The few times that I have posted on here, I would like to thank the people who responded or took the time to give me advice when I was hard on myself. I did nothing but spend the last few months of 2019 grieving over my past relationship that I have had for three years, and crying on a daily basis thinking about everything wrong that got me to where I was. I felt misunderstood and alone, and I was not content with my own company. Being alone to me was a punishment, because of the fact that I overthink or I end up crying whenever I was alone.

Truth of the matter is, when you find happiness within yourself others can find happiness within you. I have been reflecting, and I have also learn to do things alone such as going to the gym or making my own art again.  People can only help you through the journey, but they will not go for you. It may be a lonely journey to do things for yourself and discover things, but it‚Äôs perfectly normal and fulfilling at the same time to do things independently. I no longer hate being within my own company, and instead enjoy being able to build myself up to be better than the past. I can now say I worked up to where I am now, and I am currently getting certified to facilitate family groups + doing what I love.

Of course I have had help, but in the end I made the decision to be okay with doing things on my own. Being single and only keeping those I trust close allowed me to explore who I am and make my own future for myself.  Life goes on and everyone is living their own lives, and what they do doesn‚Äôt matter as long as YOU are happy. To everyone out there that can benefit from what I am saying, I hope all of you in this subreddit (and outside of it) find your happiness whether it is within yourself or a future significant other (both hopefully). Thank you to this community for showing me I am not alone, and being a contribution to what made me believe in myself again. I depart you with this final post with love and all positive vibes.",lonely,Leaving the Community,2020-01-17 06:55:46
1519,leoquintum,1579204515,1,"[A huge article in The Guardian about loneliness ](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/16/the-agony-of-weekend-loneliness-i-wont-speak-to-another-human-until-monday)



On Saturday morning, Peter got up and went to the supermarket. He carried his shopping home, and took care of his laundry and ironing. In the afternoon, he browsed a few record stores and later he cooked himself dinner; always something adventurous on a Saturday night. Afterwards, he hit Netflix. And in all those hours, in common with many of Peter‚Äôs Saturdays, not to mention his Sundays, he had no meaningful interaction with another human being. ‚ÄúThe only person I spoke to,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwas the lady who came over to verify my bottles of beer at the supermarket self-checkout.‚Äù

During the week, Peter, 62, is too busy to be lonely. His commute from Brighton to London means that his working life is ‚Äúa tunnel‚Äù he enters on a Monday and from which no daylight is glimpsed until Friday. But just when Peter re-emerges, he is stymied by an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Instead of providing respite from the stress of office life, a chance to reconnect with family and friends, the weekend looms as a vast emotional and social wilderness that must be traversed before work takes hold again.

Peter dreads the weekend. But he is far from alone in this. He is one of nearly 200 respondents, from Falmouth to Jakarta, who replied to a request on the Guardian‚Äôs website for readers to share their experience of weekend loneliness. The youngest respondent was 16; the eldest in her 70s, and between them, the pain and isolation recurred in countless iterations.

Despite all this, the phenomenon of weekend loneliness has scarcely been studied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs been researched at all,‚Äù says Pamela Qualter, professor of psychology for education at the University of Manchester. She led the BBC‚Äôs Loneliness Experiment last year, and ‚Äúfound that there didn‚Äôt seem to be a time of day [nor] a season when people felt especially lonely. But we didn‚Äôt ask about the weekend.‚Äù So what does weekend loneliness look like, who experiences it ‚Äì and what might be done to alleviate it?

‚ÄúWe define loneliness as the difference between the desire or expectation of what life should be like, and the reality,‚Äù says Kellie Payne, research and policy manager at the Campaign to End Loneliness. For those who experience loneliness primarily ‚Äì or only ‚Äì at the weekend, this painful discrepancy is intensified by the sense of being at odds not only with the world outside the door, but with one‚Äôs capable, sociable weekday self.",lonely,The agony of weekend loneliness: ‚ÄòI won't speak to another human until Monday‚Äô (The Guardian),2020-01-17 06:55:15

I‚Äôve been ghosted and had things fizzle out both fast and slow, I‚Äôve had hormone driven idiots hit on me until my only possible solace from it is a week long social media break. 

I need to have some kind of companionship outside of me and my partners relationship. I‚Äôve become too codependent and I‚Äôm afraid I am becoming toxic to him. I have no support system outside of my partner - I have a small family, but a distant relationship and hard emotional upbringing makes it impossible for me to confide in them with any part of my life. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone in my life or online with any kind of frequency.

I‚Äôve had a couple of close friends in my life, but they never last for more than a couple of years at a time normally. They tend to end explosively due to said friend‚Äôs self destructive habits that I will not condone or join in on, or they will straight stop talking to me/spending time with me as they find somebody more interesting to be friends with - quite literally a friend breakup, that hurts just as bad as a romantic one.

I need some help on figuring out where to start, I guess. For example, I like all my coworkers, but they tend to lead lifestyles outside of work that are either overall unhealthy or that I can‚Äôt follow for one reason or another.

I don‚Äôt know. I might be in the wrong place for this. Tell me if I am. But I‚Äôm lonely, and my loneliness is ruining the only real relationship I have in my life.

So, it is really hard for me to connect with people, mostly because when I was younger I'd get bullied a lot and so I always kept my distance from others for it to not happen again, once that calmed down in 6th grade I started actually making friends, met my very first best friend in 6th grade, who I now rarely talk to anymore besides for the usual ""hey"" and ""hi"".

I'm not that social as I can't keep up a conversation for more then 2 minutes without it getting weird. I don't have interesting stories to tell like others do so to have found someone was great. Next year me and my at the time best friend were apart, me in one class, him in another, we lost contact but I got along with everyone on that new class, even met my at the moment best friend, so that's cool.

3 years go by, 10th grade roles around, everyone goes their separate ways, me and 2 girls from that class get put in a class together, girl 1 now prefers to talk to the other girls and chat with her BF on the phone (we didn't talk much back then but we do crack a joke together from time to time), girl 2 is kinda childish and generally doesn't talk to me( but when she does is to ask if a drawing she made looks good), best friend failed 9th year and moved away to the bottom of the contrey (Portugal) because of family reasons, we only talk to mensages now or when he comes to visit during school vacations.

New classmates are 3 class clowns who play Fortnite but are the time of narcistic people I don't get along with, the ruff guy who dismisses classes to go see his GF, sassy popular girl, gamer girl (gets along with me), Brazilan girl who likes BTS and sweets (quite cute but I always mess up when talking to her), and Brazilian athletic extrovert dude with cash who gets the ladies ( he's nice but I just never have a topic to talk to him). They all see me as the quiet kid who's follows them, draws alone, plays UNO with them occasionally, but is super awkward. They never pick me for group projects so I'm forced to do alone or with the childish girl who also is seen as wierd.

I've tried cracking some jokes here and there, tried being snarky sometimes, even got some ""that's what she said"" moments, but I almost always get ether ignored or dismissed.

I've always had a equally-as-nerdy or another loser like me to talk to, because apes together strong, but not this year, all I got is my drawing book, social stress, dark thoughts, and the constant feeling that if I say something they'll judge me for that. And I sincerely don't know what to do..

His birthday is the 21st, but since I have class that day I asked him if he wanted to hang out on MLK weekend. I figured he wouldn't be busy since he's usually not the type to throw parties, but for MLK weekend he told me he's gonna go clubbing with two other friends, one of whom I'm also very close with (the 3 of us hangout usually every weekend), and the other whom I'm not too familiar with. 

It hurt me a lot when he told me this. To be fair, he did invite me to hang out on his actual birthday, but I'm still hurt. Why was I not invited to come along? I thought I would've been able to celebrate his birthday with him on MLK weekend. Why did my other friend not tell me anything? I thought we were all close. Is it that I'm not cool enough to go clubbing with them? 

I feel really lonely right now. I genuinely thought we were all close. We've all been close friends for 6 years now. Now I'm beginning to doing doubt if I'm as close to them as I thought I was.",lonely,"My closest friend is going out for his birthday without me, and it really hurt to find out.",2020-01-16 19:17:03
1549,Wattos_Box,1579156770,1,"I've been feeling worse and worse for a long while now.  All I do is mope around and listen to the smiths and beat myself up inside because I've got no reason to mope around.  I come from a happy and fairly wealthy family.  But lately I've just kept feeling this immense guilt for feeling down and for not knowing how I can use my privilege to help the world.  I'm a film major in college, and all I do is stew about how I don't even deserve to do something fun like that because I'm white and male and wealthy, and that kind of people have run this western world for far too long.  But I feel bad pitying my privilege because other kinds of people (just about every other kind of person) are so much worse off than me.  So I just sit around and pity myself then hate on myself for pitying myself.  And I listen to the Smiths, an emo band from the 80s.  Which I also feel bad for because Morrissey (lead singer) is a racist asshole.  And I've had writer's block for so long now.  I can't think of any good ideas, and it's all I want to do.  That and get a girlfriend.  But I'm too anxious to really even talk to pretty girls.  I even got tinder a couple weeks ago as a desperate effort to amend my life, but I've only got 3 matches and I screwed up all the conversations.  There's even this girl who I think would go out with me in real life who I had a class with last semester and saw the other day, but I can't bring it up, just like I couldn't bring it up in middle school or high school or freshman year when I fell head over heels again and again.  Probably for the best though because I don't want to make someone else's life worse by dating me.  I went out partying the other night and ended up feeling awful and ruining my own night and just sitting on someone's couch refusing to talk to anyone because ""they all know I'm a loser"".  And I just put my headphones in and sat there.  All I do when I'm with people is look forward to being alone so I don't have to worry about people not liking me.  But all I do when I'm alone is shame myself and pity myself and pine for love.  And the past couple days I just keep thinking how everyone's exactly the same so nobody is special.  And nothing matters.  I'm taking this writing class, and the teacher keeps saying, ""Write people, not characters.""  That got me thinking that, since everyone's their own main character, and they're always rational to themselves, the only way for people to be interesting is to not know each other well enough to find out they're dull.  I eat junk food and don't excercise and am too damn lazy to do any schoolwork which I really should be trying to do more. So tonight I took a free online depression test, and the results said I matched highly with ""severely depressed.""  But I don't even know what I should do and I really don't want to do anything about it.

It‚Äôs like being in elementary school and the teacher is your only friend. It never really counts. I never really count. But yet I count the days until Vday. 

I look in the mirror and see misery. I see the cracks in the mirror that only I can see. It‚Äôs Wednesday. The last text message I received was on Saturday.  No one cares now. No one will care on Vday. And the painful and debilitating truth is, no one will care on Feb 15, 16, 17...

I can‚Äôt sleep. I suppose I could, if I really wanted to. I‚Äôd been wondering why I couldn‚Äôt fix my sleep schedule. I have self control, I know how to do it - the right way too so that it sticks you know, not just a couple of decent nights. I‚Äôm not stupid. So why am I still awake? 

I figure it‚Äôs because it honestly doesn‚Äôt matter. It doesn‚Äôt matter and so I can‚Äôt bring myself to care. The things that haunt me in my life, I see them when I open my eyes, I see them when they‚Äôre closed, and when I do fall asleep I usually end up dreaming about them too. It‚Äôs that feeling of never being at peace. Nothing being distracting enough to pull me out of this sort of purgatory I seem to have gotten myself lost in. 

I‚Äôm trying really hard though, always do. What else can I do, right? And I‚Äôm really good at fooling people (most days). Nobody wants to be around the Debbie Downer. The trouble is I can‚Äôt fool myself. And isn‚Äôt that the goal, trick yourself into thinking you feel a certain way until at some point the fabricated emotions meld together with the real ones?

The realization that I have to turn 30 this year won‚Äôt leave me. It makes me want to climb into a hole with a stick of dynamite, but that‚Äôs another story for another bad night.

They wouldn't do it for absolutely no reason.. something must have happened for them to realize that I wasn't worth it as a friend to keep or even bother talking to. This may sound hypocritical of me, but I walked away from a group of other friends because I felt so left out whenever they would talk about their other friends or something they did together because I wouldn't know who or what they were talking about. And whenever I asked, I would get ignored or somebody would change the topic. At one of the previous places I worked at, I was definitely a crappy person  because I talked smack about some of the girls so that was definitely my fault for that. My only ""friend"" right now is somebody I've realized is a narcissist and I just don't want to be a pushover and have to listen to her talk about whatever.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I have ""friends,"" but they never message me. Never check up on me. Never ask me to hang out. Never invite me to do things. Nothing. The only time I interact with them is if I message them or if I invite them to something. They told me to vocalize my problems. When I did this every once in a while, they would run away. Everytime I say what's on my mind, I feel like a burden. Who wants to hear someone talk about their issues? I'm supposed to keep smiling and tending to their needs, right?

I'm 22 and I feel like I'm destined for loneliness. My mother was single all of my life, and I dont even see myself finding companionship or a best friend. I'm never invited to hang with anyone, but see said people hanging on social media and am always the person that's never invited. There was a comment about feeling like the Truman show where there's something wrong with me that everyone else knows besides me and no one wants to let me in on it. Today I was asking a friend of my crush if I should ask them to be my valentine on valentine's day. I told them I didn't want to necessarily date them, but I wanted to take them out on a date and tell them how I feel. I was told it was a selfish move and they already know how I feel and they dont feel the same way. I feel like shit for not realizing this, and I have no experience with romantic or emotional relationships. No one's ever had any sort of romantic interest in me and I don't see it ever happening. I just want to be loved by someone who knows me other than my family. The closest person I ever came to dating sent me a snapchat from their new boyfriend's account on new year's wishing me a happy new year, and the last time I talked to that person in person I asked them if we could ever have a shot, only for them to make out with my teammate in the club not even 5 minutes later. I'm a college student who gets no financial aid and am racking up loans and paying out of pocket and I'm 9 credits away from graduation, but I dont even feel like I belong in my field based off interactions with my peers. I joined orgs and I do a sport and stay active, but I still dont feel like I belong. I honestly feel like I don't belong anywhere in the world. I dont know what I'll do or where I'll go after I graduate. Everything I touch I feel like goes to failure, and I work in a restaurant job as a food runner and busser where I've worked for almost three years without the chance to become a server and make some more money instead of barely scraping by with rent every month. I feel like I'm destined for nothing and am a side character in everything I do. I'm not looking for sympathy this is the one place where I feel like someone actually understands me. I always say I have plans to own land when I'm 40 and just have a farm with dogs. I wish there wasn't a need for companionship. I've cried more in the past hour than I have in years. I'm not suicidal. I am lonely and I feel this is the only thing that is certain about my future. Everyone and everything feels so superficial and I wish I didn't want to feel a need to fit in or belong somewhere. At this point I'm giving up on trying to find someone or somewhere where I belong.

That was until the last few weeks. After being inspired by someone's story late last year I started applying for jobs in September and was employed by October. It was nice to have aquatances to talk to every week, even if it was only ever small talk. I even approached a cute girl for the first time in my life and we talked regularly.

Long story short after the New Year they let a ton of people go and I was one of them. I thought I'd be fine going back to the way things were, boy was I wrong. It feels really fucking lonely and pretty depressing. I've also been drinking more than I probably should. I never thought I'd miss having something to do.

For some reason, I come across as awkward and the type of girls that I like typically aren‚Äôt into that. I could go into a long list of things that I personally find fucked up about myself but frankly I think you‚Äôve all heard the speech about a depressed lonely male who doesn‚Äôt really care enough about himself to even make an effort at this point. While I think I could tell that story in a number of ways, that‚Äôs not we‚Äôre here for. 
Typically I think that because of the person that I am, the girls who develop feelings for me are girls who typically pity me. Now I know pity isn‚Äôt a word that you‚Äôd probably describe the situation with, but as a teenager trying to date and having this feeling that I couldn‚Äôt provide for anyone especially myself. This kinda manifested into my current lack of willingness to do anything for myself. 
That‚Äôs why i think that any girl attracted to that may treat their man with something akin to pity or a lacking. Not being able to provide or contribute to anything in my family would just make me feel useless. At the same time though I would like to experience all aspects of my life instead of just working all the time, but again story for another time. 
I‚Äôve yet to meet a women confident enough to bring the confidence out of me because broken people are attracted to each other. Maybe this is a similar feeling but i think that the best man has a stronger woman behind him. That said there is no real best man anymore. Most of the young men in the world today, i being one, are either broken or douchebags. Kinda obvious choice for alot of people.

My family and friends don‚Äôt care about my sexuality, and I don‚Äôt care about my orientation either because it doesn‚Äôt define me as a person nor does it make me into a stereotypical homosexual man... 

For years I‚Äôve struggled to understand why I am single. And for the longest time I felt like it was because I was unattractive, useless, fat, a loser, ugly, and multiple other things I try not to think about myself.... every guy I‚Äôve dated has either ghosted me, wanted sex from me, or something THEY wanted... all I‚Äôve ever been after is a guy who‚Äôll love my heart and make me feel like I matter and validated. I know that there‚Äôs this big thing where you have to rely on yourself and that you have to be happy with yourself before you can be with anyone else. My argument with that is that I‚Äôm not unhappy with myself per say, just that my past affects me in ways I wish it wouldn‚Äôt and that shit is hard to get rid of when it has affected you so deeply and is rooted into your psyche, that you can‚Äôt just get rid of it over night. I have been healing for A while now. 

I guess what I don‚Äôt understand is why is it so hard to date another guy? What is there to do when you‚Äôre out of ideas and options that you feel will fail because all of the other times have failed? Especially when that person has said they‚Äôre interested in you and they end up flaking or ghosting on you after weeks of non stop talking and getting to know one another...

The problem here is that I sometimes don't feel like I'm getting the same care and love back.

This year we started high school and a lot changed. They're different. But we all change. I changed a lot too. For the better, I like to think. It's just that through all these changes I've supported them and done nearly everything possible, but then gotten little in return. 

I oftentimes ask them if they're okay. I check in after a rough day. I make sure they're eating and pay for their meals when they didn't pack a lunch.

I just wish someone would ask if I'm okay and genuinely listen, instead of barely acknowledging my problem and just moving on. I've talked to them about this before and disclosed that a lot of the time I don't feel loved or appreciated, but it's usually a halfhearted answer and then the conversation turns to them.

I guess a part of this is my fault. A lot of people are like this with me. I took on the ""mature"" role when we were younger. Kept us out of a bit of trouble. Often posed as the voice of reason, even if it meant not having as much fun. Guess' they got used to it and now feel it normal. But I'm tired of feeling like a parent watching them.

but then there are people like me who just loves loneliness. i dont have social anxiety i just hate social life because its seems very shallow for me (my opinion). i also dont like attention.

the longer you talk, the longer you are in the center of attention therefore i always talked/talk in half sentences. many years later i realized im really bad at speaking and languages at all because i dont talk much and the best way to learn it is just by doing it. this is the only problem i have because of the loneliness hahah.

here are the reasons why i love loneliness

* **freedom**
* no obligations (for example in a friendship)
* no accepting or denials
* no overthinking or atleast less
* no explantations
* no expectations
* nobody recognizes you on the streets
* more money left over

there are probably more reasons that I couldn't think of. cheers",lonely,i love loneliness,2020-01-16 07:26:54

My purity went for a beat

Licking their lips thinking its normal to let them at it
Laying there mixed with confusion and emotions
Just let them go through their sexual motions.

It sure feels as if there should be someone out there for me, but I‚Äôm slowly starting to give up on that dream. 

About 4 months ago I started really putting in the extra effort to make myself look appealing. I‚Äôd shower, shave, and fight acne more frequently. I‚Äôd pick new clothes I wouldn‚Äôt typically wear that would look better on me. I got new shoes, a new haircut and started at least trying to get out there via tinder or whatever. I much prefer trying to find someone online because honestly I‚Äôm not very talkative and I‚Äôm really shy in public. To this day I‚Äôve never been the one to walk up to a stranger and talk to them. Anyway, I‚Äôm really trying my best but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any hope left for me. 

Yesterday was my first day of class this new semester in college. And I don‚Äôt know why I never really paid much attention to this before, but I noticed that of all the 30 or so people in that room literally every single one of them was better-looking than me. Every female in that class is far out of my league in terms of appearance and every male in that class would be a more attractive pick for a romantic partner than me. I really don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. Tinder is useless, I‚Äôll swipe and swipe for hours every single day and won‚Äôt get any matches for weeks and when I do the conversation doesn‚Äôt go anywhere other than ‚Äúhi.‚Äù Sometimes they unmatch me as soon as I‚Äôm about to message them and this is probably why. 

What sucks is that I never considered myself especially bad looking or ugly. I always thought of myself as neither good or bad looking, just plain average. I mean I‚Äôm not fat at all, I‚Äôm not short, I don‚Äôt have any missing teeth, I have acne but not nearly as bad as I used to have it. It‚Äôs just, when I look at everyone else my age and how they look and carry themselves, I‚Äôm not anywhere near the middle I‚Äôm like down near the bottom of the barrel. I mean I know looks aren‚Äôt everything but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to charm anyone with my personality, I can barely answer my teacher when he asks me a direct question.

I'm almost 34,a virgin and have had 1 girlfriend my entire life. That was back when I was 17 and barely lasted 2 months. 

I'm not really very sociable, I have few friends and in my head I'm the kind of guy who thinks most people dislike me. I spend most of my time alone, unless I'm at work or for some reason one of my friends might actually wanna hang out. 

I don't really feel like I've had many life experiences, can't even imagine talking to a woman (like how do I do that). I met my gf in college, it just kinda happened and well yeah it didn't last long. Since then, yeah no chance. I don't see how a woman would ever be interested in me. Barely anyone is interested in me.

What a sad state of affairs. 

Just need some advice, I've tried going to meetup groups but I really have to push myself to go, and everyone is so much more interesting than me. I've tried tinder, bumble etc for the past year but had no luck. If I do match they either delete me or things go nowhere.

Sorry for the long post, if anyone wants to chat and maybe be friends I'd like that. Just DM me here, I don't know how to DM people (every time I've tried it messes up). I have a bunch of other apps to chat on if you want as reddit kinda sucks for that.

1619,extrapulpoj,1579105206,1,"This week is the first week of classes at my college. Yesterday night, I finished all my classes before my other 3 housemates did, so I was home. They came back about two hours later, bringing their friends from their classes back to my home without asking. Typically, I‚Äôm okay with this, but they didn‚Äôt even introduce me to them, nor did their friends introduce themselves to me. My housemates know that I‚Äôm awkward around new people due to a history of social anxiety and depression, so it‚Äôs really difficult for me to make the first move to talk. They all just looked at me, and continued to talk, like I wasn‚Äôt there. We were all in the living room, so I was just sitting there awkwardly, while they were all chatting and laughing and having a good time. 

At that moment, it was like I didn‚Äôt exist, like I wasn‚Äôt even there in the room. They didn‚Äôt even notice that something was wrong with me, that inside, I was freaking out, feeling the emotions of loneliness like never before, and at that moment, I was ostracized to my own isolated bubble. I sat on that couch awkwardly until they left, about 4 hours later. 4 hours of torture. Why didn‚Äôt I go up to my room before then? Why didn‚Äôt I just suck it up and introduce myself to them? I had no clue.

Later that night when they left, I just wallowed in my own depression and anxiety, kicking myself for making the whole situation awkward. I blamed my housemates for not introducing me to them, I blamed their friends for not introducing them to me, when they saw me first thing coming through the door. But I blamed myself the most, for my depression and anxiety, for freezing at that moment and making the whole situation worse for me. And then I had thoughts of them talking about me after they left, about the awkward Asian girl sitting on the other couch alone, not even attempting to make conversation. I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself, and it generated a feeling of loneliness I‚Äôve never felt in my life.

Around new years I found out that my partner of many years had been cheating on me, and they left me for the other person and took our friendship group with her, and my family don't get along with each other whatsoever and all my own friends had moved away, so I was starting this new year totally alone. 

In a sense, the thought of that felt refreshing but I felt totally worthless simultaneously. It was my birthday a couple of days ago too, and I spent the day alone, with only a stranger on Facebook wishing me a happy birthday, which made that feeling of worthlessness even more powerful.

Aside from people issues, I suffer from an infuriating eye disease called Keratoconus which has gotten worse lately and I'm so frightened of the thought of losing my eyesight (treatments are really expensive AND risky).

With all this against me, I still made all these resolutions: join a gym, read more, pick up my music playing, work on my mental health etc. but I have a horrible anxiety and creeping depression that tells me that nothing's going to get easier, and I always fall back into a pit of self-loathing with a horrible lack of motivation where I end up just sitting alone in my bedroom.

I put a lot of thought on things automatically being easier as soon as the calender said 2020, which was obviously delusional of me.

How do I shake the feeling that everything I do is just doomed to fail, and that I'm just stuck existing and not living, and how do I actually get through the bad without letting it cripple me?

In all honestly, this is a cry for help - I've been comfortably unhappy, lonely and mundane for so long that the thought of feeling anything else is frightening.

With my friends are interests are so far and different from each other starting conversation is hard asf without boring them to death. Because of what I like no one just wants to keep a conversation with me. Even with people who have similar interests or exactly like mine I still can‚Äôt keep a conversation. Like what is so wrong with me that I can‚Äôt even keep a conversation?

Me being young (17 about to be 18 in 2 and a half months) when I talk about my loneliness and how I feel isolated everyone just tells me hey you‚Äôre young and things will just happen for you you‚Äôll be alright. So basically I‚Äôm too young to feel the way I do because it‚Äôs supposed to be better in college? Lmao sure.  Seriously trying to date rn is a fucking enigma and will only be worse in college and in my 20‚Äôs. I‚Äôm probably just gonna pay a worker to finally have sex. 

I know and all my friends (not exaggerating this part) have kissed someone and have had sex all at 15-16 or done things similar. I have not even been kissed on the goddamn forehead that‚Äôs how repulsive I am.  And not as often as before but conversations turn into about their causal sex life‚Äôs and relationships. So now I‚Äôm left out completely for a good 15 minutes while I sit there just waiting for something to kill the conversation. 

And literally just this weekend it was a hangout between three of us and one of them started talking about their gf with the other guy.  So I crack a small joke about me being lonely. He basically said stop being sad or feeling sad every-time relationships are brought up.  Yeah bro lemme just pretend being lonely while you all have gfs doesn‚Äôt eat at my soul. Yeah lemme just pretend that the fact that I am the only one of two people in the group to never have intimacy or relationship doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. Seriously the most insensitive thing said to me. But ofc he says it he has a gf and has that love from his partner I want so he wouldn‚Äôt understand the literal mental torture of seeing relationships in your face and knowing you‚Äôll never be adequate for one and it‚Äôll only be worse. 

At this point I‚Äôm done literally beating myself up, I‚Äôm done trying to cry and not managing too, done with high school and not looking forward to college anymore, and so done with being alone.

I guess I want attention. I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends. I only talk to like 3 people who I really trust. It‚Äôs been so hard for me to deal with my loneliness. I‚Äôve been sexually abused and severely bullied and I think that might affect how I handle relationships. It hurts me to see my friends blow me off to go spend time with their boyfriends/girlfriends. It hurts to see couples at school. It hurts to see my friends having happy relationships on social media, posting about how much they love their partner, the gifts they give them. The relationships I have been in were almost always toxic. I have never dated anyone longer than a month before being dumped, sometimes ghosted. I had a boyfriend who was very abusive looking back. He hit me in my face. After I have my consensual virginity to him he broke up with me the day after. He seemed so nice. I never see it coming. I try to be a good girlfriend, I really do. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. A lot of guys say they find me attractive, or have crushes on me. But when I try to date someone it never works out. 


I feel like I‚Äôm always a second choice, if I‚Äôm even a choice at all. No one ever wrote me poems. My boyfriend forgot about my birthday. A girl I dated blew off our date to go get high. I recently quit social media, at least for awhile. I‚Äôm the only one out of my friend group who is single and it fucking hurts. I‚Äôve never had anyone who was proud to be with me. No one ever put my name in their bio with a heart. No one ever called me out of the blue just to tell me they loved me. No one ever got me presents. No one ever talked about me. My bf told his friends that I was a slut and retarded because I rode the short bus. He told me never to tell anyone that we were dating, he refused to hold my hand in public. Now he‚Äôs had a new girlfriend for a year and treats her like a queen. They do everything together, and he constantly goes on about how amazing she is. His new gf used to be my friend. They still bully me sometimes. 


I just needed to get that out. It really hurts. My heart hurts and I‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt want to go to school anymore and watch everyone be loved and appreciated except me. It fucking hurts. I feel so worthless, and I feel stupid for being upset over it. I know it doesn‚Äôt matter but it‚Äôs still so painful.",lonely,Being lonely hurts,2020-01-15 15:46:28

1661,hamartiated,1579057212,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Months ago my wife told me to start dating because she didn't want me to suffer while she figured out what she wanted to do. I will not see other people while I am legally married, but I do suffur from loneliness. On the weeks my wife has our daughters I am entirely alone. On the weeks I have my girls, I still fill my wife and step son missing.

I wanted to ask if this subreddit allows people to actually meet in person. Of course safety is paramount and any meetings should be conducted in a public place with lots of people around. I ask because it seems groups of people would benefit from meeting one another. All that stands in the way is getting to know where the people are located. I'm not talking about dating. I'm talking about making friends and possibly groups of people socializing. I posted about my situation and recieved replies from other men that are in my situation or have been in my situation. It would be wonderful if the tools were available on Reddit for me to meet these guys and discuss things.

I just came back from hiking with my family. We did Mt Tronador's Paso de las nubes at Bariloche, Argentina. We sleep at the mountain refugge qnd then come back by other side of the mount.  Would sound nice but actually was crappy. My brother being edgy, my mom had a breakdown because she couldn't stand my brother and keep with us and my father was so troubled to come back don't so late. Fuck. The best part was when we talked with a couple (around their late 20s-30s)  when we was coming back and the view from above the mountain (i took like 20 photos) 


Mean while i just looked ig and facebook and people seems to be having fun. For instance the guy that used to be my friend (but later turned shit) ate Sushi with his family and later went to a pool party with my former group of friends (who seemed to be having fun too) and got drunk by vodka, my ex seems to be happy (at least i what i wanted for her), a friend seems that come back with her ex (that 2 weeks ago did some surgery to lose weight)  and having a nice time at beach, and another ""friend"" seems to be having fun gaming with her girl

Fuck. Why i can't have anything nice? I mean obviously i love Bariloche, especially the views and walking and hiking around there but fuck, is so hard to enjoy when my family is arguing, i have my own insecurities, and even the last time that i told someone that i liked this sort of things people was like ""Why the hell do u like to climb mountains and took photos?

I really dont know what to write or if I even should...

From outside people would think my life is fine, but it really isnt... am graduating at the moment, but with huge struggle. I dont know if it is the stuff I need to learn, or the permanent feeling of being isolated. 

I was alone my whole life. I got someone from time to time, but im just incapable of keeping people interested in me... or is it the other way around? I feel like in todays world you have to be alltime happy to be able to find other people... to be liked. But what if you're depressed 24/7, because no one really is interested in you. And because no one is interested in you, you are depressed 24/7? 

I'm in that black hole again. I don't know where to go or what to do with my life. I used to be a stoner... It worked so well.. took away all the thoughts and the pain. I didn't care anymore and sadly these years were the only years I could live ""happy"".

Then police came in the way and I got the warning shot. I was lucky they did not find anything in my car, but well... they took my blood to the doc.

we broke up because she was young and confused about herself and it hurt like hell but i understood and supported her. we never fought or anything. i had eaten some of my meds (prescribed for anxiety) klonopin, and that makes me emotional and def didnt help.

this last weekend we fought. i overreacted over some communication break downs. it made me feel betrayed and lied to and i told her as much but it all came out so messy. we both ended up crying and then when she left to her new place yesterday it felt bad.

today she is texting me saying she regrets this move and it was a mistake and how lonely she is but i dont know how to make it up to her. i told her i would like a chance to make it all up and be better because i know it can be, neither of us were ourselves over this weekend and i realized how stressed i am.

i'm just writing to get this off my chest i guess. i'm also always receptive to any advice. do i walk away from all of this and embrace my loneliness or should i keep trying and see were it goes? as of now, i am going to try to be positive and if she gives it a chance and i try and it doesn't work i will accept that outcome.

1709,nootroopical,1579012785,1,"This is a third person story written from the account of a now nineteen year old man, and it is not indicative of being written directly by that person, as there is no proof of that accusation:

"" There once was a man of eighteen years of age who made a huge mistake out of desperation and recklessness because he was cheated on by his ex-girlfriend of two years. An emotional/ sexual cheat that was not obvious (i.e. daily lies to the face, no hints, no communication, nothing). Because of this mistake, he can't legally use the internet or social media. He was sent to jail, where he hit rock bottom, and had nothing left to look forward to, no way to fix his reputation, and nobody or anything to call his own. When he got out after two weeks, he was depressed, yes, but a burning motivation kept him going: if he could push himself hard enough, he could fix the hole in his soul. He clung on to what little he had: a girl living in another state that would still text him, the kratom that got him high enough to forget, the positive notion that his family cared about him, and the opportunity to meet girls. He wandered around outside, sometimes visiting places where people were at, at first managing the confidence to talk to strangers, but after constant rejection, sometimes from embarassing details about his charges slipping out, and other times from mere social awkwardness/ unlikeability, that confidence dwindled. He put his all into the girl that would still text him, perhaps even fell in love, but she was disgusted by who he was on the inside now, despite her physical attraction to him, and the chemistry they had in conversation. Because of this, she talked to him no more, but made sure to deeply insult him and the songs he would write for her just to get him off her back. He found his ex's old number, the same ex that cheated on him, got the man she cheated on him with to threaten to fight our main character, and tried to hack our main character's google account, and told her that he's sorry, and that he forgives her for what she did, while also telling her about how degraded his mental health/ life has become. To this she had the man she cheated on him with message our main character, telling him to leave them alone, and that his mistakes are his own, to which he agreed as there was nothing left to gain in fighting. Because of her doing this, he could no longer forgive her, so she condemned him to more pain and hatred. He worked for his dad doing hard labor every day that just barely got him enough money to survive, and he still was expected to make debt payments off of that money. His dad was emotionless, and struggled to see his son as a son, as he didn't grow up with his father, and his father has mental issues of an odd nature. His dad often chose his step mom over him, and would mistreat his son to demonstrate loyalty to the step mom at times. His step mom wanted to tear down the main character for her own benefit, as she always has. His mother was reliable but often selfish, and incapable of talking to him about his problems deeply. Both parents were often more concerned with their self-interest than their son's, though sometimes the mother would care and try to help her son's mental health. He saw a therapist, but it didn't help, and he couldn't afford him. He started taking kratom more and more, becoming increasingly desperate and reckless, driving 115 miles down the road just to save time and because he didn't value life anymore. At times the thoughts of suicide would consume him, and he'd think about how he's going to do it, and if it was worth it or not. Sometimes he was stuck in place, no motivation to move anymore, and only thoughts of regret. He can't make music because the songs he writes begin to mean nothing so long as there is nobody in his life of meaning, the depressing lyrics that spew out don't feel like him and he hates them, they're pointless. He can't talk to anyone, there's nobody, he can't use social media to get a girlfriend anymore because anything is better than going back to jail, he has no friends, and he doesn't know how to make them. He went to church groups, despite losing faith, only to feel more disconnected than ever to other human beings. He's far away from the people he went to highschool with. His father is threatening to fire him, despite knowing the depths of his sadness, because he didn't show up to work today. The only thing that can fix him is the very thing that eludes him, and so with time he dives deeper and deeper into the very same mindset that got him in trouble in the first place. He's facing two to three years prison time and has nothing to show for his time ""free"" on bail. If he goes to jail for any amount of time, it could very well be a death sentence.

Anyways, I‚Äôm in a low place and I couldn‚Äôt help but think about how much of a loser I am. She was a friend in my freshman year of highschool let‚Äôs call her A. I was shy and awkward but I managed to be funny sometimes. I didn‚Äôt think much of A and me until the next year

 A came back and I felt so warm and happy being around her. She was so sweet and goofy and cute to me. But my friend also liked A and asked for my advice to ask her out. I helped him while hating myself. 

Fast-forward and A breaks up with him and I end up dating A‚Äôs friend, this doesn‚Äôt last long though because A‚Äôs friend tells me that she really likes her best friend, I break up with her. We never actually kissed.

The next year I came back I went on without catching any feelings thank god, until A was looking more and more beautiful again to me. Her laugh and her calming voice just stirred something inside me and I tried asking A out again. She says she‚Äôs not ready. A week later I see her with another one of my friends snuggled up together and flirting all the time. I stop talking to A for awhile but at the end I apologize for it. She says ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok let‚Äôs be friends again‚Äù 

Senior year comes, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm hideous as much and I start to see that maybe I‚Äôm not that bad. I ask A out like an idiot and she says she‚Äôll think about it but she‚Äôs not looking for anything because of her last relationship with my friend. Later on I overhear how she talked to other girls that she was going to other school parties to find a ‚Äúman to cuff‚Äù at this point I‚Äôm a senior and all my friends graduated. I‚Äôve only hung out with her and other senior girls. All they do is whisper in front of me. I stop hanging out with them.

She does end up dating another guy,  a junior at our school for the rest of the year. My soul must be black and so repulsive

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I go to youth group once a week but I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for a long time (yes, I go to therapy for it) and it‚Äôs ridiculously hard to put myself out there..not to mention that it‚Äôs only a few people. My head spins, I can‚Äôt breathe, my mind goes blank whenever I try to think...; I don‚Äôt really have social skills. It‚Äôs hard to find where I fit in too. I have an older sister and sometimes I go out with her, but I‚Äôm always the tag-along. Whenever I‚Äôm with her it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm invisible anyways. I‚Äôve tried. 

My town is really small, and there‚Äôs not really any home-school support groups. Not that many people are homeschooled here anyways. I could maybe get a job, but that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been able to think of. I‚Äôm not really good at sports or anything like that. But the whole not getting out thing is getting really bad. Panic attacks and nightmares have been insane lately. I‚Äôve gotten over a lot of things but confidence is something I‚Äôm having a hard time gaining. I wish I could just ‚Äòput myself out there‚Äô but it‚Äôs almost like I physically can‚Äôt. I really need help. I don‚Äôt really have any background friends either?? So I can‚Äôt make friends through them??? I just desperate to get some socialization.

1762,Pak3tt1,1578962908,1,"This all happened earlier today at school.
I was on my way to my school sofas to wait for my bus, then a girl stopped me and asked for my name then my instagram. After that i sat down on one of those 1 person sofas and she sat on the 1 next to me. She didn't say anything at first, she was just looking at me and smiling. Then she asked some basic guestions about me and we chatted a bit, she then asked why do i always sit alone in the cafeteria. I just said that i don't have any friends. After that she suggests that i sit with her next time. At this point i notice that her breath smelt like alcohol, so i ask her if she was drunk. She giggles and says yes. There is a moment of silence and she just keeps staring at me with her head resting on her arms, while biting on her lip. I had to start walking to my bus stop, so i tell her i habe to go, but she tells me she's coming too. She asks me if she could hold on to me for support cause she was drunk and had a hard time walking. She hugs my arm and we  head out. We chat a bit more, then she asks me to smile for some reason. Now that we reached the bus stop, she stops me and gets kinda close to my face and tells me ""we will see again rigth?"" I said yes.  We looked at eachother for a little longer and she says ""you do have pretty eyes"" she then walked back inside without any problems.
After school at like 8-pm she sends me a message, and they go like this.
Her: Hey sorry about earlierüòÖ
Me: It's oküòÇ
Her: is it?üôÉ
Her: Well.. thanks for not getting ""traumatized""üòÇ

1768,human_875,1578960432,1,"       Yesterday my boyfriend and I broke up officially. He was basically cheating on me, he told me and promised it would never happen again, only to find out that the did it later that night.
      Almost two years ago my wonderful ex boyfriend asked me to be his and I said yes. We had to hide our relationship for almost a whole year but eventually our parents were okay with it and we could be happy. About a week ago he told me that he wasn‚Äôt feeling the spark anymore but didn‚Äôt want to break things off so we decided to go on a break for a week. Two days into that he decided that‚Äôs not what he wanted to do and asked me to be his again. I said yes because I missed and loved him and that day after school we went to McDonald‚Äôs. Ok the walk there he told me about who he was flirting with that day while we weren‚Äôt together and then told me that he had been flirting with other girls while we were together. 
       I got extremely angry and walked away and told him not to talk to me anymore but he asked me to come back and I felt bad so I did. We both continued walking and he asked me to officially be his again, and I told him as long as he stopped flirting with other girls and he said okay, and promised it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. 
       We went to a game later that night at our school  and he went to a friends house and spent the night afterward. The next day I get a call from him because we normally always talked when we woke up in the morning and he told me that he was flirting with a girl there and was going to try to take things further and I lost it and ended it with him. 
      He wanted to break up for a while but didn‚Äôt do I guess this was his way of making me do it so he wouldn‚Äôt be the bad guy. I miss him so so much and aside from everything I‚Äôve said here I miss him so much and aside from flirting with other girls he had made me the happiest I had ever been and I never wanted to leave.
       Since we broke up I‚Äôve been crying excessively over the last few days knowing that I‚Äôll never have the man of my dreams back. He was the man I wanted to marry, start a family with and spend the rest of my life with and now that‚Äôs all just gone. I‚Äôm feeling pretty hopeless and if I could do anything to earn him back I would, but I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs not possible.

One year ago from today, I used to have a lot of friends. I was social, happy, and hopeful. I had a community of friends that I surrounded myself with in college and we hung out and bonded almost every night. 

Sometime around last year, I started to date this girl, and things were amazing. Little did I know, this girl and I were more different than I thought, especially our perspective in life. But I loved her, so I started to see things her way and changed.... I began to lose all my friends... I became more negative... and I became more isolated from everyone. 

My gf started to get controlling and I lost it. I broke up with her but regretted it immediately after so I begged her to get back with me and she did a month later. This is when things really start going downhill... people that I thought liked me started talking shit about me behind my back... the insults and jokes I heard being said about me hurt because they weren‚Äôt true. But who‚Äôs gonna know what‚Äôs true or not right? People are only going to believe what‚Äôs more entertaining to them. As long as they have something spicy to gossip and laugh at, they don‚Äôt care about my well being or the truth. My gf‚Äôs friends all look down on me and I know they have no respect for me as a person. This bothered me for months, as I am not used to drama or hate towards my way. 

I guess I was naive to think that this world is full of sunshine and rainbows. This past 7 months made me a dry, numb, and cold person.

‚ÄúLets suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream
And you would naturally as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes

You would have every kind of pleasure, you see
And after several nights you would say, ""well that was pretty great.""
But now lets have a surprise, lets have a dream which isn‚Äôt under control
Well something is going to happen to me that i don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs gonna be
Then you would get more and more adventurous, and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream, and finally you would dream where you are now

If you awaken from this illusion
And you understand that black implies white
Self implies other
Life implies death
You can feel yourself, not as a stranger in the world
Not as something here on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental

The only thing I used to love doing was working out but I lost my love for bodybuilding and I fell out of shape. I‚Äôm still a virgin and I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend. My only person I love was my internet friend. It took me 5 years just to see I was being used and manipulated. She wanted my eyes on her only and prevented me from ever even thinking about seeking a relationship with someone else while she got with other men. I applied for a job and I got pretty close, I just never got a call back. After months and months of bad news, I‚Äôm too afraid of leaving the house now, especially since the new year. I told myself that things would change, I would go to the gym, I would pursue 3D modeling and make that child inside of me happy and make a game. Hell, I even had plans of getting Tinder and at least leaving the house more to see someone at least. I fell flat on all of those plans.

1821,coneydiscopalace,1578901614,1,"I‚Äôm already in my mid 20s and have had the same 3 irl friends since I was a little kid. I never really developed the same social skills that they did when I was young due to childhood social anxiety disorder/ panic disorder, and I didn‚Äôt have the typical ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù that allowed them to meet and connect with new people. I‚Äôve also never gone on a single date, never been in a relationship, never experienced any kind of intimacy, etc. I try my best to reach out, go to meetups, concerts, try dating apps, etc, but nothing ever comes out of it and I end up quitting and feeling pathetic and unwanted.

If I had more friends besides those three, I wouldn‚Äôt really care about them having large social circles as well as more close friends, but that‚Äôs not the case so I can‚Äôt help but feel jealous. When I‚Äôm hanging out with their mutual friends, I‚Äôm always the awkward third wheel listening to them laugh about their inside jokes. Same is true when they‚Äôre with their significant others. It‚Äôs almost like they pity me so they just let me tag along because they know I‚Äôm lonely and barely have anyone else to talk to. Whenever they post pictures on social media of them hanging out/socializing, it‚Äôs always been with other people. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre embarrassed of being seen with me.

And because we‚Äôre ‚Äúold‚Äù now, most of us are distant in the literal sense. And also incredibly busy. But I‚Äôm still in education (I started college late) while they‚Äôre employed so they are much busier. That‚Äôs why I feel like a pathetic burden when I text them to say hi or send a dumb meme or ask if they want to hang out when they are near my area. I don‚Äôt take it personally at all if they say no, but it makes me feel dumb and bothersome for asking in the first place. I am also always the first person to reach out which means that I am thinking of them much more than they are thinking about me. It‚Äôs embarrassing and pathetic.

1827,Hardyscott,1578896274,1,"So I met this guy on Discord, he's 20 and pretty much a good guy who likes helping people go through their depression, but before that he was quite lost between a crossroad whether or not he should care for his mother or not and he posts a post here on this subreddit from where this girl came out in support of him to tall to him and sooner they became friends. Despite of him repeatedly telling her she was like a Sister to him because of her age, she indirectly tried to flirt with him and also used to get jealous everytime he'd talk to someone who'd make him feel more comfortable talking to rather than talking to her.

One fine day he got done with her and ended their friendship and her anger and jealousy took a big turn as she and her friends cropped out some screenshots which don't even make any sense, as he just asks about the age of 4 girls whom he thinks are above 18 with whom he could talk to, also when he found out they weren't he even said ""striked off my list"" and didn't even talk to them or even dm them first which even they acknowledged as well but this girl used three different screenshots and cropped them into making it look like a conversation which doesn't even get along and tried to get people to go against him which wasn't working as that screenshot looked clearly photoshopped with 3 scrollers, however they did everything they could like using alternate accounts to dm people and convince them despite of getting banned but nothing worked.

Atlast in the end they came on Reddit and posted a small paragraph saying he's a pedophile and mentally ill and many believed it without proper proofs and his DMs started to get flooded with hate comments and people asking him to die on Reddit and on Discord. Also if he was a pedophile one of the girl's whose name was among those 4 girls whose age he asked that girl to find once wouldn't have been his friend even today and even through this whole rough time because she stood up for him as soon as she found out because he never really texted her 17 when he found out she was a minor and they both ended up being good friends and siblings

In the end, atlast after battling with all of this for two months and also presenting his proofs earlier two months back in the server already he decided to talk about it on YouTube as people are just believing in whatever those people are writing on Reddit and he made the video as Reddit doesn't allow all of the screenshots. He talks about how much all of this have had an impact on him but still he is surviving and moving along ignoring all the facts. He also warns people that those psychopaths might be making fake accounts as well as their final resort as they have his picture and he tells people that he doesn't DM or Comment on anybody's pics or talk to anybody in DMs. He also asks people to verify the screenshots people present by asking Message Link &amp; User ID and report to the concerned Social Media Company as this is a serious issue and screenshots can't be trusted!

1847,hamartiated,1578883758,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2020-01-13 13:49:18

I plan to use this account for the times when it gets really hard , when the silence is just deafening and I just struggle with finding some actual happiness ( or you know the good chemicals for my brain )

The times when I‚Äôm just alone with my thoughts and I noticed this giant void , this really shitty aching pain in my chest , which you can‚Äôt put a plaster over. Why do I have to feel this way??

I guess I‚Äôve done the easy part which is acknowledging I‚Äôm fucking lonely with a side helping of what I probably think is acute depression but I‚Äôll try to hide the depression with my poor attempt of humour and comedy , the kind that you pay someone to stop and fuck off, or go Awwwhh , or when they say ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure how you really meant to amend this , no one taught me how to deal with it , there was no manual or Q&amp;A session after school about this shit , so these days I‚Äôm just winging it making sure I somehow put the left shoe on my left foot. Baby steps I guess?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1876,Alive-Builder,1578871604,1," 

Basically i'm from Finland. I've been born around 14.02.1997

I also have been diagnosed with learning disability since i was a child. I can't remember what age, but when i had to go to first grade, it wasn't a normal school, it was a class, which we call in Finland ''Pienryhm√§'' I also have had OCD symptoms during my childhood such as compulsive hand washing, symmetry obsessions,Checking, and recently I've had obsessive thoughts.

I have not been diagnosed with OCD of any form.

In this small group class i was heavily bullied. I had 2 name calling names. such as ''squeaky toy'' ''stutterer''. Around this time i had a stuttering problem, and making noises around the class because i was not paying attention at all, and mostly i just were making noises because i was bored during the class. i would sometimes daydream and think about what games i'm going to play after school or what are we going to do outside with my childhood friends.

At age 12 i was put into a epilepsy test and they would test me in a hospital. they tested my brain by putting me some kind of device around my head and i would have to sleep during the time they were reading my brain. The tests came as negative and i had no ''problems in my brain''

As i kept getting older i had to be moved into a different school because of my bullying and my difficulties to not keep able to be on track with other students. This time it was different. This school was specifically designed for people who are disabled/have severe learning disabilities.

When we had this discussion with the principal i cried. I did not want to go there. But i had no other choice.

So around 2009 i was moved into this school. During the years i studied there it was horrible. I felt... like i was some kind of test subject the government keeps eye on us.. everything was so strict as well.for example: No kissing, showing other affection to other human being if you liked other student (the only way you could show you liked a student romantically would be by hugs and holding hands but not kissing for some reason)

the teachers had this overly positive attitude as well which annoyed me a lot. Like they were talking to children. I was on 7 grade by the way, and this kept going nonstop until 9 grade. I tried to fight back the education system they were handing to us but it just gave me bad numbers. Everything considered violent subject we would have would be banned/not to be talked about. We didn't even had history. Biology. nothing. The hole education system was litterly made for fucking children. Some of the teachers would hold you're hand if you would not be able to succeed on a task. for example ( We had household class where we basically cook, and one time i was squashing tomatoes to make some sauce and one of the teachers came to me and started to show me how it's ''apparently done'' by taking me by the hand. )

When it comes to my parents, my mom is probably the most supportive person in my life. My dad on the other hand is narcissistic,

has a temper and overall he's a pretty shitty person. During midsummer two years ago, he said that i'm not he's son and i should leave he's fucking house immediately because i didn't want to help him for some task (he was drunk)

He would get pissed off at the smallest things, He did shouted at me during my childhood which lead me to running to my room crying.He also cheated on my mother, lied to her kept promises about he's going to change but he didn't do a shit to change himself. just false promises. He's a piece of shit who can't admit if hes wrong. (My dad has also learning disability)

When it comes to woman/relationships I've had last relationship around 6 years ago. It was not searius but during that time i had no social skills, i was really awkward and shy.

I would never leave my parents house, i would be sitting my ass off playing games all summer all day long. Until a few years ago i started working out, started to talk to people and getting out of my comfort zone. A lot of woman/men have told that I'm attractive looking. a few woman have also stated that i'm a good talker/kisser as well, but since i'm shy i'm having a hard time to start conversations.

Honestly life felt good for the time when i was studying. But after i graduated from Vocational school, everything started to slowly fall apart. My first ever job would be face-to-face fundraiser but i got fired because i would not get enough donations.

After that last year, i had to go to a IQ test which was in social insurance institution of Finland in my town. Basically after the face-to-face fundraiser i couldn't find a job, i kept sending CV'S to companies, to the simplest jobs that there is, but i would just not get a response, that's why they suggested that i would take one of these IQ test and i agreed.

So after the first time i went to this IQ test, and during this IQ test i was really nervous,anxious,uneasy and i just wanted it to end. Since the psychologist didn't have that much time, we had to make it to 2 sessions.Every session lasted around 1-2 hours. Every time after these sessions, i would just go to the bathroom and cry. He gave me a IQ of 36 if i remember correctly and it fucked up my self-esteem for a very long time, still to this day. I even skipped exam day to a acting school where i had a chance to go to try my luck. I didn't read for the exams, i was so fucking lazy and depressed that i just gave up.

Since then I've had possibly starting depression, I've also have had suicidal thoughts. I have self-harmed. Last summer around 1.6.2019 i was out drinking with my friends. My friends dropped me into a pizzeria because i wanted to get some pizza (Ya know drunk munchies?) after i got my pizza i walked home since i live nearby it. So i get inside my house and open the pizza box and just start crying. I get up from my computer chair head to the kitchen and slit my finger (Index-point finger) the wound was pretty bad so i had to call a ambulance.

Ever since then i have stopped completely just trying. I don't clean anymore. I don't do the dishes. i don't cook anymore. I can do them all by myself, but my mom keeps helping me since i had a trouble learning stuff in my childhood, and she has that kind of personality that she wants to help people, and i honestly sometimes i feel like shit because of it. That i can't even fucking take care of myself currently. I used to have a passion for acting/theater but it's all gone. All what i do is sit at home play video games, watch porn try to work out to keep myself in shape/meeting my friends and trying to meet people so my social skills wont shrink. ( I'm quite lonely and isolated )

My friends could be the best people I've ever met in my life. I think that they accept me for the person who i am but since we don't really share that much interest to other things (other than theater) we're really not that close. My psychiatric-doctor says that i just have to believe in my self but i am in a point where i think this is it. This is the situation where i will be for god sake how long. On this fucking hole. Miserable hole. I just don't know what to do. I have no energy to motivate myself anymore.

Things have been rough to us this last month on different levels, at first she seemed worried about my situation, but after a couple of days it seemed as she had forgotten about the whole thing, later on she stopped texting and when she did, it seemed a little bit off; I get that everyone have their own problems and nobody owes you their support nor time, but I really really needed her at that time.

She ghosted me on Christmas, since December I‚Äôve been the one who reaches out, she has said so many times that she thought I didn‚Äôt answer, therefore she wouldn‚Äôt text back.

When we broke up I was devastated, but I slowly started coming back out of my shell. I made some friends in college and was well-liked in my department. Then I was finally starting to make a few *close* friends. But once I graduated, they all cut me off over a misunderstanding (genuinely a misunderstanding). 

Now I find myself completely alone, out of college, and friendless aside from coworker surface ""friendships"". I have trouble emotionally opening up and connecting to people, and it's almost like I just don't know how. I worry about when is the ""right time"" to talk about heavy stuff to people, how do you know they can handle deeper topics and when they're comfortable with that?  Then, if I do somehow get there, I get afraid that they'll think that's all I am and that I'm a downer for bringing that stuff up. It's horrible and cyclic thinking. I get stuck and it feels like things go nowhere with people I try to engage.

I tend to be a very deep thinker and like talking to people, but I never really get to that point with others anymore. I hang out with them and blank on what to talk about. I don't really go out, I don't know *where* to go when I want to invite someone to hang out. I hate going to clubs in our area because there's shitty parking and it makes me panic. I tried to go once, since I enjoyed going when I had friends, and I ended up having a panic attack and drove home sobbing. Yeah it's a little pathetic, I can't help that I'm emotional though.

I feel this glass wall between me and the world. 

I downloaded some dating apps to put myself out there for romantic opportunities or friendships. I've hung out with a few people. Mostly coffee and tea shops. One had potential to be a friend, but she had plans to move to the opposite coast in a few months so I just distanced myself...idk. The other was inconsiderate and just ""eh"". I still couldn't figure out how to connect when talking to these people.

Then I met a great woman, talked for months about everything and anything. We were both catching feelings, she changed my status to friend because she was hung up on her ex. We still talk a lot, and I still have feelings. She's so easy to be around. But I only talk to her over text since I'm still coming down from when we were in a relationship.

Now I'm just left with vague connections but I still feel empty and don't know how to proceed. People keep saying my \~tribe\~ will find me and it just feels...fruitless. I'm 23 and it's getting hard to keep trying to form bonds at this point.

Apart from going to my part time job, I hardly ever leave my house. I don‚Äôt know where to go to meet people my age. I was counting on being able to go back to college for my social interaction, but I missed the deadline to re-enroll....

I tried going to game stores to play DnD, but either no one shows up or the people who are there just don‚Äôt let me in their group. Honestly, I have no idea where to go to meet other people my age. I have no local regular friends and I sure as Hell don‚Äôt have any romantic partners (have never had a gf actually or even been on a date).

My hobbies include reading books, writing poetry, working with electronics, cooking, and gaming among other things, but I can‚Äôt find any groups or places to go that are conducive to meeting people my age who are into those things (the college and comic stores are basically it). On top of that, because of my autism and bad anxiety, I still don‚Äôt drive so I‚Äôm confined to local activities...

To deal with my romantic frustration, I would talk to European girls on Interpals since they are a lot more willing to talk to me (because approaching women in public is frowned upon apparently...) and I actually have things in common with them.

First year of uni passes and things are so different, I don‚Äôt feel like she loves me anymore and that she gives her friends in that state more attention than me. I shrugged it off and told myself nah everything is good she loves me. Second year of uni starts and she decided to leave me. I asked why and didn‚Äôt really get a definitive answer, she just didn‚Äôt like me anymore and didn‚Äôt want to pity-date me anymore. I always enjoyed being alone and I never beg people to stay with me. But I did beg her to stay, because she was my only source of happiness here even though I saw her twice a month. Nevertheless after i begged her and tried to understand why she‚Äôs leaving ... she left and all my questions were left unanswered. Now I‚Äôm stuck here completely alone and people in my university hate me for some reason and think I‚Äôm a foreigner even though we‚Äôre all the same nationality. I spend weekends at home trying to find something to do. I write a lot but I have no one to show my writing to. I just keep doing things to distract myself from the mess my life turned out to be.

Relationships don't make me happy. I get so infatuated and obsess over them and idealize them, but the moment they do a single thing that shatters the image of perfection I had for them, I'm left feeling broken and betrayed and if the relationship doesn't end right then, I will just go on pretending that I still feel the same way while on the inside I feel isolated even with them. I'm not really mentally healthy enough for a relationship. I'm too fragile and I just want to make someone into my sanctuary, that I can go to and dump all my baggage out on while they comfort me but that's not a realistic expectation, nobody is going to want to do that, and I shouldn't want to do that but I do.

My family basically doesn't exist. I thought maybe one day I could make my own family and give them all the experiences I never had, but honestly if nothing else helps I don't think that's going to either, and I probably shouldn't bring more people into this world and risk them ending up like me. Maybe my parents had a similar thinking when they had me, and that didn't end well for me, so it would be selfish for me to do the same to someone else. I can't imagine the depression it would cause if it didn't turn out the way I fantasize about, and that's not really the kind of mental state a good parent should be in.

1968,ChrissiBun,1578787995,1,"I'm extremely lonely..for more than a year and half now and I always thought it would go away as time passed but it only got worse. 

The thing is I don't really have friends. At University I'm part of a nice group of people, but I am kinda on the outside. It's difficult to describe, like I am always welcome but I don't get missed. Nobody really texts me privately and I never meet them outside of classes, except in bigger ""uni group activities"". There is one person though who is at least texting me from time to time but I feel like I am thin air for the rest of them. 
I've always been shy and I don't like being in the centre of attention but having nobody to ask you how you are REALLY doing is so devastating..and so I feel like I bother them, which is why I don't text much because I'm afraid if I do then they might see me as intrusive. 
Additionally, over this long time of loneliness I completely lost all my confidence, even the little I had before. I am extremely sensitive on the inside and think a lot about what I told people/how they responded etc, however I try my very best not to show it on the outside.. don't ask me why, cause idk myself. This has made me pretty depressed, I lost any motivation to do anything at all..I have no hobbies, no interests in any way so I spend most of my time alone at home and study or play video games/watch movies. 
Later on, when I'm in bed, I lay awake for hours thinking how I wasted the day, how I am not changing my situation and that I might as well be dead because I don't want to lead a life this way. 
The problem I'm facing is that I don't have the strength for change and I don't have the people to pull me through it because I don't let anyone get close to me. I'm so afraid of people truly knowing me and seeing me for the loser I am, the person with no interests, with no happy thoughts about the future. 
Who would want to spend time with someone like that...let alone get to know the person at all?
So the few times I do go out and meet with them, I pretend I am doing well and try to be funny, since I try to believe that if they think I'm a fun person, they might want to spend more time with me and thus they will also be there for me when I need them. But in the end I end up listening to their conversations and saying a few sentences, which mostly get ignored. 
I really am that person who walks alone behind the rest when there is a small pavement. 
The person who always listens to other people and encourages them to keep telling their story, but gets completely ignored when she wants to say something.
The person who just gets forgotten. 

I'm sorry for this long post, but I just had to tell someone...even if it's just anonymously to a bunch of strangers. Ty so much if  you read this, it means a lot to me.",lonely,I don't know what to exactly call this..probably a rant of self pity..,2020-01-12 11:13:15

I ended up oversharing and posting everything that happened in my life as I had no one else to really talk to, but because of my appearance I attracted a lot of attention and a lot of it became negative, which led to people stalking me and almost made me homeless and childless.

I was talking to him how I feel bad when I stay in, but I feel bad when I go out. Which I've only done twice. And part of that is maybe they weren't good clubs, the second was just a friend turned suicidal and I had to take care of her the rest of the night and day, the first i just was in eye pain from the lights due to my eye disease, but also couldn't hear and was overstimulated as I'm reliant on hearing due to said eye disease. So just got lost and abandoned after paying $20 while my girlfriend got in free and feeling hands touch me up. 

To end it shortly, he just said most people he knows and talked to don't like clubs. It's just we compare ourselves to ""beer commercials"" and movies. We see everyone partying on our social media and on our TV. We see people drinking and having fun, but we don't see the effects of alcoholism, we don't see the aftermath of drugs on the producing countries or on the users, we don't see that despite now being more ""sex positive"" than ever, more people are remaining single and virgins than ever before.

1974,dirtydong69,1578785377,1,"Ive been pretty much living in my room for a couple months now. I just switched high schools, and i fuckin hate it. I thought it wasnt gonna be that bad, but i avtually want to die everytime i go to school. I have no friends there at all. The only friends i sorta have go to another school, like an hour drive away. I hardly ever see them, theyve pretty much forgotten about me. When i switched i thought i would just make new friends. I havent had to make new friends before this year since elementry school. I cant make friends anymore. Everytime someone even talks to me at my new school, i can only respond with one word answers, i dont know why. At my old school, i had my best friends, people who i could be myself around. But now i have no one. It feels like im not myself anymore. All i do is sleep, smoke weed, and eat. Those are the  only things that make me even a little happy anymore. I cant go a day without getting baked as fuck. Its been 3 months now, and i dont even have anyone to talk to. No one will probably even care about this stupif fuckkn post either. I thought i was making friends at first. This one girl actually was talking to me for like a week, and i really liked her, i thought she was really cool and we had a lot in common. I havent talked to her in like 2 months. She left me on opened and stopped talking to me. I eat lunch by myself, no one ever texts me or anything unless i do first. But i never do. Whats the point of reaching out to someone if they dont care enough to reach out to you? I havent had a girlfriend in years, i cant flirt to save my life. Everytime i thought i had a thing with a girl, i just ended up getting my heart broken. I thought i was the victim at first, but it was probably all my fault anyways. I always end up being confused and not knowing what i did wrong, but i know i was the one who fucked it up.  All i want is someone who avtually likes me and isnt just being nice or feeling bad. I feel like that shouldnt be too much to ask, theres like 7 billion people in the world. But i guess it is too much. Maybe i just dont deserve it. Before i moved, i fucked up a lot of my relationships. I was an asshole and i didnt even know it. I would do anything i could to fit in. Ive learned from my mistakes the hard way. Ive made so many that im scared to talk to anyone. Thats probably why i have no friends. At least its a contributing factor. I was at the doctor a few weeks ago, and i was gonna lie on the mental health evaluation thingy, but i still failed it. Now i have to go to therapy. I dont wsnt to talk to a therapist, i dont want to talk to my parents. I dont want someone to like me because they have to. I want someone to like me for being me. But i dont even like me. Im starting to feel like theres no meaning to life. Were all just specs in the universe, randomly floating by. Nothing anyone ever does is gonna make a difference. One day the sun will explode and no one will remember anything cuz well all be dead. Once its over, its over so why not just cut the chase and end it. Its like im not even alive anymore. Im just coasting through life. Ive pretty much given up on evrything. I dont try in school, i dont do anything athletic or something. Im already a failure. Everytime i try something new, and im really shitty at it, i just think i cant do it at all, and i just give up. Im just a waste of space. My biggest fear is that im gonna end up dying alone, but i can see it happening already. I honestly just dont see anything getting better for me. I even feel like a piece of shit for writing this because i know there are people who have it way worse than i do. I feel selfish, and i feel like im just better off dead. I think about it constantly. All i want in life, is to spend it with someone i love and with someone who loves me too. I just dont deserve it. I dont even care about success. I could be broke as a joke for all i care, as long as i had someone. It feels like im already too broken to be fixed. I dont want to live like this, im probably jist gonna off myself. Im sorry for making this long ass post, but i didnt know what else to do and i have no one else to talk to. I cant talk about this kind of stuff to my ""friends"" cuz its not who i am around them. I dont even know who i am anymore really. To  the 0.3 people who will actually see this, pls dont flame me. i poured my heart out just now.

Whenever I see her with her guy friends I get kind of jealous or envious (?). And there seems to be this unwillingness to let go. I do try this though. I try to forget about her, but on the other hand I kind of can't.

However, I tried to show interest, yet I feel like I am getting mixed signals. Maybe I don't want to accept that she sees me as just another friend. I feel like this is the truth.

I just want to learn their process of handling other employees and creating my own later on plus I'm kinda broke. 

When someone stole all my wealth, essentially all my friends disappeared... I guess? For example, when I want to hang out with them, they either make up an excuse that their busy or something like that; except one of my bestie, we hang out once in a while. Thus making me extremely lonely and unproductive. Despite being a late bloomer at 20 years of age, It's kinda hard getting a girlfriend especially when I'm kinda broke and introverted. I also need the most support at this moment in time. 

This special quote from my cousins because they were rich like me in the past, ""they were rich but suddenly one night their factory was on fire and they lost everything with my head burnt and arm too"" or my other cousin said, ""I had a big construction company in China, but one week I decided to put all my eggs in basket and gambled my properties to the casino"". They all started from the ground up again but the one thing they said to me. ""If someone truly supports you at the bottom, be friends with him forever or marry her. When you're at the bottom, you need it the most!"" These words instantly lifted me up from depression and gave me hope but the only thing that hurts inside is loneliness since I live in Vancouver. After they told me that, they invited me to their business to work as a Business Strategist.

Eventually, they came to Canada and settled they all built established businesses such as Importing, Construction, Landscaping, and Restaurants. Now they're millionaires again after 10 years later, which was impressive. So basically, I'm going through the same process as them.

The main reason is my social anxiety. I have a lot of trouble forming even basic relationships with people. I‚Äôm not even sure how I have even one friend. The second reason is that even if I didn‚Äôt have social anxiety, I have no redeeming qualities that would make someone want to be in a relationship with me.

     I only have one friend, and even then I don‚Äôt feel very close to her. Ever since I was a teenager I‚Äôve had attachment issues?? I‚Äôve had a rough upbringing so it feels like no matter how long I‚Äôve known someone or how close I get to them, it‚Äôs never fully... attached? Like I could walk away and be just fine? Which doesn‚Äôt  really help because it makes me feel more disconnected than ever. I don‚Äôt have a boyfriend or anything, the one I did have was toxic and manipulative so I had to leave him after a very naive me didn‚Äôt realize what was happening.

I try to make friends or even find a partner via Tinder, but over the past 2 years, that‚Äôs only turned up one person but even then we‚Äôre more acquaintances than friends.

2055,anxiouslyeverafter,1578720665,1,"For most of my life, I've lived by the saying ""expect the worst and be pleasantly surprised when it's not"". Except in one aspect. I've always hoped to find myself in a healthy, long-term (permanent) relationship.

I can't hope anymore. It's killing me to hope, year after year, that I'll find any relationship, let alone a soul mate. I've been single, without even prospects, for nigh on five years now, and prior to that, just a couple brief periods of unbridled bliss before being hopelessly shattered.

So now that I'm preparing myself to expect the worst, how do I live? I hardly enjoy things I used to love and adore. I've invested the majority of my life into work simply to make time go faster (with the beneficial side effect of becoming a valid career path, but that's beside the point). I have a huge problem socializing, what with my social anxiety and difficulty connecting with people.

I have nightmares every night. Half are that I'll be alone forever, and the rest I wake up crying from because they show me what I want most: a happy life with my soul mate. Every time I see others in relationships, it's just a reminder of what I want most and cannot achieve. 90% of movies and TV shows are the same, it's rare to see any without romance.

I'm sorry, this came out really jumbled and haphazard. Expressing the depth and pain I'm experiencing is incredibly difficult. I truly don't know how to move forward. I have to give up on share my life with someone, but I don't know how to do so without giving up what's left of my sanity.

Mostly colleagues because we all started at the same time and gradually we moved away. Then I relocated to Philadelphia. 

That was one of the happiest times in my life. I bought my first house, met the girl I am about to be engaged to, and made some of my best friends I've ever had. I truly felt at home for the first time in my life. Before I always felt like an outsider, not because I was awkward or shy, quite the opposite actually. I've always been charismatic and outgoing, but I grew up in a small town, full of people with limited dreams and intellects. Philly for me was wonderful, but then my job took me back to my home state in the midwest. 

Everyone always says with excitement how happy I must be to move home. But that is just the thing, I hated it here when it was my home, and now I left a place I felt was home to return to feeling like an outsider. I live in the nicest county this state can offer, but I know that I traded happiness for money. The food is crap, everyone I knew here has moved or moved on with their lives, it is hard to meet new people, and my family is great, but I find it hard to reach out.

On the outside my life is perfect. I have a great job, I love our house here,  I have several degrees without student loans, and I am getting engaged to a wonderful person. But what kills me the most is that ever since she started working evening shifts, I have been overcome with a feeling of such complete loneliness. I spend most days after work completely alone until I go to bed. All I want is just a friend or two to have dinner with a couple times a week. In Philly I had those friends, the ones I can call and meet up with, the ones that even traveled out here to visit after we settled into the house. But here, I have everything on the outside, but feel so empty on the inside it is debilitating. 

I have good days where I go to the gym or fix something around the house. But then more often than not, my black dog comes around and I worry I will end up like James Joyce in Beckett's Ohio Impromptu -sitting in silence for hours, day after day. 

I just feel at a loss for what to do. I dont know that I came here for a solution or advice more than I just need to let this out.

2072,GeneralWalters421,1578714514,1,"Essentially back in high school I didn‚Äôt really have any friends, but I‚Äôm now in my second semester of university and I‚Äôm kinda trying to change that. I have Aspergers so I‚Äôm pretty emotionally immature, and thus not very good at this stuff. I kinda got the confidence to introduce myself to a girl I sat next to in class, who seemed pretty shy and quite, and long story short, we got along well, and it turned out we shared tons of interests. Shes a 21 year old 4th and I‚Äôm a 17 year old (male) 1st year but despite this we get along and still relate.

I invited her to grab a coffee at Starbucks and we kinda talked for a couple hours then. We kinda ran into some miscommunication after this, but all you need to know is that I kinda explained my Aspergers, and how I am pretty awkward and socially immature because of it, and we sorted it out. She told me that it was alright, because ‚Äúbelieve me I‚Äôm pretty socially awkward myself‚Äù.

During the Christmas holidays we sorta communicated through Snapchat, and a few days ago, during the start of the second semester, we arranged to meet up at Starbucks again. During this I briefly brought that I was looking to join a club because I need to make friends, and she kinda jokingly mentioned that shes not the best person to ask. Essentially shes a pretty shy person, like shyer than me. I don‚Äôt have friends due to being autistic and having a complicated past, but I can do public speaking and stuff well. She says has a few friends, and all of them approached her first, but that shes kinda been fine with what she had. 

Anyway, it kinda made me think a bit and the day after this I send her a long, and a admitily, pretty self conscious sounding text. It was probably a dumb idea but I basically explained my situation and asked her if I could be her friend. Afterwards she replied telling me that she does think of me as her friend. (I then kinda apologize for sending such a long text, and being kinda weird, but she tells me it‚Äôs all good and not weird). 

Anyway, thats where I am now. I do really like this girl, and I‚Äôd like to hang out with her more, but I also don‚Äôt want to be clingy or anything. She‚Äôs pretty introverted, plus she does have other friends so I can‚Äôt really overwhelm her. I guess I should seek out more friends and stuff and I think I‚Äôd like to join a club maybe, but I feel kinda the same as her, in that I‚Äôd be content with a few. I feel like having too many would just be overwhelming, I‚Äôm already struggling with one. In the mean time, I‚Äôd like to invite her out to an activity, like playing a board game going to a museum, or seeing a movie, rather than just talking at a cafe. I‚Äôm just not sure how long I should wait and all that. I‚Äôm also not really sure how, if ever, I‚Äôd be able to be like an actual close friend. Despite having all these problems, I am happy that I finally feel like I have a friend, I feel like having someone, and having events like hanging out to look forward to gives some meaning to life, as weird as it sounds.",lonely,"I‚Äôve made a friend for the first time in a long time, but I‚Äôm not sure how to maintain it.",2020-01-11 14:48:34

2080,uneventoothpastetube,1578710682,1,"Im on mobile so you‚Äôll have to read through errors.

Since October I‚Äôve been seeing this girl. I‚Äôve tried my best to be as loving and as attentive to her as possible. I really do love her, and she‚Äôs said it back to me before, multiple times. Up until 2 days ago everything seemed absolutely fine.

I just had this thought in my head that she is in every way better than me and probably deserves better, though I also thought that no one deserves her. So I prayed to god. I prayed that she could be happy and that I would be willing to fundamentally changed myself in order for me to be the best person for her. 

The next day (two days ago) she reassured me that she loved me. 

The next day she said she was tired and wanted to go to bed, and that she hopes I understand. And I said, ‚Äúof course I understand; I love you.‚Äù And didn‚Äôt get any response. I just assumed this was because she didn‚Äôt read it and she went to bed, after all she probably assumed I‚Äôd read it later.

But today we were in class and she sat on the far side of the room, completely opposite of where me and her normally sit together.

After the class she calls me over and tells me she‚Äôll walk with me. And out of the blue she tells me she isn‚Äôt ready to be in a relationship. 
I just don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs been five months and just now she decides she, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt ready.‚Äù 

I always thought (openly) it was stupid to have these high school relationships and that they never work out. So I‚Äôve hurt myself by doing something I do openly distrusted and I feel like an idiot.

I just hate the thought of us being with other people. Because if I love someone the same as I love her, than love seems a lot less spiritual and more of just hormones in my brain.

It also makes me think of she never really loved me the way I loved her. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Everything just seems empty. In a way, before today, I always thought of her when I did anything. Now I‚Äôm back to knowing I must be a lot less important to her than I was 12 hours ago. 

I don‚Äôt talk to my friends and family about this stuff. I‚Äôm not a very open person. The only person I shared with was her. 

But writing this out does really help. Knowing I‚Äôm not the only person who feels sad does too. But I also surrounded myself with things that remind me of her, and I don‚Äôt think I can pull myself from them.

It‚Äôs just I tried to prioritize her above all else. I tried to always let her know how amazing she is. I always tell her I love her and how important she is to me. But clearly that was for nothing. 

Clearly I can‚Äôt be passionate for anything without screwing it up. I knew I could drive her away, but I think I tried to limit myself.

Earlier when I said I prayed, it wasn‚Äôt the first time I prayed about her. I‚Äôve prayed many times that I would do anything to make her happy. So I can‚Äôt help feeling like I was the root of all of this.

I‚Äôm stuck here thinking about everything I‚Äôve done wrong. But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that the person that I cared about, thought about, and loved the most doesn‚Äôt love me anymore.

I‚Äôve known her for much longer. She was my best friend. I could talk to her then. Then she was my girlfriend. I could still talk to her. Now I don‚Äôt have her at all and I can‚Äôt talk to her about anything.

I was even gonna introduce her to my sister today. Part of me thinks she didn‚Äôt really take the relationship seriously. Maybe I have a problem of romanticizing things.

(Before you come @ me, these aren‚Äôt the normal type of bf/gf relationships. It‚Äôs the high school clout relationships where you only date for clout and status.)

So what I‚Äôm trying to say here is that, before you say you don‚Äôt have any friends, go reevaluate your situation before you hurt the ones who are actually there for you. Cause one day, they will actually leave you and you will ACTUALLY HAVE NO ONE. NO ONE.

After him I met two different guys on Reddit. One childfree man that raised some red flags, and another that raised a lot of red flags. 

After that I'm kind of happy and relieved that I wasn't so desperate to get into an abusive relationship, and pessimistic for the prospect of meeting a guy that isn't dirty or abusive, and doesn't want kids.

2106,TheSpectrumPlasn,1578690862,1,"I didn't use to be like this. I didn't use to feel alone and shit. I didn't use to crave conversation and company as I do now. This will probably be quite ranty and emotional because I've bottled it up for so long and I feel that the only way I can get better is by shouting into the void in the hopes that someone answers. My life used to be pretty good. I live in an amazing home, with a loving family and I go to a great school where I don't have to worry about being bullied or made fun of. I used to have friends, lots, so many I couldn't count them on my hands and, mind you, these were good friends, friends with whom you can talk about everything and nothing and still end up feeling great. But one by one these friends slipped away. I moved to a different secondary school and my two best friends went to another. We were inseparable, the best friends I could hope for, we gamed and played and ran through the fields and woods outside our village and it was great. I started to see them less, but they were still in the village so I'd speak to them at the weekend instead. Then one of them moved away to Yorkshire and whilst we still talked over the years we spoke less and less. The other stayed for a while and it was still great, but then he was given a one month notice that he was moving away down south and like that he was gone. So I was alone in my village. I go running, through the same glens and streams, and the glade where we built a fort and the old bunkers where we used to play war games. It hurts. Knowing that I'm so close to touching those times and the only difference is that time has moved on and left me behind. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't the only cog to the broken machine that is my life. At my primary school, I had another group of friends. They were American, their families in the military staying in an RAF base outside a neighbouring village. Those friendships were short-lived, they stayed two, three years and moved on. They were used to the loss. I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Coming to my secondary school. I had two groups of friends. one was a group of 4, me included. I knew one from my old school and that's how I was introduced to the others. We used to go to a weekly youth theatre club where people from both the girl and boy school would go on Saturday and it was great. We put on a series of plays, workshops and talked and had fun. It was good. Then the older girls left 6th form and it got less and less interesting until we collectively decided to quit. We stayed great friends and actually all got put into the same form, massively increasing the time we spent together. This was both a blessing and a curse and whilst we enjoyed spending time with each other, previously unknown flaws in the group started forming. This culminated at a summer party where we were playing truth or dare and as a joke, someone asked who's mum was the stupidest. No one else wanted to answer so tried to go for a joke answer which I obviously didn't mean. The answer I gave was an inside joke with the friend I used to go to school with about how the school dinner ladies made a notoriously bad salmon and broccoli bake. So the joke boiled down to 'your mum is the stupidest for serving a salmon and broccoli bake.' seemingly trivial? Not so much. My friend, being out of the joke loop took offence to this, not understanding the in-joke and in turn, I misunderstood him as being fake-outraged. I said his mum was a bad host and took the joke way too far without realising my 'joke' was actually hurtful. Anyway, parents got involved and a series of beefy long messages were sent which made the situation worse. looking back it was a massive overreaction but it cost me my friendship with him. He stopped inviting me to events and the other friends responded by not inviting one of us to save awkwardness. By this point, GCSEs were on us and I worked my ass off for them, meaning I had no time for them. I ended up with 2A\*, 4 9s, 3 8s and a 7 so whilst I can't complain I also can help but notice how this lack of interaction probably resulted in me being excluded from parties and stuff. So the summer comes and I find my self lonely as hell, not speaking to my other gaming friend (who I'll come on to next) because of me stopping playing games in my GCSEs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I attended NCS over the summer and it was great, I made tonnes of friends within the first day and we hung out talking and doing activities with each other, probably the best 2 weeks of 2019. I'm still in contact, I regularly message them and I've met them a couple of times since but it's rare and I don't do anything with them outside of this.

&amp;#x200B;

My final story is of I suppose I could say my best friend and my school. We are both into gaming and nerdy things like science and StarWars and pokemon etc.. I used to call him every day after school and we would game long into the night. but then GCSEs came round and I stopped, blaming it on time pressure. anyway, after GCSEs finished I didn't do much gaming, aside from Stellaris and stardew valley which were both singleplayer as none of my other friends had them. I didn't call him the entire summer. kick start this year and I'm doing bio, chem and maths and he is doing phy, comp sci and maths (different class) so I don't see him in lessons. I walk with him to school and back as we both get the train (from opposite directions so meet at the station) so I speak to him then. But there is a problem. So much of our friendship was based on gaming that with that absent there wasn't much to talk about and it just feels awkward. This paired with him being super introverted so much so that he doesn't want to meet up outside of school, not even to watch a film makes it really hard to be around and I have to second guess everything I say. I hate it, I just want to be able to have a normal conversation.

There is hope, my school is all boys but there is a girl school equivalent and this year their school was moved onto our campus with a shared sixth form for everything but lessons, so breaks, free periods etc... However, there is a problem I can't speak to them. It's not because they're girls, the NCS group has 6 girls in it (I realise this looks like a crappy excuse but trust me I have a reason and it's not that I'm socially awkward (I am but not like that)). The reason I feel I can't speak to them is that my old group of friends tends to hang out with them and I just can't bring myself to speak to them with them there. It hurts too much and I don't want to have to reignite that again. There are people on my train but they either don't like me or are too shy to talk much. so I'm stuck. feeling alone and shit with no apparent way out.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think it's because I either can't make friends or I'm not interesting, I've made plenty its just unfortunate situations that have led me here. I tried getting back in contact with one of my original friends (the one who moved south) and I spoke and chatted and played stardew valley and some CSGO but I can't help feeling empty after he has gone, craving company more than before I spoke to him. He spends most of his time with his gf and friends and I just feel so sad, like I've missed growing up with him and whilst he moves on, I'm left to remain. In my small village with anyone I can even call a friend at least an hour away. I feel so sad all the damn time. empty and hollow. it's affecting my school work. I want to study biology at oxford, that's the dream at least, but everything I do seems too hard at the moment to do. I can't talk to my family because they can't offer me that friendship and commonality I need so desperately. so instead of living, I sit in my room listening to sad lofi mixes. I love art and science and StarWars and pokemon and harry potter and Warhammer and reading and gaming and all a bunch of other things but if you have no one to share that passion with, why bother.  This has gotten rambly and nonsensical with no clear meaning so I'm going to stop here now as I've been typing this for the past hour and honestly I need to spend less time feeling sorry for my self. so thanks for reading my life story I just need this off my chest. sorry in advance for spelling mistakes.",lonely,I'm so sick of losing people.

First of all I would like to clarify something, while I have read a lot of psychology books and have a decent amount of experience with helping people out with their emotions and problems (suicidal thoughts, depression, isolation, abusive relationships, etc.) I am NOT a qualified professional, I am NOT a therapist and I do NOT have all those years of education that therapists and psychiatrists have, not yet at least, Im still a teen.

But sometimes all that a person needs is someone to talk to, to vent to..and I can help with that, I want to help with that.

2128,kwamiswap,1578657540,1,"Honestly beggining of last year till this day have been the best times of my life. I enjoy being with my boyfriend and love him so much, he means everything to me.

I no longer go to school and I only ever had extremly toxic friends. I no longer have any friends. Its really nice but really difficult. It gets lonely when my boyfriends not around since he lives almost 2 hours away and I work every day. I love my new job and I'm starting to get to know people there but I just don't see them as friends.

My childhood friends are all party addicts and do drugs and alcohol. Typical teenagers. I really can't stand teenagers these days and don't get along with many but I also don't mix very well with older people, I always feel so immature.

I only started feeling sad about this the other day when I was talking to my cousins. He asked me if I was going to schoolies with friends. I told him no and that I have no friends. It became awkward after that.

My brother didn't really have friends when he finished school and now he's loved by so many people. But he's 23. do I have to wait that long to have friends? He's never had a best friend either though.

2130,Madalynneisdacoolest,1578654608,1,  I've always been lonely but I've learned to deal with it in healthy ways. Except for these past 2 weeks. I think I'm really depressed and lonely. I can't sleep I just cry and my heart aches but I don't why I'm sad. When I finally do fall asleep it's really hard to get out of bed the next day. I don't want to go to work I don't want to talk to strangers who could give a shit about whether I exist or not. My only guess for why this is happening is because of a funeral I went to and also my aunt being diagnosed with cancer. The idea of death is being pushed to my attention. I'm petrified. Or is it because I just feel really alone. The sadness I feel in my heart feels like loneliness . I've always had trouble making friends. I've only had 2 best friends everyone else I'm trying to force it because to have friends you have to be a friend right?I currently have none. I don't want me being depressed to ruin my life. I don't want to flunk college and get fired but it's difficult to function. I feel so alone and like there's something wrong or unlikeable about me. Im 24 and still am unsure of my myself. Im getting older and I feel less desirable I feel like it doesn't matter what I do the older I get. The language everyone uses is about age like you need to be 18 or the clock has run out. I have learned important things that have helped me progress but I think people like people who are sure of themselves and I'm not. Im posting this because I can't sleep and I have no one to talk to. My heart hurts. Have you ever been so sad that you can feel it in your heart? I'm invisible to everyone. I want to have friend because I'm embarrassed my family and other people will say things and I don't know how to explain. On my birthday every year I'm sad because I feel pathedic that I don't have anyone to hang out with. I think my mom always trys to make something happen because she knows I don't have friends. I hate being an adult because if your sad you can't pause your life you have to go to work. You have to do assignments. I think I'm a cool person. So why do I not have any friends?

2154,hamartiated,1578625632,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, arts",2020-01-10 14:07:12

I've always been in long term relationships and for weird reasons I was never single more than a few months since I was 19yo.  I forced myself to be single since my last relationship. 

Right now I have no friends to hang up with so I don't go out and I have no one romantically speaking. 
I never felt so alone but in a way I always felt like this on the inside even when surrounded with people. I don't know why it's like a void I have inside... I think it's because I feel a lot of voids in myself that only I can fill.

Until them I can't be with anyone else because I know that if I don't fix those issues that I don't like about myself I won't feel complete with anyone else. After all how can someone love and admire me if I don't do it myself and I'm not happy with who I am? 

Right now I feel completley alone, more than ever before. I've shut down from the world, I don't want to feel like this anymore but I don't do anything to stop it. It's painful, I want to cry all the time but the tears won't come out. 

So I've been reading this sub for weeks now and analyzing a lot of the people in here, and I came to the conclusion than all of you are alone because you're so afraid of everything. Afraid of talking to someone, afraid of rejection, afraid of being alone forever (aren't we all?) 

And mostly afraid of life, of doing what you love and what you like because you care too much about what others might think. 

You know what guys? Fuck them!! Fuck the world. This is your only life. You don't know what's going to happen in the future, you don't know how much time you got left, you can't waste your short time in this world like this. You deserve to be happy. Stop wasting your life waiting for someone to save you.

Save yourself and don't expect anyone to fill your voids because those go deeper than a partner or a friend. We all have little voids within ourselves and a partner or a friend can't fill them all. (It helps but it's not the solution) 

You deserve to be love... but you have to love yourself first. After all the only thing that it's for sure it's that you are the person you're going to expend the rest of your life with. 

Sorry for this long post I needed to vent. And sorry for the mistakes I wrote this real fast. 

If you need a friend, dm, I'm here for you. (Don't be afraid)

So, to start, I‚Äôm a 19 year old dude, I do have friends, close friends even, have had girlfriends in the past, and I live at home with family who seem to care about me. I have more family that‚Äôs moved out that basically pretends I don‚Äôt exist, my older brother doesn‚Äôt care about me, I never see my oldest sister, but my older sister is still cool, but unfortunately her husband doesn‚Äôt seem to like me so I never really see them often.

I‚Äôve always struggled with social anxiety so forming connections with others has always been a slow and difficult process for me, which typically means I‚Äôll plant my feet in a friend group and just remain comfortable with them. Unfortunately my group from high school doesn‚Äôt get together too much as we‚Äôre all too busy with our own lives and even when we do it seems like two friends don‚Äôt care much anymore, both of them have girlfriends, one is in a very difficult program at school and the other just works a full time job and lives 45 minutes away now. The one who‚Äôs in a difficult program doesn‚Äôt seem to care much about me anymore, he asked me to get him invited to a party for NYE and then dropped out when I told him we were taking a cab over and back and he didn‚Äôt want to pay for the cab which left me unable to get over there and then he blamed it all on me, as I had to spend my entrance to 2020 alone, sad and stoned.

I did get lucky to make friends with a guy in a group I had for a management course during my first year of university, but I was in such a dark and depressed place then that I never really followed up on that friendship. Thankfully that guy followed up on me and invited me to a boat adventure with a group of friends from our school, I did hit it off well with them and even got my first crush since high school on one of the girls in the group. Things didn‚Äôt really work out on that end as she doesn‚Äôt want to date people in the group out of fear of it ruining the dynamic.

Now, after all that explanation of my current social standings, I just recently received news that my dad has prostate cancer although we‚Äôre unsure how far along it is until he sees an oncologist which could be up to ten weeks from now. I‚Äôve quit nicotine but that feels like a mistake with everything going on and I just feel like I‚Äôm incapable of properly coping now.

I just feel so alone right now as my friends feel like they drift further everyday, my anxiety surrounding relationships and sex gets worse every day that I don‚Äôt do anything about it, my hero and father could fucking die sometime soon while he‚Äôs in his early fifties. I‚Äôm just fucking furious guys, it‚Äôs been a very long week, if anyone just wants to chat please let me know, pretty much anything would brighten my day at this point.",lonely,2020 is unfortunately off to a poor start,2020-01-10 11:07:16

Our feelings to each other grew a lot, as she is almost like me (tl;dr our characters match like if we got cloned in different genders lol), I made a ppan to meet her one day, as she is thousands and thousands of kilometers away, she approved... But what does it mean. Even if she approved, there's still so much time before it will happen that I can't think about it, but I have nothing other to think about, as she is my only reason to stay happy, at least a little.

Some people are simply born with a charming appearance, a fully neurotypical brain and enough social skills to pull things out, and others are not.

Do you really think (saving some exceptions), the majority of people you see in relationships holding hands on the street and everything ever put even half as much effort into improving themselves than other lonely guys you see eating alone (at best, with a girl who fzd them and ignores them for her phone, a relative, or even a friend if they're very lucky, that doesn't change their relationship status).

Well, not really. Working on yourself isn't a bad concept and could be productive throughout the years, however, is a very difficult process, doesn't bring results for everyone, isn't that much of a help in the dating scene and isn't the reason most social attractive people get into relationships.

Since the first year of Junior High some people will get into relationships, others won't. The latter may or may not improve themselves but usually nothing changes.

It seems to me that the dating scene is just a privilege extrovert and attractive people enjoy. And that's fine, you know, there are things you're born with, and others you're not.

Hello,
I am sorry if this is long. Please go easy on me as well, I‚Äôm feeling extremely self-conscious. 
I‚Äôm in my first year of university. Last night I decided to go out with a couple guy friends (I‚Äôm 19M), two of whom I just met before we left (they were mutual friends of one of the guy friends who invited me). I was told the place we were going to was a bar, but when I got there, it was more of a club. Anyways, we all aren‚Äôt exactly sober. We sat at a booth, got some drinks, and one of the mutual friends was saying how we should all try to pick up some girls for the night. I didn‚Äôt exactly hear what he said, so my one friend told him that I have a girlfriend (which is true). The two mutual friends were sort of lightly pressuring me to cheat, and I would not budge, as I politely turned that idea down. (Side note: I have absolutely no tolerance for cheaters. It‚Äôs super messed up to do that to another person). Anyways, we went to the dance floor and I‚Äôm dancing (horribly) with one of the mutual friends and we get in this group of other girls and whatever, nothing eventful... I obviously was not trying to hook up with anyone. Was just trying to make some friends. Now, I obviously know that going to clubs is where people want to hookup, but I guess I didn‚Äôt fully realize how frequent of an occurrence that was. So a little while later My friends and I are walking back up to the bar, and I‚Äôm kind of trailing behind, and one of them sees a group of girls that he knows. So I get into the little circle, and I just introduce myself or whatever. Now, I‚Äôm usually TERRIBLE at reading if someone is interested in me (i guess I‚Äôm just extremely oblivious, also I‚Äôve had my girlfriend for three years now) but this one girl was clearly making advances towards me, and if I was able to pick up on that, there was no way it wasn‚Äôt true. Anyways, she starts dancing near me, and I kind of just start doing the same thing, and within 15 seconds of that, she turns around and starts grinding. I‚Äôm caught off guard, so I slowly start backing up. To get her to turn around, I tell her my name, which would kind of incline her to turn around and tell me her name (I guess This was my thought process. I wasn‚Äôt sober, and I wasn‚Äôt in my prime decision-making state). It worked though, and she turned around (which was the goal). She told her her name and She was touching me, grabbing me by the arm, all that. I somehow slipped away from this situation within a minute of her turning around (I can‚Äôt even remember how I did it to be honest. I wasn‚Äôt absolutely wasted, I was still in control of myself, I just don‚Äôt remember that detail). 
So I ended up leaving the club as soon as I could without straight up ditching the guys I went with. I probably left around 20 minutes after it happened, which was the first opportunity I saw to leave. Wasn‚Äôt feeling very good. I got home, and called my girlfriend and I told her the general story. She offered to come over (we both live on campus residence so its very close) and so she stayed the night and I told her more of the details of the story. She told me that I should have straight up told the girl at the beginning as soon as she started dancing near me that I have a girlfriend. At that point however, I wasn‚Äôt fully certain she was trying to hit on me, and I didn‚Äôt want to immediately say ‚Äúoh I have a girlfriend‚Äù and just leave. I thought maybe not every girl in this club is looking for a hookup (I guess that‚Äôs where my naivety comes into play?). I was really tired (I couldn‚Äôt even keep my eyes open) and I wanted to go to bed, but my girlfriend was super upset. I was trying to comfort her, while also feeling really self-conscious myself, on top of not being in a sober state. So yeah that didn‚Äôt go very well. It‚Äôs tense between the two of us right now, and I was just trying to do the right thing. In general, I felt very socially awkward during many parts of the night, and out of place, and I felt like everyone was staring at me nitpicking every little thing I did or didn‚Äôt do. I just need some reassurance or something, anything. I have had depression and anxiety in the past, and I‚Äôm now medicated for it. But in extreme situations (like this one) my depressed and anxious tendencies seem to surface.

2192,yureadingname,1578591915,1,"Seems like a simple task, really. Simply socialise with some people - that's built-in human functionality, right? There's already a lot of advice our there on this, but I feel like things just don't ""line up"" for me to get it to work. Is it only me who feels this way?

For example, you can meet people through work, apparently. Yet no one at my work seems to extend much invitation to socialise. Everyone there already seem to have their ""group"", which evidently doesn't need me, and I don't want to butt in (that typically ends awkwardly, it's quite apparent that I'm the odd one out).  
Also I'm literally the only person of my age group there, so I can't relate to most of them anyway :/

""Just go out"" is another one that gets thrown around. Seems like decent enough advice, considering that there's a whole world of people out there. But does it work?  
As far as I've observed, most people seem to stick to themselves - I can't imagine anyone coming up to me if I was by myself, nor can I imagine approaching someone else and it ends well (my poor self-confidence doesn't help with that).  
And what does ""go out"" even mean? Go out and do what? Sit around alone at a coffee shop or a bar, and wait for something to happen? I dunno about you guys, but that doesn't sound at all enjoyable to me. And you can't just rock up and start talking to any random person who's around, I don't think that's how it works. Why would they care to meet me? (They probably don't.)

People also say you're lucky to be in school with regards to socialising. Well then I guess I'm lucky... except for the fact that it has been just as lonely and isolating as the other aspects of my life.  
I'm at uni studying computer science, and as you can imagine, no one is particularly sociable (not to mention there's a higher than average amount of people I, uh, wouldn't exactly jump to hang out with...). And then again, it seems like most people already have their group of people, and they're perfectly fine without meeting others.

2203,Isolation_Man,1578564510,1,"First time I post here. I really want nothing. Just want to vent. I'm not looking for advice, but you can offer it if you want.

I'm an ugly and short male, so I never had a gf and I'm still a virgin. I have a job, so at least I'm not homeless. Lately I've been sick, and can barely clean my house, cook... And I definetly can't get out my home, so I won't be able to buy the medicines I was prescribed after I finish those I have now. I can't go out to buy food. And depression don't let me sleep more than 3 or 4 hours per day. God. I've never felt so bad at every level, physical and psychological.

I've felt absurdly lonely all my life, hundreds of rejection from women that can't see beyond my looks destroyed my soul through these years... At this point I really doubt that non- superficial women around my age exist in this century. But these days I discovered that that suffering is nothing compared to be literally dying alone in my room, with no one to take care of me, after years of taking care of everyone around me. I can't believe I ended up like this. 

My parents (deluded boomers) educated me to think that what people value is personality, so I'm well-behaved, patient, kind, generous, responsible, etc... According to them, just being a nice human being would get me a girlfriend. They were so I incredible wrong. All that matters are looks, I discovered with horror. Maybe women from their generation could see beyond that, but not my generation. And, because of that absurdly shallow aspect of my persona that I can't change (being born short and ugly), Im condemned to go through the worst sickness of my life completely alone. To be hungry, to rationate the medicines, to worry about things like what could happen if I pass out while being alone in my home... I cant blame my parents. They did what they thought was better for me. It worked for my father, he is short and ugly like me but my mother could see through it, and discovered man you can trust, responsible, kind, generous... Something that will never happen to me.

Life is so unfair. I wish I was born tall and good looking. Somebody would be taking care of me right now. I wish I was told the truth: ""IsolationMan, you should stop volunteering, and go to the gym. Girls find volunteering pathetic, it is just not something cool"". ""IsolationMan, you should not waste your money in meditation retreats, giving to the poor or learning new languages, no girl cares about that. Save that money to get surgery, you're ugly and that's all that matters really"". ""IsolationMan, you should stop trying to be a nice feminist guy, literally nobody cares. Go to boxing, join something that promotes toxic masculinity like the army, because it makes you more attractive in the eyes of girls""... I wish, I wish, I wish... But this is my reality. I'm what I am, a boomer amongst millennials. A completely outdated human being. They just can't value what I've done with myself, the effort and the suffering that it took. I should have focuses on my looks. Maybe I would not have a job, maybe I could not be able to write this (I had to learn English)... But I would no be isolated. Someone would love me, take care of me, ask me how I am today, have intimacy and sex with me... I missed it all.

Well... That's my completely pathetic life. I'm a fucking clown. If I die tomorrow, only my parents would be sad. At this point, I just want it to end.

One of the things I've found is I don't like to inconvenience people. I was raised vegetarian and no one in my family drinks. I don't intend to change these things about me. But living in America for the last few years I've found this to be a massive social disadvantage. 

When we have after work outings either it feels like everyone has to go an extra mile to accommodate me (which is really kind of them and I always tell them I appreciate it) or I quickly decline so they can go to whatever place they want without worrying about me. These people are considerate enough to not force me to change my eating or drinking habits apart from an occasional question but I've found myself declining invitations more frequently just so they don't have to worry about what I'll have to eat.

On the social front it just seems that almost everyone I know has met their significant other in a bar or over drinks at someones party etc. Growing up a teetotaler I've sort of handicapped myself on this front. Going to bars just feels really awkward for me because Ive never done that. I've been trying dating apps without much success. Feels like everyone here in the US drinks and it would just be so inconvenient to go out with someone like me.

Part of it I'm sure is that I don't have many friends. The people I hang out with are either other guys from school who graduated with me and live in the same area, but are busy and our schedules don't really match up. If we want to hang out, we need to schedule something in advance; spontaneous hangouts just don't really happen. The other few people I'm friends with are still in college and I don't go back to school to visit as often anymore. I just don't have any friends. And thus I spend even more time alone when I'm not working.

I \*WANT\* to get out more and do things in my city and be active, but with no one else to go with, the motivation is just not there for me. When I talk to my friends and family about this, they just say I need to find new friends. That's great and all, but let me tell you finding new friends as an adult in a new city is difficult, especially when I'm introverted and already like being alone (I'm sure this rings true for a lot of people on this subreddit).

I do have hobbies that take me outside. I enjoy fishing, but it's winter and the bass aren't exactly the hungriest this time of year. I want to try the different restaurants and bars in my area, but that requires I spend money and it's awkward if I'm just going by myself. I enjoy cooking for myself and that's what I do 99% of the time. Going out with the intention of talking to other people scares me, whether it be trying to meet women or some new friends.

2227,hamartiated,1578539006,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

It felt like i could just talk to her whenever i wanted and like she actually wanted to talt to me too.

We actually met at Mcdonalds as she works there. Something funny happened at the drive-thru and we just started talking ever since. At first i thought she was just being nice because she is at work. Later she asked for my facebook and we started chatting on there so being nice for work wasn't the case here. We talked a lot through facebook and also in person and i actually started to fell in love with her. I just made one big mistake. I told a friend of mine i was crushing on her. She later proceeded to tell the girl that i really liked her and we just kind of stopped talking ever since. I messaged her a month later or so to say i didn't mean for this to happen and stuff and she said that there was nothing to worry about and she would just talk to me whenever she would saw me without being awkward and stuff. However this wasn't case. I only see her from time to time at Mcdonalds and we don't talk at all. Like i know she is working and stuff but before we used to talk a lot when she was working. She works night shifts so it's usually very calm there and not much to do for her so we just talked. I just wish i could back to that time because ever since we stopped talking i just feel so lonely and so empty inside.

I literally have no one to talk to anymore without feeling like a burden. I really want her in my life again and i don't mean as in girlfriend (i would love that tho) but as a friend. A few people i know say she's gone through a lot and that's why she is so distant ever since she knows i'm crushing on her. I know what she went through she told me everything, and i would never hurt her the way she was hurt before because i think i loved her and i loved the way she made me feel.

2233,Pikachu134,1578531786,1,"Hello everyone.  and I have decided to make a special project to help people in my school, especially younger people. 
In my country, mental health is not talked about at all, and even when it is talked about, not a single time has my school offered something which truly would show students how it‚Äôs okay to not be okay and that people with mental health disorders don‚Äôt have to be treated different or judged since we‚Äôre all humans and we should all get treated without prejudice. 
I decided because of this to make a documentary as a school project where I‚Äôm going to interview people from my country, as well as all over the world that have mental disorders and just have a normal conversation with them and try to humanize the idea of having a disorder. This would then closely related to something I am looking to implement in my school which would help students feel more comfortable about reaching out for help when they need it. 
What I need is people from all over the world who are willing to be interviewed by me about their lives, their disorder, but mainly just about them. I truly believe that if students here see that a mental disorder isn‚Äôt something to be ashamed of or even struggling with mental health isn‚Äôt something that should stay hidden. I hope this project will help someone out there and I‚Äôd really appreciate all the help I could get. 

If you have any questions, which I‚Äôm sure I do since I feel I wasn‚Äôt very clear about some things, you can leave a comment and I‚Äôll try to reply.

If you are interested in being a part of this, here‚Äôs the discord link. 
https://discord.gg/GRz5m6g 

I am not exactly sure when the interviews will start, but more information about all this will be on the discord server so if this peaks your interest please do join.

2235,TheBeetsKillerTofu,1578528787,1,"My fiance and I were grocery shopping. He doesn't shop much and likes to wander around to see if he finds anything he wants.

I'm waiting with the cart in the dairy section while he checks out a couple of close aisles. A girl, probably a few years younger than me, compliments something I'm wearing. I thank her and she just stands in front of me, so I compliment something of hers. We continue to talk because she keeps standing there. I'm not very socially aware, so it hits me that I'm probably standing in front of something she needs and she's too polite to tell me to move. I say ""sorry, do you need something here?"" and move my cart. She says ""No, I was just complimenting you,"" and she stays there. I'm kind of uncomfortable so I tell her I need to check on my fiance. She says bye and walks away. 

Walking down the aisle I'm like, oh maybe she wanted to connect. Is that how people make friends? I'm not going to chase after her like a weirdo, but if we happen upon each other again it's some kind of sign so I'll ask her if she wants to exchange numbers. 

A few minutes later he and I are going to get one last thing and he gets distracted as I run into her again. She says something like, ""Oh you lost him again,"" and I say ""Yeah, thought we were almost done."" Again she stays with me so I do ask if she wants to exchange numbers. She says ""Oh, I'm really busy,"" so I play it off saying ""So am I, it's just that when someone just starts talking to you it's because they're selling something (awkward chuckle)."" She still stays with me until I tell her I need to get him again. 

I'm thinking, okay you started two conversations with me which I had to end, you're still just holding that 4 pack of toilet paper and aren't getting in the checkout line. What gives?

2247,bmcatt,1578518508,1,"Ok - first off, some necessary prefaces to this, starting with ... eh, I probably should've created a throwaway for this, but - eff it (after all, this already wound up being a ""friends-only"" post on FB, so it's not like ""hiding"" is going to matter); and, since there's basically no ""backstory"" for myself on just about anything in my personal post history, I'll give a VERY brief overview.

(Overview of me: 52, male, NJ, divorced with two teenage sons and 50/50 shared custody, once-decently-successful computer geek who's had pretty much no career for almost a decade; gifted, in the ""intellectual"" sense of the word; solid INTP (as in - never, ever, a different result); way too smart for my own good - and I've got actual IQ test results to prove it. If there's any other relevant details I'll interject them *italicized*)

And, since I did say that this started as an FB post, I might as well just mostly copy that bit over. I wish I could also call this an ""unburdening"", but that would imply that I should feel less burdened afterwards and that's definitely not the case.

&amp;#x200B;

I am feeling very empty and ""broken"". While there is a certain truth to being physically ""broken"" (spinal cord injuries don't exactly leave one entirely ""whole"" *incomplete spinal cord injury from 2015; able to stand and walk, but with very limited stamina and a bunch of other stuff that still doesn't quite work right*), there's much more to it than that. There's no ""one"" for me, it seems...

I think the last true (whole-hearted) frienship I had - one that had started during high school and lasted into my 30s - ended shortly after my marriage started ... and its ending was related to that event (thanks, once again, to the narcissist that I married). And as for romantic relationships ... there's the usual comment about counting the fingers on a hand, right? For me, I'm not even sure (being honest - with myself and others) that I could count them on the fingers of one finger.

Sure, I'm a hard-core introvert. I've always preferred being by myself than the company of others. But even that's not quite correct. It's not **solitude** that's important but ... serenity? The quiet sense of being complete. I can certainly imagine that sense, and even imagine that happening with someone else.

Hell, ultimately, that's what I want ... need? There's only so much of one's life that can be spent proclaiming (to myself, if not to the world) that I'm fine as a ""loner"", but the truth of the matter is that I'd much rather not be that. Being content with being a ""loner"" is a wonderful mask that is put up to try and comfort ... someone? Probably myself, as I think about it.

So, of course, in my current state, I've started doing what could easily be viewed as being un-useful... binge-watching anime romance. \[Thankfully, I've managed to stop myself from even seriously considering re-watching ""Your Lie in April""... I just do NOT have enough tissues and ice cream to deal with that again.\]

Yes, I'm a nerd, a geek, an otaku, a ... choose your descriptive term. I have always liked Japanese anime. And, sure, I've watched most of the Studio Ghibli stuff. \[Hell - the first time I saw Tonari no Totoro was in a small room as a guest of an anime ""club"" at Rutgers, on a badly copied VHS, with someone passing around a print-out of the script since it wasn't even subtitled.\]

But, lately, the ones that I've more **wanted** to watch are romances. The fact that most of them wind up being high-school based just, of course, makes the wound deeper and more painful.

Let's face it - back then, I never had a chance at all. I was two years younger even than my own classmates (*I skipped 5th and 7th grades - see above about intellect - so I had pretty much no connections to anyone in my VERY small high school; the entire high school, all 4 years, was about 500 students.*) and was a bit of an arrogant asshole. \[I will argue that the arrogance and asshole-ish-ness may have been appropriate, but that's very much a separate discussion.\] Doesn't change the fact that I had pretty much zero chances to form any sort of significant romantic attachments (aside, of course, from my crush - again, another time - or, more likely, not).

Hell, in retrospect, I am honestly not sure that I've ever had any true ... deep ... fulfilling ... romantic relationships. (*Aside from my ex, I've had two other girlfriends and neither of those were going to go anywhere anyway. And, as much as many of us, myself included, might like to think that an online relationship is meaningful or significant ... it just isn't - lack of physical contact can't be overcome with lights on a screen, regardless of whether they form letters or pictures or anything else.*) And there is very much a part of me that knows it and hurts.

Then, add in the lack of any sort of social circle (something I think I've commented on at least once in the past) (*at least on FB - the reality is that I just don't have any real close friends; I was working remotely for 7 years prior to my career coming to a screeching halt in ... 2012, so I haven't really seen much past the 4 walls of my own home office (or the larger 4 walls of my own home) for a very long time*) ... and the lack of activity / connection to anyone / anything ... and ... what am I left with?

Yeah, I'm feeling very alone and lonely at the moment. And, as always, I haven't got the faintest clue about what I can do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Postscript (sort of) ... I'm very much a shut-in these days. A serious lack of energy (see above about spinal injury) combines horribly with a real sense of ""nowhere to go"".

Oh, and I'm not so much looking for ... validation? Kind words are always appreciated, but I will ask that you (reddit reader) not try to say anything along the lines of ""it'll work out"" or ""it'll get better"". Trust me - I've been telling myself that for, being honest, probably longer than you've been alive and it doesn't actually help.",lonely,Needing to let it out... rant / vent / something?,2020-01-09 08:21:48

I had about three friends in high school and I felt so horribly out of place I couldn‚Äôt wait to go to a huge college. I thought that would be the solution to everything. I thought ‚Äúin a campus full of 40,000 students, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll be lonely‚Äù 
lol you can imagine my disappointment. I‚Äôd never leave my dorm idk how I expected things to be better. I tried a local college for my second year and pushed myself to make conversations this time. But during these scenarios everything felt pointless and tedious and in the back of my head it always felt like neither one of us gave an actual fuck about each other.

2257,ghostess99,1578507405,1,"I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend never touched a girl‚Äôs hand and never even had a girl friend with a space in between. Every girl I tried talking to has acted like I‚Äôm some kind of inferior worthless thing. I‚Äôve also had several traumatic experiences with girls (like getting called a pervert in front of everyone etc) also all my friends have been exclusively boys. Right now I have this overwhelming fear of girls because I assume they all see me like a piece of trash just like every other girl who has ever seen my face, and that they‚Äôre going to hurt me and harm me just like what every other girl did in the past. It doesn‚Äôt even change anything if she is unattractive or ugly or whatever, I feel this with everyone who‚Äôs female just because they‚Äôre female.

To make things worse I have this overwhelming urge as a result of having a typical normal functioning male body (no need to go into detail here) and this only seems to get stronger as I age. I wish I could just tell my body ‚Äústop producing these hormones, you might anatomically be normal but you belong to a hopeless permavirgin ugly loser, so producing male hormones is useless and stupid. You‚Äôre only making things worse for yourself by working this way, look I‚Äôm depressed and have to take antidepressants and go to therapy and this is one of the main reasons‚Äù but there‚Äôs no way to change the way my body works and I wish I were born gay or asexual but I‚Äôm unfortunately straight. 

It also makes me feel awful to see couples of opposite sexes and friend groups of mixed sexes when I go to university because it makes me think ‚Äúwhat do those guys have that I don‚Äôt? Why can‚Äôt I be liked or loved by girls too?‚Äù And I have to turn up the volume of the music in my AirPods in order to block their sounds because hearing them makes me get so anxious my legs start shaking I feel too weak to walk. This is one of the main things that‚Äôs ruining my life at the moment, as I skipped school for more than half of the time because of this anxiety, and I‚Äôve failed most of my courses because I didn‚Äôt know anything because I didn‚Äôt go to class and I have a gpa of 1.2 so yeah this is actually a very big problem and it just seems to get bigger and bigger like a snowball rolling down a mountain getting bigger and turning into an avalanche idk how I‚Äôm going to graduate at this rate.

When I was younger I used to assume that most girls were lesbians and they didn‚Äôt like boys and found them unattractive and didn‚Äôt want them around themselves, and that was why every girl was treating me like a plastic bag instead of a human, it was simply because I‚Äôm a boy. I was used to things being like this because that‚Äôs what I always saw happen to me, so I just assumed this was the reality. But as I started getting older I realized this can‚Äôt be true because well for one human race wouldn‚Äôt be able to go on for thousands of years if that was true. This only makes me feel worse because those other guys who are able to get girlfriends or girl friends must have something that I don‚Äôt have and as a result my self esteem is below zero

When I was younger I also used to assume these problems would go away as I grew up but this wasn‚Äôt the case at all

I would willingly turn gay or asexual if it was possible, so I wouldn‚Äôt feel this overwhelming urge caused by having a normal functioning male human body, so at least being treated by this like girls wouldn‚Äôt bother me so much and I wouldn‚Äôt be this depressed. But there‚Äôs no way to do that and I‚Äôm straight and I‚Äôm attracted to girls there‚Äôs nothing I can do to change this.

I sometimes also wish I was a girl (no I‚Äôm not trans) because they have it much easier when it comes to attracting the opposite sex. As a girl, even if you‚Äôre ugly, unattractive, fat, boring, annoying, or whatever other negative adjective you can think of, you can still attract a portion of guys and if you have some self confidence and are not picky, you can definitely get a boyfriend if you want to. 

But if you‚Äôre an guy and don‚Äôt have any of the qualities that make someone attractive, you turn every girl off. And you can‚Äôt have a girlfriend and in fact can‚Äôt even be casual friends with girls because they will all treat you like a piece of trash and won‚Äôt even see you as a human. Now I know that not every guy with a girlfriend or girl friends is very handsome, but even those who aren‚Äôt have attractive personality traits to compensate for it. As for me, along with being extremely ugly physically and having an intolerably ugly voice, my personality is incredibly boring and lame so I‚Äôm completely trash. 

I also know that I‚Äôm not the only guy who‚Äôs having these problems with girls because my best friend is having the same problems as me, girls have always treated him this way too. I felt happy when he told me about these problems and asked me if I felt the same way, because he literally put my feelings into words and told them to me, and I finally felt that I was understood. He said he also wished he was born gay or asexual, and we even jokingly said that one of us should become trans and then we should get married. Really though I would marry him because he makes me feel understood and liked and somewhat special, and we‚Äôre both in the same boat of being so trash and desperate, but same sex marriage isn‚Äôt legal where we live so

I don‚Äôt even get how it is fair for me to be this trash because I have a high level of intelligence (I learned how to read and write on my own when I was 3 by figuring out what sounds each letter made, I went to an elementary school for gifted kids etc) and I am quite talented (I learned how to play the piano in a few weeks etc) and I‚Äôm a very nice and sweet and loving and caring person and I could never find it in myself to hurt anyone but still I‚Äôm more trash than guys who are less intelligent and talented than me just because they look better and are interesting and fun to spend time with and I‚Äôm so ugly and boring and lame. It really hurts me

Tldr: girls never treat me like I‚Äôm a human and are always rude and mean to me because of whatever this thing is that the eyes of the female see in me that makes me so unlikeable to them. I‚Äôm really scared of them. And I know that I‚Äôm going to die alone and a virgin.

2259,tnonymous,1578504622,1,"      I made  an alt to post this, for obvious reasons. I'm a 16 year old guy ( I know, it could all just be hormones) who doesn't like having excessive amounts of friends. I find that having 3-4 people who you can talk to is very important. 
       As of late though, whenever I feel like I'm having a period of let's just say non happy thoughts, I try to avoid talking about it to my friends. In the past I've tried to stay open about this stuff, but now I almost feel guilty for dumping my emotional baggage onto them. I don't like it, but it really does feel wrong to tell them about the same thing so many times. 
      Don't get me wrong. My friends are great and listen to me, but I've started wondering if they're doing this out of pity. It doesn't matter if anyone sees this or not, it's not that important anyway. I just really needed to understand what's going on...

I feel different than most people so I tend to be picky concerning the people I want in my life that is why I'm alone. Plus I'm very introverted and I have social anxiety so it doesn't help at all. 

For years social media was my shelter. But I've realized that people are worse in social media than in real life. They're condescending, believe they're superior to everyone. Have no compassion and are simply mean, close-minded, childish and will insult you for no reason. I know not everyone is like that fortunately but I'm a very sensitive person who hates negative vibes so seeing all this makes me angry and frustrated more and more. And due to my anxiety I tend to ghost people a lot because I'm too anxious to keep a conversation so there is no point in even starting one. I think it is best for me to delete reddit too.

I do think I‚Äôm a nice guy, like genuinely nice and caring. But I don‚Äôt like to say it, because it makes me feel like a dick. 

Anyway. I‚Äôm making this post because I am trapped and scared, and haven‚Äôt felt affection or love ever. I do have my parents, and I know they love me. But it‚Äôs become stale. Almost everyday my Mum says something to me like, ‚Äúget a job‚Äù or ‚Äúget a life‚Äù. And I know I NEED to do these things and get out my room. But it makes me feel more trapped, like even if I do get out, or go get a job. I know I‚Äôll just come back to the same place it all started. Like it means nothing. 

One major problem I have, is that I don‚Äôt have any IRL friends. I‚Äôve put so much time onto the internet, that I‚Äôve lost the connection to the real world. And that I don‚Äôt know where to go to get back into it. I want to go out with people. Go drinking, nightclubbing, house-parties, just staying in studying or watching a movie. But I can‚Äôt have that, because I have no one to do it with. I want to meet a mutual friend girl, who‚Äôll maybe turn into someone who loves me, and I love them. Not just a title like ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù or ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù. But who genuinely cares about me and who‚Äôll talk to me when I need them and they need me. 

I have made plans to fix all this for this year. I want to start going to the gym and bodybuilding. I want to get a job and meet people. I want to go back to college or start UNI, to have fun. And have a set out future. But all this will only start in June. 6 months of more hell to sit through. 6 months of more loneliness, with the only thing to cuddle is my own damn pillow. 

Anyway, if have any information about how to get out, where to go, what to do. Please say. It‚Äôll help me a lot. I need it more than ever. I also didn‚Äôt make this to find new friends, I can barely handle the ones I have. I just need people to hang out with IRL.",lonely,"I‚Äôm trapped, alone and feel deprived of love and affection.

We are a mainly voice-active community, so we spend most of our time chatting together while we play games or go about our day. We run weekly movie and music nights, occasional game nights, Minecraft server, and other seasonal events. There‚Äôs plenty of text and media channels to share your interests as well as a variety of voice channels for larger or smaller conversations, watching movies, or playing video games together.

2320,User7482848,1578429728,1,"Hello, everyone. I want to make this post short because I feel like people don't like to read long posts about topics like these. All this talk about ""incels"" usually ends up in arguements and I want to say that I am not looking to argue and or spread hate against any group of people. Now, I just want to give you guys a rundown of who I am. I'm 6'4"", white, go to the gym constantly, have a six pack, no acne, shower every other day, light stubble beard, long brown hair, and dress usually in sweaters, short sleeve shirts, long sleeve shirts and jeans. Occasionally, I'll wear a denim jacket with black jeans or whatever I am feeling that day (just so you get an idea that I atleast try to dress nice). I have a job that pays $11 and hour, and go to community college

Okay, now that we got that out of the way, you're probably going to say that I am not an incel because I'm tall, white, in shape, etc. But you would be wrong. I'm still a virgin. I'm not going to complain about that, but I read online especially on reddit that people like me are considered the ones who get the most girls. Gee, I wish. Most people complain about how they are soo short and if they were taller they would be better off yet it never did me any favours. 

I also read up that people think that I have an advantage in the dating game because I am white. I find this to be false because I have a black friend who acts like he's from the ghetto and dresses like it. He gets way more attention from girls than I do. It's almost too easy for him. I understand that some of you might say ""well maybe he's good looking"". I mean, he is but he's not a male model or something. On top of that, the girls he attracts like the ghetto mentality and stuff and they are white too. A lot of these girls have also stated that they ""only date black guys"" which I've been hearing a lot lately.

I started a tinder, and I only got a little over 20 matches. A lot of the girls on there are flakey and talking to them is like walking on egg shells because if you say one thing that is remotely off then they will ghost you and continue talking to the rest of the guys they have lined up. It proves that there is this attitude I like to call ""disposable dating"" because girls have the power to talk to someone else who is looking to date them in a heartbeat, making it tough for me to meet someone who is truely interested. I bet you all can relate somehow. 

The question to this post is, what does a guy have to do in order to find a date and or get at least laid? I feel like I might as well kill myself within the next few years because as far as I'm concerned, no one is interested in dating me even though I have been called handsome and cute by many. I don't want to join a ""hiking club"" or something like that, so if you are going to say that then just save your time and don't comment that because none of my friends had to join a club in order to get a girlfriend. Guys. I'm really struggling. I feel like girls think I'm not good enough. I am seriously considering suicide. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but some day. Am I doomed to just be an incel?

2322,StefTD,1578428872,1,"Not exactly sure where to start - at first, sorry, I‚Äôm typing this on my iPhone.

7 months ago, I moved to a city I‚Äòve never visited before for my wife‚Äôs new job. It seemed great at first, found an awesome apartment, got a great job for myself, too and really enjoyed the city.
But at the same time, I was quite stressed and told my wife I need a bit of distance to learn what stresses me so much because I don‚Äôt want to reflect my problems on her or our relationship.
Mind you, I hadn‚Äôt seen my friends in months, the closest ones live 3 hours away and my new job was great, but quite different from the old one.

It seemed like we were able to work it out and had a good time again, but one night when I came home, she left her phone at home while she went to yoga (still everything fine). I heard a phone ringing, saw it was hers and a good friend of us called, so I answered (we did this and knew the pins for each other‚Äôs iphone). We chatted for a few minutes, right as we finished an SMS arrived from a new colleague of her.
She has the preview text function activated and it just said something along the lines of: ‚ÄûI‚Äôm so happy that my hoodie still smells like you! :* ‚Äú

I care about privacy but I had to read the rest - turned out, she was flirting with him for 4 weeks and planned to leave me for him. A guy she really disliked for things like smoking weed, having a bad work ethic and so on. All things she really dislikes. But he listened to her for one single afternoon while I needed distance. That was enough to break everything off, after 13 years together and 3 1/2 years married.

So after some arguments I spent the night in a hotel, went to work, told my bosses what happened, so that they know why I‚Äôm so fucked up. Than I drove to my parents after my wife and I discussed that we will speak about everything the following weekend (I left on Saturday).

So a week goes by, and she tells me she still wants to leave me, because she realized she fell in love with him (I later found out that she invited him to our apartment 12 hours after I left). 
I tried everything, told her how much she meant to me, but she didn‚Äôt care. Due to still being quite new to the town, I had to stay in our apartment and we slept in different rooms. 

I asked her every day not to call him while I still lived there, but she called him every day, I got sleep deprived (max 3 hours per day) and went almost crazy. She said she was already nice, could invite him over. I begged her to just give me one single day to relax, but she never did, even threatened to do worse things, even though I was desperately searching for a New place. She didn‚Äôt want to move out, I probably should have kicked her out. But I couldn‚Äôt live there without her. She even told me one day that she‚Äôs going to have her first official date with him, just to let me know, but due to being separated I‚Äôm not allowed to judge her for it. She‚Äôs a therapist by the way...

She forced me to give her the keys on the day I moved out (I paid for the whole month and it was the 14th), wanted my car that my dad gave to me. Paid me a 1/3 of the money I invested in the kitchen we‚Äôve built and so on. 

So that all sucks, at the same time my dad found out that he might have cancer, a good friend of mine died. I struggle with my life on a daily basis and even got really sick two days ago. Almost had to call the ambulance for myself after I blacked out multiple times at home. Some infusions and loads of meds from my doc helped a bit, but I can hardly move, my lung hurts while breathing, I can‚Äôt sleep and I‚Äôm really depressed. And I‚Äôm quite afraid that it might be something worse.

I never had a real plan for my life, but I always knew that I would be happy with her. It‚Äôs the first time since I‚Äôm 18 that my life doesn‚Äôt focus around her. And as soon as that happened, so many things broke down. 

I don‚Äôt know how to handle all of this, I don‚Äôt have many friends, and even less that will just hug you, even if you‚Äôre a sobbing wreck. Probably 2 - and both live hours and hours away and are also in a lot of stress right now.
It might help to date someone, but I don‚Äôt even know how that works anymore. And besides that, I‚Äôm not the most handsome guy, so that plus little confidence and depression probably won‚Äôt help. But just a honest hug would help me the most I think.

Sorry for the long text. Just had to get that of my chest. I already found a therapist, my first appointment is in two weeks. But especially the last two days were rough and made me understand why humans can get suicidal. I don‚Äôt think I was, but I really lost the will to live for quite some time. And it felt horrible.

Hello this might be a long post but i don't know anyone to talk to 

I'm 22 year old i can't really say i ever had a best friend i always feel different from the people around me .

I want to try the feeling of having someone who can understand me and feel what I'm saying, i got into 2 relationships and they both cheated on me so that made me feel even worse the only person i have is now gone in the worst possible way. 

Now what ? I'm left alone again with no one by my side 

I want to feel like i'm top priority in someone's life i know my post might sound like a hookup to some of you but it's not really the case I'm trying to find a best Girl-Friend or a trust worthy relationship. 

You might ask why a girl ? Why don't you have friends from same gender the answer is simple it's because i want to be wanted i want to feel that someone is attracted to me 

Yes my profile has a lot of NSFW posts but it's because that's part of the problem i want to feel that I'm sexually attractive to someone 

If u want to talk to me without having any NSFW talk I'm 100% fine with that 

I'm open minded so don't ever feel shy talking to me i accept everyone no matter how different we are 

What i really need is a real friend with whom i can feel safe and accepted, a long term real friend or relationship 
I have no limits we can do anything or talk about anything you want 

And also if you want to leave me a positive comment/ message feel free to do so it might help

2335,YeetMeToDaMoon04,1578415501,1,"So I‚Äôm 15 and trans (FtM). I know I‚Äôm young and all that but I‚Äôve had depression for roughly 3 years and I just can‚Äôt find any meaning in life. I'm not diagnosed and my  family cant afford therapy, i cant tell them about this stuff, my mom already has  enough to worry about. Im just really lonely and have no one to talk to about this stuff. I‚Äôm pre t (so not transitioned) I don‚Äôt look super female but I dunno I guess you can tell. (If anyone wants to hear that long story i made a post on r/advice, it just explains the trans stuff and those details.  Just go to my profile and it'll  be my most recent post besides this one, although there are a few comments in between ) 

I‚Äôm not out yet (I feel like Im too young to completely social transition yet) I do bind my chest and dress completely masculine. 

I feel like I‚Äôll never find anyone because I‚Äôm trans. I hate it. I wish every second of every day that I wasn‚Äôt trans but I know I need to try and accept myself. I‚Äôm gay (so I like guys) which i feel like makes things even more hopeless. I don‚Äôt think I have a bad personality (I‚Äôve got really great memes too) but I wish I could just be normal. Like, if I meet someone or whatever do I say my birthname or ..... I don‚Äôt really know my name. And because I‚Äôm not at all medically transitioned I feel like a guy I‚Äôm talking to should probably know that but at the same time I just feel like trash. But it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to them if I didn‚Äôt tell them these things, I‚Äôd feel like I‚Äôm lying. 

It‚Äôs just really upsetting that the second I say I‚Äôm trans they pretty much ghost me. I understand why though, I mean who would want to date a pre t guy who is in the closet? 

oh, I‚Äôm also moderately asexual so yeah not really into that stuff :/

Dunno I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice, I mean if ur interested in this mess of a human then go ahead and tell me xD.

I'm 22 year old i can't really say i ever had a best friend i always feel different from the people around me .

I want to try the feeling of having someone who can understand me and feel what I'm saying, i got into 2 relationships and they both cheated on me so that made me feel even worse the only person i have is now gone in the worst possible way. 

Now what ? I'm left alone again with no one by my side 

I want to feel like i'm top priority in someone's life i know my post might sound like a hookup to some of you but it's not really the case I'm trying to find a best Girl-Friend or a trust worthy relationship. 

You might ask why a girl ? Why don't you have friends from same gender the answer is simple it's because i want to be wanted i want to feel that someone is attracted to me 

Yes my profile has a lot of NSFW posts but it's because that's part of the problem i want to feel that I'm sexually attractive to someone

2348,TheF1rstHuman,1578402246,1,"I (25M) have been single all my life. I go on dates fairly often, as I'm not the worst looking guy in the world, but I've never met anyone who wanted to stay with me or go on more than 1 or 2 dates with me. I feel like my issue with being desirable to others has always been personality and confidence, rather than my looks. I've been watching as all of my closest friends hit the 1 or 2 year marks in their relationships and I've just been single the whole time and I've been slowly feeling more and more lonely over the years. Even though I am surrounded by people who genuinely like and care about me I just don't have that one special connection with anyone, an intimate loving connection. So every night when everyone else is cuddling up with their loved ones I just lie in bed alone. Or when my housemates go on holidays and trips with their partners, again I'm just alone at home or at work. I've been on multiple dating apps for years and nothing good has come out of them for me.

Recently my good friend/housemate had his friend from University come and stay with us for 2 weeks. She studied here in my country a few years back but she's pretty much from the other side of the planet. I hit it off immediately with her when she arrived. We shared a lot of similar interests, had basically the same sense of humour and had the same taste in obscure music and media. 
We were all staying up late on the 2nd night she was here, drinking wine and watching films. We were sitting next to each other on the sofa all night and by the end we were actually getting quite flirty with each other. The two of us were the last ones up after everyone else went to bed and eventually we kissed and ended up going to my bedroom.

After this night she was pretty much living out of my bedroom for the rest of the 2 weeks that she was here. We'd cuddle and talk for hours in the mornings and at night, we'd go for walks, go and get coffee, cook together or just cuddle on the sofa. My other 2 housemates had work every now and then but I had the whole festive period off so it was just me and her a lot of the time during the day. We were having sex multiple times a day and honestly it was the most regular sex I've ever had. But it was the before and after of the sex that I really enjoyed, the intimacy and the conversations, it was really, really nice. Seeing her every day for 2 weeks really made me start to like her quite quickly, we developed some private jokes together, were constantly making each other laugh and having lots of great conversations about every topic you could think of. I've always been quite an awkward guy, which has held me back in relationships and dating but she put me so at ease and was so easy to talk to that I felt my confidence go up so much when I was around her.

In all my 25 years on this planet I have never met someone who I would genuinely love to spend all my time with, every day. She was so nice and funny and easy going and just great to talk to. Not to mention beautiful.

She went back to her country a few days ago and I've never experienced such a feeling of loss in my entire life. I could barely function at work the other day because I couldn't help but think about her and how she's most likely just going to end up meeting someone else when she gets back to her country and I'm just gonna be left alone again, like I always am. We're in touch and talking online but she's so far away and so desirable that it feels like I don't really have a chance. Also, a long distance relationship of this distance is just so unlikely and inpractical that I feel like it could never work. It all feels like a cruel joke.

I've been trying to get out of my current living situation for over 6 months (deplorable conditions, cockroaches) and I finally saw the proverbial ""light at the end of the tunnel"". I found a gorgeous apartment, like it was so fucking nice I checked the BBB to make sure the property company was legitimate. I made an appointment for a viewing and it felt like something good was finally going to happen, I got so excited I was smiling just thinking about going to view it. I've been hovering between moderate to severe suicidal thoughts for the past month and so this spark of hope held quite a bit of significance for me. 

As with most things in my life, it didn't work out. Somebody managed to rent it before I could even view the apartment and it threw me into an awful spiral. I went to my local drug store and priced out sleeping pills, managed to talk myself out of it (afterall, who's going to take care of my pet?) and went home. Then I received two phone calls instigating me about my living situation and 0 remorse by the instigator (yes, same person both calls), I guess it's really fucking funny to some people. 

I've been doing some breathing exercises and letting myself cry it out. I'm kicking myself for having a stitch of hope, what an utterly stupid thing for me to do. I'll never get a place like that. That opportunity won't come again, at least not in my budget... and I feel condemned to moving from shithole to shithole. I don't have enough in my life to keep going and I'm just so sick of being in physical and psychological pain.

I often spend weekends mostly alone (I may have a few brief conversations with my brother, whom I live with).

I had a start on making 4 or 5 friends last year, and I worked hard on forcing myself to go do things whenever invited (though my severe depression at times got in the way).  I do not hear from them anymore, haven't really heard from them in months despite trying to make contact.  I'd spent most of the past four years alone prior, so it was a big step trying to make new friends.  I'd honestly reached a breaking point right before, where I'd been seriously ideating.

I can feel how close I am to being back at that place, it's just on the far side of this month.  And the worst part, I feel like I'm legitimately going insane.  I tried therapy for the whole year, two+ months of psychotherapy, anti-depressants.  Nothing has worked long term besides brief interventions via my two dogs, and despite my efforts to maintain friendships I feel I've been dropped.

And being around people living normal, social lives - With friendships and relationships, interacting with them at work knowing that the interactions mean nothing to them - I really can no longer trust what I feel, what I see, believe, remember.

And as you climb the ladder of significance in any system, your room for making mistakes keeps on decreasing depending upon how much others depend on you. The more they depend on you, the less room you have and thus your growth is stunted to a greater extent. 

The only feasible solution to this, is to decrease the dependency across the ladder of significance such that at no point, an individual or a group of individuals are completely depended upon for everything. This can only happen if every member of that system is competent enough to achieve the collective goal even in the absence of individuals that might be sufficiently higher on the ladder of significance.

I have now reached the point that I don't see the point of living, like at all. Basically everything seems bullshit. I am not able to make any friends anymore. I have always been insecure but now I just want to run away from people as fast as I can. I'm afraid to be judged I guess. I just shut down when I meet new people, I have no clue what to talk about, I'm so nervous and just want to get away. While others make friends within days or hours. I started studying now. Almost at the end of my first semester and I have no friends and always sit alone during lectures. The thought of doing any kind of group assignment freaks me out and I have already totally skipped some courses to get out of these assignments, risking my chances of passing my first year. I am afraid I will not manage my study and will never be able to apply for a job, because I am too scared to do basically anything that involves people. I feel like there is no point in living for me, everything I do is just stressful and if I meet someone I will overthink the interaction about a thousand times, about what I did or said wrong. I'm still so ashamed of some things I said many years ago that when I think of it I just want to scream. I am not sure what to do next, I feel like a genetic mistake and therefor cannot function. I see all the people around me just doing their thing and not worrying about any of this stuff and yes like that I understand how it is possible to survive this world, but just not for me. I think about ending it every day, it's the only thing that calms me down, to know there is a way out. I will see a psychologist soon. I guess I have to do something? I hope they can help. Last time I went to a psychologist she told me to just talk to people where ever I go, that is was easy. She clearly did not understand it at all. So I hope I have better luck this time.

I don't know how in depth I should go with the details but I went through a lot of abuse from my mother who enjoyed making my life hell. I developed extreme anxiety, social ineptness, shyness, and unable to talk to people. I never had a relationship with someone ever and it hurts inside. I don't really have any friends and I've been used a lot by people because I thought they were my friends when instead I was just useful for the moment. I tried going to groups with people who also had my issues but it didn't really feel the same. I've done a lot of nice things for people like help with homework, check in on people to see if they were okay, help anyway I can, put together a little birthday party for someone and still im isolated and alone. I watch as people get together and be happy but then breakup and find someone else within the span of a week. Then the two ex's meet up and stay as friends or get back together and continue having sex. For someone like me I don't get how to be able to meet people let alone exist in that same world as they do.

The hardest thing is always lying in an empty bed, wanting nothing else in the world but someone to lie beside you. To keep you company, warm, secure, and happy. To set your mind at ease. That whatever happens, there will always be that memory of when you weren't alone. A warmth to stay buried somewhere within you forever.

And I'm reminded of how cold it is living like this every time I try to fall asleep. And again when I wake up. Every time I look to my side and no one's there. No one's ever there. Some nights the cold keeps me from sleeping. It injects the deepest anxiety straight to my veins and forces me to stay awake, dreading the loneliness of the next days, weeks, months, and years. Other nights it comes to me in my nightmares. To torment me with awful horrors and visions, or to tease me with a sweet dream where I'm loved by a sweet girl, only to wretch it all away from me when I wake up.

I wish I was able to shoot myself when I was holding that gun. It could all be over by now. But I was too scared. Of the permanence. Of how I might mess up.

Came to another country to study and make something of myself 3 years ago.
Right now-
1. When you come to another country to study your first ambition is to make something of you. To be more successful, earn good money, pay off debts you had while making it happen, stand up on your own feet. But I am a complete loser. I have done nothing of it. I live with my boyfriend's parents and probably would be homeless and die of starvation if they hadnt been there to help. Note- bf and I are long dist and open.

2. My very unstable financial status quite literally makes me cry, on daily basis. I am very qualified and able but I am never gonna be the free. I ll never make enough money and I feel I ll never stop living paycheck to paycheck. Which is a bitch as I keep losing jobs every few months. All I want was a good job to get rid of this and possibly save for future. Guess its not happening.

3. In a LDR, we are open. And I am resentful. Last year on a bad note my boyfriend had tons of mental health issues and I was facing daily rejection from him in terms of pushing me away, no sex, no intimacy, and saying its difficult is understatement. I had suggested to see other people but he denied.  Now I am happy he is doing well, lesser bad days, more normal days. We agreed to be open for when he was on a solo trip for 3 weeks. I wanted to go back to exclusive but he insisted he wants to try. So I said yes.
I have no idea why he is with me. We speak 10-15 mins a day. Since long dist there are no dates. No sex. No sexting. No dirty talking. Nothing sexual apart from occasional jokes. He is going on dates now so clearly he has no need of me. He is having better days so he doesnt need me to talk to anymore or he always does talk to his therapist. He says he loves me but I am trying but having hard time to believe. Its convenient for him to be open and he said no when I needed it and he was having bad time.
I want to keep trying open but I am very resentful. I have not had been with another man yet. I had a few chances but it didnt happen in end. Him on other end had. I love him and I want this to work. I am working on getting job in the city he is but its very hard due to visa restrictions.

I wish to go to a beach eat a bunch of pills and drink alcohol and fall asleep watching sunrise and never wake up again.

Idk why I'm even like this still it's so stupid of me. I feel like I'm always so desperate for someone to say something nice about me or call me something sweet because I'm almost never complimented by anyone. I'm sorry for sounding like some desperate, annoying, freak but all I want is someone to be here for me every day to say something nice about me every day and tell me how much I mean to them.

I don't want to feel like an idiot to anyone I just want to be that sweet guy that always has something  nice to say to a person no matter what. And I'd love it if a person accepts what I say to them and maybe say something nice back to me so I'll feel happy too.

I am broke, I live in a house that is quite literally falling apart and I have neither time time to do it properly, the skills or simply the money.

I hate my life. 

The only thing that keeps me going is knowing it would hurt other people, but at this point I see one person on a regular basis and I think it would just be a load off their mind and allow them to live their life in peace for once.

I am a burden. I ran from therapy, hell I lied to the therapist simply because every solution they came up with was ""Your father"". I can not sit an listen to someone tell me how the man who at least made sure I was fed and clothed with a roof over my head tell me he is a bad man. He had problems too, I know that now, but blaming him does not make me feel better or help the good memories I have left of him.

I am alone, I would give my life to hug that man again and tell him how much I really loved him and appreciate the sacrifices he made for me. 

Lately if I tell anyone the way I feel I just get a chuckles and ""Well you are just being too hard on yourself"" Great advice people, let me know how to stop it and maybe that will help. Even my mother just tells me you need more meds, or ""You aren't taking your meds are you?"" I do every day, even when they make me feel weird.

I sit here balling, a 38 year old man who can not even afford to fix the water pouring in from his chimney and in the basement because I feel paralyzed by my own brain.

I take Vyvanse, Trintellix and Tripeltal .. these are just a few of the dozens of meds I have tried other the years.

I truly feel like none of these medications will never help me. I have been like this since I was 14, I can not keep this up the rest of my life. Every six months I just feel like I lose myself. Who wants to be part of that?

I had to acknowledge my sister first, as upon it reaching 6pm and her still not saying anything I realised I'd likely have to go first or just have one less person wishing me a happy birthday, as expected, her reply was swift once I had messaged her first...

My boyfriend ignored my birthday.
His mother appeared to genuinely forget, but it was gutting to have to have me personally text the woman to make her aware, to save her feeling guilty if she finds out two weeks down the line, whilst also having to stress that the message was not my way of selfishly saying 'lol so where's my gifts?'.

Especially when her birthday is next weekend and I've already bought her something with my money because she literally asked me to, sending me a fucking shopping list, after I text her early on this month asking for a reminder of her birthday to ensure I got it right. I'm unsure of why she could not have sent me a damn text asking when my birthday was to be sure? She even said in her reply when I told her that she knew my birthday was in January, she just didn't know when. And then I recieved my happy birthday - like it meant anything at that point lmao.

So yep. I knew her birthday was in January, didn't know when, so I checked with her early on in the month. This seems logical, right?
What in the holy hell was wrong with her checking with me?!?!

I'm now hosting a small get together for his mother next weekend also. I didn't actually get a say in this, my boyfriend offered her over, whilst she was on the phone to him, on speaker also so I could hardly pipe up and say 'hang on!', I simply had to agree.

This is going to be expensive for me as although his mother has said she'll be bringing food I know she'll expect us to supply her with a lot, specifically the weed that I smoke for medical reasons. She'll 100% want some, free of charge.

I'm dreading it. This will not be my birthday party. It will be hers. I don't really want to host the party of someone who forgot all about my birthday. I don't really want to spend the kind of money that I will be spending. I've bought her a gift, more than one!

Best thing is, she had a choice! She sent a fucking list! She's not asked for my list! I've bought my own presents this year! The ones I EVENTUALLY get from her will be literal tacky knock off crap. I do not have expensive taste - I can find cheap things that i like that do not look tacky or knock off, which is sad because the woman is gonna end up spending more on crap I will not ever use than she would if she just asked me if I want something specific, I can find cheap that is not tacky. On Christmas, she also got what she asked for from me. I got what I was given - I regifted nearly all of it! None of it was bought by someone who knows me at all or cares about me. It was like receiving a present from that one coworker who is super friendly with everyone bar you but they're still kind enough to buy you a gift at Christmas however the gift is minimal effort, cheap, and complete guesswork as of to what you like. You appreciate it - but you definitely couldn't care less if they just forget in future because by and by they're only wasting their own money and time.

I'm just so underwhelmed and so isolated.
A friend that I have blocked on facebook, due to my boyfriends jealousy, added me as a friend today. This was when I realised that I actually only had the friend blocked on messenger, not Facebook. He couldn't reach out due to this fact however.

It made me cry seeing him pop up like that, because i know he just wants to wish me a happy birthday or acknowledge that it is my birthday. Best thing is, my birthday is not shared with anyone bar my friends on Facebook (I confirmed this through double checking my privacy settings).

Hey everyone, I'm part of a small Discord server meant to help people make new friends.  
We do a lot of activities as a community, including:  
\- **Movie nights**: Anyone can host! Our regular hosts have Disney+, Netflix, and Amazon Prime.  
\- **Game nights**: Jackbox, Cards Against Humanity, Skribbl... we also have a Steam group and roles for different gaming platforms.  
\- **Voice chats**: You can talk or even just listen in, we don't mind lurkers :)  
\- **Drawing challenges**: Every month we have new themes for inspiration.  
\- **Minecraft server**: Build with us in a lightly modded survival world.

We have channels for all types of interests so everyone has something they can talk about! (Sports, art, gaming, music, fashion, tech and more) We also have channels for NSFW stuff as well as venting in case you just wanna get things off your chest.  
We only accept people over 18 and the server is meant for purely platonic friendships only. Message me and tell me a bit about yourself if you're interested, we'd be happy to have you!

**Note:** we ask everyone to introduce themselves when they join the server. If you're not willing to share a few interests with the group to get conversations started, this server is not for you.",lonely,Discord server community for making friends!,2020-01-06 07:41:08
2513,Xenvette,1578256165,1,"Bit of a heads up, there is some heavy language in this post.

I can't tell if it's me or the people in my life that make me feel like I'm going mad. 

It's like they don't understand the most common law that is a pretty much a well known fact. Every action has a reaction of some sort. 

A few years back I moved to my home state after traveling across country. It's something I've enjoyed doing that unfortunately screwed up my life. Went where ever for whatever reason. 

When I came back I had no place to go, no work, nothing. I did it intentionally so I can understand the one thing I was never taught after being tossed to the wind by my family at fourteen/fifteen. 

I did it but the cost left me with destroyed relationships, the only people around me choose to focus on how I react and say that it's a problem. Even with some of the dumbest shit, like fucking video games - I'm 27 not fucking 17. So it just shows me the problem I'm faced. 

Do I try and fix this relationship or do I just let go? If I let go then I'm even more alone than now. If I try and fix it, then I have a chance ofaking the situation worse. I can't even begin to figure out what or where to go this issue. 

The nasty habit I built from traveling is the urge to just leave and go somewhere. Never come back, but I built something here and I can't replace the time lost on it. 

There more to this but this is the crack that broke me a bit, the people I've helped only to screw me over, the friends I've known for years are just - I've either changed or they changed but it's apparent that there's a conflict here with just how we are as individuals. 

I just don't know what to do about this, I'm tired of being alone, I'm tired of feeling this void no matter who I surround myself; it's still there. I choose not to have sexual relationships because I've only gotten screwed over in them one way or another.

I guess the question Im asking here is, how do you know if you're the problem or if it's the people around you that are. 

I understand that the saying, ""If everyone is the problem, them maybe its yourself."" But what if it isn't? I just try and keep my distance with much, I try and be helpful and nice and leave it there but I just - it's getting more difficult for me to word it. 

I'm pretty sure I'm not the only that has been faced this issue. I'm hoping I could probably get some advice about this.",lonely,People in my life,2020-01-06 07:29:25

He was then moving to other state for Uni, and we decided to just go on a random spontaneous trip. We went to Cali and had the best time EVER.   

Before our destination, there was this diner. He touched me , and showed 2 girls from the table next to us. It is not inappropriate to ask for hanging out, I thought, so we did! The girls were age 18, and we all clicked. They were waiting for the bus to Cali, and they again, didn‚Äôt have a place, didn‚Äôt have plan. It was PERFECT.   

He grabbed Lucy‚Äôs attention, other girl Mia had curly hair, she was beautiful and so nice. We came to Cali, had the time of our life, listening to music, playing in the pool. I clicked with Mia, and lost my virginity that evening. Repeating myself - it was the best 7 days of my entire life. Cali, new friends, summer.‚ÄùWe have to repeat this‚Äù - he muttered on the way back home.    


Lets go to present now. I am 23, no friends, just students that I know, whom I really never clicked with.

I would comment on a story on Instagram, he would reply with emoji, but he never really interacted with me. I guess he found the new group of friends, again, judging by the Instagram.    

He came to his home-state yesterday. I asked him out. We went out this morning on a breakfast. I refuse to believe thats the same guy. The way he talks about women. The way he never left the phone out of his hand. The way he made me feel invisible.

The majority of lonely people are men.

Men often post how they have no friends, no family, no relationships.

Women often post about how they can‚Äôt find love.

Most users here are in the 20-30 age range (but that‚Äôs Reddit in general).

Being lonely is accompanied by depression, anxiety, low self esteem.

2556,Im_awesome_AMA,1578201807,2,"Half a year ago I met a really great girl.
She had just come out of a long term relationship and I suppose I was mostly a distraction to her. She always told me she is not ready to be emotionally attached again, and I told her the same. 

I thought it would be what she'd want to hear, but I was lying to myself. And the more we got to know each other, the more I fell in love, and the more she fell out of it. I felt really connected to her the more I got to know about her. She felt more and more like I'm not right for her. One time she told me she really had a crush on me until she got to know me. That stung. Regardless, we spent time with each other almost every day. 

A few months ago, in September, she told me she doesn't want to see me anymore. I told her I was in love with her, and she answered she was still thinking about her ex, and even if she weren't I wouldn't be right for her. I was really sad, but what was I to do except accept it.
In the months to come I got drunk a lot and senselessly flirted with random people to fill the void. I was still in love with her, and sad about the loss but I didn't feel as empty anymore. 

Around the beginning of this month, we saw each other again and I went home with her. I was so happy. We started texting again every day, and seeing each other a few times a week. Sometimes she'd still vent to me about her ex, and I'd try to be supportive but hearing her talk about how she still loves him and wants to get back with him broke my heart. But in the end we ended up having sex and she'd cuddle me and that made it so easy to lie to myself.

'One day she'll come around. She will open up again and be able to truly see what we have. Somewhere deep down inside of her, she has to feel the same as me'

New Years eve we had an argument. She danced with someone else, I got angry and went home. I was drunk, but even if I hadn't been it would have hurt. I've had accepted that she doesn't want a relationship with me, but I thought we could still have a good time while it lasts. Maybe that's even why I kept falling in love with her, but in my mind it never made sense that if I was with her I'd have to hold back. Maybe it's not forever, but I still wanted to kiss her in public, and hold hands, and have her play with my hair and just let myself fall into the moment and enjoy it wholeheartedly. She told me she notices how I feel, that she knows what she wants and that I am not it. That she is busy with herself and wants to feel free and that she doesn't with me. That if we spent time the way I imagined it, we could just have a relationship (not going to lie when she said that I thought yeah we could and I'd love that). That she doesn't want to hurt me by giving me false hopes, and that she still isn't over her ex. I told her I had accepted that a long time ago and let's please just have a nice few weeks until you move away. I was really banking on that, because that would have made it like a higher power kind of thing.
She said she'd consider it and we haven't seen each other since. I still texted her, because I miss her. We talked about neutral uni stuff, but every evening I would offer that we could see each other if she wanted. I had really hoped she'd just say yes and I'd get to run away from accepting that this is never going to work just for a while longer. But I felt desperate at the same time, like an unwanted solicitor.

I'm a stroke of absolute genius I decided I had to show her I am not as attached as she thought. That she wasn't actually breaking my heart and it would be OK to just spend a little time with me without worrying about my feelings and attachments and the fact that I love her.
I decided to text her that I am kind of horny and if she had time that evening I'd like to see her.
Her first response was delete my number. I said sorry. She said she doesn't think we should see each other again. I said I didn't mean to insult or hurt her, that I am sorry for having said that and that she is not just anyone to me. That I still understand how that was hurtful and would be leaving her alone from now on. That if she ever wanted to see me again I would be available and that if she never wanted to see me again I would appreciate saying my goodbyes in person.
She has not replied.


I know this is on me, but that doesn't change the feeling I have right now. I wonder why I just could never listen to her. She has been telling me this since the very beginning, but there's still a part of me that's indignant right now thinking 'we would have been perfect for each other', and it really hurts that she couldn't see it that way. I deeply miss her and wish I could make it up to her and just spend time in her arms. That has been the only place I have felt true comfort since I've met her, and I am really mad at myself for feeling this way. It feels like I have calluses on my emotions, and she has been the first person in a really long time to press on them so hard that even through those, I felt something. I was really happy spending my days with her, even if she always took swipes at me telling me how this or that about my character bothered her. I always thought we were just playing, that maybe she was annoyed by me sometimes but in her heart of hearts she felt similar to me.

Turns out she was really just annoyed. Turns out she really thinks  we could never get married, 'not even in a parallel universe' as she once said. I am grateful for her being honest with me, but I feel really dumb for being sad. I should have known better.

Still, I am going to miss her immensely. It has been a long time since I felt that way and opened up to someone like that. I always felt we got along perfectly in our day to day. We were best friends and the sex was great. I think what I'm gonna miss most is her being my go to talk person. I don't text a lot with my guy friends, but whatever I felt, whatever problem I had or whatever meme I'd seen I could always talk to her. And even if there was no reason, we would just spend all day talking, every day. But not anymore. 

Back to distracting myself with stuff I don't truly enjoy and fantasizing about one day just loving someone and being 100% sure they love me back the same way.

2557,MonaLisaRevenge,1578201751,1,"Once upon a time, I was a happily married woman. I had everything. A beautiful home, kids, and loyal hard working handsome and hung husband. Outside my window you could see mountains and a treed forest. A large well maintained grassy yard, basketball court, pets, farm animals, fruit trees and so much more. A bountiful life. A life I always wished for when I was a young lonely child.

However, that all changed in the summer of 2015. My life was ripped from me and I was ignorant to the campaign to ruin what I worked so hard for.

In school I befriended an asian man named Jon. He took a liking to me and would sit next to me and converse with me, when many others wouldn't. He gave me attention though. Despite my unusual oddities. He was well cared for smart and articulate gentleman. Large coke bottle glasses, quite tall and thin. Unusual framework for the average asian.   He had mentioned he previously worked for the government. In fact, a few people in my past had always 'worked for the government' in some form or fashion.

On a dark winter's night, jon had reached out to me via phone. A format he had never reached out to me on before. Talking about a matter that was outside a very basic school friendship. Under the full moon I stood outside in the yard, facing my husband's shop, while I listened to his story and his woe.

He was in anguish. He was in desperate need for an ear. He talked about how painfully alone he was and how all he wanted was a wife and family. An odd thing for a married woman to listen to, while her husband was steps away. I didn't know how to comfort jon aside from being sympathetic with him and trying my best to reassure him that we learn things when given times of loneliness. It can be important in short terms. I was a very lonely girl when I was young before I met my husband, so I understood from a place I had already been that I had the benefit of forgetting after years of happiness.

He cried. He wanted to kill himself. He wanted to die. And there was nothing I could really do. I wasn't that close with him to begin with and couldn't attempt to be since I was a married woman. To tell you the truth, he scared me. I was afraid of him for the first time because I didn't know him well and that behavior was different than our other interactions. At the end of the conversation, I could do nothing for him. I have no idea where he is now. Maybe he did kill himself. Maybe he moved back to korea to find a wife.

I became divorced shortly after. I'm going to leave out a lot of the important details about Jon. But one thing that is indisputable, is that he breathed his curse into my mind.  It lives with me now, years later. I'm infected by what I once feared and now live. What I once suffered from and now suffer again. He didn't even have the decency to teach me how to make authentic kimchi.

2558,lifeiselsewhere_,1578201486,2,"Hello :) 

This is the first time I post anything here so it's a little scary but I will try my best. Everyone seems so nice. 

So I am a freshman in college, and basically, I have no friends. I have some acquaintances and people who could possibly end up being my friends, but no one seems to really want to be close to me. I moved to the US a few years ago, and before then, I never had to make any friends. I grew up and went to school with the same people all my life, so those are my real friends. I know they love me too, so I don't think there is anything wrong with me. That's why I don't understand why people here don't seem to want to be my friends.

I have to say I am a bit introverted at first, but when I get comfortable, I can be pretty outgoing and funny . I am not the most confident person either, but I am ok with myself, so that can't be the problem. It's not like people don't want to be near me or anything, just that no one wants to be actual friends with me. People seem to think I'm nice and cool when they talk to me, so why don't they want to be my friends??? I'm just really tired of sitting in my room by myself, eating alone, and having no one to hang out with or talk to. Family life is good, but I don't want to tell them that I don't have friends. I also feel frustrated when I'm with them and realize that they are the only people I have, and yet, I am not sharing what makes me sad.

I thought college was going to be a fresh new start, full of new experiences, and that I'd be happier than in my last years of high school (where I didn't have friends either), but that is not the case. I put myself out there in the first few weeks, and I hung out with some people who seemed interested in getting to know me. But once groups started forming, I was left out. I try to talk to my ""acquaintances"" on social media, and although they talk back, rarely ever do I get invited to do anything with them. I try to bring up plans too, but since no one ever ends up coming along, I just do things by myself, and I'm starting to give up. On top of that, no one ever reaches out to me in a ""romantic"" way either, although I would say I am a fairly good looking and cool person. What is wrong with me???

I just wanted to ask for other people's opinion and their tips for getting out of this situation. I'm very tired of feeling lonely and sad all the time.

and this past september, when a guy asked me to hang out and proceeded to rub me through my pants as we stood parked in the lot of a walmart. again, i didn‚Äôt say no. i didn‚Äôt say a word. i was so starved of kindness, so starved of a friend to the point where i accepted this as the be all end all. i later became disgusted with my body and developed an eating disorder 

i can‚Äôt believe how ignorant i was to all of this. i honestly pity myself for reaching such a low point where these interactions were considered a normal part of human connection to me. thankfully i have pushed these people out of my life, but these traumatic memories still haunt me. anyone got any similar experiences?",lonely,i remember how desperate i used to be,2020-01-05 13:25:39

The majority of my friend‚Äôs plans centre around them meeting up with their children, they go to places for their kids to play etc and they catch up at the same time. I don‚Äôt have children so obviously don‚Äôt get included in the plans, again totally understand. 

Last year I had to move into an apartment on my own. My husband had a serious cocaine addiction and he refused any help so I called time on our marriage. 

Family wise, my brother and sister-in-law have their children and I see them maybe once every month for a few hours. 

My parents are great and I visit them for dinner once a week. I don‚Äôt want to burden them with how I feel or talk to them about my problems, I don‚Äôt want to worry them. 

I come home from work 4/5 nights per week to sit with nobody to talk with. I finish work on a Friday and most weekends I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk with until I go back to work on the Monday morning. 

I go to the gym but again I‚Äôm just on my own. I have signed up for classes but it‚Äôs just in, work out and straight back out again. 

I have really struggled over the holidays. It really shouldn‚Äôt have been a burden but I got two weeks vacation and I don‚Äôt go back to work until Monday. I have spent the majority of the time alone and with nothing to do.  

I feel empty. I‚Äôm not sure how to make it better. One of my colleagues suggested dating but I really don‚Äôt feel ready for another relationship.

I thought so, I started working out, put effort into my appearance, started conversations with people, tried to be a good person...so why do I feel more empty than ever? Why do I feel more lonely than any other time in my life? Why do I have virtually no friends and have nothing to do or no one available to hang out with, so i'm stuck every day, doing nothing? Why am I so dependent on one person to keep me from myself? Why does no one really like me or are even bothered to talk to me? I want to know what it is about me, what can I do to change this, to change myself. 

I still hate myself. I still am super self conscious about every part of me, but if I ever try to reach out people just hate me more for it and that leads to me being even more alone on top of that. 

I feel so bad for being so needy, for wanting so much more physical contact than what I get. For wanting to just meet up someone in person that genuinely wants to just talk and hang out. For being so self conscious and wanting attention and praise to feel better about myself.

2592,MonaLisaRevenge,1578175961,27,"Most recently, I got the idea to add plants into my home. Something I've done in the past, only annually by having a balcony garden. But hadn't thought of even having them indoors all year long. In fear that I would kill them with my very non-green thumb. However, like anything, practice makes perfect. I had stumbled upon this video with an incredible woman that filled her city apartment with plants everywhere. I was very impressed and entrapped. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NwD7VjxZ\_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NwD7VjxZ_A)

Upon watching that, I did more research. I had read something somewhere which stated that plants can naturally clean the air of toxins, according to a nasa study. And being that I'm very fond of trees and rivers and mountains and have had to live the last 4 years of my life, further away from them, I figured I could bring some different species into my own home. Ones that do alright with little light. I started with 2 and them from there ended up with 7 different plants and a small aquaponics fish tank that grows herbs. A small blue beta fish to add to the new plant environment. Also a medium window sill potter for small radish vegetables I'm trying to grow in the sun, but not having much luck yet. 

The best thing I've discovered about these plants, which seems to be a documented truth, is that they help lower my depression. And I've also been regularly taking vitamin b. But, the house is so much more less lonely than it seemed before. You don't get that sense of dread as you do in a house without plants. It makes it feel more like a home. And you have something/someone to talk to. They are alive. Watching life and living with you. They give you a sense of being responsible and useful to another living thing. Somehow, they keep you a little calmer. A sense of peace. 

My loneliness isn't cured at all. I still want a husband! But is it so much better with the plants. I'm doing my best to keep the ones I've got alive. I think my kids also benefit from the plants too. It just makes for an entirely different aura in the home. I'm not positive how to put it in words. But maybe there is someone out there it could help too.",lonely,"Less Lonely Since I've Invited Plants Into My Home. If You Talk To Them, They Listen.",2020-01-05 09:12:41

At around alfway through the dream she wanted to leave me for some reason (I think I had screwed up something with our relationship) but I convinced her to stay, then woke up in disappointment.
In the second dream I met a dark-blond haired girl, who, like the first one, was pretty even though there was nothing special about her look.
I met her at a very large and crowded feast (don‚Äôt ask me why) and for some reason my parents were with me, then I started talking to the girl and, again, I remember that I felt a love for her, a kind of love that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my first (previous) dream.
She was also interested in me, then I remember that many days passed in the dream and then I was smoking weed (I don‚Äôt know why) with my real life friends, but suddenly remembered I had an appointment with my girlfriend at my house later that day.
So I ran to my house and found her on my bed. She was a bit pissed I made her wait, but soon forgave me. We had sex afterwards, but it wasn‚Äôt the kind of sex done just for pleasure (like porn sex), it was true love, and I remember I was feeling so good of sharing the intercourse with her, and being there laying in her arms afterwards.

I've never had any real friends, nor have I ever been in a  relationship. I've never done things like hold hands or kiss, I've never really known interpersonal warmth.

The last time I had any romantic encounter with a woman was 2009. Before that, there were only a handful of almost-but-not-really relationships. 

I have an unused degree, a full-time job, and am a student. I have 1 friend I know I could count on, but he's an alcoholic so I find myself distancing myself from him because I'm mostly one myself but trying hard to not be. There are a few other people I know, but I keep them at a distance because I know I'm a downer. Besides, they are all young and don't ""really"" want a creepy old guy hanging around, I get it (yeah we talk, but they don't want to hang out or invite me to gatherings). 

I have a hard time relating to people, and am guarded so I do come off as creepy which makes attracting a woman nearly impossible. I believe society is collapsing and the future is bleak. So, on top of all my other fine qualities I'm a weirdo too. I spend my time learning trade/technical/primitive survival skills so my interests are also very niche.

I'm pretty sure that at my age, and given all the above, I have to come to terms with the fact that I am past the point of no return. Either that, or I would have to bury my head in the sand, abandon everything that makes me me, and put on some new plastic personality.

I'm not even sure why I'm even writing all this. Maybe it's just in the hope that future me can come back to this and see how far I've come.

I'm a 16 year old boy from South East Asia and ever since my family moved to Canada, things have been going downhill for me. I found it very difficult to fit in school because of language barriers. And me being an introvert didn't help either. As a response, I desperately tried to find my own people, which I did. I found a group of 5 people that spoke my main language. They immediately welcomed me to their group and my old noisy self was coming back. After some time, they showed me that they were not the people I thought they were. (There's 1 guy I happily get along with) But the rest are just  scumbags. There's this one guy in our ""friend"" group that hates me for no reason, he's manipulative and toxic, but gets away with it because of his humor. 

I tried to avoid them, but I immediately found myself with no one to talk to again. Should I keep pursuing this trash friendship so that I could fulfill my social needs? Right now I'm trying to be fluent asap and converse as much English as possible at home or at video games hoping it would save me from being akward asf irl.

Lately I shifted my attention to fitness to increase my self-esteem. And boy do I find it lonely heading at the gym alone, not having a gym friend, and eating at McDonalds by myself after my workouts. I feel like it's my fault for avoiding all these potential conversation and friends anyways.

This has been a long rant, and if you made it this far, I thank you so much and I wish you the best fellow redditor.

I know people joke that they have no friends, but I've genuinely lost all people that were at one point close to me. I have no one I can reach out to... no one I can open up to. The few people that talk to me when they're bored don't want to hear about me. They want to share about themselves. 

I spend the majority of my time at work or at home. I don't go out anymore because it makes me anxious to leave the house and do things alone. It's difficult for me to open up and I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to form health relationships.

How do you deal with this? Will I ever br able to have a group of people I can connect with. Am I meant to be alone forever? If so, how do I cope?

2671,verdipar,1578097583,1,"(Warning this will be somewhat long) 

I am a 16 y/o boy living in my annoying grandma's 40 y/o wooden house with my dad, step-mom, and baby brother. I'm enrolled in an online high school meaning I'm pretty much home 24/7 with doing nothing but doing 4-5 hours of school every weekday and playing videogames. I live in a rural area where there are only houses around and small stores. 10 years ago our family was one, we were wealthy and I was always smart, energetic and happy. The next coming years would change it all.

2010 would be one of the worst years of my life, when my favorite grandma (mothers side) died of cancer. Still though, being the happy and smart kid that I was, quickly recovered and came back to school getting 100s everywhere and finishing the grade as number 1 of my class. 3rd grade was when my parents would be screaming at each other all the time, and me and my brother were always crying in our room hearing them. After a couple months they got divorced, which really affected me and my grades in 3rd grade, but luckily I had one of the best teachers ever, making sure everyone was always enjoying class. 4th grade I had the worst teacher ever, I remember that old hag very well because of how boring and annoying her class was, but of course my smartass had excellent grades anyway. 5th to 6th grade was pretty alright. Then I entered middle school which was when we were living with our stepmom which thankfully is the best mom ever, not like my slutty and dumb real mom which probably her only purpose in life is to widen her p\*ssy as much as possible.

Anyway, middle school is where I would meet my best friends ever and for the most part these years were chill.

But then, oh then came high school and puberty. As I was growing up I was starting to realize how much was hidden from me as a child. I found out how much in debt my dad was because he didn't pay his taxes, and if not for my stepmom making him wake up and start paying his taxes, he would definitely be in jail right now. I found out the real reason my parents got divorced (my mom cheated) and around the same time my dad couldn't afford rent anymore so we moved to my old grandma's old shitty house, but hey atleast she asked for no rent money. These were the years where my happiness and energy came crashing straight down. Fast forward 2 years to now, still living in the same old rotten house, my parents bought a good house on a low price w/o electricity or water 3 years ago, its still there with no progress. I'm pretty much dead inside, I feel no emotion, nothing makes me happy or excited anymore. Of course I can laugh at funny videos, memes or funny moments when playing games with my friends, but I am in no way truly happy at all. My ability to post a picture of myself online without worries completely went away (mainly because I'm pretty skinny and short for an average 16 y/o). Because I switched to online school bc my private school was too expensive, I have no way to socialize with anyone my age on a daily basis. I now have no way to get to know a girl or something of course, and I'm too scared to talk to anyone on social media because I'm too worried about being rejected and laughed at. I'm not scared at all to talk to a girl irl though, I just feel very nervous when going directly at them online. I am mainly very introverted around my boring ass family, but when its me and my best friends and/or my old classmates at a party, I be partying, drinking, screaming at the song lyrics and having fun like there's no tomorrow. As of writing this though, I have become super lazy, not having any energy or passion to do my schoolwork everyday. Barely enjoying videogames that much anymore. By doing pretty much nothing all day, I barely feel hungry, but of course I do make sure I eat everyday. I always tell myself that I will exercise today, but I never do it because my grandma's house is right next to my aunt's house to the left and great aunt's house to the right, which basically means whenever I'm outside they can all see me, and I get embarrased to do some exercise outside while everyone is looking at me while laughing. I am so bored bc if I aint on my laptop or phone, I pretty much have nothing to do. There are no parks, movie theaters, malls, or any other interesting thing around here to do. I have lots of dreams, but no energy to get to them. 

TL;DR - 16 y/o life ruined dead inside boy with nothing to do everyday and nobody to have an emotional or personal conversation with.

2677,qwertyuiop4000,1578093337,5,"Bit of background. I'm an autistic 17 year old guy who couldn't communicate directly with someone with confidence if my life depended on it. I feel like my autism has hindered my personality and thoughts in some areas, like trying to talk with people. I always struggle to get involved with a conversation. I do think sometimes it's a benefit though. There were plenty of things that no one should say to someone, but because of how badly I communicate, no one understands me, so I offend nobody. It feels more like a downside though because of the summer break just over a year ago. (this next bit will likely make most people cringe, so sorry for that in advance)

I was going to this thing called NCS (national citizen service, it's a UK thing where you get to do a bunch of activities then organise charity stuff the couple weeks after) anyway, I was suprisingly popular there, even though I barely talked. While there I met a group of girls who were sweet and kind to me, but one in particular stood out to me. Georgia seemed to pay more attention to me, asking me to join their group, asking me to sit next to her, and she often seemed excited to see me. When I arrived one week her even friend told me that she'll be glad to see me, and sure enough she was. I didn't know if she was just kind and polite anyway or if she had a crush on me, but me being me, I didn't ask for a phone number or social media. I was planning to, but she was surrounded by friends and everywhere she went she was with someone. We had an awards ceremony for participation in it and I was going to then, but I felt like her friends would laugh at me for it. I didn't know what would happen, what if they would laugh at me for being pathetic looking or making it too obvious I had a crush on her, then have her tell me she liked me as a friend? I instead stood in a corner of the room, just one small comment away from breaking down in tears. I had some girls approach me and they seemed to notice I was down so they tried getting me to do more stuff while there, which helped, but I feel like because of my autism my thoughts are suppressed by my own self. I might not be so lonely and pathetic if I had just talked to her. She seemed to be the only person I knew who didn't have any negative traits or thoughts, always happy. I don't really know if she was even real or if it was all one big elaborate dream in my head, she just seemed too kind to exist. Now I'm stuck on r/needafriend and r/makefriendshere trying desperately to just have a friend I can talk for a while, but then conversations just die off like they don't want to anymore.

I'm looking for some comfort. I'm looking for some attention.  


**My father and his coldness**  
Sometimes he would show kindness, then he would destruct me emotionally.   
Recently, it  was too much for me. He went too far with some behaviors he had.  
I just don't want to hear from him anymore. I wish him the best, but I just can't be around him anymore.  
It's so hard for me to open my heart to him, and then see him consuming all my positive energy, seeing him destroying me mentally.   
I even had this argument with him, I asked him why he would never laugh with me, why he would never ask how I'm feeling  
Seeing how other fathers behave toward their kids, and then looking at my father, and the cold way he treats me is hard.

  
**My mother and her lack of love**  
I remember this talk I had with my mom.   
She told me this story about me as a kid. There was this teacher I cherished so much. She told me there was this day, when I cried terribly after her because she had to change school.  
My mother told me, as a kid, I would get attached to anyone around.   


Truth is I was attached because of the love I would get from those ""people around"".   
I didn't want to tell my mom. I didn't want to cause her pain.   


There was that day, when my mom approached me to hug me. It was so unusual. It felt so weird.   
I suddenly had madness growing inside me. I thought that this was so unfair. She was giving me love, when I didn't need it. I'm a grown man now. I thought "" where were you when I needed this ? ""   


**No recognition for the achievements I make**  
I have accomplished so many things in my life, and yet I'm just 21. I have proved how strong I am, I have involved financially in a way that no one has seen before. I have worked hard in order to be wise, mature, and good. I'm doing my best in order to be attractive with really good clothing and taking care of my body.   
I feel like all of this is in vain. No one is beside me in order to recognize those achievements. Whatever I'm doing - I could even win the lottery and no one would be around to recognize this achievement.   
I wish I had someone whom sharing those accomplishment with.  


**My experience as a closeted gay**   
They are all asking this question "" so when are you getting a girlfriend ? ""   
I would deeply feel uncomfortable, then create some random excuse to justify myself.  
This is so much pressure. It's about playing a role in front of everyone in my family. It's a non stop job.   
I just want to be myself. I just want to be able to talk freely about my feelings.

He is a nice person but our friendship ended somehow badly, so if a get rejected, I'm just afraid that my reaction will be too much and who knows what I will do after that.

Now my only options are to either get new online buddies (feel free to hmu, but know that talking to me can worsen your mood) or text him. What should I do?",lonely,What should I do?,2020-01-04 08:28:09

2687,IamaCraab,1578085979,2,"Pathetic... many people find loneliness pathetic. Like, we want something we can't have and the rest of the world have it so it seems like we are worse than the rest in it.

But I don't think it's that simple. At all. I mean, different people require different kind of things, and not being lonely is not a matter of an only factor ""being social"" ""being popular"", that's just teenager fears expressed, the way I see it.

I'd say that people who are more ""like the rest"" or share more things with them, tend to feel less lonely, but not being like the rest is not necessarily being worse than the rest (nor better).

As years have passed, I've seen that loneliness, with sadness, gives a sense of inferiority to people, but when you fight that fears, or just for luck, you know more people... you end seeing the truth: I can socialize like any other, everybody is liked by some people, disliked by some people, going out every weekend, having people calling you for events, is ""easy"" for everybody (ok, that word may be wrong, the only problem is psychological, but that doesn't make things easy, what I'm trying to say is that once a person has lost fears, it doesn't matter how not funny you think you are, how boring you think you are when you talk, people are searching just like you for other random people to go out, and in big groups the truth is, talking is almost always anything but interesting, it's just making noise and smile.

I guess young people will always desire things and after they get them they will always think ""why did I even thought I would like this"".

The thing is, in the end, if you are lonely, that's probably because you just don't get along with others, because you wouldn't feel less lonely doing the same things that other people do. I tend to think that many people end ""forgetting how lonely they feel"" precisely in the search of not feeling lonely by going out with strangers that don't satisfy their solitude, and that's all. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe they truly enjoy that.

But those who have really good relationships don't need to see them all the time, and I've never met a person who had more than a couple of friends like that if they have them. When they have them, it doesn't depend (at all) in how smart, pretty, ingenious, funny... you are, it doesn't seem to depend on any factor but compatibility, which vary a lot from one person to another. It's true that some things allow you to meet more people, and that can lead to have more good relationships, but factors for having that kind of relationships are not so simple, I wouldn't say that even honesty or kindness are ""good"" or ""worse"" for that, some people fit with some people, and that's all, they don't even have to be the same.

So, I hope that if you think that you are pathetic for not having friends, you stop thinking that. You are not pathetic. We are just mutant weirdos that will be forever alone no matter how good we become in anything or how much strangers love us.

But who knows, maybe we learn how to feel well with some regular people, or we met other muties at some point in life :)",lonely,"To those who think that being lonely is ""pathetic"" or makes you worse than the rest",2020-01-04 08:12:59

2737,-JeanP-,1578027128,1,"So im just posting this because i feel very lonely and i wanna know your opinion on what should i do to make it better

So i just graduated from high school about a year ago, and all throughout elementary through highschool i grew up with the same people and had lots of friends and i felt happy back then, i would hangout with all the guys and we would usually just do silly things when we were younger and when we grew up we would love to talk about all the good and funny moments, our favourite things to do were playing videogames or meeting up at the park to play soccer, or just hangout and do anything together, over time most of us started getting jobs, or girlfriends so we started hanging out less often but would still see each other and have fun, we would see each other everyday in high school so it was cool.

Fast forward to the end of high school we all graduated and everything, i was happy to finally have graduated, but had memories there and was sad that most of the people i went to highschool with i wouldnt see again or not as much, especially my mates. Once college started it felt weird and boring tbh, i only had 2 or 3 friends i knew from highschool that went to the same college i went, and im the beginning we would hangout a bit, but then as time went on and on everyone started parting ways, a lot of my friends moved to different states and we lost contact, others just left and stopped talking to us, and some were just busy with work or college or even their girlfriends, ever since college began, i havent talked to a single of my friends again. It felt like it just happened so suddenly out of nowhere. 

Now people would probably say just go out and make new friends but its not the same. I find myself usually just alone thinking, and being bored, sometimes i get lonely and i have nothing to do, even when i used to love playing videogames with my friends, nowadays i turn on my pc to play or my console and play for like 10 minutes and just sit and think again and get bored so i turn it off, i have so many games but i dont even touch them, i domt even go to the park anymore either, so much soccer equipment just gathering dust, and although i feel lonely all the time, i dont feel like talking to people or making friends, and i dont want to contact my old ones, we havent talked in so long, so i kinda just said forget about it.

2751,jukcze,1578011946,4,"I have always been a solitary fellow,I never really had many friends,never really got out,never had a girl.I never felt lonely,but I got used to doing things alone or not doing them at all.And now I am disturbed like never before.

I live in a relatively small town,but it‚Äôs got both an elementary and a high school.I was really weird in elementary school (‚Äúthe quiet kid‚Äù),but at 11 I transferred to the high school (it‚Äôs a good opportunity for not dumb people-basically a more difficult 2nd half of elementary school+4 years high school).Now there is a girl that I have known since kindergarten.She went to elementary school with me and transferred to the same high school just like me.More about her later though.

Years went by and I changed quite a bit.I got some friends that I‚Äôm not afraid to call them such.But I never got a girlfriend,not even close.I always tried to be nice to girls,but I guess I never really showed my interest,I was just nice.This hasn‚Äôt bothered me much until now.

I felt the need of having someone I could be close to.Someone with whom I could do what we both like.

By being solitary when I was younger I don‚Äôt know many people,which makes things complicated.The girls I know have boyfriends,are out of my league or are just not for me.In the meantime my friends are either pursuing intellectual goals,which is not what I could or want to do,or they are getting together with girls.

Then I thought about her,the girl I knew most of my life.She is quite pretty and smart and lives in the same town I do.Our moms know each other and so we spent some time together as kids even outside of kindergarten/school.But after we transferred to high school we kinda went our separate ways.I did my stuff and she did hers,eventually finding a boyfriend.

When I got the news she has a boyfriend,I felt something small die inside me.I wasn‚Äôt outright sad or depressed,but I was feeling down.I heard stories of how she went to all sorts of trips with her boyfriend and what things she does with him.This was about 4 months ago.

I took her out to a restaurant the week before Christmas,but that wasn‚Äôt any move on my side,I knew she had a boyfriend,that was just coincidence and circumstance.We shared a nice meal and that evening really got me thinking about her.

4 days before Christmas I received an invitation to a sort of hike where she and her family would be too.I didn‚Äôt have anything better to do so 2 days before Christmas I went to meet up with my friend who invited me.It was all quite short,8km or so overall,but I talked to her and my 1 friend a lot during that trip (they were the only ones I knew there).

Shortly after the hike I got the news that she and her boyfriend broke up.They did so over 2 months ago.I got a bit happy knowing this could be my chance,but that has quickly changed to me getting afraid.I didn‚Äôt have a better way to combat this than to watch a movie.But that came to bite me back.

In the movie (don‚Äôt remember what it was called,sorry) there was a part where they talked about eye contact and how your eyes tell emotions.This spiked my curiosity so I went through the internet reading about that.Turn out it isn‚Äôt as big of a bulls hit as I though it was.Which got me thinking even more and I eventually ended up thinking about her again.

The way she looked at me.During our dinner and during the hike.I noticed she had a strange expression on her face,a one I have never really seen before,but I didn‚Äôt pay any attention to it.I think there was more to our dinner and the hike than I initially though.The fact she‚Äôs  boyfriendless(?) and lonely (I got that from her friends) makes me suspect I ain‚Äôt the only one thinking like this.I have this moment from the hike,when we were in a restaurant,burnt into my memory.We looked right into each other‚Äôs eyes and that‚Äôs when I felt she isn‚Äôt looking at me the way she looks at everybody else.I keep telling myself that‚Äôs really far fetched,but my gut is telling me I‚Äôm right.

I‚Äôm really afraid though.I‚Äôd like to try it with her,but I don‚Äôt know how,I don‚Äôt know if she would even want to,and I‚Äôm afraid of making a clown of myself.

TL:DR My lonely ass would like to go for a girl I have know for quite some time,but I‚Äôm too afraid of doing anything because I don‚Äôt know what to do and how not to make a clown of myself.

I've never posted to this sub.  I haven't even joined.  But, I ran across a comment about the unsolicited pictures of genitals and the like one person experienced after messaging a few guys.  It blew up, naturally.

I just want to say this:  Your efforts do count.  They aren't all turned into dick pics.  Personally, I had zero messages over the holidays that anyone gave a rat's ass or even remembered me.  A message from someone sweet would have meant the world to me.  Would I have liked it to turn into something romantic, something special?  Sure.  Would I have gone in that direction?  Probably not.  

I'm fairly reserved and have never sent an unsolicited pic in my life, never mind one of my genitals.  I've pretty much gone through hell and back a couple of times.  Someone saying, ""Hey, as a human being, I see you,"" during the holidays would have been great.  Please don't let the jackasses steer you away from this.

If sex is really just penises in vaginas, why does it hurt so much to know when someone you care about has stored their nether regions in another? 

Sex can bring us to love, to lust, to hate, and even to kill. What is it about the devils tango that can make one heart flutter with nervousness, and another stretch and tear apart?

Sometimes sex seems so anatomical and scientific, other times it seems like it‚Äôs the only force keeping a relationship together. Isn‚Äôt it crazy how sex can make you feel so close to someone, yet also so lonely, longing for touch.

Many times I find myself wondering, ‚ÄúAm I good at sex? Maybe they‚Äôve been with someone better. I bet they wish they were with them right now‚Äù. And it just destroys me. Why can‚Äôt sex just be sex? Why do we all have to be magicians in bed?

I hate sex because of the perversion that‚Äôs associated with it. I hate that people can just fuck with no hesitation, and be regardless of the damage they leave behind. I hate that people have dirty urges, it makes me feel so disgusting at times.

2816,DarkDawgYT,1577949046,1,"The start of a new year is most certainly a joyous occasion. It opens the possibility for growth and exploration, an opportunity unlike any other. But it also begs several questions: Will I follow through on my resolutions? Will I reach more success than last year? Will I be a better person, a better friend? Will I find the one?

Of course, it‚Äôs not all open-ended questions and self pity. The few friends I‚Äôve made and the things I‚Äôve been blessed with serve as proof of that. Yet there‚Äôs patterns I‚Äôm terrified of following. Patterns I‚Äôve followed for years on end. What makes this year any different? Unhealthy eating habits, daily long naps, late nights, last minute cramming and my sloth all make up the bulk of my life.

I eat midnight snacks because I slept through dinner time. I nap through dinner time because I go to bed late. I go to bed late because I napped and woke up during the night. In between, I masturbate because, along with video games and YouTube videos, it‚Äôs the only thing that gives me any sort of noticeable pleasure. I keep gaining weight because of my midnight snacking and I don‚Äôt exercise because my naps take up all my afternoon time. I get random urges to get my life together in the middle of the night, when I can‚Äôt do anything about it. 

When I wake up, I find myself unmotivated to go to class, do exercise, even talk to other people, all the while feeling lonely and like nobody cares about me. But people do care, specifically my family. They love me so much and I take it all for granted because their love is all I‚Äôve known from them. My parents, who I thought were the perfect couple, are now separated, shattering my entire perspective on love. 

I was spoiled. All my life, the only problems I suffered were self-inflicted. I complained a lot as a child and in doing so, isolated myself from my classmates. I didn‚Äôt learn, and did the same upon entering high school. All of the friend groups I did have at one point all fell apart. I only talk to a small handful now. At college, it‚Äôs hard to get to know people because everyone‚Äôs always busy with their own lives. 

So here I am. Living an unhealthy life full of loneliness and regret. I neglect my body because I don‚Äôt feel like I matter, and I lack the motivation to do anything about it. All I‚Äôve ever wanted was to find a girl to love who‚Äôd love me back. The one time I fell in love, my heart got fucking crushed. Now I‚Äôm scared. Scared of women, scared of taking risks, scared of putting myself out there because I know that I haven‚Äôt put in the work to be loved. I don‚Äôt love myself. At most, I tolerate myself. That‚Äôs it. And until I love myself, and I don‚Äôt know when that will be, I can‚Äôt find anyone who‚Äôll love me either. This feeds back into my lack of motivation and so it goes.

It's been like this for years, sometimes I think I will never have a girlfriend/marry a women and I just can't take it anymore, I'm planning to change things and get some company because I know there are people out there that I'll get along with and enjoy my time with, but I don't know how, maybe can you suggest me a book to read to learn how to get free from loneliness, maybe a book that made you less lonely and get ""real"" friends? or general advice?


I love reading, and I believe that books have magical effect to the brain. If I am still breathing today, it's because of all the fictional characters I've read about that are hard working, persistent and fighting even though it's tough.

I'm 24, and I can invest 3 or 4 years of training to change, I don't care if I get rejected (I'm used to it now), I'm pretty sure someone will accept me, I feel it! But I need some help :)

Thank you and my best wishes for 2020.",lonely,Book to read and get free from this burden?,2020-01-02 17:07:35

2823,OpalWillow,1577943724,1,"  24 year old lady here. I was in a really meaningful relationship from fourteen to just before I turned 21. I was really struggling immediately after and entered a relationship with someone new, without really stopping to think about it or getting to know the person.

  I was really hard up for cash at the time, and the man I moved in paid for the majority of the security deposit at the apartment we moved into together. 

  He cheated on me within the first month of us living together and I made the decision to stay, one because I wanted things to work out and, secondly, I had signed my very first official lease with him and was stressed about breaking it. I totally let myself get into this terrible hole with him. 

  He said he just always cheated on his partners and that he hated himself for it, I was unsure how to work with that and just tried to move forward. He would sense that I wasn't as invested physically and that would make him really upset. Sometimes I'd be getting ready to go for a run or out for lunch with one of my friends and he'd grab me and say things like,""Where do you think you're going? I paid for this place so I could fuck you any time I wanted"". He'd be forceful and hurtful, though I didn't do much sticking up for myself. I'd be frozen and not want to make things worse. 

  Friends would see how he behaved and eventually convinced me to leave him without warning. After leaving, he stalked me for some time. Following me and watching me at work, sitting in the parking lot of the church across the street from my house, chain smoking and pleasuring himself. He was in my house and stole my used underwear. 

 It's been about a year and a half since he seemingly stopped and I just do not know how to connect with people on an intimate level. When I knew he was following me, I felt like such a risk for the people I cared about to be around. I think I still sort of feel that way, despite the fact that he has stopped following me. 

  Also, I don't want the point of this post to be to demonize this man I was with. He's a person, and the things he did really hurt me. I take some responsibility in being complacent to him at times and for living in denial and finding reasons to stick around.

  I know I am in need of some therapy, but, can anyone here offer any advice on moving forward and learning how to put myself in safe spaces to feel vulnerable again? I feel like when I sense that there is a chance for things to go really well with a person I'm seeing, I unconsciously sabotage the situation in a panic.

2829,yohan410,1577940235,1,"i‚Äôm new to reddit just an fyi ... 

just in the past few days i feel as if i have lost complete sight of who i am, that my philosophical outlook on life has been shattered, and my self esteem has gone down the drain. usually i can pinpoint what caused a troubling mood or depressed feeling, but this time i can‚Äôt. 

my anxiety is through the roof due to my little mental break.. i feel like i don‚Äôt even know how to talk to people. so when in a room i feel like a fucking idiot, boring, and extremely alone. 

i don‚Äôt have many friends due to being someone who has a lot on their plate, very focused and sometimes is my own worst enemy. each time i find someone i click with, things go well as friends for awhile and then BAM, some bizarre thing happens and they lash out at me and then friendship ended. it has happened so many times that now i don‚Äôt have anyone to turn to while all these thoughts are bouncing around in my head of how i feel like i don‚Äôt know who i am anymore, my outlook on life is evolving rather quickly and that i am simply alone.

i have a very loving boyfriend whom i care for so very much, supportive parents and my sister but then i feel like i have no one else. now i‚Äôm not discrediting the people i just mentioned, but it can be troubling when you want to call up a girlfriend to vent about things you can‚Äôt talk about with your parents or don‚Äôt want to talk about with your sister and let‚Äôs be honest, everyone needs a gal friend to escape to when they need a little break from their boyfriend. i don‚Äôt have that and it‚Äôs been YEARS. yes years. and the pains of being alone have plagued me for just that same time.. years. but w these dark feelings and thoughts i‚Äôve been having lately, the ache of being alone is ever more present.

I'm a 41 year old guy who's still never been married or in any kind of serious or LTR, and I go years without any kind of affection. When you're younger, it's vastly easier to meet people via networking since you're in a common environment like school, but when you're older it's almost impossible since there really isn't that kind of situation. I work a solo job so it's not like I can meet co-workers either.

Knowing that I need to have friends first, some kind of a social circle, before I can even consider the possibility of a relationship, means I pretty much have to start from scratch. I'm not sure I even know how to make friends anymore, and being that I've settled into a deep long-term depression, it makes me not even feel like trying to reach out to anyone.

I feel really lonely, depression kicking me stronger and stronger every day, feeling suicidal again (but I won't try doing it another time, not yet at least.)

All of this and knowing that I don't know if I'd be able to keep up with meeting someone else, or pretending that I'm fine to not show off my depression.

Yet being alone is making things worse. I've been told it gets better, that if I try things change, and that's been going on for 15 years, but despite trying and trying, nothing changes.

I have wonderful friends and family that if I needed anything they'd be there for me..  But there's that one thing I don't have that a lot of my peers/friends have that I seem to lack and it's every year end when it hits hardest and most notable. The 4 big holidays. Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years and V day(fake and hallmark but still). I'm pretty laid back and worry free of it prior to the end of the year into the new year.. But it's at this time of year I am most lonely, as it's time for gathering and being with those you love and etc, etc, etc.  

Which then follows the questions from those friends and family about you not having someone on your arm or by your side. The you're a ""great/good person"" speeches/statements that come into play.  As I've gotten older I have had a love hate relationship with the holidays, now in my 4's it's a constant reminder when you're out and everyone around you has their person in they life.  Makes coming out for gatherings and parties difficult and these close people not understand why you'd rather stay home haha. I know the routine of ""do you"" and ""don't go look, things will happen/come in time"" or ""just occupy yourself with other things and even the ""get out more"" bs... it's whatever...  The older you are without said person, it can make you harder as a person.  

I have terrible taste... seems like all the ladies I come to like before even getting to know them are either already married or spoken for or way too young for me.  It's like WTF lol.  I've learned to be alone in a way and just deal with, at least until this time of year and my hardened shell gets a few large cracks in them.

2850,BriscWRLD,1577926068,1,"First off before I begin, I have 3 good friends that I would hang out with. When we hang out together I am the most quiet person at the back of the group. I would come out and say a couple things in a convo and sometimes its stupid shit to make them laugh. I'm never the center of a conversation. I don't follow a bunch of memes or watch a lot of movies to follow references they say. I have such a bad memory, I would forget so many scenes in a movie to remember a reference. My friends know I am extremely shy even though I try not to be. I'm usually the listener of the group and I don't have many jokes in my head to make the group laugh. My friends are still good friends though, I am not trying to portray them to be evil. They all still like me which is a blessing to have. But if I were to go out to an event with new people included in my group of friends. I am literally quiet and I have difficulty starting a conversation. Yea I could do small talk but in my head, it's always running with so many thoughts of like ""don't make things awkward"" and shit like that. Not only that I cannot walk up to girls and be the center of ""attention"" in a conversation. Especially girls that look very pretty and have high standards, it's impossible to get their attention. It's easier to speak to ""less prettier"" girls if that makes sense no offence. They are easier to talk to but still I can't hold a conversation and make people laugh other than my 3 good friends. So when i'm at partys with my friends I get drunk to make myself ""confident"" and not give a fck about anything and just talk about anything. Or even get high because I'm a more crazy and social person. But then after a while being drunk or high I snap to reality of how stupid doing this shit is and how it doesn't help at all. Basically when meeting new people I just have nothing to say. I always cling along with my friends because I cant leave my friend and be alone with new people in a party. A girl called me cute at a family friend party and she I believe is a couple years older than me but I just didn't have the confidence to go up to her and have a conversation. Instead I stayed with the boys in the family friend party and chilled with them playing video games and talking. I feel so stupid because she is really pretty and the day after I was so sad because I have no way of contacting her through any social media. I don't even know her name. I also feel like if I were to go out of my way to find her instagram and message her. I feel like it would be super weird because I didn't speak to her at the party at all. It made me realize that I need to stand up and converse with the opposite sex because as humans I believe it makes us truly happy. I read stories that people in their early 30's feel like they wasted their 20s and I don't want to be like that. I am 20 years old and I am super quiet and shy. I believe I can change but I think I need to start small. I'm sure im missing some points but this is all I can think of. Thanks for reading.

I created a New Years Eve group chat for a bunch of people who were gonna spend it alone, so that we could all be with one another and have a nice chat. It was all good and everyone was happy for a while. One guy joined at the point if it reaching 20 members and starts to disrupt it a lot. So, being the creator of the group, I ask him to either calm down or leave. After a few minutes of silence, he gets back to me. He's been looking through my profile. He's seen the posts about me wanting to kill myself. He calls me failure and a burden and tells me I should have killed myself. I'm feeling like shit already. This stuff hurts. The group says that I'm not but I feel like I am. I continue adding more people. Some leave and some more join. It peaks at 50+ members, but had around 80 in total. Before going to bed, I say goodbye. But i still feel bad so i cut myself on my arm. It helps release the stress a little but I'm still upset. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wake up today and I'm feeling down. I speak to a friend (from the group, but who I was already helping before) about it and she tells me I'm wrong. I start to feel a bit better. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mum calls me a burden. Says I don't do anything around the house. Says all I do is hold them back financially. They do the bear minimum but all I do is hold them back. She's right. I don't help at all in any way and I am a burden to them. So I try to help someone I know I can help. My friend. But when she starts to talk about the problems, she just suddenly stops. All messengers, just stops. Not reading any messages at all. I have failed her.

&amp;#x200B;

And then it hits me. The dude from yesterday's chat was right. He said I was a failure and a burden. I have proven to be both.  Maybe he's right about the third, I don't know.

2887,HashbrownTownxxx,1577898296,1,"I was really excited for New Years this year as I had plans to go downtown with my SO, my brother, and a couple friends. I had purchased tickets and had never been to something like this. Unfortunately this past Sunday my best friend and I were almost abducted during the daytime. It was at a restaurant and the staff ended up coming to our rescue and sneaking us out through the kitchen to the back of the restaurant‚Äî hid us by the dumpsters. They even drove my car to me because they were worried we‚Äôd be followed by the man if he saw what car we got into. 

Both my friend and I are safe and reported it to the police‚Äî turns out the man trying to take us has a long history with the police.. I was really shaken up by it... I‚Äôve had past issues of stalking and am a survivor of sexual assault. For the most part, I‚Äôve healed, and live a normal life, but this incident just brought everything back to the surface.

I called my brother and told him I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to come because I don‚Äôt feel safe being out at the moment. Even though I‚Äôd be with some friends, the thought of getting drunk and potentially losing them in a crowd made me feel incredibly vulnerable and terrified. I hate it. I keep looking over my shoulder and feel hyper vigilant of my surroundings... 

So I ended up just staying home with my SO (bless his heart, I told him he could still go out but he didn‚Äôt want me to be home alone). So I guzzled down a bottle of wine and painted some pictures. He tried hard to make the night fun and we watched a comedy special‚Äîkissed at midnight. It was nice but my heart was so sad that we couldn‚Äôt go out. I just feel so isolated. 

I‚Äôll add this part in because I‚Äôm sure you might be asking why missing one event would make me feel lonely‚Äî- it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been working full time plus finishing up my bachelors degree/ major final capstone project the past 6 months.

2893,MicrowaveSama,1577895758,1," 

My new years eve was a little sad - I spent it working on a food handlers certificate for my part time job. When the clock struck midnight I sat alone staring at a computer screen feeling frustrated, stagnant, and sad. The biggest lesson that I had to learn this year was the lesson of self love. I could have added the word ‚Äúlonely‚Äù to that list but I opted out purposefully. 

My biggest fear used to be the thought of dying alone, though because of the growth I experienced this year, I no longer feel this way. I studied abroad this year and I was forced to face my own sense of being alone. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve been in this situation - when I lived on my own in 2017 I described it as the worst feeling in the world. I often experienced panic attacks and crying myself to sleep at night was a regular occurence. I spent most of that year in bed and staring at the four blank walls that housed me. I let the idea of isolation consume me and become a living nightmare. They do say that the worst form of punishment is total isolation, and I was just living that out of no other choice, people wanting to spend time with me felt like a treat that I had to cherish. 

This year I was faced with a similar pit feeling, I felt it often and I felt it strongly. When I moved out of my studio apartment back in 2017 I vowed to never let myself feel this way again. This wasn‚Äôt the right approach. The reality is that for the majority of this decade I have felt this way - the only difference being my environment and the people around me. Those things constantly change but the feeling of being alone stays consistent. I spend most days by myself, and getting to spend time with people who want to be around me is something that I value and I don‚Äôt take for granted. Another reality I was forced to face this year is that all people are temporary, and take that as you will but the only person who will share a deathbed with you is yourself. When I started to think about things this way my mentality towards my loneliness shifted into something much healthier, and let me tell you how and why:

Who is *always* going to be there to take care of you?: You are. Who is going to *always* want to do the things you want to do and spend time the way that you want to spend it?: You are. Who will fight harder for your dreams and goals more than anyone else will? *You.* Who will always be there for you when no else is? *You are.* I started to realize that my relationship with myself is the most important relationship that I will have in this lifetime. When I realized this I started taking better care of myself. I became more mindful of how I was eating, I started to exercise (albeit not without struggle) and I started taking myself out on dates. I learned that the person that I can always rely on to be there to love me - is *me*. 

I often feel guilty asking for help, and that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt like the feeling of not being in control. To not be able to do something without the assistance of another person makes me feel vulnerable and incapable. I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúindependent‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúdependent‚Äù either. I often feel useless and not valuable to other people, so asking things of others just makes me feel worse. 

My resolution for this year is to get a full time job doing what I went to college for. The job search has been making me feel helpless. The one thing that would give me complete autonomy over myself is being financially independent. It‚Äôs the one thing that I‚Äôve struggled with for years now. I have to accept that sometimes I need to ask the help of people who don‚Äôt want to help me. I just want to prove to myself that I am capable of being of use to the world - instead of floating along aimlessly hoping for people to catch notice of me.",lonely,a journal entry to myself,2020-01-02 03:22:38

For some people it's the best time of year. 

For many other people it's the worst time of year, because they get reminded that everyone 
else has friends and they don't. 

And the best thing you can do when you know someone who will be spending tonight alone is to invite them to whatever you're doing. No matter what it is. 

For some, when you see the Facebook statuses and pics with friends, when you see the snap chat story of someone else's party, new York times square commercials, it only brews and 
brews resentment and it makes society a 
crappier place to live.

2990,Dalakaar,1577834696,1,"Replied to a topic about how to get into a relationship. I wound up putting a bit more thought into it than I originally expected.

Take it all with a grain of salt cause I‚Äôm spending NYE alone too. This is in my extremely limited experience on the matter.

That being said, I wanted to make my own topic to get it out there. Maybe it‚Äôll be helpful to someone, maybe not. At least it‚Äôs written down and available just in case and not hidden away in a reply.

***

Depends on your age I find. Geographic location too.

Here‚Äôs my thoughts on the matter. So you understand my perspective I am a straight mid-thirties white male that‚Äôs been on the west coast of Canada for most of my life. I am not unattractive, but I‚Äôm socially awkward most of the time. I‚Äôm not what I‚Äôd call terribly attractive either, solid 6.5-7 if I‚Äôm being generous that day. Every so often women make it known they are interested in me. I still am genuinely surprised when it happens.

It‚Äôs easier in your younger years, thirties it gets pretty tough. You have to put yourself out there. Sounds cliche but I‚Äôll try and explain. Even though it sounds simple it‚Äôs not. If you aren‚Äôt around people of the gender(s) you desire you won‚Äôt find anyone. Online dating isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd recommend. It‚Äôs a numbers game and reduces people to just that, a game. And many people are on there for little else.

The other thing to consider is that depending on what kind of person you are this could take time. It‚Äôs an investment you have to work towards. While it might happen sooner than you think, it could take a long time. With that level of potential work involved you have to honestly be ready for a relationship. Many people that want one aren‚Äôt really ready for it. It‚Äôs not easy.

Here‚Äôs the biggest thing, you can‚Äôt actively be trying to find one. It can‚Äôt be the only thing on you brain. It‚Äôll happen naturally if you stop trying to make it happen and try to enjoy things and have conversation because you just want to have he conversation. Don‚Äôt lead yourself by the nose.

My suggestion for how to accomplish this... You have to either already have, or find, a hobby that has a social aspect to it. Hiking, sports, D&amp;D, crafts, dancing, or art like painting, pottery, etc. Writing in a dark room or corner of a coffee shop isn‚Äôt likely to make it happen. You need to spark the chance of interaction. The next step is to go online and find a group, or multiple groups, that get together and appreciate the hobby you have. A writing group, a book club, a beginners dancing course, a pottery class, a hiking group. D&amp;D groups are often looking for more players.

...And then you sign up and attend those groups.

And here‚Äôs the hardest part, you have to let yourself potentially fail at them.

Yeah. That‚Äôs the kicker. The group you enter might not be your fit. That‚Äôs 100% okay. Maybe it‚Äôs close enough and you decide if you work at it you‚Äôll fit in. That‚Äôs up to you. But acknowledge that sometimes it‚Äôs just not a fit.

Eventually, if you‚Äôre lucky, you might find a group that you fit in with.

And that‚Äôs where you start to form platonic relationships with the people around you.

One of those platonic relationships might wind up becoming something more.

One thing to consider as well, personal hygiene matters. Groom yourself a bit, wear some slightly better clothes. Do laundry, get a haircut, etc. What matters a LOT less than most people think is their physical appearance outside of hygiene. If you are overweight, have a weird facial structure, or just generally consider yourself ugly for the hundreds of reasons you come up with, that‚Äôs you doing yourself a disservice. Hygiene and physical appearance aren‚Äôt the same. There are other people that are just as concerned about themselves being ugly as you are. And they all are lonely and want to be with someone. You could be that someone. You don‚Äôt have to work out and spend huge chunks of money on nice clothes to find someone. Just show that you‚Äôre willing to clean up a bit, it goes a long way.

When you are with someone it can‚Äôt be for the explicit purpose of getting together. The thing you need to look for is really simple. Someone who you can talk to, and genuinely enjoy being around. Someone who you can be comfortable with. Once you stop pursing a relationship and just look for likeminded people to be yourself around the relationship part just sort of takes care of itself.

Example: Even being with a group of all guys playing a game of D&amp;D could lead to finding a girl. You make a friend, that friend invites you to a birthday party, that friend has a cousin who is a girl who shows up. Turns out she‚Äôs playing a game, it‚Äôs multiplayer, you ask if you can join her. She kicks your ass at it, you ask her for pointers. You both enjoy yourselves. Later that night you ask her if she wants to do some more multiplayer online later in the week, nothing more, just that. She says yes, a week or two down the road you guys are happily chatting away on discord and you both start to realize things are getting pretty flirty. Then you can ask her if she wants to go for coffee, or to a Comic-Con, or somewhere public that you know you‚Äôll both enjoy yourselves. You don‚Äôt have to go full throttle to dinner and a movie. That comes later. Just find someone you can spend time with doing something you both enjoy.",lonely,Some Honest Advice on Trying to get a Relationship,2020-01-01 10:24:56

Is the friendship over?

Ello friends! 


I‚Äôm on mobile etc...


I think I probably sound jealous, but I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm just very sad and lonely. 

I‚Äôve (24f) been besties with my friend (25f) for about 8 years now but recently she got a boyfriend and everything has changed. 


She‚Äôs become super distant; she replies to my texts only once a day, but I haven‚Äôt had a reply since Saturday, even though she pops up on WhatsApp and Facebook throughout the day, as well as views my Instagram stories. Alongside this, when we do hang out, she always replies to people when we are together etc... so she‚Äôs not actually bad on her phone, just bad at getting back to me. 


I‚Äôve been there a lot for her; when her parents migrated to another country, when she‚Äôs had tough times with her mental health and her job, as well as all of her boy troubles but now she‚Äôs got a boyfriend it seems like she doesn‚Äôt need me. 


For years I‚Äôve asked her to try new things with me - like different sports, different fashions, go on a road trip etc... and she always refused because it would push her out of her comfort zone but she‚Äôs done all of the above with her new boyfriend. I won‚Äôt lie, it does sting a bit. Whilst I didn‚Äôt stop myself doing these things, it just sucked not doing it with my best friend. 


In hindsight, I feel like she was my best friend but I‚Äôm not hers. Maybe I was a friend of convenience... I don‚Äôt know. 


All infrequent text interactions feel pointless now; it feels like the friendship is over and we are dead. I‚Äôm just so gutted now that I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to.

3000,Callous02,1577829244,1,"Many of us here in this sub feel lonely. Mostly because of our luck of social skills and thus our inability to create meaningful relationships. An other reason for our loneliness might be are low self-esteem and overall we feel stuck and like shit throughout most of the year. 

Don't feel bad 

Honestly you shouldn't feel like its your fault ( with some exceptions ofc ) 

Our disgusting parents poisoned us. Yeah that's right they ""p o i s o n e d"" us, and the poison they used was a childhood full of negativity, fighting/yelling , arguing DAY and NIGHT over the stupidest things ( not caring about whether that affects their children or not ). Others were poisoned with insecurities and anxiety, some really unlucky ones have panic attacks, and all of this because they were overly protective and overly strict. 

Dont feel like you deserve all the shit that you're dealing with. 

As the famous saying goes &lt;&lt; being weak is not a problem, staying weak is &gt;&gt; 

How do you expect to be your ideal self if you weren't given the appropriate tools to achieve that goal 

After a certain age though, we have to create those tools for ourselves and let go of the burden that was bestowed upon us . 

Cut yourself some slack, if it was up to you from the start you'd be better off now

I am Kevin (obviously) 

I am a 28 year old Dutch white Male. 
I am not at all ugly or annoying to be around.  The opposite is true apparently because there are many times people emphasize this in different ways and situations. 

I can make lots of acquaintances anywhere and people do actually like me but it seems there is never someone who will (after meeting) reach out first.
People are willing to hang chill and whatever when I start conversation. 

I feel incredibly lonely  and have tried anything to turn this around but nothing seems to really help.

I also really tend to overthink everything which is not helpful at all.

3013,PlentyTourist8,1577825478,1,"Cut a long story short (not short at all) I am in grad school. Last year we had a new student who joined our group and me and her hit it off fast and I was really into her an all that (stupid stupid stupid). She was also the first woman I've slept with so it had some extra feelings involved from my end. She decided to break it after about a month and I was pretty ok with everything considering my situation before meeting her and I knew she moved on dating others (oh the wonders of having no social disabillities...) and even though it did hurt at one point I was fine... Maybe not fine I don't know...  Unfortunately I have some years of experience with depression and anxiety, namely social so everything is mixed up with that. But overall were on good terms and I felt good for most of the time.

Around summer we got closer again and all my feelings were amplified, and she calls me one night sweet talking me and all that, saying she wants us to have sex again but doesn't wanna ruin our friendship or whatever that is. I told her how I felt, that I do not want to be her ""friend"", that I want her to be with me. The feeling wasn't mutual and it hurt me bad.

3 months later she now has a boyfriend, and I am utterly destroyed. Just the sight and sound of her talking gives me anxiety and pain. I try to hide it when I'm around due to obvious reasons, but it's just getting harder. You know, dealing with my depression has led me to always try to evolve onward, be empowered, acknowledging my thoughts and all that mindful bullshit but I am just tired of fighting my own mind. I am tired of keeping strong - I don't want to be fucking strong. I want to have the confidence to be weak, to let my guard down. Like, what's the point of living this life if I am relentlessly conflicted? I swear the pain I feel is physical, and there is so much of it. 

Worst thing is that both of us have a few years to work side by side as she is now full time in. I have no intention of dropping my current research, but that shit is tearing me apart and this is my fault only. I am scared so much that I will always be alone. My friends are all in thriving relationships and I hardly see them anymore. How the fuck do people even meet women? How do I get a hold of myself before I spiral again? This is also happening during a very very stressful and important time for me at uni and I don't want to mess up.

Its been pretty overwhelming to say the least. I spend everyday stuck in my room. I have an anxiety disorder and on disability so i have enough money to get food pay the bills etc. No real reason to go out to find  more people to reject me etc. But it would be nice to have somebody to talk to.  I am really working hard on being more positive but that's how it feels so just sharing that. 

 I really feel like im not dealing with life very well anymore. Im married and dont even feel like i can talk to my wife. I feel like shes just kinda there and doesnt know how to deal with me. I know she loves me in her own way but i cant ask more of her anyway because two of the people that passed were her dad and her uncle that raised her.  

I normally   play PC games everyday, listen to tons of music, watch movies etc. But lately i feel like im having trouble even concentrating on it because i feel sort of overwhelmed with hopelessness. I keep praying and God is helping me but its slow going. I keep thinking 2020 is going to be a great year though and I went and sat and watched the sunlight stream into our dining room this morning and sat down and spent time reading the bible and just trying to be thankful for the moments themselves.Small things like sun through a window. That always makes me feel good. I love sunlight. 

  Trying to put my thoughts away from people because i know i dont have a place in this world but they always trail back there. Theres a lot of joy and beauty to be found in this life that has nothing to do with people. But i always feel lonely and like somethings missing. Then i think i should be more grateful for the good things i do have.  Ive also been trying to do my best to be kind and compassionate and help where im able even if people hate me. Not that most hate me but you know what i mean. It feels that way sometimes.  Starts feeling like i have no place even in my own place. 

I go from desperately wanting to talk to somebody to not ever wanting to be around people again.  Im also trying not to be so butthurt about life and emo etc. I know lifes not like a lifetime TV movie but id also like it to not feel like a horror movie too. 

Im 44 and ive watched the world turn into something i dont even recognize anymore. Thinking about our neighbor she was 90 years old so she lived a long full life. But i can only imagine how strange and alien the world must seem after being alive that amount of time. So many changes. Im not great at change but im trying. Broke down crying earlier when my wife was going back to sleep and she asked me whats wrong and i told her i just felt overwhelmed. Only lasted a minute i told her i didnt need to talk or anything and really i dont i guess. Washed my face and getting on with the day. About broke down again thinking about that moment. 

Today is new years so all that holiday crap is gonna be going on today too. I dont even care about any of that i just want to get on with the business of living. Wouldnt mind having a few beers but i know that aint gonna help my mindset. I dont feel like im on a tightrope. More like a see saw back and forth.

3049,Altaccforsadtimes,1577808257,1,"I hate it. I'll be browsing social media and see a post of people hanging out with friends I'll be talking to family members and hear them talk about how much fun they had with friends. Sometimes my brain will just decide to flip on the sadness switch on its own. It's like no matter what I do, the world just keeps wanting to remind me of how lonely I am. It's the new years right now and everyone's celebrating and firing off fireworks while I'm here writing something people probably won't even see on an account I'm not even sure I'll keep.",lonely,Do you guys ever get reminded of how lonely you are and then get hit with a sudden wave of sadness?,2020-01-01 03:04:17

If you are introverted, shy, depressed or with social anxiety etc... So am i, let's get out of our confort zone.

Pm me if you might be interested in meeting up a stranger from internet and if you are from Europe/UK. Just send ""Hi, i might be interested."" if you don't know what to say.",lonely,[EU] Let's meet up?,2020-01-01 02:53:22

However there's no one who I feel truly cares about me, everyone seems to enjoy my company when I'm there but I never get invited to anything and no one seems to miss me when I'm not there.

3053,Killashandra19,1577805683,1,"In 2015 right after I got married we went to this Burning Man type festival in Texas and I acquired drug-resistant skin mites. Did you ever wonder if you could survive years of having your skin infested with bugs? Me neither. But I did, and I beat it. By myself I might add- MANY doctors were zero help! It‚Äôs been five years and I still suffer from a residual skin condition that plagues me daily. Just when I was getting mentally stronger again and had re-started painting and writing and doing shit I care about, my dad died this last July. My mom came to live with me and my husband which has been VERY stressful. She brought four cats with her and three of them have died in different ways since she‚Äôs been here. I love all cats, especially the ones in my house and I was taking good care of them and I know it‚Äôs not my fault but what the fuck. So on top of all this who is out there that can relate to going through crap this intense in your 30s?? Or at all? Anybody?
