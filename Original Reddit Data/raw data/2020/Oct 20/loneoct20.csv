6,Air-Constant,1604145081,1,"This Is what I became. Oh, and lonely too. Since it's my very First personal reddit post, I'll be long. Sorry about It.

What can I say? I thought I found what they call ""the girl of your Life"". No, She wasn't. It was the only serious relationship I had. We broke, and I've been treated like garbage by everyone related to her. 
The only girl interested in me now lives in Scotland, and here in my country we're basically in lockdown. So this Is very depressing for me, because I fell for her.

But now, here's the worst part. People always define me as ""handsome and very good looking"". I've actually worked as a model too. Now, everyone always would ask as consequence: ""How can you be then Always sad, lonely, single and depressed? YoU arE HoT!1!1!!"". Well, plot twist. Being good looking Is not the golden ticket for acceptance and happiness. At all, especially if you are a boy. You always must be strong and not insecure and surrounded by fake friends. So, add all of my issues with unhuman expectations that people (especially the girls I try to date) have on me and you obtain the paradox I'm living in. 

I only have some good, real friends (and I consider them a privilege I don't even deserve). And anyway, only One of them and my brother (so, 2 persons) ask me if I feel bad or something. All of the remaining people (too many) Always reach me if they need something (both for UNI or not). I always have to be the ""cool looking chad that can't never ever be depressed or sad, because he's super good looking and funny"", but SURPRISE I am depressed and sad. I just want to be myself and find someone sincere that love me for what I am. I don't care about being the number one, I don't even have social like Instagram. I hate how our society is often merely based on looks. 

The only girl I like and that likes me back lives in another country (Scotland) and mine is basically in lockdown (Italy), so this Is making me feel even more lonely and depressed. Sorry for the wall of text...",lonely,Hollow,2020-10-31 22:51:21

Also, my situation is huge paradox. People always define me as ""handsome"", so everyone ask ""how can you be so lonely and shy and very often single?"". Well, plot twist. Being good looking May help, but it's not a golden ticket for acceptance and happiness. At all. Especially if you are a boy. I only have some real friends (and I consider them a HUGE privilege I don't even deserve). All the remaining people only look for me when they need something (both in Uni or not). So I am not only lonely, but I also have unhuman expectations from others (I've noticed It especially when I try to date a girl). And that's depressing to see how this society Is based mainly on the looks.

But still, I'm lonely. Except for my Brother, nobody never ask me if I feel bad. Because I am the cool one, the ""chad that can't never, ever be depressed or sad"". But -SURPRISE- I am. I am not a playboy. I don't even have social (like Instagram). I love to read, and get lost in tales that are not mine (but I wish were). Tales lost in times..

To be honest I’m not the most social person, I’m super shy, socially awkward, and am overweight (kinda like a stereotype basically) once you get past all that I consider myself a chill guy, nothing special ya know, I usually kept to myself during my high school years cause I was nervous as hell to initiate a conversation myself.
Anytime any girl at school would talk to me I’d be so nervous that half the time I’d just have single word responses during the conversation, even when prom came around I didn’t have any confidence to ask any girl if they wanted to go with me cause I usually just tell myself “Who’d want to go to prom with someone like me” i didn’t even tell anyone that I was having thoughts like this because then I might get asked out by a girl who felt sorry for me which I honestly didn’t want to deal with.
There were a few girls during my school career that I had crushes on but either they already had boyfriends or girlfriends (yes you read that right) or they were a total slut and wasn’t worth the drama that come with getting involved with them. Even after HighSchool whenever I would go out to hang with my friends there was one time that a few girls walked up to me and talked to me, I don’t know how I was able to keep conversation with them but afterwards one of them gives me her phone number, at the time I didn’t really know what to think but it wouldn’t last as I would come to find out that they wanted to get me to buy them things and swindle me out of a few hundred dollars buying them things at the mall where my friends and I went to hang out.
Don’t even get me started on Online dating, when someone would match with me and I try to start the conversation only for them to unmatch me and it honestly irritates me like if you don’t like what you see on my profile why even match with me in the first place.

We talked for another two weeks, and she came over and stayed the night. I took her on a big fancy date, and we ended up doing things that night. Of course I fall head over heels for her, I mean I felt stuff with this girl I hadn’t felt in years... and I wake up the next day to the dreaded “I’m still in love with my Ex, goodbye.” Text. 

I had never been so depressed in my life because I genuinely thought the world of this girl. She is everything I had ever wanted in a significant other. BUT, I started eating better, hitting the gym 3 times a week, got a new tattoo and have tried looking for the next potential. 

Fast forward to Tuesday this week, she messaged me telling me her ex cheated on her. 
I am trying so hard, to not tell her that I still think she’s the one and that she should give me a real chance. But, a part of me knows that it would be backtracking. I made all this progress and changed so much in my life, to just throw my self worth in the garbage to go back to someone who treated me like an option. I don’t want to be the one to message her, I want her to message me. To admit she’s at fault, that way I could be the so called “goaltender”. You know like, “Well if we try again this, these and those will have to happen.” But I really don’t think she will message me and Im finding myself begging whatever power rules over us to send her a sign to message me. Whether it be a dream, or a random pop up thought. I want her back but I don’t want to be the one to pursue that. Is that toxic? Crazy? What if she never messages me? 

I know I would technically be better off moving on and keep grinding on myself but, damn. I really want to be with this girl. So I’ll just let it eat away at me until I either become numb to it, or find someone else who makes me feel the way she did.",lonely,Not sure if this is the right place for this but here it goes,2020-10-31 11:44:25

just gonna post a brain splurge because I just can’t get my mind off this. 

I’m 14 and I have just started highschool. I’m not very social. I don’t really talk to people, and the only person I know that I would consider a close friend doesn’t have any classes with me in school this year and we don’t live close to each other. so I was eating breakfast with him before class starts in the cafeteria and he was telling me about something and then one of his friends came over that I’ve met before but don’t know very well. she and him start talking and it’s cool but then some weird subjects get brought up, I dunno how to say this the right way but relationships and sex kept getting brung up. I mentioned that we were all like really young to be doing shit like having sex and they pretty much react with “well yeah but like no”

so the conversation continues and they talk about friends, people they know and I’m just sitting here, only knowing the one dude in front of me and at some point we were talking and I mentioned I didn’t really have any friends aside from him. I barely even talk outside of talking to him at breakfast. and his friend looks at me and tells me that I’m super depressing. I just say “yeah, I know.”

I always kinda told myself that, I’m 14, the lack of social life I have is probably normal. but talking to that friend’s friend made me kinda realize just how much I didn’t know about... well, having friends I guess. knowing people. even the one friend, I don’t feel like we’re that close and I don’t feel like I know him that well. I never realized just how isolated I have made myself by being so antisocial.

112,isuckatusingreddit,1604054775,1,"Hi!! Thank you for taking the time to read this post. The title covers the point but to elaborate further:

I'm a 19F and i have 4 close friends, I have never been in a romantic relationship ever and i dont see myself finding anyone like that anytime soon. I also can't go to my parents about anything bcz our relationship isn't comfortable enough for me to express my feelings, unfortunately. 

I also dont feel like going to the friends i have with my problems bcz 2 of them are not ppl i can go to with my emotions and feelings. And going to the other 2 makes me feel like I'm bothering them and that I'm wasting their time. Ofc my logical side says otherwise but i just can't stop feeling this way. Not to mention i cant visit them due to covid or even otherwise bcz we live an hour away from each other.

I have tried finding ppl online to date, which brought nothing. I'm currently trying to get friends online but I'm not expecting much and I'm not gonna be forcing anything to happen either. 

I have  realised that all i can do is survive being alone and feeling lonely for the time being. But for the last month, I've been crying myself to sleep almost every single day, and i just want to hug someone or just hold someone's hand to know that I'm not alone and that ppl do care about me. But everytime i want that, i also think i deserve none of that affection from anyone and asking that of someone is extremely selfish. 

So if anyone has any advice on the way they cope with feeling lonely, and having no one else make them feel less lonely, it would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you for making it this far if you did!!",lonely,I have no choice but to be alone and feel lonely. How do i cope with this?,2020-10-30 21:46:15

114,Lonelylover_123,1604052599,1,"Hi. I am 22M from South India and new to reddit. I did not spend much time home. I went a school in North India where I was not accepted among the locals for ‘I dont know what’ reasons. When I asked a guy there he said “South Indians are generally gross and have bad intentions”. I never had a single friend. 

Then I did my college abroad (USA) and people there avoided me. I tried to ask a person there and he told, “Almost 95% of the Indians gross and sick people”. I have seen many people from my country have a great social life anywhere. 

I have never had any experience of friendship or dating with any country people. Just because I am born with a creepy face I am being treated like I am something that makes them vomit.

I wanted to give one last try and landed on reddit. I tried to meet some people on different subs. I made few posts and absolutely no response. Sent out some messages and guess what, “I am not looking for anything with Indians” is the response. Tried to chat with some people without mentioning my origin. One girl chatted with me for a few hours. It was going great. She asked a picture and I sent. She asked “Are you from India?” And I got ghosted. Also I find number of posts saying, “Indians dont bother messaging I wont respond”.

115,w_a_r_p_a_i_n_t,1604048587,1,"I’m pretty much always alone. I moved to Idaho from California, where I used to have so many friends, I’d go to concerts/parties, was always in the company of others and I felt loved.

Now I have no friends, I have a roommate but he’s always at his girlfriend’s, he pretty much is there every day and night, so I never see him.

I started this job and a woman I work with is so attractive and I’m in love with her personality. I listen to her when she has issues and give her advice. Her most recent issue involved a guy she was seeing but wasn’t into him. I gave her some advice that she should break up with him sooner than later because it would be harder for both of them if it’s dragged on.

On Sunday she says she’s finally ready to do go through with it, and afterward she invites me out for a drink. We meet up and I decide I’ll buy her some congratulatory drinks because she’s single and not with someone she doesn’t want to be with anymore. We’re having a great time and she says I can go back to her place. 

I’m there for maybe ten minutes then randomly she says she wants to sleep alone just in case her ex pops by as to not look bad, I agree and head home.

Today she asks advice saying someone used her for sex, saying she thought it’d be more but just wasn’t and was let down. I ask when out of curiosity and she says Sunday. So after we have a good time out she kicked me out randomly to have some guy come over.

I sometimes have the feeling she likes me, but that confirmed to me she doesn’t. After finding that out I had an overwhelming feeling of depression, she’s pretty much my only friend and I thought it would become something more, because if it did I thought it would really turn my life around for the better.

I’m always alone, I have no true friends in my life besides her. I have an ex that constantly wants to use me for sex, but nothing beyond that. The mixture of constant loneliness, being used, my family being distant and not talking to me, and the validation that I’m not anything to her caught up to me. 

All I can think about is how I don’t want to live this kind of life anymore.",lonely,I feel so sad.,2020-10-30 20:03:07
116,mangobou,1604048548,1,"I have always been afraid of sharing my feelings or being overly trustful of people, to the point where I barely exist in my friendship group. Like I'm kind of the background character to the friendship and that my presense is nothing more than a number. As much as I complain about it, I'm weirdly complacent with my position as I realised that its the only spot left for me.

Besides that though, Inside the group there are 2 people that I feel I can genuinely call them my best friends, where I can talk to them on the regular and goof around with them and what not. Obviously there are other 'friends' but its like we only talk during school and thats it, with the basic small talk and thats all, where we ask eachother for stuff, but never meet up or play games or anything.

But highschool graduation is coming soon and its become well known that all types of relationships in highschools dont last. This just makes me sad that I will lose the only 2 true friends that I have.

I am quite reserved but once I get to know someone, I can talk a lot. I don’t feel really listened to even though I always tried to listen to others.

Like I have some friend, but I feel like I am always a second choice. For example, in a group of friend they almost all text one-on-one but never with me (unless they need something)

When I asked her to go we never said whether or not it was a date. I’m not sure what it was. Or if she liked me back. Maybe I was too scared she didn’t share the same feelings. 

We had a good time. Walked around trails, got ice cream. I took her back to my house and introduced her to my parents. They really liked her. That was maybe the happiest I’ve been. At least in a long time. I was so nervous though, couldn’t even make proper eye contact. 

A few days later she came to my house again. I made her dinner and we watched a movie. After the movie finished she had to go to an eye doctors appointment. I haven’t seen her since then. It’s been almost 2 1/2 years. We still talk sometimes. She seems happy. Moving up in the world at her job. I’m in school, and busy. Our lives are moving in separate directions.

125,doomsday-baby,1604036592,1,"2020 was supposed to be the best year of my life but it turned out being one of the worst... I Lost all my friends, my job and a crap ton of money.

2020 was supposed to be a fantastic year I had a trip to Italy planned with friends for March break and a trip for Greece in the summer. Of course none of those things happened and I actually ended up losing a lot of money for Unrefunded bookings. I’m not normally one to be down in the dumps for long so I tried to pick myself up and look on the bright side... at least I still had a job and friends. Turns out 2020 wasn’t done yet and I lost my job because the company went under, and let me tell you looking for a new job has been a lot harder than expected. I was okay with this because I thought I still had my friends to rely on. 

A few months ago this facade of friendship came crashing down, I never would have imagined, in my wildest nightmares, the way my world of friendship came crashing down.  I always thought These girls were my life long friends, the 4 of us used to spend every possible second together. So as I was saying, everything changed. It was 10:00 at night and i was just about to get in the shower as 2 of my good friends called, H and W. W sounded frantic on the phone, like she was on the brink of tears and they insisted on coming over. So I quickly got dressed and invited them inside. When we sat down W told me that my best friend, let’s call her L had raped her sometime during the summer and that she was going to press charges. I was repulsed by someone who used to be my best friend and i felt horrible that something like that could happen to my friend W. I instantly cut ties with L because I couldn’t even look at her the same knowing what she had done. You would think the story ends here but it doesn’t... and i hate that I’ve managed to feel sorry for myself when W is the victim. 

Over the course of the next few months W and H got a lot closer, and slowly started excluding me from going out with them. At first I thought nothing of it because I was still invited if I was driving somewhere or if I was buying or they needed me to get something from L’s house (I was the only person who had contact with her roommates to get things).... obviously in hindsight I can see that I was being used. I noticed we were drifting apart and after having lost one friend because she turned out to be a horrible person I couldn’t let that happen again. 
So i started to reach out to H and W asking to hang out and go places, but they always had reasons why they couldn’t... I’m swamped with uni, I have work etc. I tried to give them the Benefit of the doubt but when I opened Instagram or Snapchat a few moments later it was loud and clear on their story that they were together, at a place I suggested we hang out.  

This took a while to sink in but I’ve taken the hint and I know that I just don’t fit into the friendship anymore. So with the last of my friends gone, I have no one left. I have no job, I have lost so much money and now I’ve lost my only friends. 

I don’t know what to do... COVID makes it impossible to o just go out and make new friends, not to mention im at a point in my life where it seems like everyone has already found there friends.

134,kprincess77,1604033692,1,"  She found out years ago, walking alone can be the hardest thing a young girl can do. But she knows that maybe it is the best for her at the time.

She has a hard time trusting people that tend end up hurting her. As, she walks alone, she finds the power that a princess she can be. she walks in with the shadows of her soul. So, she can have daydreams instead of nightmares of darkness.

She is not like every other woman. She is different she can survive on her own. Even when others doubt her, or she even when she doubts herself.   

She has been through death, stabbed hearts, pain, and mistakes. She knows dealing with it herself can turn out to be a lonely life. But what is the point of waiting for people to help her out. Where there is no possibility of getting what she needs. 

But the worst thing is to wait for something/someone that will not come. she does her best to go through life with her shadows. She knows she can climb the mountains that life gave her. She knows moving forward is worth it in the end. Even if she must walk alone for a while. 

She can show the world what she is made. The strength she has in her soul. The right people will show up without her knowing. She always used to be alone and helping herself. Which has been hard for her to let people come in. But sometimes she thinks the “right people” are her friends or lover, but after awhile the relationships or friendships turn into a toxic waste land of hopes and dreams lost. 

She knows there can be people out there that can understand her qualities. There will be people that admire her golden heart. Over the years she has her moments that bring out how strong she is. The strength she can see to herself she can only understand in her own mind. Finding ways to keep her strength that has been stolen by the cruel world.  She knows deep down she can do it even if she must do it alone. 

In her soul she knows she is born to help others, even if it weakest her soul. But she questions is it worth it? Helping everyone she loves and cares for. She has her break downs. It makes her stronger. she has trouble letting people help her out. She is born to LEAD her own wolf pack of misfits like her. She remembers she needs to be the wolf climbing the hill, and she finds the highest level she can take herself. She must learn to stop living in the past, it does not help. It just makes the scars open again. She always tries to live in day by day. 

It is much easier to walk alone in the right direction, then following the heard in the wrong. She figures out now that her destiny is in her own hands. She has to learn to hunt for what she wants no matter how many people tell her “ you can do that, you have epilepsy” or a learning disability which has haunted her for many years.

It's evident, even after always being friendly, talking to them, having a laugh with them, etc, that they don't give a shit about me and already formed their new batch of friends. It's rude of them, plain rude, a lot of them are purely dicks and show so much passive aggressiveness too.  I feel so alone at school, only one close friend I have and he's from my old school, we get along so well and always hang out, he means the world to me; but man, I still wanna broaden my range of relationships and tried so hard... This group pisses me off, what did I do wrong, did I not vibe with their damn hive mind? Not in any of their chats, left alone in social scenes; loneliness makes me angry, listening to Punk Music, Punk Rap and Industrial keeps me sane but I'm just so pent up with anger. Sorry if my grammar is poor, I'm just writing down my thoughts as I go alone, I didn't intend for this to make much sense. I don't know if anyone feels the same way as me, but I'm so quintessentially lonely even if I'm surrounded by a good family with very few good old friends and the one best friend I still hang out with; but I can't fit in to any social scenes in my new school, a kid from the country going to a city school, I love the school so much and the city is amazing but why can't I vibe with the kids? Am I doing something wrong? I'm always kind, polite, mature and friendly to my peers, always have a laugh and discuss topics, but I don't fit into a group, I get along far better with adults and all the teachers love me, but it's a different story with the students...
Loneliness, causing so much anger inside me, frustration, impatience, insecurity, anxiety. Once an ougoing ambivert with many friends, I've now turned into an absolute introvert, I just want to let all my anger out.
I can manage myself happily lonely, I'm happy alone, always have been, honestly preferred being alone; being happy and being with yourself alone is a sign of intelligence, which is nice. However, human connection is still important, and I lack a social group I could rely on.
I don't know if anyone feels the same way, but being lonely and psychologically isolated makes me feel so fucking angry.

I have a boyfriend but I don't think it would be healthy to rely on him completely for my social inclusion needs. Everytime he shows me conversations from his friend group I get so fucking jealous cause I've only ever had a group once and it all fell to pieces after I finished school.

All my friends are really busy/moved out of town so I've been feeling really isolated. Covid just made things worse. I try to be sociable at work but I just end up being really awkward cause I'm pretty introverted. And besides, everyone is so much older than me so I can't really relate to any of them. 

I sometimes glimpse at their phones while they're texting and I can see they're in group chats sharing memes and stuff. It sucks cause I wish I had that kind of stuff man. I don't even mind not hanging out right now I just wanna feel like I belong somewhere.

But then I found this place, I found you people. And I see that we're all going through the same struggle. After such a long time I finally don't feel as lonely.

Mainly because I have really severe social anxiety to the point where I have panic attacks if I’m around too many people or if I’m in a awkward 1 on 1 conversation. I used to have friends but they weren’t really friends at all just toxic people I stuck around with just so I wasn’t alone. They ended up betraying my trust and treated me like garbage so I no longer talk to them.

Now searching for actual friends it’s just impossible. I’m not even gonna try making friends in real life because I’ll quite literally give myself a heart attack. So I’m trying to make friends online through mainly Xbox one and discord. I just want a group of guys my age to socialise with every now and then so it’s not awkward and I can grow to trust and become close to them over time without being in their face too often.

On Xbox I try talking to people in gta v car meets or minecraft survival group posts but everyone’s either like 12, doesn’t have a mic, is like 40 years old or is just absurdly annoying. And it’s basically the same on any discord server. And when I try to talk to people on discord I pretty much get ignored because they’re already talking to friends and don’t want any more.

And I try so hard to push myself to talk and not be awkward and it never pays off because no ones Interested in talking. So I basically have no one at all to talk to besides my girlfriend, my sister who is always grumpy and my dad when he’s not wasted.

231,Captain-Cheesehead,1603944720,1,"In about 2 hours, I’ll be 26 years old. Just four little years away from entering my thirties, and in hindsight, 25 has been pretty shitty to put it gently. 

I thought this was the year I’d hit my stride; the year I’d get back up on my feet after my first encounter with heartbreak, the year I’d find a job and start saving for many dreams and aspirations I want to fulfill, like traveling and buying something nice. 

Instead, this year was the one where I sank to my lowest: Sadness, anxiety, a year-long dry spell (that’s still ongoing), heartbreak, disappointment, unemployed, fear of becoming a failure, not knowing what I’ll do, still in college, putting in weight… and this myriad of misfortune was kicked off with a funeral. The funeral of someone I knew. Someone who wasn’t very close to me, but that I held in high regards. That person and their entire family, who had their lives taken away in a fire. 

I thought things would get better from then on. I went out with my brothers the following week, had a great time and told myself: I’m gonna go out more this year. I’m gonna be the very best version of myself. I’m gonna go out on dates again, and work to make me the man any girl would want. 

Yet here I am. Many months later, sitting before my TV, eating a spaghetti dinner while the hour draws nearer to declare me beyond the halfway point of my 20’s. I’m at an all-time low, and the worst part is: I know I haven’t hit rock bottom yet. 

So, to God or fate or whoever is listening: I don’t want a great, amazing year. The bar’s been set too low, and I don’t want to build up great expectations. I just want 26 to be good. Nothing special, nothing spectacular; just… good. 

I just hope that, a year from today, I won’t find myself drenched in self pity and sorrow asking for words of encouragement, but rather giving them to someone who needs them. I don’t want to be asking for a helping hand, but instead giving it to someone because I now know what it’s like to feel so abandoned, lonely, desperate and heartbroken, and I wouldn’t wish this sensation upon anyone. 

So, 26th year of my life: I don’t ask for finding love, I don’t ask for one-night stands or hookups, I don’t ask for a graduation, I don’t even ask that the Packers win the Super Bowl.

Especially lately, It feels like daggers not having that. Like it gives me small anxiety attacks seeing other people be close like that. 

I know sex and physicality isn’t everything, especially what it’s romanticized to be. And believe me, I’m very much craving the emotional side of companionship as well. But I don’t think it’s right to deny the need for physical affection either. It’s just that when I talk about it, that’s all anyone hears. “Oh, you’re just horny.” “You just want to get laid.” It’s not “just” that, but yes, that’s definitely part of what hurts so much.",lonely,Physically Starved (and ashamed of it),2020-10-29 13:02:58

I know that there's a lot going on in the world right now and I know that you are exhausted from it all. We all are. I know that sometimes (or oftentimes) you just want to shut everyone and everything out and just get the time to catch your breath. If you ever need to do that, please do. Disappear for a while. Call in sick from work, turn off your phone, check in on a hotel by yourself, close your business for a day, sleep for an entire day,  etc. Do whatever gives you peace, even just for a day. Never underestimate the healing powers of rest and never romanticize ""busy"" as being ""productive"" or whatever the corporates call it. 

I know sometimes you just want someone to listen to you vent without judgement, and if you have a close friend or family who you can do that with? Talk to them. If not, there is a huge online community of people who have been through what you're foing through and are willing to give you advice based off on their own experiences if you're open to them. And the best part is that, you don't have to agree with what that say.

It’s been almost six months she cut me off. The last time we spoke in person I kissed her and held her in my arms. I was so happy and thought all was well. The next morning at 9 I got a text that hurt me. I read it and went fully numb. All it said was “it’s not you, it’s me” “I’m going to block you on everything so that way I don’t feel tempted” she did this because it wasent the first time it happened. We were in and out of a relationship, if you can even call it that, for three years. Something drew me toward her and I’m not sure what it was. I had a crush on her since 6th grade and it never left. Now I’m a jr who still only wants one person. All my friends are hooking up with people but when ever try to meet someone new I can’t, it’s just not her. Recently she unblocked me on Instagram and I don’t know why. Last thing she said was that she was never going to talk to me again. This confuses me so much and just makes me mad but I hate being mad at her. I want to ask her why she did this but I know that won’t help, and even if it did help, I don’t want to do that to her. She said she was done talking to me so I couldn’t do that to her. I want her back so badly but I know if I go back it’ll only make it so much worse.

So I’ve always been more “well-known” at my school (I don’t mean that to sound egotistical). I’ve always had strong groups of friends and great connections with people. I maintained straight A’s and participated in a plethora of out of school activities (again sorry, this sounds very strong of me). However during the beginning of quarantine, life just took a turn. I developed a lot of health problems, lost a lot of friends, and just slipped on my grades (and I know grades aren’t that important, but I don’t want to disappoint my parents). I became extremely jealous and insecure and I just lost all of my progress. I developed depression and anxiety and I built a wall around myself so I couldn’t get more hurt (I also deleted all my social media which was the dumbest thing I could possibly do). Anyways, November is soon. Soon I’ll be sixteen and I feel as though I’ve accomplished nothing. I question if I should try and put myself back out there, but I don’t have anybody’s contacts and I just feel so alone. I also question why I make this idealistic birthday experience feel so big. I know people just always overhype turning sixteen and it’s like I’ll get a chance to drive a car, but it seems so necessary? When I was a child I’d always picture myself getting older and having this perfect life, and I just feel like I let my younger self down (I’m also really sorry I’m hopping on different ideas).

Usually, I had those dreams where I felt lost, alone, rejected, looking for my joy which always was hard to find, but last night, it wasn't hard to find that moment, I found that happy place right away, it was so real, I can touch it, feel it, knowing that I was there for real, I felt so happy, it made me have some hope that things would be better, that the ""we"" ll be good at some point ""was real, that it have some sense, i didn't feel alone anymore, even when I waked up to face reality.",lonely,I know this might upset you,2020-10-29 04:39:16

Besides the anger issues the only other thing I can think of that could be causing this is my OCD. My OCD makes me behave in weird ways (not intentionally) that may turn people off. Besides this I really can’t think of what else could be causing this problem. (isolation/no girlfriend)

I have no problems making friends online, where I'm less inhibited and I don't have the anxieties of interacting in person. We play games together, have good conversations, talk about our lives and feelings, basically everything normal friends would do.

I am just okay with talking to someone. Anyone. About the weather or the food. It doesn’t even matter if it’s deep or not. Just any words would do. So I can’t think of ending this friendship.

I’m thirty years old. I’m a divorced father of four. I’m an EMT. That’s about it. 

I work an insane amount of hours. EMS doesn’t exactly pay well, and, children, so I work probably more than I should. But I feel like I’m just living my life for other people. My job is taking care of people, and most days when I’m not working, I get my children. 

Typing that out makes it sound so incredibly selfish. I chose this career, and I chose to have children. I do like my job. It has its rewards. And I love my children. They’re the light of my life. But it gets to be pretty isolating. I have a couple of friends with varying degrees of closeness, but nothing especially great. It’s difficult enough to maintain friendships when you start reaching this age. Add the other extenuating circumstances, and it makes it all the more strenuous. And I have my partner, but that’s all he is. My partner. 

Aside from that, that’s it. So I spend most of my night when I’m not on a run just cycling through the same three dating apps, which honestly feels like a waste of time. Even at thirty, it seems hard to escape hookup culture. I thought all this was left behind in my mid twenties but I suppose not. But alright, let’s say for the benefit of the doubt, there was that one person out there that was on the same wave length as me. I don’t feel like I could make anything come from it. I work too much, and I have my girls. Quite frankly, it feels almost better that I can’t find my person. Would it be better to find them and watch it fail, or just not find them at all?

It feels like I’m going to be stuck in this loop perpetually. I go to work. I get my children. I have that one day few and far between that I can do things, and when that comes, there’s not anyone there. In the meantime I just get to watch more and more people on my fb start dating or get married, while I have to respond to another run. 

Maybe it would get better when my children are grown? I mean then I would have a bit more money to do things with, and wouldn’t have to work nearly as much. But at the same time, I feel so guilty thinking that way.

I'm a friendly guy and make fast friends with many people.  I haven't had sex for about 1.5 years, and that was just my ex coming up to visit for one evening. Before that was about another 1.5 years, give or take.  I just look around and feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to love and dating.  I haven't even met a girl that I've liked in a long long time, especially now that the coronavirus keeps people home more.  I feel like I live in a town of like 50 people, since I don't see anyone too often anymore.  It's like a ghost town.

I've been learning online lately something that could explain my lack of success:  It's that (I've recently found out) women take someone being friendly or ""nice"" in an introduction or a conversation as disingenuous and needy to them.  So that essentially means that, if I ever want to find a girlfriend or date, that I'll actually have to NOT be my friendly self (that so many friends seem to like about me btw), and become some faker who pretends to not like a girl that I'm interested in.  I have to admit, upon that realization I have built up a lot of resentment toward women who would do this, because they're demanding that I be someone else, because who I am isn't good enough.  How is that supposed to make me feel?  Because it doesn't feel good.  TBH, if they want someone to not be nice to them then I can supply that, because i'm full of resentment and if they're wanting me to not be nice then I can be super not nice.  I feel that if I have to go through that to get the positive attention of a woman, then I could never respect her, because I would know that she just likes the persona I've put on and not the real me.  TBH, it breaks my heart.  I was having a lot of s\*\*\*idal thoughts for the past few years due to my loneliness but I feel like me finding out about the above info will give me a new lease on life, or at least I hope so.

Also, please don't say:  You aren't having luck with women because you're treating them bad, because all I've done is treat these women good and with respect, and got nothing but ignored and/or walked on.  Don't they say that doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results is the definition of insanity?  I've been nice and respectful for this whole time and get brushed aside, how am I not supposed to find an answer to try to fix that?  And the people who I hear are having success with women are handling it that way.  You can even find youtube videos where women say how they feel about a ""nice guy"" and they have only negative things to say.  I feel like I've been lied to my whole life, and I feel like this situation is going to turn me into a heartless monster, because apparently that's the definition of being a man to these women.  So I feel backed into a corner and have not other way out than to become ""not nice"" at all, which to me means: be shitty and disrespectful to them, also never show them your true nice self, because it's showing weakness.  :(

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I live in a town of about 100,000 people and when I go out I hardly ever seen any new people out, and when I do it usually like some obvious couple holding hands or something.   I just feel like I never see any single girls out.  And yes, I'm going to bars to see if I can meet someone, but I've NEVER heard of an actual better option than that.  People say stuff like:  go to the grocery store and talk to a girl about broccoli or something.  Start doing some volunteer work (I have no time for that after my work schedule).  Plus, who the heck has actual time for that after working full time.  Like do they have 2 days off a week and use one of them doing volunteer work?  I usually have one day to work on my house and do chores and one day to relax, so volunteer work is ridiculous to recommend to any normal working person imo.  Oh yeah, don't forget to get a dog and go to the dog park.  I work full time and live alone.  That's not a fair schedule for a dog.  I wouldn't leave a poor animal alone for that long just to have a girl magnet.   And there's always work where I see lots of girls, but I feel like it's not right to try to hit on a girl while I'm working on their tattoo, so I've never done it.",lonely,"I had enough problems finding a date before coronavirus, but now it seems impossible.",2020-10-28 15:57:48

I've been living with my 2 best friends and their families for about 6 months now and there are 7 of us total. About 5 months ago I became the only person with both a license and a vehicle so I picked up the slack. 2 months ago i had an argument with one of my friends about asking permission instead of forgiveness when she needs my car. Nothing changed for a while but then 2 months ago her daughter, who's a couple months shy of 18 and full of bad attitude, got a job a town away and I was expected to take her and pick her up every day now without any discussion. 
Skip forward. Shes still acting like she owns my car AND my time on a regular basis, but now shes making me take her daughter to get food after work ""so she doesnt have to reheat what we had for dinner"" and now doesnt even acknowledge me unless she is trying to get something out of me. 
So today I woke up to a text saying we have to go two towns over after dropping her daughter off 1 town over. And I responded to her asking her to ""be more gentle"" when she makes a request and she told me ""nvm I'll figure it out "" so I asked if she was gonna figure out her daughter too and she responded with ""fuck off"" and launched into calling me a child and telling me I do nothing for anyone around there. This woman has a history of abusive patterns, especially with me and nobody else in the house wanted to help mediate so now I'm trying to find a place to store my possessions while my grandparents graciously invite me to stay with them. 
How are people so rotten and entitled that asking them to respect the fact that that car is my car got me expelled from a group of people claiming to be my adoptive family.",lonely,Tried to stand up for myself today and got shown how little I was valued.,2020-10-28 11:20:17
384,Monica-Hernandez,1603843774,1,"*He teases you playfully* 

This is often the case when a man likes a girl. He can tell jokes, get nervous, and make her laugh. The main thing is that he tries to make you laugh. He should never be mean or hurtful. If he likes you, the last thing he wants is to make you angry or hurt you. 

*He acts protective* 

This is one of the signs he is really interested in because he will do everything to protect you from something negative. Maybe he is defending your feelings and opinions or just looking out for your safety. He may be a nice, polite person, but if you add this sign to some others, chances are he likes you more than a friend. 

*He asks you personal questions* 

I am not saying that he will ask intimate, uncomfortable questions, but only that he is trying to get to know you. What do you like about him? What are your hobbies? What is your favorite movie? etc. 

Men do not waste time trying to meet someone they are not interested in. He may be content to make polite small talk, but one of the signs of someone who likes you is that he continues to be interested in you. When you are together, does he ask you questions about yourself and really listen to your answers?

398,__daco_,1603832597,1,"Hello, I'm new to this sub, and eventhough the topic of this subreddit isn't that uplifting, I'm glad I joined. In hope of relieving some of that lonelieness.

Usually, when I'm feeling fine and comfortable, I'm more of an extrovert, entertainer kind of guy. I love making jokes, telling stories, and I'm not afraid to say I'm kinda good at it. Sadly, it's the only thing I got going for me.

For four years now I'm feeling desperately lonely. I've had a bunch of good and close friends when I left school but it all quickly spiraled downwards. I don't exactly remember how it all started, but I've gotten into smoking pot. Like, a lot. Like, snoop dogg amounts. For some time, I smoked 100 bucks worth in 2, maybe 3 days tops.

I feel like I don't have to mention what this brought upon my social life. I started feeling bad and like incompetent for ever longer lasting time periods. During which I started isolating myself. I used to meet my friends everyday, now it's one friend I talk to every two or three weeks.

I've had met a girl some months ago, we were chatting a bit, she was super sweet and also into me and I was on cloud 9. The need to smoke pot was gone completely. Like a switch that got pulled as soon as I could feel worth it again. Eventually we talked about pot. Because of corona, we couldn't meet yet, but she had this idea of talking on the phone while we both were smoking a blunt, enjoying it together, over the distance. I've hadn't wasted a thought on pot upto this point and my sky high mood made me think ""yeah, it's gonna be fine""....welp, it wasn't.

I kinda started panicking and because of the early stage of getting to know one another, it was a big deal. She wanted someone stable, I wasn't. Still am not.

I just know that as soon as I find a girl I'm interested in, I don't need it anymore. I get the strongest urges when I'm feeling the most lonely.

I was being told throughout my youth that I'm such a smart, talkative person, who everyone likes, but I feel like noone loves.

Also I'm pretty empathic. I'd say I'm very good in interpreting emotions of others and I'm good at helping them. Ironically, I'm very bad at handling my own emotions. I don't get angry or loud though, when something comes up, I shut up and isolate myself because throwing accusations doesn't help the situation either. It's really hard to talk about my emotions in person. And emotions I got a lot. Im the type of person who cries about a sit-com (the alternative...better...ending of himym finished me back then)

Now, two weeks ago I got fired for some dumb shit reason. I left school with good grades, went to college, maybe even could've went to university, but as soon as I started smoking pot, my grades plummeted, I cancelled college (Abitur, im from germany), got some annoying job, cancelled it, had to agree to an even worse job I now got fired from.

I don't know what I try to achieve with this post, I'm already getting the feeling of ""Stop bothering people with your problems"" while writing this.

I broke up with my boyfriend in January and have felt starved of physical affection to the point of psychological pain since start of September. Jesus that sounds dark reading it back but it feels good to express. I can't do the whole in-person dating thing currently because my grandmother lives with us and is very high risk as she's battling cancer. 

My subconscious has been torturing me every night for the past week or so with dreams where I'm forming a connection with usually a girl (I'm pan) but being unable to touch her or show her affection due to a wide variety of absurd obstacles. Last night she kinda resembled Freaks and Geeks era Linda Cardellini for some reason. It's really scary to me that my soul is suffering so much that it needs to remind me on a nightly basis in such a straightforward manner what I am lacking. I'm generally doing okay mood wise, but these constant messages from my psyche are adding up and thwarting my efforts to distract myself by keeping busy on school work and hobbies. 

I figured this sub could be a good place place to find people who I may relate to in this capacity.

420,surrealgarbage,1603818459,1,"Quote from bojack horseman that hit a little too deep. 
Anyone else feel that being amongst a crowd of people is even lonelier than being by yourself? 
It’s kind of like an incessant reminder of how I’m not as close with any of these people as they all are to each other.
That lonely empty feeling I get at parties is almost nostalgic for me, I’ve felt it ever since I was little when I would go to my parents’ dinner parties.
Locking yourself in the bathroom just to have a second to yourself, to breathe, look at yourself in the mirror and sometimes even hold back tears. 
That’s what parties are for me.
Going back out into the war zone that is that dreaded crowd of people and trying to force a believable smile.
Keeping small talk with that one other person who seems like they hate parties as much as you do.
Or constantly following that one friend of yours who seems to know everyone because you don’t wanna be left alone. 
Standing by the snacks table like an idiot trying not to draw any attention to yourself.
Going on your phone just to act like you’re doing something, when in reality you’re just opening and closing the same apps over and over again.
That’s what parties are for me.

She's never coming back (she told me this before blocking me from all social medias). This brings an end to our 8 month long relationship. It's only been a week but I never knew how much I loved her until we broke up. 

Every girl I have dated ended up becoming my everything and I always felt lonely and depressed once I broke up with them. This feeling lasts anywhere between a month to a few months or even a little more than a year. But this time I feel just as hurt as I did in 2016 when I used to cry myself to sleep over the girl who had left me. Except now I'm a grown man who hasn't cried in years but this time I really feel like letting it out.

During the 8 months of my relationship with the girl I broke up with a week ago, I started becoming distant from my best friend and other friends. I used to message my best friend everyday but not as much as I used to before I got into the relationship. He is now happy to see me messaging him more and more but I still feel lonely for some reason. I have other friends who are busy. I also lost my job yesterday so I don't really know what to do anymore. Even when I had work, I used to think about her all the time. Now that I'm free, it's worse. I just can't stop thinking about her. I want to move on but I'm not able to. They say time will heal but I can't wait for time to heal me. I really want to get over her. 

Everything I do reminds me of her and it makes me feel like shit. I love my best friend who also lost his job during the Pandemic. I told him we should start going out again but he said he'll be busy for the next two weeks so I really don't know what to do. I feel like punching myself for breaking up with her. But after the break up I started messaging my friends whom I became distant from. Turns out they're all busy.

But my best friend's wife kept pestering me to ask out her sister. So, I thought she must know something I don't! And her sister seemed to always enjoy being around me, and asked me to dance! 

But, when I finally relented and did, she told me she didn't want to date in the friend group.

Okay. I knew it was a bad idea, and my friend's wife is an idiot. I never should have listened to someone other than myself. 

Well, the sister got a boyfriend and engaged. Even to the point that my best friend's wife said, ""Wow, if my sister didn't reject you, you'd be hanging out all the time with us instead of them."" Some friend, right? My buddy sure knows how to pick them.

But in 2 weeks there's a gender reveal for the wife's baby. I have to hang out with her again my. Unless I just dip on my best friend's celebration. It's been 6 months since, and in that time the sister found a taller, better looking, *race car driver* that she's now engaged to. Literally a *race car driver*!

And I'm still single. I've dated, but haven't found anything long term. And lately, Coronavirus has stopped me from dating at all. So, for the last 4 months I've felt like a giant loser.

Basically, I have to go hang out with the woman that rejected me, and her race car driver fiance, at my best friend's baby gender reveal party. He's literally the only friend I have, and I almost never see them anymore. I'm amazed they invited me to this.

442,nonick2,1603802144,1,"Hello everyone,

Ever since high school I was pretty much always the third wheel among friends. I always had lots of friends but never really a best friend. I remember it made me sad a lot of times and this story just continues all my life. Even during college I had situations when friends didn't call me when they went out but luckily I had many other friends there so somebody did call me or I called them.

Now I am 289 and working for the past 6 years. I used to live for a few years with two of my best friends from college and even then I had instances where I felt left out. I have cried many times when I felt like this. Then I found my first real boyfriend but I still spent lots of time with my friends. I always tell everyone to not forget about their friends when they find a relationship. 

2 years ago I bought an apartment and we live here. Ever since then it's been even worse because most of my friends live a bit distant from me but it's manageable, and on the other hand they live very close by to each other which I am jealous of. I don't have anyone close to me and I didn't make any new friends in my area. I always tell my friends that if I have a boyfriend that doesnt mean I dont want to spend time with them anymore I cannot even count how many times I told them that I want to be with them , I have plenty of time to be with my BF for the rest of my life. But pretty much every time I am part of something happening its because I messaged them asking what are their plans for the weekend and if we can go biking or organize a BBQ, play beach volleyball or something. Of course they invite me for birthdays and the regular stuff but still. 

I even wanted to go to Croatia in July when the situation there was pretty good and one of my friends didnt want to go because of corona which is funny because she is one of those - its just a flu. And then I found out that she went with three other friends in end of August when the situation in Croatia was becoming pretty bad. And these are the types of things basically. In this instance I wouldn't be able to go with them even if they called me because my dad was celebrating birthday at that time,  but they didn't know that.

Recently I messaged one of my friends for her plans for the weekend and she told me she just discussed with other friend that they might go for some hiking maybe even with a sleepover somewhere. So I jokingly (but in reality sadly) responded - and again nobody invited me (I usually dont even say this but I couldn't resist this time) and she said well we still dont know the specifics we just talked about it. These are those typical replies when you dont want to hurt someone's feelings so you say something like this. 

Or this last weekend I suggested grilling in the woods and the response was - it's too cold for that and then two of my friends went biking. So I just find that funny because when you have a fire set up it's much warmer than biking where the wind makes you very cold in autumn. And of course they didn't invite me.

I dont even know why am I posting, I just wish I could find out why has this been my destiny? I am very easy going and can make friends easily if I meet some new people, during parties I am usually the one being the funny one people laugh at , I even joke about myself a lot and people seem to be enjoying it , I never insult people and when we have some serious discussions that can sometimes get heated (you know how it is sometimes, politics or other sensitive topics) I always make sure not to insult someone I try to keep it calm and never start those topics. 

Overall I consider myself a nice person that would do a lot for my closest friends but it seems it's not the same the other way and its making me very sad. My BF is a very passive person and I am trying to be very active I dont want to sit at home during weekends and even though he goes with me of course I cannot be only with him all the time. It's not even good for the relationship to be with someone all the time and I told that to my friends so many times that I love being around them and they dont need to assume I just want to be with my BF.

TLDR : I have always felt like a third wheel, made lots of friends during my life but never really had a best friend. I consider myself to be nice and usually being the funny one at parties, yet friends usually dont invite me when they go somewhere during the weekend. If I am with them, its mostly because I messaged them and organized it.",lonely,Why am I always just the third wheel?,2020-10-27 23:35:44

Something I've noticed about lonelyness and the pain of it for so long is just how familiar and comfortable it has become in a certain sense. For all intensive purposes being lonely is being in pain, but that pain has been so ingrained into my existence that anything else is horrifying. It's scary, unfamiliar, and almost unknown not to feel it. It is the constant in life, the only thing you know is going to be there when nothing else is. Then there's those faint times of hope where maybe I won't be lonely for the rest of my life. The lack of that pain makes me suspicious of everything and just plan that it will be back in full force in due time, that anything else is temporary.

I’ve always wanted to be in a relationship with someone. It seems no matter what I do, the girls I get close to always push me aside for someone else. People always tell me that “being in a relationship isn’t that great” or “you need to be happy with yourself being single before you start looking for a relationship”. But I’ve never had the chance to experience any kind of relationship and I’m sick and tired of being told the same things when I face rejection. 

I got really close to a girl I liked a couple years ago and we both liked each other, but eventually, she ended up going back to her ex boyfriend and nothing ended up happening between us. She just told me I’d make a great boyfriend for another lucky girl somewhere out there. But that’s not the first time that’s happened to me, that’s the third time. With 3 different girls. I have to sit and watch from Facebook or Instagram how happy they are with the person they chose over me, while I struggle to comprehend why I always come second. 

I hate dating apps because I barely get any responses or matches and it just destroys my self confidence. It’s hard to meet new people nowadays because people just judge you based on looks. I wouldn’t consider myself unattractive. I’m fit and healthy, but now I have to second guess myself and question if I am actually attractive or not.

I’m really just stuck, because everything I try seems to backfire on me. I’m sick of coming second to some other guy who doesn’t even give a damn about anyone else besides himself. I’m sick of trying to put effort into finding someone and I’ve been patient for too long. Either way, I always seem to be the second choice whether or not I’m patient or trying to make an effort.

it wasnt supposed to be like this...i was supposed yo be beside someone, to meet some artists, make friends, study in a beautiful place, stay as far away from my home as i could

instead im stuck here...im alone, everyone's insulting and yelling at me, treating me like a moron...i dont even have anyone to call so i dont feel as lonely as i do. im up to the neck with school and exams and all that, im just...im tired

in there, no one makes fun of me, no one yells at me...i have someone to talk to, someone to sing with, someone to watch movies or play videogames with...someone to hug when im sad and...yeah, but...well, i dont really feel sad, i mean, in there, why would i be? i wouldnt be alone anymore, i'd have no reason to

look at me, speaking of a place that doesnt exist, of a life that isnt really mine, and about a person that in reality, would never care about me...

but i always wish i woke up there, or maybe just, never doing it, cause then, it'd be reality...then i'd have someone that cares, and a nice place to live, in peace and quiet, just, a happy life

On top of that, if someone does come to me and asks for a number or intends for a relationship, my hand shake and I panic. It's the kind of panic that makes me draw blanks and I feel as if I'm being tested for my life. I then clumsily explain why their efforts make me so glad to hear them (that kind of thing isn't an every day occurence for me; it's like seeing a unicorn) but we wouldn't work out and should find someone who better fits them.

I feel like by telling them this, I'm doing them and myself a favor and not waste time for what (I feel) is the inevitable. 

It hurts when I do this to myself. I'm trying to love myself better, but that panic always sets in if someone gets near.

Sinking deeper and deeper into the hole of insanity with no one to pull you out and the harder you try to make things better only makes things much worse.

 I try to be myself and it makes people uncomfortable. My ability to interact has almost vanished completely. My few friends are less willing to understand. I see no light, only darkness surrounds me in the basement I'm currently living in. I watch as people I know achieve success and are easily loved. They have pets, nice living situations, family, so's... I have to wonder how long before I finally get something nice or feel loved to any sort of degree. And even once I hit the milestones, will I even feel any better at all?

I'm now starting to feel bitter towards people. I get very anxious when I'm near them. I start to feel bugs crawling on me the closer these strangers get to me. They want to ridicule me for being lazy and weak. A social outcast and a lazy bum has no good place in the great wheel of society.

 I live in a country where people are always coming and going, and one of my friends, who has lived here about a year now, introduced some of our group (the ones that commonly play games together on discord) to some of his friends from where he came from who also play games. 
 We have played quite a lot since we first met them over the past week or two, and the last three nights a few of us have stayed up late to chat and chill on discord. Bare in mind I am still at school and wake up at 6am to do so, and the last three nights I’ve gone to bed at 2am, 230am, and as I write this, 4am. I have never stayed up this late either, hence why this feels so big to me.
 Tonight, two of the people who I’ve recently met and I stayed up and chatted to each other for about 4 hours. The two of them have known each other sometime, so we spent our time just chilling and making jokes and getting to know one another. I didn’t think I was capable of making friends who, when talking to them, really felt like I was their friend, or that they wanted to talk to me. With these new guys however, they make me feel like they want to talk to me. 
 Whether they do actually want to talk to me or not, the feeling is amazing and I really appreciated the time that they gave to talk to me. Obviously, based off of the fact I’m writing this, I enjoyed talking and getting to know them, and definitely look forward to spending more time chilling with them, regardless of the fact we’re on different sides of the planet. They made me feel welcome and relevant and for the first time in a VERY long time, especially during the given circumstances, I didn’t feel lonely. 
 To the two of you who stayed up with me, even though you’ll likely never read this, thank you. You cheered up someone who thought they couldn’t be cheered up by people, and made someone happier than they have been in a really long time.

517,4Roman4,1603748694,1,"*Hey, guys, finally decided to come and tell you a bit about the feelings I had for a pretty long time. I'll try to summarize it as best as I can because my English is not the best one and I'm still learning even after the 5 years of practise I had from school, videogames and Youtube. If you'll have any questions, please do ask in the comments and I'll reply as quickly as possible.*

Trough my 18 years of existence, people around me always put in my mind that everyone is special and different, which is a good thing because by that everyone has a different purpose in life and fit in the group they're intended to be in. I did not really understand it until I was 8 years old. In that time, I just used my imagination of the world around me, which led to me being lonely, because nobody (even my mom) didn't understand what my intentions were. Even I don't really know what were the things I did as a kid were for, but none the less, because of that I am a person I am today.

I didn't really have any friends until I finally got to high school I am currently in. I am studying a graphic design, which makes me use my imagination pretty often thankfully. But even tho I finally have some people to talk to from school, it just doesn't really feel like I have connections to these people. These people don't really know my whole story, even tho they act as they do.

I'm not saying that my friends are bad people, they definitely aren't and I'm glad I got to meet them in my timeline of events! The problem I have with them is that they just cannot see what I see and they can't hear what I hear. The jokes I make are only funny to me, not to anybody else. When I do art and show it to someone, their only reply is ""Wow, that is cool"" and ""Wow, that is nice,"" but I know for a fact that they don't understand that thought behind it and what I tried to say. I can try so much to put my vision into my drawings, but It just seems like I fail at it every single time.

The only thing I hear most of the time is that my art is nice, which I know already. I'm not trying to sound cocky or anything, but do they think that if I would make something I disliked that I would even show it to someone? My art is the art I like and I enjoy making it, but if people around me don't really see the point of it, then what's the point of making anything? What do you do, when people cannot understand what you're trying to say?

People are different, but I wish the exact opposite. I'm tired of being that dude who's alone even in a room full of thousands of people. I know I'll never find the love of my life, even if people tell me it just takes time, but I am already tired of waiting because I know that nobody is perfect for me. I have many problems and I would just be another problem but for my partner.

I'm not ready for this world. I know I am not. But I finally have to do something about it. Tomorrow I'll contact a psychiatrist from my town to see if I can do something about myself. I don't see any other possibility, so I just have to believe this one will do.",lonely,Being different sucks,2020-10-27 08:44:54

I know I’ve past the age of making genuine friends and It’s eating me up inside. I’ve gone weeks and months without speaking to anyone other than my family throughout lockdown.

When I woke up I got hit with a truck load of emotion. I can’t seem to shake things that have happened. The smallest memories always stay with me; like once my friend didn’t stop to have a conversation once and it seemed like she didn’t want to talk to me, and to this day that crushes me. 

I just want people to care. I want someone to acknowledge that I am capable of having these feelings. My parents don’t understand. My closest friend won’t let me break that barrier in our friendship where we acknowledge our feelings and really listen to each other.

recently i’ve been feeling lonelier than ever. i have a few close friends and caring family who love me, but somehow i still feel empty and lonely inside. for some context, i’m a freshman in university and because of covid, i haven’t made a single friend since the semester started. my group mates are nice but i wouldn’t consider them people that i can sustain long conversations with. apart from that, i’ve never dated in my entire life. i’m not saying i’m actively looking for a partner, because i feel that i should learn to love myself first before loving someone else; and i shouldn’t date because i am lonely, but date when i am ready. i am also an only child, both my parents are busy and tired from work on weekdays. hence, i’m mostly alone at home most of the time since my classes are mostly online. this has kind of intensified the feelings of loneliness although i have become used to it.

instead, what i really need is a soulmate. not a best friend, lover or family member but a soulmate. i’m not sure how to put this into words but i just want someone i can share my interests with, have late night heart to heart talks with, hang out and go on adventures with. whenever i watch movies or go out shopping or eating alone, i wish for someone to be there to share my experiences and feelings, just as i would share theirs. i do hang out with my close friends once every few months (they are all busy and we live far apart) so what i really wish for now is a soulmate that can truly understand me.

Well it has nothing to do with my looks OR my personality but more with my traumatic past (including years of bullying and growing up with a narcissistic parent).
To cope with with this emptiness, I had to teach myself to find happiness from within.
Because I never learned how to love myself so how can I share that with someone which I don’t have myself?
I certainly grew during this progress, since I sort of healed from my codependency and learned to accept myself for who I am (my father never truly did), but my desire for love and intimacy is still there, waiting to be fulfilled.

We were suppose to do an online Halloween day thing with our shared group of friends but then last minute they’ve changed their plans to see each other instead which automatically excludes us because of the distance and lockdown restrictions.  Then we were going to do something different online with one of them who weren’t going to meet the group but he’s cancelled on us too to join the friendship group face to face.  He said he wants to make time for everyone but it just feels like a slap in the face tbh because they see each other every single week but don’t want to stick to the original online plan so that we can ‘see’ them for the day.

I’ve not been able to make any friendships from anyone at uni because I don’t attend the same lectures as them since I’m part time uni.  And most of its online now anyway. I literally don’t know anyone in the area and COVID means I can’t go join a sports or hobby group. 

My partner is amazing and supportive but there’s not a lot he can do to stop me feeling so isolated. It makes me want to cry.  I’m jealous of him in honesty because he’s got friends from work and people he can go to the pub with if he wanted to.  He knows this but I don’t blame him for it. I’m really happy for him and it’d suck even more if he felt as lonely as me too.

551,5worn2carryurburdens,1603716663,1,"Hi I’m sorry I’m advance for how long this is going to be. I’m 17 and this half term I decided to make a motorbike trip up from Norwich to Cumbria. Camping for 5 nights and staying in a hostel for 2. As i am riding a 125cc on L plates I can’t use motorways. Because of this The fastest route takes roughly 8 hours with no stops and is about 300 miles. I am doing it with 4 other friends who are travelling in the car. On the first day I made it to lake Windermere when it was already dark. This was around an two hours ride still to my campsite and I couldn’t feel my fingers or toes any more and I was soaked though even with my full body waterproofs on. I gave up and checked into a hotel for the night. In the morning I had to drive over the hard knot pass to meet my friends at the campsite. My friends wanted to go on a three night wild. Camping hike before staying in the hostel. Usually I would be really down for this but I still feel really downtrodden after the long ride up here. Instead I have booked myself into a bed and breakfast place near Wasdale head for the next three nights. I spent last night in the campsite and it rained and hailed all night absolutely soaking my cheap tent. My friends just left to start their hike and I am sitting in the only pup for miles, regretting leaving home. I don’t really want to do anything as it is so wet and cold and going anywhere in the nicer parts of the lakes like Grasmere or Ambleside would mean going back over the hard knot pass. I leave this Saturday but I am feeling really homesick. I am really anxious about the 8 hour trip home and I am really panicking.  Sorry again for the length.

566,useronymous15243,1603694609,1,"Hai reddit, I've managed to make friends here in the past who ended up being really big aspects of my life. Honestly I'm here right now, because a friend I made a few months ago here, ended up being one of the best friends I feel like I've ever had. I grew really strong feelings for them and I was so sure that they felt the same, but they ended up confiding in me that they like somebody else, so I admitted my feelings. We went from talking and hanging out every single day, to just not doing that anymore. I feel like I've been replaced, and like I'm just not as important anymore. I really did love them a lot, I have been a complete and total mess. I spent the entire day yesterday crying, but I've tried being more productive. I would really just like a new friend. Someone who gives me their time because they enjoy my company and I do the same for them.

Some things I like to do and what you should know about me:

    I have extremely bad anxiety. I suffer agoraphobia and AvPD. I find it really hard to handle talking to people. One on one I can kind of manage it but in a group form it becomes really difficult for me. I basically shut down from the anxiety. I also find it difficult to open up to people, it takes me some time. I like patient and understanding friends who let me go at my own pace.

    Video games! It's the best way to spend time with someone imo. I would play pretty much anything with a friend. On my own time I tend to play single player games. My favorite genre's are metroidvania and hack &amp; slash games, and I love a good story. I tend to tackle difficult challenges in games because it is fun and a good time waster.

    Art! I love anything creative really. I love polymer clay and want to learn how to cross stitch. Doing smithing and making jewelry would be a dream for me to try. I make pixel art myself.

    Podcasts and Music! I mainly listen to gaming, true crime, and paranormal podcasts. It's a good way to distract myself and feel like someone is talking to me, so I don't feel so alone. I love all kinds of music but I mainly listen to synthpop, dreampop, chiptune, lofi, anime OP/EP. I'm also trying to learn piano right now, and make my own music. I just started so it's a journey.

    Movies/Anime! I love horror movies. 2000 era is the best but I'd watch anything once, unless it bores me to death. I haven't watched anime in awhile but it's something I do like to do. I'd love watching stuff together if we get along.

Honestly, I'm just really lonely, and very sad. I miss my friend, they were the light in my life and made me so happy. I'm scared I won't be able to find something like that again. I guess this is my attempt to scream into the void and hope something good comes out of it. I've had my fair share of toxic friendships, and the really good, special connections seem to happen literally out of nowhere, when you're not even looking for it. Yes I need a distraction right now, but if we become close you'd be so much more than that to me. I really love and care about my friends.

Please message me if anything I said resonated with you... I feel so alone right now. Tell me a joke or something if you read this far so I know you didn't just skim my wall of text. Sending good vibes, and thank you. c: &lt;3

EDIT: I forgot to add, please just be 18+",lonely,"I really need a friend right now, so I'm going to pour my heart out to you",2020-10-26 17:43:29

571,katydid73,1603690386,1,"Last spring, after a family crisis I (25f) made the decision to move 3000 miles away with my daughter and move in with my boyfriend (not an internet boyfriend, we're from the same place and I've known him for 10 years) I still stand by my decision as its what was best for my daughter and I. 

Thanks to the current pandemic I haven't made any friends or even mom friends. The women I work with are my only real interaction and they all have children my age. My boyfriend is a field tech so he travels for work. He started last Monday at a new company and is gone for 2 weeks, home next weekend then gone for two more.

 Well I found out I was pregnant Monday afternoon. We were trying for a baby but didn't expect it to happen in the first month. I was so excited at first. But I dont even have someone to share my excitement with. I've told my best friend but she's across the country and it's not the same. I'm not ready to tell my family and have a hard time believing my mother with be very congratulatory. 

Over the course of this week my feeling of loneliness has multiplied exponentially. I didnt have much support from my daughter's father when I was pregnant at 18 and this is bringing me back to that. I at least had my family and my father (passed away in March from late stage cancer). Here I have no one. I'm in a better place to have a child but I feel like I'm gonna be doing this by myself and that makes me really fucking sad. I've cried more times this week than not. My boyfriend doesn't get home for another week then he basically turns back around for another two weeks. 

I'm so afraid I'm going to be doing this alone: pregnancy, all the appointments, finding out the gender, giving birth, God forbid anything goes wrong, all the ups or downs, raising two kids and a dog and working and trying to be a good mom. 

 I really just need a hug right now but the only person I have is my daughter and I love her hugs but she's 6 and clueless to everything going on (for the best till I'm farther along)",lonely,Should be over the moon but never felt so lonely and depressed.,2020-10-26 16:33:06

I feel so alone. I know I’m depressed and that makes me isolate, which in turn makes me push away the few people I have and fuels the fire of feeling alone. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not actually alone. My family has my back. But I hate being a burden, I don’t want it to drag them down. And they aren’t near. There’s only so much comfort to be had over a call. 
I’m so overwhelmed with school and the environment I live in. I can’t focus on anything and I feel like a failure for not being able to do enough. I feel like no one understands me. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and no one wants to be around me, like everyone has someone they’d rather be around. And who can blame them? I’m a dark cloud right now and lately every semblance of “I’m okay” is just a lie, a mask of how I really feel. Some days I’m proud that I can do it mostly all on my own, and other days I just want someone to hold me and tell me it will be okay. I’m so tired of feeling like I have to fight for everything. I feel like I’m not even in control anymore. I’m just hanging on for the ride that is life.  
I question if my loneliness is because people don’t like me or if I do something wrong. I know I push people away. 
I’m scared to be real, to get hurt. I often wonder if I’ll always feel alone. I’ve only ever had one relationship and it left me feeling so broken, even after all this time. It ending made me feel like it was my fault. That I didn’t work hard enough to make it work, or I wasn’t good enough. It’s hard for me to imagine anyone ever wanting me or loving me romantically again because I don’t feel like I’ll ever be enough.

599,Squalyian,1603679929,1,"Hi , i'm full time  employee at 26 years old , i hate my job  and awake every morning, every weekend  repetitive,  only wasting time on fucking screen playing video games and watching animes.

Nobody cares about me nor i don't have anybody real - personal relationship - so i can meet him

I hate my self more when i go to restureaunt and set with my self on the table, every customer there they came with a group either friends or family.

I feel the waiting time is very long 

I don't have any cousins nor brother nor sister care to come with me

My brothers only talking to me on wasting time material like video games and anime and i didn't remember they are stand with me on any social events like graduating from high school , my sisters only talking to me of they need something, and my co workers only about work

Nobody in my circle of acquaintances talk to me about life, when i go every day to bed  i'm thinking every time when i will have friends? Why i'm wasting my time on playing video games and watching? Is it because i have nothing to do and the whole day i have a free time?

On December i have my annual leave but i'm not exciting because i know i will not have any social activities and will stay home .

I didn't feel my presence at all, if the sucide is not haram and sin then i will commit it.

610,kikigenesis,1603671917,1,"I sleep with my pillows arranged in a specific way, with one upright on my side so it can feel like my head is on someone’s chest. Or sometimes i’d hold it on top of me to feel like i’m hugging them. Whenever a nice song comes on I grab a pillow and slow dance with it. or i’d hug my jacket that i’ve just used and i imagine it’s the warmth of another person. Id talk to my stuffed animals and with myself almost 24/7. Id have conversations with the air and i turn my head and move my eyes to where i think the person i’m talking to is, to make it more realistic. I’m pretty sure i have a problem with physical touch now since i’ve been deprived of it for so long...whenever someone tries to hug me i tense up and don’t hug back and if they touch me in any way like rubbing my back or anything like that i twitch and get really uncomfortable. Sometimes i feel so lonely, i don’t feel like interacting with people at all. Like i know i’m not able to form connections, and when i try, and fail, it makes me feel worse. So i just stop trying. Yet there’s still a huge part of me that craves it too. I refuse love and i hate the fact that i’m acting like this because it makes me sick.

I haven't had a friend in so long. It hurts so much knowing that there's absolutely no one that truly cherishes me as a person. There are so many people out there that take their friendships for granted, but if I had even a single friend I'd consider myself the luckiest person in the world. 

I don't know what I did wrong, honestly. Ever since I was little, people ignored me, made fun of me, and actively bullied me. I didn't deserve any of it, but maybe I did? There must be a reason, right? Can people be born unlovable? 

I don't know. I carried all that baggage through high school, and the personality problems that developed as a result of my earlier experiences just made me isolated and lonely. No one gave a fuck about me, and I made no effort to make them care. I would just retreat into a corner and be alone. I didn't belong there. The bullying continued, because I was too ""weird"", I guess. 

Even in college, where I suddenly transformed into a more social and outspoken person, I couldn't forge any long-lasting relationships. I was too afraid to fuck it up because people like me always fuck it up somehow. I was never gonna make friends there or anywhere, because I never made friends in high school or elementary because there is something fundamentally wrong with me, so why even try, right?

A year ago I met my favorite singer. We hit it off and added each other on Instagram. I gave them art and we talked on and off nearly everyday and week. I was mutual friends with people they knew and friends with the people in the community built around the music. Everything seemed fine. This person would open up to me, send voice messages, and things like that (even when they were touring). 

Fast forward to about a year later and they start drifting. Sometimes I’m left on read, I politely ask and I’m told I’ve done nothing wrong, they’re busy etc. and I’m like sure. Makes sense: I don’t expect this person to spend lots of time on me, they are busy with a career after all. (They’re not in a relationship as another possible explanation)

In May they ask for concept album art. I say sure, I don’t do any of the regular comission safe guards because they’re my friend: they’re verified and I trust them after all. Even their guitarist talks to me and follows me. 

I have to make a new account because of certain issues and re add them. I’ve done everything I can to make sure they know it’s really me and everything is cool: everyone else adds me back including the guitarist. 

The singer, however, won’t add me back. And it’s been months since he will reply to me. He has seen my new account story and art. He’s even immediately responded to my friends and even a spam account I tried.  But he won’t have anything to do with me suddenly. 

No message, tag, or anything gets him to reply while he’s openly replying to nearly everyone else. 

I don’t know what I did wrong. If anything. 
I feel completely ignored and ghosted but I can’t even have this conversation with the singer because they do not answer. I know I need to move on, but this has never happened to me before. I could ask the guitarist but I don’t want to start drama. And it hurts so much. 
Thanks for reading.

630,Draper31,1603660541,1,"As I sat back to think about that, it didn’t take long at all to see how it applied to my life. I have many acquaintances, and a handful of very close friends.

Disclaimer: I am aware that what I mentioned above is more than what most people have here. I’m not making this post to get into a pissing match about who has it worse. Dating and relationships are tough for both sexes, this post will be about the struggles of dating as a male, simply because I am a male.

So, back to the point. It is a common assumption and most of the time it turns out to be true that a man’s girlfriend is his sole source of emotional support and as such it’s possible for him to dump a massive amount of emotional baggage on her at once.

This isn’t the case with my friends though, we are each other’s emotional support systems, and we have deep meaningful conversations often so if I ever do enter into a relationship at least it won’t be with emotional baggage.

Here’s where the “lesson in depravity” comes in. No matter how many friends I have, they will never take the place of romantic affection from someone that is interested in me as more than a friend. 

I’m so touch starved and deprived from affection in general, but there’s nothing I can do to fix it, that requires a woman who wants to be affectionate with me. I can count on one hand the amount of compliments I’ve received from women-7. 25 years old and I received 7 compliments from women, each one I can remember like it was yesterday, I remember what I was wearing, what she was wearing, what the weather was like lol. 

Growing up as a man you learn to live without affection on a regular basis (at least I have anyway) but that doesn’t lessen my internal need and longing for it. Maybe someday my body won’t feel like it’s on fire every time I see PDA, because the PDA will be happening to me too.",lonely,I read something the other day that really stuck with me: being a man is a lesson in depravity.,2020-10-26 08:15:41
631,Curious_Jyo,1603659882,1,"So, this will actually be my first og post ever on Reddit and I just felt like getting this off my chest after being a lurker for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that I have great friends who always look out for me. My family can be a pain to deal with but I do honestly believe they love me and would do anything for me but as any kid brought up in a very strict household knows, that you hide and bottle up your feelings as much as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized this was a terrible thing to do during my university years as you became really closed off from everyone. Cannabis was an opener for me and I started to become a lot more social and out-going.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, I still feel incredibly lonely. I think it is because of the fact that I have never had a meaningful relationship that has lasted more than a couple of months. I never talk to anyone about my traumas as I believe what happened in the past, should be left in the past. As of late, this has been weighing me down as I look at social media and see all these couples related posts or stories. Previously, I would just ignore it and would think ""my time will come"" but as time goes on, I just started feeling more and more restless and depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I watched ""the social dilemma"" and while I think I was always subconsciously knew how social media would track us and gives us posts where we would engage more, I was never aware of the phycological effects it can have. As such, I have to come to believe that social media may be the cause of my depressing attitude and have decided to take a minimum 2 week hiatus from it. Everything but reddit, since I don't really consider it to be social media. 

&amp;#x200B;

636,Expensive-Disaster60,1603657846,1,"Like most people, I’ve been through a lot in my life. The worst of the things all happened before I turned 26. 8-10 traumatic memories/events whatever of varying degree. No support from my family when I very clearly needed to be in therapy, I was told you are just sad - you’ve been through hard things it’s normal to be sad. 

I wasn’t just sad. I was deeply depressed. My depression over time was kind of shaped like a W. Two deep deep bottoms, the ways down and back up and down and back up again. I’m back up after my second deep bottom. But I’m struggling. 

I ended a relationship that was not good for me. I am proud of that. I have my own place. I am proud of that. I have a pet who keeps my company. I’m proud of that. I have a full time job even in this crazy time. I’m proud of that. 

However. I don’t have many family members left. And I’m an adult, they all have their own lives, and I don’t want to burden them. I’ve expressed before how I am not doing great mentally and they gave support but maybe we check in with each other every 2-3 months. I don’t have parents. 

I know I am not ready for another relationship again yet and I already made the decision to take time to myself. But this has been made difficult by me feeling very unmotivated and very very lonely and sad. No one reaches out much. Most of it is light chit chat. I am on a strict budget and it would make me too nervous to pay for a therapist, what if I need emergency funds? What if I lose my job (the way the world is going makes me too damn nervous so take on any extra payments even if I know it would benefit me). 

So I am posting here. I’m very lonely. When I’m alone which is most of the time if I’m not at work, I’m in my head. I read sad or messed up stories on here and think “well at least I didn’t have to deal with that”. But if I put everything I’ve experienced. Well, people would know who I am because my wide array of events is not common, just the one thing specifically is not common. 

I don’t want to burden my friends or family. But I don’t want to get back down to the deep darkness where I push everyone away and can’t get out of bed. I’m ashamed I let myself get that bad before. I don’t want to again. And so far I’m holding out but I am seeing a worrying amount of my bad cooping mechanisms all front and center. 

Mostly just wanted to write that out. I don’t need sympathy. I’m tired of hearing I’m sorry. Advice is better tho, we know some things are easier said than done. 

I more just want people to know, not everyone you think is happy, actually is. Or you think they are “normal” or well-adjusted. People in my life know what I’ve been through, but I put on a mask and say I’m fine and I would never speak about how bleak and hopeless I feel to them.

646,k0nter33,1603651852,1,"

Being an 19 year old Eastern European male who just graduated from school I never had a romantic relatioship while trying multiple times but miserably failing because of my social awkwardness. Since the beginning of the quarantine my life only got worse. I'm not planning to go to a college and my parents earn a decent amount of money at their jobs, so they are not pushing me to go get one myself. For the last 5 months I was practically isolated in my room just staring at my monitor.

I realised a long time ago that all I need is a simple human interaction, but I'm too anxious and self conscious to reach out to people outside my family (even now, when I'm writing this while walking down the street after going out to the grocery store, I can't stop thinking about what other people think of me).That realisation doesn't give me anything. Only people that I have in my life are my parents, that are both depressed from their work, I don't know how to talk to them and they never talk to me; one good friend, that doesn't really care about anything I say to him when I try to reach out and instead he gives me a bunch of motivational quotes and ""lol, same"" type of answer; and my sister of the same age that I'm really close to, but even being that close to her and confessing about my depression not so long ago, it never did change anything, and it feels like I never told her anything at all. 

Even when I want to, I can't interact with people outside my family, because the single thought of trying to talk to a strangere is giving me a panic attack, and it makes me feel so disappointed and sad in my own existence.

I don't know for how long I'll be able to go on. Suicidal thoughts have been a daily occurrence for me. It feels like I'm going insane and it's destroying me from the inside.",lonely,I'm tired of being anxious and depressed,2020-10-26 05:50:52

September comes, back to school, and I began to see that they were becoming more and more distant from me, we weren't talking as often. Realising that made me feel a little bit sad but I thought ""well it's normal it's just because we aren't on vacation anymore"" and I didn't worry about it that much. 

Now we are one week into autumn holidays, and in the past few days I had a depressive episode. None of them contacted me. None of them asked me to do anything with them. We just exchanged some text messages on some public discord conversations. I asked one of them ""why are we so distant ?"". 

Apparently I said some thing he didn't like but he didn't want to tell me about it. ""I still want to be your friend tho"". I also learned that they did exactly what we were doing back in summer (always being together in voice chat, doing the same stuff together) since the start of the week. Just without me.

There's a woman I'm facebook friends with that constantly posts about how depressed she is and I tried to say ""omg adorable dog"" on her posts or just leave random comments but she never replies or comments on anything of mine so I stopped, maybe we just dont vibe. 


Anyways I've also stopped going out to places, it got too depressing. I remember going to this outdoor botanical garden and noticed I was literally the only person there by myself. It was somehow way more horrible and depressing than staying home. I wanted to cry. I've been lazy like I said and just depended on my ex for everything social. That's bad and unhealthy and I was miserable anyways with him because he literally never wanted to go anywhere or do anything and we hung out like once or twice a week anyways so whatever. Steps I am taking are going to a mental health support group tuesday. I was crossing my fingers and praying it was in person around other people but it isn't. Like fuck I've been contemplating just going to an AA meeting since all the other in person group things I vastly prefer are canceled. I'm surprised how big of a difference going to one yoga class and one guided meditation group meeting made so much difference in loneliness levels. 


Also there seems to be this paradox in mental health communities or support communities. Where half of the posts and just horrible things happening and horribly depressed people and been thinking of quitting reddit because of how negative everyone in general is. I need to stop the habit of complaining about things and being in a bad mood. Ok since it's relevant one last complaint, I had to read 5 different pages online for help with something like self love or exercises for social isolation and they were all only ""what is social isolation. An example of it. The end. Call therapist"" or also everything in literally the world is self care. Drink a warm cup of tea! Put on lipgloss! Specifically eat a peach.

I know many people don't think friends on the internet aren't real because you're basically just talking to their persona, but I knew they real. I met my first friend on a social app few years ago and then we began making more friends through a roleplay chat, building up friendships over the next four years, me being the very antisocial type took a while before i actually talked to most of them and became real friends. I was happy for once, my home life wasn't that good and it's better now, but they were what kept me wanting to go on, believing we'll see each other one day. 

Few months ago she broke, she said she didn't want to deal with everything going on, the drama and fighting within our group which happens a lot because some of us have clashing personalities and unfortunately some past stuff. I guess i was heartbroken the most because I was one of the people that made her leave, I never liked telling my family my problems because I didn't want them to worry about my health. So i would rant and talk to her, I admit there were times I lost control and said things I didn't mean to because my emotions were hard to control, jealousy because I loved her.

Now I've been trying to move on, but I keep remembering her, the love I felt for her, knowing it'll never happen and that I lost one of my bestest friends I'll probably ever have. I check up on her social media, she blocked me but I have alts, she seems happy again and im glad, I'm sad I couldn't be there with her.

we are starting  ""Monthly Accountability Challenge"" - M.A.C for short.

The event will take place on this discord server starting from 28 of October.  
DISCORD: [https://discord.gg/Ntb6ZQP](https://discord.gg/Ntb6ZQP)

If you want to form a new habit, start to wake up early or put your life in order this is probably for you.

We  organize it for free because it makes us happier and brings some  meaning to our lives. And to be honest because we need your  accountability, sometimes we get lazy too ;)

""Monthly Accountability Challenge"" - M.A.C. will focus on four aspects.

1. Habits
2. Public accountability &amp; support
3. Consistency
4. Action plan  


Why I think it is the right channel to share this information is because in my opinion being supported by people when your are lonely is very important and our accountability group is about it. We also do weekly and monthly calls to check on each other. That's the reason we use discord, we can chat and do calls there.

They hired me along with 6 people and 1 of them (girl) been very nice and friendly with me, we spent lot of time chatting, calling and she even called me out for full day trip, she was talking about how we gonna spent christmas by shopping and in same christmas clothing etc. things like that and I´ve attached to her, thinking it may be something more than just friendship, now she is telling me that we are gonna be going for some trip every weekend  
But now I don´t know why, my brain decided to think we are only gonna be friends (happened to me and it was terrible feeling) and I know that as colleagues I´m gonna be seeing her everyday so I can´t make step forward since it might destroy my career at my new job and I also can´t step back since we are colleagues and seeing each other almost every day and I don´t have anybody to talk about this

686,krimzonthief,1603611710,1,"Warning: long post

I uprooted my life and moved across the country for a relationship that didn't last because I never in a million years thought anyone would like me and I jumped at the chance (yes I realize how stupid it was). I'm more of an introvert so I don't mind being by myself most of the time, but I would like to make friends. I work the night shift (decent job actually) so I'm not awake during the day to go out to do things and meet people. Though I can't even do that because of you know what that ruined this entire fucking year. But even if I could go out, I'm too socially awkward to make friends. I don't smoke anything or drink (meaning I'm not the type of person to go to a bar or club) or use any of the popular social media apps that people always connect on, which all of that combined eliminates seemingly 99% of the population for both friendships and relationships. On top of that I don't even know where to go to meet people around my age that isn't school, a bar, or a club. All 3 of which are great places to meet people and all three of which I don't go to.

People always joke or are sometimes serious about not getting into a relationship, but I fucking miss it. I can't even describe how much or what I miss, but I'm not made to be alone like this. At the risk of sounding absolutely ridiculous, I feel like I'm the type of person that's meant to love someone. That's when I was at my happiest anyways. Even if I could meet someone however, not only am I too inexperienced to make something out of it, but I'm also screwed by my looks. I don't think I'm ugly, but I'm in my mid 20's and I look like I'm 12 and that is absolutely not an exaggeration (not just my opinion, but literally everyone else's too). Nobody wants to think of someone who looks like me in a romantic way. I never even get the opportunity to try to form a relationship. People always tell me that I'm lucky because when I'm old I'll look young, and that's all well and good, but I'd like to be in a relationship while I'm still young and hopefully grow up together. 

All of that brings us to why I feel lonely. I'm normally a pretty content person, but I'm on the other side of the country from my parents, I have no friends, I have no girlfriend. All I do is stay in my empty apartment and go to work where I sit in the same room for 8-12 hours depending on the day and do largely the same damn thing I do at home. I don't have any friends, I don't have a relationship, I'm by myself whenever I'm not at work and even when I'm at work I feel like I'm by myself. Like I said I'm normally content, but all the loneliness finally got to me tonight and I needed to get it off my chest. I wish I could be not lonely but I can't do anything about it because of both the pandemic and my personality, which is a horrible double-whammy. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to be alone forever and even though I'd find a way to cope with it, I don't want to end up like that.

I'm not expecting anyone to even reply to this or anything else, I just needed to get it out there. I'm normally fine being alone and even relatively happy doing it, but these last two weeks have really been rough-going. I never open up about this stuff at all, in fact I hate doing it, but everything compounded and I guess I've kept it bottled up too long.

We were always in voice chat together on discord, it was so much fun. Before that I was in a really lonely period and they really helped me get better, happier.

September comes, back to school, and I began to see that they were becoming more and more distant from me, we weren't talking as often. Realising that made me feel a little bit sad but I thought ""well it's normal it's just because we aren't on vacation anymore"" and I didn't worry about it that much. 

Now we are one week into autumn holidays, and in the past few days I had a depressive episode. None of them contacted me. None of them asked me to do anything with them. We just exchanged some text messages on some public discord conversations. I asked one of them ""why are we so distant ?"". 

Apparently I said some thing he didn't like but he didn't want to tell me about it. ""I still want to be your friend tho"". I also learned that 2 of them did exactly what we were doing back in summer (always being together in voice chat, doing the same stuff together) since the start of the week. Just without me.

702,nsfe1985,1603597663,1,"Hi, 

So I guess that I am here because I need to talk to someone, and I need a place to vent. 

After a couple of shitty years, I finally took a hard look at my life and mustered up the courage to make some serious changes. I left a job that I honestly can say I hated. (I literally cried when I got a promotion because I felt like it was a trap.) Left behind a situation that wasn't toxic, wasn't good either, and was stagnating my growth both in life and as a person. Land a dream job in a stable sector (that has been a blessing.) with a significant bump in pay and moved into a beautiful apartment in a very nice and single friendly part of my city. At the beginning of 2020, life was looking good, and I can honestly say that I was very happy, and to this day, I do not regret any of the choices I made to change my life. 


But then the pandemic hit, and well, I have been feeling very isolated and lonely since. I have two people I know pass away from COVID-19 and recently had a parent diagnosed with cancer. I understand that I have a lot to process, and I accept that sadness and maybe even a bit of loneliness while going through changes is par for the course. 

But I also feel like the loneliness that I had felt that had sparked me to make so many of the changes need to get me to this place has compounded or maybe is more present because there is less noise in the background. Plus, losing people and having a sick parent who probably wouldn't survive contracting COVID has made me super cautious, which probably hasn't helped me want to meet people. So I am wondering how is everyone else handling the shocks of this year. Has anyone else moved to a new city to start a new life and struggle to find a community or group to belong to? What has worked for you what hasn't worked for you? Any of you been lucky enough to find love?

705,Alsentar,1603596359,1,"It has been almost a year since the pandemic started, a little over a year since I entered college, and and about a year and a half since I graduated from highschool.

On highschool I had pretty solid friend circle. Not big, but so very perfectly small and fit. We were pretty tight, but it changed when we graduated.

We all went to different colleges, and I went to the one with the least number of the type of person I would be friends with. Sure, we were and still are friends, and we went out together everytime we got s chance but with the pandemic going on, we recently went from having a game night once every two months to texts on whatsapp. Sometimes I get stupid shit, and it get laughs out of everyone, or sparks an interesting debate. You would think that would be directly translated into text, but the truth is that sometimes my texts get ignored and I understand that they're not obligated to answer. Once, I was alone.

But everything changed for the better, as I found a dude that I made my friend. Pretty cool guy. Sure, he swept the floor with me everytime we played smash and me, being just a below average player always felt my serotonin hit rock bottom whenever that happened, but I was hsppy because I had him. He was my emotional anchor during my first and second semester.

But my useless peepee poopoo ape brain got too atsched to this emotional anchor, as I started to pay less and less atention to classes. Thus, I ended up having to withdraw the whole semester, while he, who is not an awful student, pass onto the next semester. I mean, sure, we were and are still friends, but now that we have no classes together, our relstionship has been reduced from going to get donuts after class and walk home together, to texts on whatsapp saying ""hey"" ""hi, what up?"" ""meh, h b u?"" ""meh"". The next semester comes in, being surrounded by strangers again, I was Once again, alone.

And it is now that I relize how clingy I am. People sre not forever, peopoe change, circumstances change, and one is suppoused to know how to yourself without the others, and I thought I learnt this lesson, but apparently I just said it out loud with my trusty friends at my back, not knowing how empty would I feel without them.

And it's not that they're dead or something, they're alive and well. But not seeing them physically for almost a year now just feels so... Lonely. I cansend them a text and they would reply, and many would argue that friendship goes over the boundaries of distances but the thing that as long as I don't see them physically, as long as we're only together by these screens, to me they're just that. Screens. Words. Meaningless visual noise.

I once had a friend that ina depressed state, when he moved permanently to another country, he decided to delete all of his contacts and block everyone he oncce knew. Everyone that knew him collectively thought ""Wow, what an asshole, after all we've been through he just deleted us like if we didn't exist"". I on the other hand remained quiet about the subject, as in my head, I understood his reasons. They wanted to still have a conection to him just by text and skype. He just wanted to move on because he knew that he would never see them again anyway, might as well be strangers again.

I used to be a super intense person, romantically or not. I would get attached to people, try to talk every day, just genuinely care a lot to the point it hurt. But, of course, I was always the initiator, on the outside of the friend group and tolerated but never wanted around.

Over and over again I'd just disappear. No one would care, and I'd hold on to thst fact that no one cares I'm gone despite being around every day.

I have online friendships that have carried on decently and checked in more often. The most persistent of which, who is lonely and clingy like me, moved to town and we're now dating. The others...

717,PancakeFoxReborn,1603589621,1,"I feel whiny for posting this cause I have a boyfriend but I guess I still need to vent and ask for advice.

I used to be a super intense person, romantically or not. I would get attached to people, try to talk every day, just genuinely care a lot to the point it hurt. But, of course, I was always the initiator, on the outside of the friend group and tolerated but never wanted around.

Over and over again I'd just disappear. No one would care, and I'd hold on to thst fact that no one cares I'm gone despite being around every day.

I have online friendships that have carried on decently and checked in more often. The most persistent of which, who is lonely and clingy like me, moved to town and we're now dating. The others... They've still let me go months without checking in, but they eventually came back, albeit the relationships getting less close over time.

The only person I'm genuinely connected to is my partner, and I miss even the fascimile of friendship I had before I've drifted away.

But... It seems like I can't even manage that anymore. Quarantine aside, I feel incapable of devoting personal energy to someone.

Sorry if I fuck up my grammar or that because I’m just going to vent how I feel just now. 

I’m nearly 27 years old, I don’t know what I’m doing anymore, I don’t feel suicidal or anything I’m just fed up. I’ve lived on my own basically since I was 19 and it’s lonely as fuck recently, usually I do love my own space but at times you just want human contact. I’ve had girlfriends and stuff but it’s always ended just completely shit for me in the end, I literally haven’t touched a woman since March 2019 so that sucks, plus most woman only care about being fucked or money now days, it’s to hard to find something meaningful because everyone craves that attention. I do have a friend that I get a drink with and always chat to on the phone with etc but due to the problems in the world plus he has a kid also, it makes it quite hard to arrange something now days. So usually if I’m in a situation like this I would always go and try speak to woman try to fuck them and what not, but I can’t even do that anymore because I’ve put on so much weight since corona started and have 0 confidence. Another thing I wish I could do would be to speak to my family, I have a mum and a few brothers and sisters but my mum has just never been interested in me which is obviously shit but I never let it affect me until it gets to times like this and I feel so small. I’ve never wrote anything on the internet like this and I’ve never once in my life opened up because sadly I don’t like it, it’s just not me. I brought myself up and always feel like I should just act like a man and get on with it. I don’t have motivation because I’m only motivated when it’s something right in front of my eyes if you understand what I mean? I just don’t know what to do. I don’t even want to read this back to check for mistakes or anything because I know for a fact I just wouldn’t post it, so sorry if there’s grammar or something wrong. I’m just going to post it.",lonely,How I feel just now,2020-10-25 12:30:19

In fact, I've been incredibly isolated since I still have trouble with the native language. The distance I have from my family and friends back home has maybe alienated them from me. Not to mention my partner has become busy with work and school so I spend a lot of time in my own head. I mean I do at least have some simulation from the small business I've created. I just can spend so much time not even saying anything, doing somewhat menial or repetitive work, and chores. I type all this out and it seems so trivial, but I just keep having intrusive suicidal thoughts. I keep reaching out but I just can't seem to get anyone to care, which I know is my own fault.

I felt really alone before I met them, like I haven't found someone who actually cared about me yet. We do literally everything together... I don't think there has been a day that we didn't talk since we met. They started talking to a friend they lost contact with, and that person told my friend they like them.

I feel happy waking up next to my fiancé, I feel happy being in my safe space, under my blankets, with his arms around me and the door closed. Everything is perfect every morning, we kiss and hug until we have enough energy to get up. Still, I feel fine.. maybe a little nausea sometimes but that’s ok. I can deal with that. Then comes the part of the day that I dread the most, about 2-3 hours after I wake up.. which is going outside. As soon as I start looking for clothes, I have an idea of what I want to wear. Sometimes I get lucky and find a nice outfit right away and I look cute with my hair up.. other days, well, most days, I can’t find anything to wear. I try on 30 different things, and everything all of a sudden starts to feel like it’s going wrong. My pants have holes in them, my shirts are too tight, my shirts are too loose, I’m too fat, I’m too ugly, my hair is ugly, I can’t fix anything, I can’t help anything. I’m useless, I’m worthless, I hate myself. I hate myself. What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I get dressed like a normal person? Why can’t I just do a bun with my hair and be satisfied with it like a NORMAL GIRL?! “You need to get over it” that’s what everyone says.. nobody understands. I have the energy to go outside yet I don’t. What will people think of me if I decide to wear anything I wanted? “She’s fat, she’s ugly asf, she looks stupid” Will even my own fiancé think that? I’m pretty sure he does but he lies to my face all the time. Maybe I am kind of pretty? Maybe I’m not. Maybe I’m just ugly as fuck. As I’m looking for what to wear everything starts to fall on me... I’m gonna miss work, I’m not gonna be there on time, I’m gonna get fired, Everybody is going to hate me because IM THE PROBLEM.. why can’t I just be normal? After looking and looking I give up, I cry, I feel useless. Nobody can help me, nobody cares and nobody understands. I’m alone. And I push and push people away, I slowly start to isolate myself when I do manage to get myself outside and slowly I become more anti social, I start to lose weight by doing nothing, I start to lose my apetite.

I don’t want to live at the same fucking time. I’m tired of life, I’m tired of everything. I’m only 21, why am I feeling this way?  I try my fucking best to get out of this loop. But nothing is working. I can’t control it anymore, it’s gotten too bad. I drowned myself in ways to ignore the pain, but now it’s all here at once. Idk what to do.... I’m sorry for taking up space.

I feel like even though im a nice person who has a great character and would make a great friend very few people want to deal with me. Whenever I'm around people and we are all talking I know eventually i will get drowned out and the people would start talking to each other and nobody will listen or respond to me. I feel like i sometimes push people away because I know eventually i will be the forgotten one so to avoid it i subconsciously respond this way. I've spend a lot of years in college and only made one friend. Whenever i walk the halls no one would My whole life I've never fit in rather it was school, work or just plain oh anywhere. I've always had very few friends my whole lie. I feel like even though im a nice person who has a great character and would make a great friend very few people want to deal with me. Whenever I'm around people and we and ask me to join their club or frat and i would think maybe that even though i think i seem approachable that might not be what others think.  However, when someone needs me to donate money or sign a petition im approachable. I started grad school last year and i knew exactly what would happen and that was eventually people could get to know each other and they would form their own social groups (this out of a class of 62 students) and group chats and i wouldn't be apart of any of the groups. I've had my bouts with depressions. Anxiety is just something that can't be turned off. It can be better depending on the environment. I remember always having anxiety even as a kid and I hates the feeling it gives you but i think it was made worst by the fact that i was made fun of all my whole life for having a lazy eye. People would make fun of me just a few feet away from me as if I didn't know what was going on. I've always had people just look at me and laugh which is the worst because i don't know why everyone feels the need to laugh at me but they do. I've even went to an job interview one time and the lady (interviewer) kind of giggled at me. So for the last year its been weighing on me that its hard for me to make friends and i have  no girlfriend. If im not at school or work i have no one to talk to or hangout with and just spend all my time at home. That's why i always says just because someone isn't doing something or doesn't have something doesn't mean its because they want it that way. Anyway i started doing bad in grad school and not being able to focus or put the effort because my thinking was what's the point of being successful if i have no one to share it with. If I wanted to go on vacation or just out in general i have nobody to do that with. Only being in my late 20's i sometimes, and this is not an over exaggerate, rather be dead than to wake up every day and face depression, anxiety and loneliness face on. I often wonder how similar people with the same traits can get treated differently by the same people. Case in point michael Jackson was a charitable person and people praise and call him an angel for that. But there are many good-hearted people out there that are just as charitable as michael Jackson and do for others but they will never get that type of praise or be called an angel. I think im a good-hearted person who would make a great friend and boyfriend but yet here I am friendless with no girlfriend and someone who is always getting left out. Now I must admit even though i stated i have no friends i do have one friend but because we barely talk or hang out because as you know as you get older life changes and you don't have amount of free time you use to have it hard to match schedules up. So from a day to day prospective i pretty much have no one and its just me. The thing about loneliness is that you'll always reminded of it. When you go to school, work, etc. You see people constantly texting and their phones are filled with conversations(texts from multiple people). I can turn my phone off for a month and the only miss call ill have is from scam likely. I see and hear about about people vacationing with their friends and partners all the time. I do enjoy my me time but being able to say ok now i want friends around would be great. Sometimes i think if people know that being likeable and having friends is something of great value and shouldn't be taken for granted or if because that how their life is its just seen as life and its nothing that ever crosses their minds.

I am essentially an introvert. I am writing this to pen my thoughts down in a coherent manner and also as a shoutout to those who share my feelings. Over the last few years I have grown increasingly reclusive. It is not that I don’t have friends. I have a few of them and I believe they are genuinely concerned about me. However there is this sinking feeling of being alone that I find to be very overwhelming. My anxiety makes things worse for me often. I am super anxious all the time, almost always invariably ending up over analysing a said situation making it only worse in the long run. I often feel like I have not achieved anything of note in my life and that I have only disappointed my near and dear ones. I know that is not true. However I am unable to drive this feeling away. I have been single all my life and there are times, more frequent now than ever, that I yearn for that special someone in my life.

I wish I had more friends, I wish I could engage and be apart of things more, but it’s like when I leave it’s like I was never there. I try to make myself known but I’m again realizing my efforts are pointless. I’ve gotten no where in the past 19 years. I’ve felt more pain than I did healing. 

When I do “connect” with a person, they wind up leaving.. I only meet people through my siblings, and no one else. They are very extroverted, I’m an ambivert which means I can switch to extroverted and introverted. 

Sad thing is I could be dead for 24 hours and no one would notice... crazy how quiet people make a group of friends in minutes. I’ve met people who barely talk and have people swarming behind them. But I can’t even get a text back, or I’m constantly ghosted. 

I tried, already called a quits but what can you do now? I’ll always be in my family’s shadow, I’ll always will be a last choice, I always be replaceable, traded, I am forgotten.",lonely,Still lonely even though I’m engaging and interacting,2020-10-24 14:54:39

I love learning about new things, be it anything. I also enjoy long discussions on art, films, anime, tv shows, games, comics where we dissect scenes or symbolism, easter eggs and the likes. We could also decide on watching a movie or show or anything and have discussions appreciating their art.

I also believe I am an amazing personal cheerleader haha. We could also try to keep ourselves accountable for habits we have been trying to stick to (I for one, would love to get back into reading , making digital art and working out more often).

People are grouping together. I feel like I'm bothering the few people I can talk to. And my ambitions are far greater than I will ever be. My whole life is encompassed by this existential dread and I'm not even sure that's accurate.

Just recently, someone talked to me about their concerns in life. I comforted them. I doubt I helped but she did thank me. I scolded myself. I become so indescribably happy when I make someone happy.

I work extremely hard every day to better myself and get a shot at a D1 school (even though my grades have suffered a bit, which I am fixing). I am also an aspiring producer who, through my dad, has finally made some progress with selling my beats.

My problem is, unless the topic is football or making music, I have NO IDEA how to hold a conversation with girls. There was a girl in my math class last year who I could not take my eyes off of, but the only thing I could do was offer to help her with work, which she politely declined.

Unfortunately, this has been a very common theme throughout my life since even Pre-K. I like a girl -&gt; can barely say any damn thing -&gt; move up a grade -&gt; repeat cycle.

This has only gotten worse since I've been in high school, where apparently every girl has a boyfriend, has had sex, or just isn't in my interests.

I’m 16 turning 17 in a few months. I have just started Sixth Form College at my school. Most people I know have been out with people and been having a great time before (and even during) COVID-19.

I have not been so fortunate with my times with the opposite sex. I have never been asked out (at least not out of pity or as a dare) and I just don’t have the emotional capacity to risk asking someone out myself.

I have also been hearing rumours from my friends recently that people are taking people out on dates and afterwards are saying “We’re still just friends, right?” or some bollocks like that. This has happened to a few of my friends, and as well as me pitying them, it also discouraged me even more from opening up and trying to maintain a somewhat meaningful relationship.

However, I do try my hardest to not give up and just go about my normal life, however the more I see people in my year dating and stuff and while I’m working to my full capacity while people were / are partying, it just grinds my general happiness and therefore my productivity to a stop. 

I am hoping that this will change soon, and not because my friends see this on Reddit and pity me (that would just be the last straw tbh, considering how introverted I am). I also hope that anyone else faced with this problem finds someone that they are happy with someday, and doesn’t have to go through the emotional quarrels I have with myself everyday.",lonely,I apologise in advance for the rant that you may be reading (for those of you who read the titles first).,2020-10-24 03:38:15

I realized that I am mostly invisible to women in a romantic sense. I am not ugly or loser at all. I am successful student, I can say that I take care of my personal hygiene, I am well groomed, dress well, read a lot, have many hobbies, I can talk about many different stuff and so on. The only thing is I have a few extra pounds but I am not really obese. 

All women say that they want nice, kind guy who will treat them well and who has his shit together. Well guess what they don't. I do not want to blame others but I have started to notice that standards and expectations for a guy are becoming more and more insane. We are supposed to look like movie stars or football players, make a lot of money, entertain them and so on but if a guy says he does not want larger woman all hell breaks lose. I know you can not force someone to like you but being isolated, overlooked and ignored is really bad for me. I am wondering what am I doing wrong every day.

What's the point?"" Not to mention the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and everything, which only makes things even harder.

Hearing other people talk about their best friend or their friend group(s) makes me go a bit loony, especially when they talk about how close they are, how often they talk to each other, and so on. It's not helpful to compare myself to others, but when the word ""friend"" is like the 200th most common English word in the dictionary, you can't help but hear that word so often.

They wrong you in every way you can think

You fight on your own, you’re the definitive host
alone in this fight they want no part
And against your belief, your success won’t make them start

Start to be there with a burning hand
There’s no such thing as the holy land
A smile is found in the adrenal gland

So I’ve been thinking of what to say to my tattoo artist at the consultation if he asks me why I’d like a tattoo in an area that would affect job prospects, and the answer is as simple as this. Non conformity. it would force me to be extra motivated as well as putting me in a position where I’ve no choice but to explore my creative side and find my creative passion and earning an income from that, and honestly that has always appealed to me so much. What’s the alternative really? Get a boring bullshit 9-5 office job where at the end of the day I’d come home to a frozen meal dinner? I can’t do anything fulfilling like starting a family, my genes are trash. My wife would be giving birth and then out plops my baby in a wheel chair and knitted green quilt. And then I’d just be in this fucked cycle of existential dread where I’m used to the routine of coming home from my office job and interacting with my weird child and eating frozen meal dinners until my 40th or 50th birthday where I finally decide to sit in my garage in the car with the windows rolled up blasting Metallica or Coldplay while I inhale exhaust fumes. What kinda life is that? And not to mention the fact that my wife would probably be fucking the mailman the entire damn time. I just don’t really see any downsides to this really, I’d have beautiful and meaningful artwork on my skin, I’d get to truly express myself and I’d get to turn my passion, once I found out what that is into a fulfilling source of income. the thought of following societal norms for the sole sake of fitting in makes my skin crawl, what is the point of life if you’re not living the sort of life you want to live?

I was quite a popular person at my previous school however before joining the new school I was diagnosed with depression and found it very difficult to make new friends. However over time I became closer with some people and could say I had around a handful of friends.
On the bus back after the day we were playing a game called “Psych!” and we were playing “the truth comes out”. The game basically gives a name of a person then other players have to write a answer and the other player vote for their favorite answers. When my name came up I was worried about what people would write as me as not many of my friends were there but many of their friends were. Once everyone had written something my heart dropped as about half of answers were about how no one liked me and that most people just spoke to me and acted as a friend because they felt sorry for me.

almost a year ago I created my website companions.love in an act of sheer loneliness and also posted it here.

Back then I implemented a chat with quite a few features, with technology that's absolutely not meant for it. Somehow it worked (and it's still there), but it turned out a chat app burns out really quickly, as in, people stop caring. Besides, there are much better solutions for this, like discord, which don't go up in flames when there are 20 people online. 

However, today I finally gave the page another design rework that emphasizes what it has always been about: the world map on which everyone who is online is a colourful dot.

It's a place where you can just go to see someone else ""being there"", without necessarily having to interact, and it's quite beautiful to look at once there are a handful of people at the same time.

But until then I have no solid goal or plan apart from getting my driving license from now til 2020 September.

I’ve always felt pretty lonely but this year really does take the cake (seriously I have not talked to my ‘friends’ since March apart from the occasional texts or snaps) but I know that I’m not even at peak loneliness yet since now all of my friends have moved on, not that I was that close with any of them anyway. They’ve all moved out of town into their uni places and I’m the only one still here. We’ve all already stopped talking.

So all in all, I have no job, no friends, no SO and crippling anxiety. I spent my 18th at home which I didn’t mind since I had the excuse of a pandemic but come 2021, I don’t know who or how I’m going to spending my 19th birthday.

I think everyone find me boring and dull, when I meet new people with my friends I can see that they are more interested in my friends than me. I met a lot of people during summer and I hoped to get closer to them but it didn’t happen. They tell me they like ma a lot but they do nothing that would show that they want to be any closer with me. They don’t invite me to the parties, they don’t text me etc.
Today I had a really shitty day that made me think that I should actually give up and stop going out again. Someone texted me if I’m around and I was like!!maybe they want to meet but they just asked if I can buy them cigarettes. It’s always like that, someone text me or ask me if I can come to the caffe but it ends up they just want me to buy them alcohol or cigarettes. Sometimes they ask me if I want to join them (if it’s alcohol) but it’s more about not being so obvious in using me. 
Another situation: I was sitting in the park and two guys we sometimes sit with came up to me and asked if I can give them a cigarette, when I told them that I don’t have any they just said goodbye and sat on different bench. If my friends were there they would stay and talk with us but since I was alone they weren’t interested. 
I notice this more and more, people just greets me when they see me and they go off with whatever they were doing but when my friends are with me they stay for a quick chat or something.
There is a little hope in me that maybe it’s my attitude, I can be really distant and cold to people I don’t know well because I’m shy and stressed. So sometimes I tell myself that they like me but maybe they are not sure if I do so they act like they act. I think it’s kinda toxic thing to think for me tho. I still hope to befriend some people and I get hurt like every week because it’s not working. I should give up but I can’t. 
People often say that I can’t complain about no one doing anything to be my friend if I don’t do anything as well, but since the beginning of summer I met like 30 people and I think that only ONE of them ever texted me. How of all of those people only one did the first move. There is no way they like me. 
School is already closed, soon there will be another lockdown in my country so I won’t have the chance to meet anyone accidentally. Everyone will forget about me, including my crush with whom I never been able to develop deeper relationship than saying hi and hanging out only if our mutual friends are with me.

Everything was well and we were always me my best friend and another friend from high school. and that up until a few months ago where my friend and my best friend started hanging out with two kids from another class who id prefer to the ""cool guys"" me and my friends were never nerdy or the ones being bullied or something we were pretty popular but i really didn't like these guys cause they just didn't seem right to me they always hanged out with some girls who some would prefer to pretty but it want like they were everyone's crush besides i just thought they were dumb. me and my best friend kinda always were thee mature ones and not to sound arrogant but ""intelligent"" the other friend of our 3 guys group wasn't like that but that was ok he just was another kind of friend. btw that was the reason why we were best friends we were super similar and i just liked him because he was the one i could talk too in a more mature way. now the ones from the other class were exactly the opposite they are dumb and make stupid pervert jokes and talk about dumb things make gay physical contact(but not because they're gay don't get me wrong my problem wit this is that they do it to make fun out of gay people) i really don't get what he likes about them but since that we don't talk much anymore cause he's always with that guys. he's been nice to everyone but with me, he's just weird and i hate that cause i don't wanna loose him but i think i already did. yesterday i took all my courage and asked him if he wanted to meet sometime since we haven't done it for a long time, he said that this week he doesn't have any time but net week he would like to! now the thing is how i said before i know for a long time and that was always the thing he said when he didn't want to meet with someone i also know because he told me multiple times so i was a bit sceptic but didn't really think about it too much and was pretty happy. now the thing is that today i sat besides him and heard how the guy from the other class asked him if he wanted to meet tomorrow and he said yes n problem. at that point i was very said i got to two other friends i talked to sometimes who actually are the more nerdy/weeb kind of guys i noticed that they weirdly vanished every time i got to them for the last few days and that one of them often asked the there one if he could come to the toilet with him when i got to them. anyways i thought that i was just imagining it and just kept hanging out wit them, bt after the thing with my bf happened i got to them to get my mind off and saw them talking and walking with a group of girls so i joined and talked wit them after 3 or 4 seconds i joined them noticed that my two friends were drifting off behind the group slowly and when i looked for them they were running away. at that point i came to them and confronted them they didn't say anything and after asking again the friend who always asked the other one to the toilet (who basically is , known to everybody, the worst liar in the world) lied about talking about anime or some shit at that moment i was completely shattered and just walked away with a ""whatever"". so that's basically my story I'm feeling the loneliest I've ever been right now. I don't have anyone to talk to, i don't want o take with my parents cause at home is the only place where i have so much positivity right now and i don't want to ruin this place too that's the only place where i feel safe right now. i guess I'm just searching advice and maybe some love you can dm me if you want and yeah that's basically it, I've always felt anxious and that's normal to me but I've never felt that lonely so yeah, in the last couple of months i think I've become bit socially awkward and i don't like it i REALLY have to get back on track cuz I'm feeling so fucking depressed and lonely right now and I'm in fear for tomorrow cause i don't know what to do in the break so please help me.",lonely,I'm 13 and im really lonely right now (please read the post),2020-10-23 05:04:12
932,ray-red13,1603389783,1," 

I don’t know if I’m ever going to share this letter with thousands of strangers. It was tough sitting in the corner of my room and putting my suffering into words. What I’m writing right now is a part of me, the darkest one I may say. The one I’ve been running away from since a long time ago. And here I’m today, sharing it with everyone out there who might relate or who might need it to heal and feel that they’re not alone. I’ve chosen to write this today, after hesitating a couple of times. I decided to face my reality, my past, my future, and my fears with what I love doing most, writing. As Jerry Gilles says “Confront your fears, list them, get to know them, and only then will you be able to put them aside and move ahead.” So here it goes.

 I’ve never felt safe being home, or shall I call it, being in my “house”, because home is where you feel safe, and I don’t. I’ve always been terrified of being near my father, his hug was jail to me, his touches were thorns, his voice sounded like the monsters underneath my bed. As a child, I remember him beating me up for silly stuff, not paying attention, being too noisy, and any silly acts that would cross your mind. Then I grew up, and so did his abuse, matters became worse. There’s so much I want to say when I mention “abuse” but I don’t want to spend my whole life focusing on the abuse and forgetting to heal. I even remember apologizing after his abuse, because for a long time I went to bed blaming myself for the abuse and continuously convinced myself that I “deserve” it. My dad used to be my hero, then I realized, heroes don’t exist.

I threw this letter in my closet for two weeks. I guess I was triggered . Then I took a deep breath, gained my power again, then continued writing.

Growing up in this house I always questioned God about why all this was happening to me, I prayed, hoping someone was up there listening, I mean, there had to be. I needed a shoulder to cry on, instead, my hands fell on blades and pills. Suicide just felt like my destiny or my exit door out of this hellfire. I desperately needed anything to relate to, a song, a book, a quote, a movie, or even a person. I needed to hear healing words, anyone to let me know that the sun will rise, and that the winds will heal my wounds.

 If my destiny was a person, I’d ask her why out of all people I had to be the chosen. I’d ask her if there’s hope or if I’ll ever survive. I’d ask her if one day I’ll have a family of my own, and a place where I call home.

 After all the ups and downs , the hell and the heaven, the rights, and the lefts, I’ve been diagnosed with depression, Bpd, PTSD, just two weeks ago. I take antidepressants when I’m only seventeen, spent my teenage years dealing with trauma rather than being a normal happy teenager, and fall in love. I wonder where I’d be now If I was a normal teenager who didn’t have to look at the mirror and feel guilty about being born. Or who wouldn’t consider her diary as her best friend or put down any chance of love, because I’d never let anyone in my darkest memories. Maybe all I need is an apology to heal, I hope one day I’ll get one. So for all you out there dealing with any type of trauma, you’re not alone, you’ll survive, you’re strong. Just hold on. I’m not a survivor yet, but I’m a warrior, and so are you.",lonely,Take a min and read it,2020-10-23 05:03:03

\- I  don’t know… I think I’d like to say only that they should learn to be  alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think  one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come  together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This  desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate  symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how  to be spend time with oneself. That doesn’t mean he should be lonely,  but that he shouldn’t grow bored with himself because people who grow  bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem  point of view.

If you are unfamiliar with Andrei Tarkovsky's works, he was a Russian director who is considered one of the greatest film makers of all time. Although he only made seven feature films in his lifetime, each one of them is a visual masterpiece. He also wrote a book about film making. called, Sculpting in Time. Among many aspects of his movies, one of them is Silence and Solitude. That's why I want you to read this.

963,devil_rockstar,1603353015,1,"New to this group and looking for some support here. Devastated by how two faced people can be. This is my story-

There is this acquaintance that I have known since 4 years, when we met through a common friend. We became facebook friends and chatted once in a year or so, but never hung out since we went to different cities. I recently moved to a new city and found out that this acquaintance lives in the same city as well. We met once for coffee and chatted for a really long time and found out that we have a lot of things in common. I don't really have a good friend in this city and I was hoping that this person finally becomes one.

Now here comes the sad part. I was recently searching for an apartment after my current lease got over. This person mentioned that he has a room available in his apartment and I took it up. I was hoping to join his social group and hang out with this friends. I started noticing a behavior in his actions towards me after I shifted to the apartment. He started acting too formal with me and maintaining a bit of distance with me. Whenever I asked him if he wanted to hang out while suggesting something, he would make some or the other excuse and not hang out. There was one time when we hung out, and my god was it so frustrating. It looked like he was hanging out, out of pity for me and not because he wanted to hang out. I thought maybe this is his nature, but then I saw him with his friends, and he was so happy and friendly while hanging out with them.

It is 12 am here, and I can hear from the wall of my room, that his friends have come to give a surprise birthday party in the living room. I was not invited to this even though all he needs to do is walk 10 feet and knock on my room.

I have always been a bit of loner, but I prefer to hang out only with trustworthy and honest people, so have very few friends.

965,thrpwoaway,1603347483,1,"so far ive been to around 8 different schools, which would probably explain a bit of my struggles to be social. but ever since 9th grade, its been not so smooth. 

usually every grade i was in school, id have multiple best friends, and it was so fun. but in 8th grade i was bullied super bad, ive been bullied a few times before but it was never this bad. not to be dramatic but i felt so embarrassed, gross and ashamed for just existing. so obviously when i changed schools, id change the way i behaved to prevent that. 

the thing is though i was afraid to talk to people, so obviously no one wanted to talk to me either. i regret this so much, because now im in 11th and have absolutely no clue how i could even befriend someone. 

ive been trying so hard, from attempting to talk to people on *a bunch* of different discord servers, apps, joining groups and in person. but nothing has ever worked. the only people in my contacts who isn't my family is my manager and moms friend.

it hurts so bad and ive been crying to sleep so much for SO LONG, i don't even know how long. i just wish id have someone reach out to me, or go to them. and knowing it's all 100% my fault hurts me even more. 

ive tried convincing myself that having no friends wasnt a bad thing, being a lonewolf sounded cool, no dealing with fake/toxic friends or drama...etc... but its too much now.

i dont even care if i had the most horrible people to talk with. i just want feel how i felt when i had someone to laugh with, tell personal things to, express literally any emotion at all. id do anything to be comfortable with a person.

991,Daalmaan,1603335751,1,"
The week before my 18th birthday I left home to study a prestigious course at an elite university in a beautiful city. I had been shy, lonely, and repressed in high school and spent the summer before leaving dreaming of making a new life for myself.

Instead I spent the following 2 and a half years digging myself deep into a hermit life where I regularly went 2-3 weeks without speaking and felt genuine fear before leaving my room. Eventually the isolation and hopelessness broke me down and I had to drop out and move back home.

Now I've recently turned 24 and am still stuck in my hometown. I eventually got a minimum wage job and sort of resocialised myself enough to feel more or less normal again, and moved out into a sad little flat on my own near my parents house.

I'm not being dramatic when I say I've never had a close friend. When I was in school I was always a peripheral member of social groups. We were friends in school but not outside. I lost what few old friends I had had almost immediately after leaving and I've never made any new ones. The people I work with now are the most significant relationships I've had in at least 6-7 years, but I don't think they consider me much more than an acquaintance. Romantic relationships have been out of the question in the past.

Now I feel trapped and alone where I am. I don't have any social circle to meet people through and feel embarrassed trying to meet new people and having to reveal how sad and empty my life has been, doubly when it comes to trying to date.

 I don't have the money to move away and start again, even if I could find a new job. I doubt if I'm even capable of going back to education. I constantly think about the past and all the opportunities and potential I squandered. I used to at least have a little hope that some day things would work out and I'd be happy and feel successful. Now It seems like I'm settling into a quiet uneventful unsatisfying life without other people in it and I don't know what to do about it.",lonely,I dont know how to rebuild,2020-10-22 14:02:31

996,Broken_Heart_Tw,1603334340,1,"I met this girl a couple of years ago, and I basically immediately fell in love. I loved the way she talked and joked, and it seemed like we hit it off. For the last couple of years, we've been good friends. We would talk over Discord (I was never brave enough to ask for her number), for hours. Around most people, she was pretty shy as far as I could tell, but around me, she would talk and laugh, and I took some pride in that. She would confide some pretty personal things to me, like how she came out as Bi to her parents, and they punished her for it. Things seemed fine, but towards the end of the first quarter of last school year, I noticed some things were wrong. She began to sleep in class, and she wouldn't do her work. Her grades began to slip, and she stopped staying after school for the club we had together. I asked her what was up, and after a little prying, she told me. Her parents had been having marital troubles for years, and finally decided to get divorced. Even before the decision had been made, her father started to see another woman. She told me so much, and I felt really humbled that she trusted me so much. 

When covid hit and we were all quarantined, I messaged her and asked her if she wanted to play some Xbox games online. After a while, she responded and said yes. For the next few weekends, when I wasn't working on online school, we would get on Xbox Live and chat while we played Minecraft or Halo. We even played until two in the morning once, beating Halo 4 in one sitting. She seemed fine over the calls, and I wasn't really worried. She said she was fine, and all I could do was believe her. After a few weeks, she told me that she had been grounded from games because of her grades. She asked me for some help with her homework, but after a while, she just stopped caring about school, and  let her grades slip even more. Her responses to my messages got shorter and eventually, she stopped responding all together.

Summer rolled around, and I messaged her on discord, asking if she had been let off of the hook for the summer. I didn't realize it, but my Discord notifications had been disabled, so I didn't se her response when she sent it two days later, and then not for like a week after. When I did, I immediately tried to respond, but I said that she had either removed me as a friend, or blocked me. I messaged her on Xbox, and after a while, she replied, saying that she had been cleaning out her contacts. I asked her if she had any plans, to which she replied no. I saw that she had been playing a game, and I asked her if she wanted to play that one. She said sure, so I downloaded it. As I started to download the game, I asked her which version I should get, to which she responded ""It doesn't matter, it's all the same"". That was the last thing she said to me, back in June. Since then, I've only sent a couple of messages to her on Xbox, but she hasn't responded. She hasn't refriended me on discord, and she's ignored my couple of friend requests. I tried to send one more a few weeks ago, and it said that there was an error, so that means that she probably blocked me. I haven't seen her at in person school at all. I feel so empty.

1007,nomad_of_the_empty_I,1603328219,1,"About a year later, she came to me and asked if I still had feelings for her. I said a bit, because I still hadn’t completely moved on. She wanted to get back together, saying that she is now ready to date. We went on our first date, and I pieced it together rather well, I think. Timed at sunset on a lakefront, casual with pizza. Thinking back on it, that wasn’t the best choice, but it was my first date and I wanted a special place for anniversaries if it ever came to it. Anyway, the date went well, and I asked if she might be interested in another one later on, and she said yes. About 2 weeks later, I called and asked if she has any good ideas for a date, and she said that she’ll think on it and get back to me. As soon as I hung up, she texted me that she wanted to break up again, saying how she still wasn’t ready to date, and probably wouldn’t be until college. That hurt. Why couldn’t she have just told me in the call, did she not trust how I would react? Anyway, that was a few months ago, and I still hurt every time I see her. I went from being fine with being single to aching every time I see a couple, and I think about what I did wrong. I know it’s a bit extreme, but I had feelings for her for years, since jr. high.

1024,DionRifkin,1603319219,1,"Over the past seven months of quarantining and social distancing, I've noticed that my motivation to take care of myself has completely diminished.  I've always been an introvert and generally have spent more time alone than one should to maintain mental stimulation and positive mental health.  All told, my day-to-day isn't completely flipped upside down in the midst of this pandemic, but my hope for a better future and the related incentive to do things that are good for myself have gone out the door.

I know I should take care of myself.  I know I should engage in habits that would make me the type of person I want to present to the world.  Among these things I should be doing are exercising regularly, cleaning my apartment, cleaning my car, spending time to learn something new from start to finish, developing plans for my future, scheduling appointments for the doctor or dentist, buying new clothes, getting a haircut, making a dating profile, drinking less, eating healthier... the list goes on.

When things were normal and when my mental health was in a modestly better state, I could generally keep on top of these things without so much of a struggle.  Now it just seems impossible.  Not just difficult, but impossible.  My days off are spent sleeping in, spending hours deciding whether I should first make my bed, do laundry, or clean the kitchen, and then dropping everything so I can get whatever meager form of exercise I have time for that week.  I feel like I have no time and yet the time I do have is spent doing practically nothing. 

I know I should treat myself better, but psychologically there is no incentive to.  I have no one to impress, and I really can't wrap my head around the idea of that ever changing.  I know if I were able to view myself from an outsider's perspective, I would see my accomplishments and my capabilities and I'd think that this person deserves a rewarding life.  But there is no outsider's perspective, just mine.  The reward mechanism is just not there and it's absolutely detrimental.",lonely,Complete isolation makes doing good things for oneself so much harder,2020-10-22 09:26:59

1047,REDbestRanger,1603306201,1,"I'm writing this as a way to vent, I suppose, so it might be long and rambly. Actually, probably will be.

I'm 32-years old. I'm so lonely that it feels like I'll lose myself to it. I've felt this way my whole life, but I can relate to this exact feeling since I was about 16. I live in Sweden. I came here as a refugee from Iraq, at the age of 5 years old. We as a family suffered in many ways, but I'll focus on myself here. I didn't realize it until much later, but growing up in a strange place never worked for me. Sweden is great, and the people are kind and generous, but it's not home, and I don't know if it ever will be. I speak perfect Swedish, and in many ways act and live like a Swede, but I don't feel like one. A lot of it is because I don't have the things that are inherently familiar; the culture of my homeland, people that look like me, people I act as almost on a genetic level, and most importantly, my own family. The few times I've gone to visit, they've treated me as the long lost son, making his return, even though we don't know each other. Just because we're family. I felt love. I felt belonging. I don't know if I can ever get that in Sweden, since I have no family here outside of my parents and siblings.

Speaking of my parents and siblings, ever since we came to Sweden, it was chaos. Parents fought, father abused mother physically, loud yelling. Traumatizing. He left the year I turned 11.  My mother is the victim of various physical and mental illnesses, so I could never rely on her for safety, comfort, stability. My older brother was a sadistic abuser, bully. I endured him until I was 23, when he finally left to live on his own. In school I was this weird kid who zoned out and acted funny. I was labelled stupid and gross. I hated going to school. I preferred to be at home, with the door to my room closed, playing video games, and later, spending time on my computer. I spent some time chatting with strangers. For what it was, it felt good. It felt like I connected with people. I was about 13 at the time. Later on I was introduced to MMORPGs, about 2-3 years later. They consumed me profoundly. Here were worlds with avatars of real people scurrying around. A world where I could be someone cool, important, a leader, and a friend. I was good at typing fast and wittily. People grew to know me and like me based on that personality, and the fact that I was somewhat strong (in-game) and helpful and kind. I was on almost every waking minute, and didn't eat or sleep to maximise my time there. 

I felt like I had friends. People would message me as soon as  I logged on. Girls in the same guild would welcome me with various sweet expressions. It's hard to put into words what it did to me. Everything I lacked in life (family, friends, love, money, belonging), I could get in those virtual worlds. I never wanted to unplug. But it couldn't last forever. I met a girl through one of those games, a girl I played with and talked to on-and-off for years. We got married and had a child. Then it didn't work out and they left, and I was back to my lonesome.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got new anti-depressants that affect the dopamine level in my brain, and they helped tremendously. I've started an online education to become an electrician. The education is short, at one year, and the particular field I'm specialising in is in high demand, and on top of that it's decently paying. That's where I am today. In about a year and a half from today I'll be employed and for the first time in my life, in control of my life, at least financially. I've spent my entire life living on social welfare, because I always felt too bad to work or study. I don't know where it will go from there, since I've never had to truly take care of myself. Although I've spent the last 5 years or so living alone, I haven't had many responsibilities, being on welfare.

My hope is that I'll be able to endure working full time, and build up the things that can be bought with money, including opportunities that cost money, like travel. I call this step ""finding myself"", after which I'll find my love. Although I can never live in Iraq, and I'll never have a network of family in Sweden, my hope is that I'll feel good enough to enjoy life with a woman by my side, and children to nurture. The kids are a bonus, because what I truly need is another person; someone who can give me physical touch, someone who can see me, encourage me, support me emotionally, someone whom I can look into the eyes of and caress. It sounds almost naïve, even to myself, how much I expect to get from just having a person in my life. But I'm not naïve enough to think that anyone can save someone else. Only you can help yourself. Other people can only support you, but even knowing this, is it too much to expect? I don't know, but right not it's part of what I need. The other part is having friends, but that's more complicated in a way. I've been lonely my whole life. I don't know what you're supposed to do with friends as an adult who's working full time. Having a girlfriend is simpler in that sense; we live together or apart, we are each other's half, we have sex, we spend a lot of time together, and the rest apart. But friends seem to need more substance. I'll have to deal with it slowly, as it comes, and figure it out that way. That being said, I can't rely on just my lover for companionship.

I’m actually evidently balding ( it’s really noticeable even from miles away ), and of course that didn’t led to an increase of my self esteem. The fact that i’ve never been in a relationship with a girl, and that i have never kissed one, makes me feel very sad. I’ve been practicing sports and going to the gym since 9 years, so i’m physically good. The main problem is my face. Plus, i never feel enough for girls: as i go to the gym and see a girl i find attractive, i start feeling sad because i think i’ll never be in a relationship and i’m too shy to talk to any girl. In italy, it works like this: guys always have to make the first move. Most of them can get VERY pretentious pretty easily too, Not easy at all. Btw, another thing that destroys me is my stuttering, that sometimes gets sorse and worse. I’m really introvert, and i like it, but i’d love to be way less shy tbh. I sometimes have suicidal thoughts because of my ossessive thoughts, that destroy my self esteem too. I’m having a psychotherapy since 3 months, but the situation isn’t improving that much. I also deleted my socials, cause i was done with all those perfect looking guys with their girlfriends and all other things.  
I’m also a bit tired of the cliche sentences everybody keeps telling me. Life is not a fairy tale.

Yeah i might be only 15 but i feel sad every day because i am lonely. I do have friends but i dont have friends that actually care about you. I do have a crush on this girl for like a super long time now.

Thing is with her, today i was talking with her because we had some time between lessons. It went alright and it was actually nice to talk with her. 

Only she said after a while because we were talking about if she likes someone that there is a guy but that “i dont know him”. I do and i was pretty sad when she said that. But i just went on and acted like i didnt hear that.

She is a girl i realllyyyyyyyyyyyy like. I never told her exactly how i fees but she knows. She is where i think about the whole day. I do have other things like hobbys and school, school goes alright so thats not a problem.

i understand that she doesnt like me and that it will never work but i hate being friends while deep inside i want more than friends. Im stuck in this shit.

I'm going to graduate from university this year and I'm so afraid of losing all my social interaction that I literally don't want to quit school like I'm currently planning to do a PhD so I can stay 4 more years with people around me. I think the things that scares me the most is that I never met a girl, never talked to a girl outside of the classroom, never touched a girl and so on. I always wanted but I don't know how to do it, like I just cannot go to a girl it feels so awkward. Since, highschool I always be around boys because girls do not like science and maths I guess.

In a nutshell, I'm lost like I don't really care I have no friends/gf but I feel like leaving school may remove the small amount of daily social interaction I have.

So I talked with her. Turns out she watches anime as well. I asked for her number, she gave it to me, we talked on Saturday, and we were supposed to meet on Sunday ""unless something comes up"", she says. After we talked, however, I noticed that they say it will rain on Sunday. So I text her that, and ask her what other day would she be able to meet, since it'll most likely rain. She doesn't reply.

Then Sunday comes and it turns out it doesn't rain, so I text her if we can meet. She replies after like 3 hours that she has something to do for college. That is already strange because you don't just receive homework or projects or whatever on freaking Sunday. She had to have known about it since at least Friday, meaning she'd have known about that when we talked on Saturday. Her saying we'll meet ""unless something comes up"" I feel like was her way of saying ""Give me some time to come up with something that'll prevent it"". Because, ok, sure, we could give her the benefit of the doubt and say she had that homework already received, but forgot to do it and remember on Sunday. Sure. BUT, I text her back asking ""Ok, that's fine. What other day can you meet on, then?"". This was on Sunday. It's Wednesday now and she hasn't replied or called or anything.

I've been through too many rejections and no-rejections-because-i-didn't-ask-because-it-was-obvious-they-didn't-like-me, just like this girl who is in the latter category. I'm done with trying. I've tried plenty.

I recently had to read a book for school that had a character say ""It's not the mouse's fault for not being a lion"", one which I feel like works really well with this sub's group. We're mice, others are lions. And this isn't a video game, a mouse can't just evolve at a certain level and be a lion because game logic dictates that.

Keep your environment clean.

The next 10 years would be nothing but suffering with the occasional big successes in between. Last year I landed a job making $100k a year. I recently graduated from Marine Corps boot camp at age 29. Lost 50lbs. Got more lean and mentally tougher. I’ve gained an immense amount of knowledge in many areas of life.

Yet even after achieving the seemingly impossible, I’m sitting here in the squadbay more lonely than ever because I can’t find the right partner for me. Either my standards were too high and I wasn’t interested, or the girl wasn’t interested in me. It’s this never ending cascade of being alone.

I don’t know what to do. Suicide is not an option. My family needs me. And I still have to accomplish my purpose in life which is to transform and revolutionize the dating industry. 

But it’s likely that I’ll end up dying alone. All I wanted was a family of my own to lead and love, but I’ve accepted that it just won’t happen for me. I don’t need pity. I don’t need advice. I just want to know that someone is reading this and understands my pain.

I moved to a new job, moved out of my parents house, and started hard working and also trying to achieve my goals as well as being social. But at some point my ""friends"" have slowly started to fade away from me. One is with his GF and another is with his new groupie (which im not invited) and others have just been giving me excuses and irrelevant arguments on why we shouldn't be in touch anymore. So all my 15+ friends were gone in an instant and i was left alone doing nothing but work, gym, home for the first year. And then came a GF into my life! and bruh that was toxic, she manipulated me and lied to me and her family just to take full advantage out of me, and sadly at the age of 23 that was my first GF ever that lasted for 6 horrible months! Not to mention she used to abuse me and punch me if i came home tired or sick and i wasn't in the mood for sex.

Thank god that relationship was over and i finally stood up to kick her out and burned her stuff after she left me and told her good luck. Since then ive had a plan to be more social and going to concerts and manning up to go to a bar all by myself and trying my best to be as social as possible. But then came covid, and with that i went back to the dating apps (which i really dont recommend!) and to the life before manning up and yeah the gym closed to all my mass turned into fat and till today im still kinda chubby and losing muscle mass due to that, and the NYC mayor has only opened the gyms with pathetic rules only for a month. I have tried again and again to meet new people and also going on dates but i havent gotten anything besides a hookup here and there (which i awfully hated it) and ghosting's, so yeah im still charming and my heart is open to give out love and i hate it when girls see me as just a sex object or a free mealer or just someone that could give attention over the phone screen (which i hate the texting relationship stuff), and dont get me started with the whole only fans stuff that most beautiful girls try to promote their accounts and also IG and all that social media bullshit just to try and get that sweet simp money and attention because many girls just dont give a fucking shit about people these days!. So overall not the best time in my life and i believe not to everyone. I live by myself in the city of dreams (NYC) with broken dreams and tears in my dreams that i have no friends or anyone to date or even talk to besides my 2 cats that are my only thing in this world. Im at my mid 20's and within time i fell like the day where i have to tell my mom that she might not see grandkids from me would come because IDK how long i could try to keep searching where there are many women out there that dont wanna give me a chance or even people in general that i have a hard time opening a convo, at least at the gym i was very very very social and met a ton of wonderful people. But sadly its gone and im all alone here.

I started to write this down after i was trying to jack off after 2 weeks of not thinking about it and i just couldn't even get in the mood even if i wanted to, i just couldn't feel it (sorry for being so open about it). I want to feel loved and appreciated and go out and have fun and get to know more people that i could connect with but sadly everything in this city is shutting down and you see hate just everywhere, and even if i try to meet people and just meet a friend that could get me started up again so i could have someone to talk to, i just cannot get a long lasting convo no matter what or even just a switch numbers and lets go out for a drink or something. And also people on social media have became extremely toxic.

Overall i know people here like to vent, cuz i know many people here just dont have much anyone to talk to in this world and i wanna let out some steam somewhere, or even lay there shoulders on. Im still young and full of life and most of my time im just playing videogames or watching youtube and netflix or sleeping and feeling with everyday that passes im slowly decaying and dying inside.",lonely,Am I the only one that completely lost it?,2020-10-21 16:25:40

People either see me as an arrogant prick who thinks he's smarter than everyone else or they see me as a loser who only does school because they can't do anything else in life like getting laid (which is true, I'm still a virgin at 21 years old).

I wish I could go back in time and fix my priorities. I would've focused on school much less and would've gone to my local state school instead of an elite college. I would've made an effort to hang out with more social people to get actual life experience involving partying, sex, and drugs. Unfortunately, all that time has gone to waste, and while everyone else enjoyed their youths not worrying about responsibilities, enjoying relationships, and feeling loved and connected to the world, I wasted mine at my house doing my homework and burying my face in a textbook while I sobbed uncontrollably about how unfair everything is.

Today is one of those days that feel like a dream. One of those days where I'm floating through life and not actually doing anything. I ate way too much food today and that's probably out of boredom and ""self care"". But I've also thought a lot about you today. I don't know who you are, and I know nothing about you. I don't even know your gender. I just know someday we are going to meet each other and it will be a blessing. I want to set up a blanket on a grassy hill and watch the stars while we tell stories of our pasts. I want to sit in comfortable silence with you and feel the love in the air.
Since I've started my new job I've felt especially lonely. After busting my butt working hard all day I wish I could come home and no longer sleep by myself.

I recently looked at my Amazon orders, all the way back to 2012 and I can actually remember the feelings I had in that period of my life by looking at whatever item I'm looking at. It's weird.

It is also a reminder of how shit my life has become. It has gone downhill a lot, snowballed. But I feel I had become accustomed to living a shit life year after year. Just coasting. I really don't have memories, every passing year seems like a blur. The orders put everything into perspective and it's quite shocking how I got to where I am.

Few examples, in like 2012 I bought books I never read, still in my book shelf. I feel like I've tried to read but ""couldn't find the time"" which is bs of course. 2015, I bought a glue gun to make a prototype of a product that I wanted to start a business on, I haven't started a business... In 2018, I bought a present for someone I love, who I have a bad relationship with and I'm wasn't sure why (you know them ones where you feel a certain way about someone but can't figure out why)... I remember having an argument with the person around that time and I was in a bad mood for a few days. I bought a business book in 2014 and I haven't started a business...

You see the pattern. I guess I never really could pinpoint why I became the person I am but there are a lot of indicators there. I also found some emails about something I was doing but quit / never tried. I always intended to do stuff but never followed through.

I guess, (I say I guess a lot ) it's never too late to learn where I went wrong but I wish it was sooner because I wasted a lot of time. Ive printed those out and stuck on my wall to act as a reminder to never make the same mistakes again.",lonely,Just reflecting on the past...,2020-10-21 07:22:39

1142,Aizxh3458,1603210045,1,"Going to college on the first day of my last semester after the pandemic subsides in my country. Honestly, I feel scared and out of place when I entered the school. Everyone's literally gathering in groups, waiting for other friends to arrive in front of the school gate. 

Meanwhile, I ducked my head in the crowd and went straight to my new class. Seeing people chattering happily and making plans before class starts ache my heart. Seeing people in their cliques made me feel alone and isolated.

I see my classmates being pals with other classes. They met each other during internship and become closer. Meanwhile, I sat in my seat, staring at my phone to hide my discomfort. 

Anxiety creeped up on me that I wanted to throw up. During class, peers walked around, helping one another and asking questions. I had to ask the teacher as he was my only sole helper in my new class. I knew nobody execpt one of my intern mates. She have a friend in this class. I didn't want to intrude as she and her friend animatedly talked. Plus I don't know her social circle well.

When the teacher announced there will be a group project, my heart stopped.

I hate the term project. The teacher was so kind to give the class freedom to choose while i had a mental breakdown. 

Being lonely in this class affected my self esteem. I was ready to give up the course but since I am close to graduating, I have to tolerate for the certificate.

Now you may say, go to a person and asked whether I can join his or her group. After losing my clique last year, I have lost the confidence and trust. I didn't want to get hurt again by the same experience. 

I wish school was online learning this year. I hate coming to class, feeling like a lowly person. It's affecting my mentality that I was on the verge of tearing my hair out.

1143,WomanBeaterMidir,1603209532,1,"Currently sitting around listening to a virtual lecture until the instructor makes a mere mention of something being on a future exam.

I really don't know at this point. After years of slowly falling out with friends, I only just recently regained the social confidence to just reach out to people with similar interests.

Yet, when the previously dissipated anxious bouts and depression start flooding back, it all begins to fall apart again after a prolonged period of busy days filled with work and coursework. Thinking the best of current relationships turns to fading away and thinking ""Yeah, they probably don't want to talk to me right now. They have other friends to keep them company.""

It's always the same. Everything seems fine for a while, we connect, find that we share a lot of interests, can't stop thinking about them, then it breaks apart. I make promises that I can't keep due to a terrible schedule, become too ashamed to show up afterwards, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of going back to being alone.

It's as if everyone I met has no comprehension of being utterly alone, with nobody to turn to. They always have people in their circles. I simply don't get how they do it. People have these tight-knit comraderies and yet I can't even last long enough to establish a friendship without silently falling apart into an emotional mess. There are even times when I'm so null of emotion that I appreciate spite just as much as mutual reciprocation, as odd as it may sound. I'd rather be hated or disliked than be alone since it at least feels like an honest emotion.

What the hell do I do? Take another year-long reprieve from trying to make friends and try again when I'm seemingly ready? Attempt to rekindle the relationships that I've strayed away from?

At 23, it's as if I already tossed aside the years that I should have spent resolving this.

1156,SpecialIndividual271,1603189278,1,"I am so starved for emotional warmth that I usually behave like a dog, traumatized if kicked, and completely all over people if I am treated nicely aka like a basic human being. A girl has to sign in on a computer in my room, my first thought is ""She's the one."" A coworker tells the group that she broke up with someone, my whole view of her flips from ""cool person to talk to"" to ""SHES THE ONE DUDEEEE"".

On the flipside, I manage to be quite the entertaining individual. i have learned to make people laugh with situational comedy or abstract scenarios, stuff that people wouldn't usually come up with. However, it feels like at work people enjoy me as a distraction, but as soon as work ends, no matter how loud they laughed, if I made them tear up or whatnot, I am dropped like a toy until the next day of work starts.

i offer to pick people up for work too, hoping one day when I drop them off they might say ""wanna come in for a coffee?"" but it just won't happen. We laugh a lot on the drive, its really just a great time, but then they get out of the car. The door opens, they get out and the familiar cold takes their place, fastens the seatbelt and takes me for a ride. 

I don't judge them. Instead I judge myself. I feel like there is something about me that draws people away, even if they wholeheartedly laugh, not out of politeness, but simply because we're having a good time. it feels like something about me warns them to stay away regardless of how much they are enjoying my company.

I look at myself in the mirror. i never liked the way my eyes looked. it's not the color or the shape, it's the way they seemingly hunger for things to stare down.

I started school as the outsider. Being friendless isn't all that fun though, so I looked up to the funny guys in class and adapted their way of joking around. It was a lot of trial and error, honestly. I went to school with these people for 12 years and its safe to say that I surpassed them as the class clown. I was busy perfecting my role as the entertaining factor of the lesson while they grew up into functioning social adults.

All that social environments have taught me are anxiety, pressure, hostility in the form of bullying, words that surprisingly pierce your oh-so-hard shell and hit right home, leave you breathless and paralyzed, so after school I would usually go home and play video games alone or with other people (where I would once again get a chance to be the weird funny guy).

Now that I am 21, I feel like an unfinished building. I feel like the front of my house looks nice, cozy, inviting, while the back is open, no windows, naked wood, with the wind dancing through the gaps in the brick walls, singing a song to underline the many missing parts in my being.

It doesn't help that at this point my self-image looks so fucked up that I don't feel like I belong to anyone. When I see girl out with her friends or have a chat with someone, I imagine me between all of them and think: They don't deserve this burden. They think I'm a nice person but all I actually am is a rusting car, ready to fall into pieces right after the money crossed the counter and the thing is sold to some unsuspecting soul.

The worst is probably the fact that the usual choice is to hide all of this, my sad side. Even when I am jolly me and make people laugh, I can't mobilize people to reach out to me for more than necessary, so it would be a complete disaster if I was actually honest about how weak I actually feel, about how confused I am about life and who I am.

i sometimes feel like I am not the man I see in the mirror. in these moments, I feel like the boy I abandoned at the start of school, the boy that is waiting for his older shell to bring him some friends to play and laugh with.

Oh well this became quite the tantrum.

I wouldn't say I'm bad looking or anything, but I wouldn't say I'm good looking either, I'm just..... ""Eh"", I guess. I haven't got the most confidence in the world, and I've been working on that, but why do I keep finding myselfback on this head space? 

I also feel like I just got this aura around me of ""this guy is just awkward and weird and annoying after 10 minutes"" 
I'm currently sat in my dorm room, kinda fighting back tears, just wondering why I'm lonely. What makes it worse is that my uni isn't letting us mix with other households, which I completely understand, and usually I'm fine with it all, I have been all me life after all, but I don't know, I've been like this for a long time, especially since I turned 18 and realised just how alone I am. 
And lately when I'm watching a film, an anime, TV show or whatever, I just think to myself ""I wish I had somebody to watch this with and cuddle up and have pizza or ice cream together"", I want someone I can talk to, someone who can rely on me and is comfortable talking to me when they feel down or just want to chat about whatever, and vise versa. 

I just want to be somebody to someone.

I don't want the world to see me, I don't want to be liked by everybody, I just want to be somebody to 1 person, that's it, that's all I want, I don't want the world, I just want that 1 person who can be my world. 
All my life I've been the ghost in the back of the class no one really acknowledges, that name on a register that's just there to be ticked off, I'm just..... A ghost, that's how I feel, I've always been a ghost (and not the cool kind from Ghost of Tsushima unfortunately), I'm that weird geeky guy who likes all things film, anime. TV, a gaming and music, but yet no one really cares about. I don't really get notifications from anyone, at least none aimed at me specifically. 

I also just feel like ""who would ever want a guy like me?"", I'm alright looking, not the best, especially since I lost a lot of my hair (which has really knocked my confidence), I'm not muscular, I'm just skinny (slightly underweight, due to anxiety), geeky, not really all that interesting, autistic (not severe, I have high functioning autism), and incapable of really talking about anything outside of my interests, because I don't know how to, people say I'm smart, but I don't know if I really am, depends on the subject I guess, and weird, and not the most confident (I'm working on it), and I'm not the best at reading social ques, and I'm not the best socially either. But I want to be better, and I'm working on it, it's just hard when you get a day like this you know? 

Man, but I do hope one day I'll find that person who I can love and cherish and who will love me back, and somehow not get tired of me or get weirded out by me, maybe we'll both be absolute weirdos who knows? 

I don't really know why I'm posting this, or even wrote this, I guess I just want to get my feelings out on something in a bid to try and feel better. Sorry for venting to all of you. I guess I also needed to do something to stop these tears from coming out, although some people say it's best just to let them out, but I don't know anymore, I guess I just don't like crying",lonely,Who would ever want me anyway?,2020-10-20 01:46:49

To be able to find someone whom you're genuinely interested in learning about who they are, knowing when they feel lonely, sad, happy, ..even horny. To know the intimate details about their lives, and find that genuinely interesting, intriguing, like a mystery unfolding.. how nice is that.

Recently I have this odd fantasy to be a silent observer of a stranger's life. Like that angel played by Nicolas Cage, watching the girl he likes, knowing what she feels, and thinks in City of Angels. Not in a creepy way ofc, but it's like, reading a story, or watching a movie, but in this case it's all real, intimate, and filled with raw and genuine emotions.

1172,hazehowlingwolf,1603109641,1,"In 99' when I was a kid, I had problems making friends. It was lonely at school, them at home while my mom was working. The only place I could really be free, had importance and be strong to do things, was in videogames.
My step dad always showed at my room at night for years, just to say how much of a failure I would be, standing there alone playing that crap.
2006 I moved to another place to live with my dad, I was happy cause I could be with him, until his new family yews at his back saying things like ""Im suppose to go back where I belong"", so even moving to another parent I was alone yet again.
At school I met that girl that made me want to create my own family. I started running after what I believed, challenged my limits and even faced my father's new family that rejects me every day. We dated for seven years, just so she cheated on me with two different guys in college.
Since them, I was labelled a bad person, cause no one believed a cute girl could do something that bad, ""the problem must have been him"" they say.
I tried my best to make them happy, the people whos important to me... best friends, family, even not blood related, only to be discarted when its convenient.
Today I still have friends because they pity me. I work at night and dont like to go out much because... you know how it is to go on a place full of people, like a mall or something, you sit there looking around, and notice how lonely and worthless you are? Why do this to myself? ""Just go back to your house and play video games, at least there you're doing something good, even if its for NPCs.""
All the few relationships I had taught me that I'm a bad person, cause thats what they say when breaking up with me. ""You dont like going on clubs? You're the worst boyfriend!"", ""What? You cant aford a expensive dinner every night? Dont ruin my rotine!"", ""You're not going? Guess whos gonna date a cute guy there!"".
People always preach about ""you gotta love yourself"" on facebook and other social medias, how can I do this if whenever I see myself in the mirror I see someone who needs to disappear? Someone who nobody would lift a finger to help?
I always feared to be alone, and today mark 3 years that I'm alone, and every place I turn theres people talking bad things about me. 3 years of waking up, go to work, and go to sleep, all day with my mouth shut.

1174,surrealgarbage,1603107382,1,"So I’m a girl in grade 11 and I’ve never had my first kiss or been in a relationship. I know I’m still young and have my life ahead of me or whatever but the loneliness still feels so real. It’s really weird because during quarantine I kind of got to know myself better; I worked on myself, improved my mental health, started dressing the way I wanted to and became much less socially anxious than I was before. I even talked to new people and made new friends somehow. I did basically everything people tell u to do when it comes to finding a relationship, all of the “be yourself” and “put yourself out there” bullshit, but still nothing. I recently hung out with a guy one on one which I normally would have been terrified of, but I wasn’t, I was myself, I talked and kept conversation flowing as best I could. There was even a moment I thought he’d want to kiss me? But no, I asked him later if we were more than friends and of course, he told me it wasn’t like that. Idk. It just feels odd. Because I feel like I’m doing everything right and there are just no results. All of my friends have so much experience with guys. I remember taking that stupid rice purity test online with my friends and my score was so embarrassingly high compared to the rest of them I literally started tearing up. My friends compliment me and tell me I’m cOoL but I swear it’s just girls being nice to girls :/ If I was actually the interesting person they say I am wouldn’t I have found someone by now? And I’m not even trying to sound full of myself but I know my worth man :/ I know I’m not ugly and either way I’m a lot more confident in myself than I was before, but still I guess I’m just broken. I feel like guys never see me as an option. I don’t know what it is about me. I feel like I’ll always be the girl in the background in a guy’s eyes. Maybe it’s the way I present myself? I dress alternative but that kind of style has been trendy with teens my age lately?

I have helped countless people over the last few years especially during university - advised them, encouraged them, helped them yet when I need help and support today, there seems to be no one around. At best, I have only got two people looking out for me at the present moment.

1201,Dependent_Divide_456,1603082162,1,"I've always wanted to express these feelings, but I have nowhere to vent them. I'm a man in my late 20s, and I don't recall a time in my life where I've had any complete control of my life's direction despite the normal optics. Growing up I was very athletic, heavily involved in school &amp; the small town I grew up in, ""model student"", first to graduate college in my family, and now have a decent job and live on my own. However, much of that was never at my discretion and has created a heavily, internally conflicted life which reads like an old naturalism novel.

I feel much of it starts with the fact that I was born before my parents were married, and I was probably the only reason they married because of the strong Christian backgrounds of their parents (and then those beliefs were heavily pushed onto me). My childhood wasn't social as I mostly spent time with my largely extended family or babysitting my mentally disabled sister when my parents were working late. I feel this is heavily a reason why I've had much difficulty making friends with others because I'm stuck with the same people over and over.

Many of my activities and interests were those that my parents wanted me to pursue, and not what I wanted to do. I can't tell you how many times I expressed interest in trying something, and my parents spent forever talking down the idea. I remember many times when my dad wasn't happy when I wasn't doing something sport related, and belittled it. Even to this day my parents ridicule when I pick up a new long-term hobby or interest, and this also is a toxic trait of their relatives. Anything that someone seems to do to get ahead or better their life is degraded, and this has created a pathological sense of guilt or shame whenever I do something positive. I never felt any dopamine urge when I received awards or congratulations, just guilt.

The same thing can go for relationships. I've never dated despite many opportunities organically &amp; from others wanting to set me up, but it's due to many reasons. The same thing can be said for dating or thoughts of attraction as any positive push in life; I just feel guilt and shame when I'm attracted to someone. Of course, these negative thoughts then roll into a decade plus of self hate and low self esteem. I'm also deeply embarrassed of introducing anyone to my family as I'm highly aware of how they could push anyone away with their demeanor.

I also feel entrapped because I worry about my sister's future. To be honest, I probably would have greatly separated myself from my family long ago if my sister did not have disabilities, but I'm the next in line to care for my sister when my parents are gone (and, yes, it's legally tendered). I only travel home because my sister frequently misses me, and I don't know how she could process a world without me (which is the same feeling that has prevented me from taking my life many times previously). This also has made life extremely conflicting for me because I don't know if I can ever truly be able to seek a relationship or life of my own as I will eventually one day need to drop everything to find a way to care for her. I feel it would be greatly disrespectful if I ever did find a wife and have kids that I would have to deprioritize them for a time after committing to them.

Carrying this guilt has been immensely overwhelming, and this year hasn't made it any better. I was for once optimistic to actually try to separate myself a bit from my family and take control of my life. I took a job in a city I adored (after leaving a job for a highly reputable company in a less than desirable city), and hoped to try to finally build a social network and begin dating. That was less than a month before the pandemic started, and now the only people I have to contact are my family and relatives. I've coped being alone for a long time now, but this year was just a punch in the gut as I briefly saw light at the end of the tunnel before it collapsed in on itself. I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts before, but this year has amplified everything as I'm stuck in the same rut for another year plus. It just feels like my ideal life is dangled on a string in front of me, and pulled away as soon as I almost attain.

Anyway, if you took the time read all of this, thank you. If you ever have a kid of your own, please allow them to explore their true selves to a healthy degree. Be a supportive, emotionally understanding parent and help them understand their thoughts and feelings without instilling negative ones. The gift of guilt is not a gift, but a curse.",lonely,"I want of life of my own, but I feel trapped because of the guilt of and for my family",2020-10-19 15:36:02

Just got a lecture from my parents about my future and I got to say its not the best. I am the odd one out of my whole entire family line. From what I see that is. My parents criticize me about my personality like why am I so quiet, why won't I speak up, etc. only my bad side. How I won't get a job and just plain dumb. They compare me to some of my relative and said that if they know English or if we were still in our hometown that they will do a better job, etc. Then my brother also keep saying somethings at me and its not very kind. It was a long lecture and it was mostly just yelling and such at my uselessness. My dad keeps speaking super loud and then my parents shouts at each other. This is probably the problem, they were gonna divorce each other when I was little probably around 9 or something. I feel like I am the cause of all this. Got to apply for a job and already they are saying I am trash, ngl I stink at talking. Going to find a job tomorrow with my dad, that's what my mom said, and hopefully is goes well, knowing my dad, he is gonna be piss if I don't speak and such. I have social anxiety and is being peer pressure. This is gonna make me even lonelier either way.

That's about it. Let's see how it goes. If it goes well, I will be back here chatting and replying to you guys.

Since  this whole covid thing I've been living a complete solitude life. And  I hate it. It's time I meet someone preferably local to talk to and do  things with. I'm not a perfect looking guy I have my flaws. So if you to  do even better. I'm a laid back guy who tries not to take life too  seriously. I'm a smart guy,well traveled (globally). Im lonely as hell and its really getting me down.

1247,randomdudefromweb,1603059381,1,"I graduated from college two years and moved to a new city for a job right after that. My job had training for college hires so I made friends that way and eventually found a friend that I’m now a part of. They all have known each other for years before I came in and lately I’ve been feeling very left out of things. Like I’ll hear about something they did that I was never invited to. Lately it’s mainly that I see them all jump online to play video games and I’m rarely invited to join. I tend to join myself and then it’s fine from there but I feel like I’m a tourist not part of this friend group. Another example, one of them is getting married soon and we had an impromptu bachelor party. We went hunting and hung out. But two of them got the groom a nice gift. I was the only one out of the loop so when the groom asked if I was in on it I just made joke about it. Like I’m glad they got it for him but it would have been nice to be in the loop. 

As I write this and thinking about other friend groups I’ve had I remember that my college friend group kinda got nuked. At least for me. I had a really close friend group. I ended up marrying one of my friends sisters. We got divorced pretty quick after I graduated. So I haven’t contacted any of them in a while. 

My high school friends are all a state or two away. Also never really in contact with them. We had a group chat that lasted a while but after Covid started it kinda dwindled. 

It doesn’t help that I live alone and currently work from home. If it wasn’t for my girlfriend I wouldn’t see another person for days or weeks at a time.

I don't have a single friend and only had my first friend at the age of 35 which lasted two years. I have literally no one i can talk to, no one who would say I am their friend.
To outsiders I must look popular. I do outdoor pursuits that suggests I am outgoing, confident and surrounded by fun people. My FB friends are always ready to say something nice on my posts so to new friends I must look normal. The truth is- I've never met any of them.
I got married once and in an attempt to not look so pathetic to my family and his friends I asked people I had only just met to be guests and maid of honor. My extended family didn't want to go and they wondered why they even had an invite. I cringe thinking about it.
Generally though, it has worked well. No one knows I'm broken and lonely. My aim was always to never let people see that I'm defective. If someone knows you have no friends and never have.... well... there's probably a good reason for that, and they walk away.
The thing is, I'm not sure why I'm hiding it anymore. No one cares about me anyway so its just me that I'm lying to now. I've been facing this more and more recently and I'm not coping well with the empty reality of my situation.",lonely,Does anyone else try to cover it up?,2020-10-19 07:46:15

Once on Tinder I didn’t really connect with anyone in there except for one girl. We both connected really fast our first 3 nights of texting. Then boom! All of a sudden she ghosted me for the following three days. I tried to get in contact but nothing. Then all of a sudden she came back, texted me, apologized, said it was due to family issues, and apologized again. I forgave her and was just happy she was back. Then we texted for 2 more days and she disappeared again. It’s now been a week since she’s said anything to me.

I know it’s not a very long time to build a connection with someone but I don’t think that’s why my loneliness is here. I just feel very neglected and unwanted right now. I feel like the world is against me. My 21st birthday was a few days ago and all I could think about is how I feel unwanted.

1268,actualperson362,1603044587,1,"I'm lonely, but I have issues with trusting people. Maybe I'm just overly critical of others, but I feel like that little twinge of an ""off"" feeling that I get from people sometimes is usually an indication that they are not trustworthy. Just recently I tried to befriend a girl at work, and I figured she was asking a lot of invasive questions because she was curious about me and wanted to learn more in order to develop a relationship with me. However, when I learned that she had told other people some of the things I shared with her I realized that she only wanted to learn these things in order to gossip about me. This is not the first time this has happened, but I guess I'm so desperate for friendship that I tell prying people personal details even when I do get that ""off"" feeling about them.  

Sometimes, I feel like these kinds of people get excited when they learn that I don't have my shit together lol. Maybe that's just my paranoia, but it's like the energy from them changes once they learn that I'm struggling a lot. I don't know. To be more specific, this strange phenomenon is from the other women that I try to befriend.  

I do want companionship, but not at the cost of trust. Sometimes I feel like people surround themselves with others just for the sake of having people around them...I'm not interested in performing, I want genuine trustworthy people that I can connect with.

And I think this is where it gets tragic. 

I’m 18 and a guy and have never had a relationship, all of the online chats and “advice for uni” stuff was saying that loads of people would be in a similar situation to me. That’s not true at all. Everyone I’ve met bar a select few have all been in relationships and all have an experience being close to someone like that. I don’t and it makes me feel so fucking lonely.

1287,moez1266,1603030551,1,"After graduating college, I found a job in a city and moved. My sister also found a job, we moved into a small, two bedroom apartment. This was the end of January 2020. I have never felt this alone in my life.

All throughout college I had a wonderful group of friends, we'd stay up all night and talk. I'm an introvert, but I truly appreciate a tight group of friends who are there when support is needed. I lived with my college roommate for 3.5 years. She graduated a semester early, and I lived alone. Even though I spent a lot more time by myself, I did not feel alone. 

Now I'm not not by myself. I have a sister who stays in her room all day. She did just met a guy online, so she sees him a few times a week. It's either Tiktok or the boyfriend. It's not the best move right now. I would be much more at ease if she didn't just meet him and spaced the meetings out. I spaced my dates out when I gave online dating a try over the summer (not for me). We're very different people though.

Even so, I can't help but think that I would feel less alone if I lived alone. It's kind of depressing having your one roommate camped-out in her room all day. Before covid, she never wanted to go out. It's like she lives her life on her phone, or has this other college party sorority life. I just find it depressing. Part of me thinks if I knew that I was living alone, I wouldn't have that. 

I was supposed to meet my old college roommate last week, but she wasn't feeling well, so we took the precaution. I can hardly wait! I need to be able to have a good conversation with someone. Back in the day, we used to talk about our day. It was nice to listen to someone else's troubles and achievements. It was nice to have someone to listen to my troubles.

But I have the last 6 years trying in vain to find a partner. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m not a creep, I like to think I’m a nice guy, and like I mean a legitimately nice person not a “nice guy”.  

I’m not the ugliest person to ever walk the world, but I wouldn’t say I’m attractive. That became very obvious when I started using tinder. That app showed me just how ugly I actually am. I feel like I’ve since adjusted my standards so that I go after women in my league. Even women that I’m not attracted to think I’m too ugly for them for even a single date.

I really feel like I have no option but to be alone. And everything that comes with that feels like a burden. Seeing all of my friends in relationships, constantly being asked by my friends and family why I haven’t been dating. My virginity. The crippling fear that I’m running out of time and that if I don’t find anyone soon I’ll be lonely forever. All of these things have been weighing on me.

I just got my heart broken by a girl I was pining after for months. She was a very close friend, I though I did everything right, but she still rejected me.

We ask two things for each  topic, (1) Your answer (2) Answers you want to be matched up with. So  we ask about whether you want to voice call 📞, share pictures 📷, your  continent 🗺️, your age, if you play games/books often, if you're  studying or working and so forth!

This  makes it super simple and quick to find people that both want to talk  to each other. You are instantly shown matched people (most people get  around 20-80 matches), and then you can send them a friend request, once  they accept then contacts details are shared with the both of you.

Good luck everyone! Any questions please ask away :)

I  try to work on the site as much as I can in my spare time, so you can  expect new features to get released as well. If you're a designer,  developer or think you can help with this - please get in contact it'd  be great to have some help and feedback.

I’m 17 years old and I have never been in a relationship with anybody romantically and it really eats at my manhood. I don’t know how to talk to girls that I like or initiate conversation with them and now that COVID happened and there is no school, I have to now initiate those conversations online on Instagram or Snapchat or something. But every time I get the courage to talk to somebody or someone talks to me I’m immediately shot down by my own insecurities and thoughts that I’m too ugly for them or something. I have friends that I talk to about these issues but the problem is that they all have a lot of experience with relationships because they are good looking people so their advice never really resonates with me. I at least try to maintain the idea that I am an outgoing person and a funny person when you get to know me but I still I have almost 0 confidence in my physical appearance. I think I have an okay style but I weigh 240 pounds at barely 6ft which I have actually lost almost 25 pounds just because I’ve gotten to the point where I just stopped eating because of my issues. But anyways I’m still fat and hate what I look like so I guess that’s the main reason I struggle with relationships. I can easily be someone’s friend but I think people find it hard to find me attractive in any way.

1398,Sponchi_,1602919405,1,"I'm asking because

For the 15 years I've been alive on this planet for the only people who have hugged me or showed any affection were my parents when I was very young. I hardly ever got any friends and have never received any hugs outside my family. My classmates are all friendly with each other, hug each other and stuff, and I'm just in the back because I'm both introverted and with social anxiety and ADHD (And I have different interests than most people I know irl so it's even harder for me to get along with others) 

I sometimes talk to some of my classmates, but they still never even say hi to me when they arrive to school. They just go to their friends and don't even notice me. One time one girl said hi to me and I nearly teared up. Every time I see others hugging and being happy with each other I get angry and jealous but I try to hide it by doing stuff on my phone or eating.

I had over 6 suicide meltdowns or more over the past 2 years due to this matter. If I didn't have my internet friends and my favorite cartoon I would have probably been dead by now. Some of them have tried sending me virtual hugs to make me feel better, but I know those can't replace real affection.

I stumbled across articles a while ago saying that not getting affection is as harmful as cigarette smocking and it decreases your life span. It sounded ridiculous to me at first but thinking about my mental problems I'm starting to believe it but I want to hear what different people think instead of what an article says.",lonely,How harmful is it to never get hugs?,2020-10-17 18:23:25

But then there’s this hellish cycle where I desperately want, more than anything, a shoulder to lean and cry on. The shoulder of someone who knows all the fucked up things about me. But I couldn’t do that to anyone. I’d feel to guilty. So I stay alone, willingly, while also wanting more and more to have someone to cure the loneliness I seem to love so much and the cycle continues.

I'm doing my best to get myself out there but with COVID restrictions and busy work schedule, it's been tough. Anyways, recently I've been writing rhymes on the train in the morning on the way to work trying to express my feelings rather than just keep bottling them up. Here's one I wrote this week that I thought I'd share. Maybe some of you can relate. 

Anyone else out there feeling like they're at the end?

Where are the other humans where music is their only friend

Artists who write about the stuff I feel inside

My brain when left silent makes a gash to open wide

A wise man once said accepting negatives a positive thing

But how do I ignore the negative, its a constant high pitched ring

It sneaks into my ear drums and slithers into my head

A domino effect leads to thoughts of ""you're probably better off dead""

My desire is to believe that things will eventually turn

And I can leave these years in the past, toss em in the fire to burn 

The hope that one day I'll be texted by friends on Friday night

That one day I'll escape this darkness and finally see the light

I need to realize that there's more to life than this city

I'm one of those geeky nerds who likes to watch movies and collect things that most people think are dumb. I wish I could find a woman who is into the same stuff but I never seem to be able to find one. It's really hard to talk to women in real life and online. I guess I'm just don't feel confident like I should be but I just find it really hard to. 

I guess one sad thing I do is I go on Twitch and like most watch some of the women who stream on there but I know they are mostly on there for the attention and money they can make. I really don't know how to meet girls or talk to them. I just hunger for female companionship that's all and not to feel so damn lonely. 

Of course me being 5'2 and 350 lbs. probably isn't the ideal guy for most women but I am funny, smart, and I will say I do not think I am half bad looking either.

I have one coworker who I can entertain actual small talk with on a variety of topics. Everyone else I feel like I'm on a different wavelength from. There's a point where small talk runs dry but there's the expectation to keep a conversation going and when I'm unable to it tends to be perceived as rude. It's not a shyness thing, I just feel the convo has ran it's course. Attempts to dive deeper into to a certain topic with people or change the subject rarely end up fruitful.

About my breakup and a joint apartment I was staying in, I was with a guy for 9 mos. about 3 mos into my relationship, I met a guy (through family) who knew how to paint, do construction, and had his own moving, bicycle, painting, and afterschool business’s. He helped me and my boyfriend move into our apartment. Hes given us money to make sure we were straight. We become good friends, and then my relationship becomes a shit fest. More arguing, more assuming, more hurt words being thrown back and forth, less trust, less dates, less having fun, less us. I noticed the change and fought long and hard, for 2-3 months almost EVERYDAY to tell him I knew something was going wrong and that i didnt wanna be with a person who wont talk to me to figure out whats wrong or how we can be better but i only ever got SILENCE, seriously. as our relationship started to deteriorate to the point where i felt as though i couldnt keep letting myself be sucked up by the four walls, i started going out more. the business guy was the only person who was there for me and treated me like a friend with everything i was dealing with this year, and my ex hated him. i gave up everything i had to be with this guy, a place, a car, a job, you name it, i lost it all. and now im back at square one. im currently staying in a van with my business friend who has stuck by me with all the crazy bs going on.

They both have made new friends and I occasionally talk to them but I don’t want to intrude their new life; they’ve reached out to me once last year actually, but when I was hanging out, I felt like an outcast.

I am still grieving over a woman I met online last summer on Interpals. She was Russian-American (I have a thing for Slavic women and am a huge Russophile) and she spoke it fluently.

I was very happy when we got to video chat that one time...Unfortunately, she ended up ghosting me for another man (after telling me she loved me and cared about me) and then gave me a half-assed apology and defended her actions when I confronted her months later.

But now I’m afraid that I’ve closed a door that I wish was still open. I am painfully lonely and I feel desperate for physical contact. Not sex, just cuddling. I want to reconnect with the newer girl, and I’ve tried, but I’m not getting anywhere this time. 

I’m so depressed and empty and I want nothing in this world other than some time holding her. But explaining all this won’t get me anywhere. It will only make me look weak and even less desirable to her. 

I’ve also tried reaching out to other past flings, and they’re all giving the cold shoulder as well, even though there’s always been good energy between us, before and after our time together. I don’t know why the world has turned on me suddenly. I feel like I’m being boxed out by the women that I’ve always been able to count on for anything. It’s nothing to do with me being too forward or emotional towards them, I can’t even get a reply from a simple “how are you?”

I just really need to be in the arms of a woman I have a deep connection with, and it’s not happening. And I don’t see it happening for a very long time. Yeah I could meet women somewhere, but it could be months until I meet one I have a strong connection with.

I basically continued the avoidance and didn’t make attempts to make any friends, throughout this time i dropped out and swapped courses a few times. I also worked a few different jobs and basically I closed myself off from everyone each time. Now I’m done with university and school and it feels like i have no chance of making friends. 

My biggest problem now is that not having any friends is my biggest insecurity. I never want anyone to find that out which means I close myself off. I’m basically stuck in a loop where not having friends causes me to not be able to make any. Has anyone overcame something like this? I feel like moving somewhere else for a fresh start and so I have an excuse for not having friends. I feel like a complete loser and as if I’ve wasted a lot of my life.

The thing is i don't feel like it's going to happen for me anymore and to be honest am not making any efforts to meet someone new mostly because i don't feel like it (i just feel like i don't have it in me anymore to try again because i tried so many times and like i ve said i ve met so many amazing girls) and in the same time i can't right now with the corona spreading all over the place in my country.

I'm honestly starting to question whether or not I'm over her after that night. I woke up in a cold sweat unable to think about virtually anything else for the rest of the day, my mind was so focused on that. I rarely remember anything about my dreams longer than a couple of minutes after I wake up, but this time is different. While I did forget most of it, I do remember a few things. It also reminded me of her in a way I haven't been for years.

It showed how truly sad and alone I am, despite seeming fine with it all, and how much I miss her. It hurts to think about her, but that's all I can do. But I don't think I would bring myself to contact her, if I could even find a way to. Which, over the course of two years, has been impossible. And at this point, if she's even still alive, isn't really my place to start trying again.

1500,Derealination,1602832621,1,"I rode my bike tonight, even though I was exhausted from walking all day in the cold. 

I kept thinking to myself, what if by sitting at home I am missing all the opportunities to bump into someone? So I put my coat back on, and got out on my bike. 

I rode until my mouth felt full of cotton. I sat at a stop sign and changed songs on my phone. 
Headlights blinded me, and a small red car honked twice. I tried to see who was inside, to young guys waving at me as they drove by. 

I didn’t recognize them. By the time I realized this though, they had already passed me. I quickly turned and watched them drive off. 
“OH NO! I didn’t wave! What if they think I wasn’t interested or annoyed by them??”

They turned into the skate park up the road, I rode my bike on the back trail to the park. Just to see if I could get a better look at them, maybe they might see me and want to talk? 

Once I got there, they were already pulling out. 
I watched them drive off once again. 
They passed the stop sign I had been sitting at. “DAMN IT! If I had just stayed there they might’ve stopped and talked to me??” 

I rode as quick as I could to make it back to the sign, but once I was there, they had already made a turn. I didn’t know which way they went. 

It isn’t until now that I realize how desperate I am for some attention/friendship/interaction. The idea of having someone over to my place tonight, or having a boyfriend, of having a girlfriend, of going on a drive with someone, talking, a late night walk, getting coffee, someone to cry with..... 
I am in desperate need for a connection. 

The problem is though, when I am with people, I put on this facade. To everyone I am happy, annoying but bubbly. They all like me, but I fail to make any friends. 
I wish I could show myself to them, but I haven’t a clue how. I wish I could talk to someone and listen to them, and become close, like I’ve always dreamed. 

Anyways, how’s it going with you bro? Lol

We loved as much as we fought, one of those things. We finally ended things in April, weeks after covid broke out. She immediately left town and met some guy in another state. 

I wasn't terribly upset by her dating someone else, and as months went by, I began to miss her. I missed her company, her affection, and our shared existential angst. We have broken up before, and come back together somehow, and I guess I thought it would happen again. I thought this week, if we get back together, I will marry her this time. 

I reached out to her via email to see if her and the cat we raised from a kitten were okay (hurricane). She said she was fine, she was actually in Portland (where we had always planned to move together), and that she was now married to that rebound, and that this was her last goodbye. 

My heart dropped, I know we aren't right for each other, that this is for the best, but I feel so crushed. I'm 30 years old, no kids, never married, found out my oldest friends were not my friends, and the woman I loved for years replaced me almost immediately.

It always irks me how blase almosy everyone around me is about relationships saying how I should just stay single and/or not have children even though at the end of the day things work out for them. Almost as if they are suggesting it's not something I should aspire to have.

Long ago I said to myself that if I ever win the lottery (unlikely but you never know) I would just remain single because my money would just bring out the gold diggers and they would only want my money and not me. Better off just paying a prostitute for my urges because at least I know what they want.

He gave me a gift that day, a stunning necklace that he had made himself, with bones that he had collected on his trips in the forests. 

I wonder now if he knew it would be the last time I saw him. 

We played music together, went foraging, talked for hours - I've never had a connection so tender and rewarding.

It felt like in every way; platonic, romantic, sexual, musically, we were on the same page. A once-in-a-lifetime person. A person who I will miss so deeply and never see again. 

We met when we were both homeless and needed somebody safe to be with. Somebody with no other intention other than to be there, to witness and hold. 

I keep playing the music that we played together, that he introduced me to. But now I'm playing it alone. 

Money can't replace it, no memory can erase it, and I know I'm never gonna find another one to compare.

I have my friends but... I never truly feel like I fit in. I feel like the forgotten one a lot - my 2 best friends always talk to me but I find it hard to explain just how lonely I feel. They’ll ask me if I’m okay and I will always reply of course. But I will always demand an answer for their own sadness. I always like my own presence and keeping my feelings to myself because the idea of being exposed and vulnerable is completely frightening but for the past couple of months, I just want someone. I have grown up an anxious person and even though I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety because I’m completely terrified of going to a doctor only to have them tell I’m overreacting, I know that this isn’t normal. But my anxiety eats up at me and my loneliness. It almost indulges on it. It takes my loneliness and makes me overthink everything and pushes me even further away from the world. I’m yearning for someone to understand this and to just know it’s an anxious and lonely day by looking at me. But we don’t live in fairytales. And I grew up on the pretences of fairytales as my escape from home. 
I’m that kind of lonely where I’ll lay awake at night and just dream of having someone who I could always go to. I imagine this someone to be warm and tall so that they can completely hide me when they hug me.
It’s heartbreaking sometimes just when I realise how lonely I feel and it hits me in sudden waves. 
I don’t want to be a burden and tell someone but I just wish I had a chance to meet the one who would make me forget everything but love everything with them.

Of the dates that I do get, these girls seem to want drink till they're blacked out, and do all sorts of drugs. Needless to say, I don't match mentally or emotionally with any of these girls.

1595,wowowow11111,1602739801,1,"Hi everybody :) 
I couldn’t attend my “virtual” group therapy session today but I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness lately so here i am.
I’m a senior at uni and I feel like I should have established strong friendships with my peers by now. It’s a really sad feeling to know people you considered good friends are hanging out without you and finding out via social media (or, more embarrassingly, through actually seeing them all out together while running some errands alone). Everyone I know has settled into their respective friend groups and I’m just stuck...alone.
I just feel so inadequate and like a second choice to everyone I know. No one reaches out to me first to hang out, with the only exception being some desperate guys who view me as an object. My whole life I’ve always felt like something was wrong with me socially and I feel like this entire year is proving me right. I know I’m boring at first but I wish people would at least stick around long enough for me to feel more comfortable with being outgoing around them. 
Living alone for the year has really exacerbated these feelings. At least if I had a roommate, I could talk to them. Considering my campus just closed back up, there really isn’t any way I can make/meet up with friends. I was also recently ghosted, which I guess is what triggered the upheaval of all the emotions. 
On a bright note, I’m thinking of taking up crafts as a hobby, maybe candle making or painting. Also, volunteering at the local hospital is the highlight of my week, as I get to distract myself from my loneliness and I love interacting with patients. But i feel like neither of these are viable replacements for genuine friendships. idk. i’m just goin thru it rn.",lonely,Lonely in college rant,2020-10-15 16:30:01

I cry about it often now as a grown woman but I never did growing up. I just don’t see how you could bring life into this world and then leave it. Even as a woman that doesn’t want children, if I did have kids I’d never leave them and sure as hell make sure the man I brought them into this world with would be In their life regardless of our relationship status.

1599,2dead2punk_2punk2die,1602732867,1," the truth is, if I were to disappear tonight none of the people that I tried to be friendly towards or wanted to be friends with would even care. I dont even know if I actually wanted friends or just the experiences that come with having them. The quiet, unfiltered back and forths. The spooky Halloween photo shoots. Driving around blasting music all the way to where we're going. friendship has always been very awkward for me, somehow performative. if they knew what was underneath, that all the sweetness and sincerity masks a ragged monster. I keep my distance because I can't bare to see that familiar fear in people's eyes that they've been left alone with a monster like me.
   I'm trying my best to change, but sometimes I get so angry that my emotions get the best of me. Even if the words are truly what I'm feeling and I'm communicating, I'm scared that I'm abusive. I realized the value of talking to a crisis counselor, but last night I went off the deep end on my lover for not answering a genuinely important question and brushing me off with ""right now you need more help then me."" I was calm before he said that.. not so much after. Well, he's gone now. Only liked my 'firey passion' as he described it when he wasn't close to the heat. 
Look.. I know I'm a fucking basket case. A big old ""yikes"" picture. a crazy bitch, with deeply seated mental illness and too high of standards for how low I've fallen.  
but for once.. just for once. I'd like to be told I deserve friends who wont leave me at the drop of a pin. People who will fight for me as hard as I've fought for them in the face of mental illness. most times now, I either view myself as an imposition in hitting them up, somebody for them to take care of or use their degree on. an unleveled imposter, posing in the guise of friendship so they can study me. I struggle with drawing the line between intuition and perception. I often walk away from people because my trust issues are so jacked that I think they'll all gaslight me, project on me, call me names, put words in my mouth, and be all around toxic. Or they'll be the opposite. Cold. Dismissive. not care about losing me. so I've grown terrified of confrontation  and end up ghosting a lot. 
I'm sorry for how all over this post is, but it encapsulates how I feel about friendship these days. 
This is where I'm at.

We were so like minded and we both mountain biked and skied and chilled together, it didn’t matter what we were doing, we didn’t have to talk all the time, we were comfortable in silence. He moved away and now I live alone in a studio apartment and my girlfriend is my best friend. I love her to bits, but I’m still lonely. I have friends but I don’t hang out with them because I don’t feel a deep connection to them like my best friend, I don’t want to just chill or go over to someone’s house, it just doesn’t seem appealing. I’d rather be doing the same thing but alone. I joined a mountain bike club, and I really enjoy it, I have some new friends, but I don’t hang out with any of them outside of the club. I just want a best friend again, someone that I don’t have to tolerate being around, just thoroughly enjoy hanging out with them. My best friend is now across the country doing the best he has ever done, he’s totally change his lifestyle and I’m really happy for him, but I can’t help to be a little mad bc I’m all alone now. I’ve never had to try to find friends, they usually just happen because I was always surrounded by people whether that be the college dorms or highschool, whatever. But now, I live alone, in apartment building full of people who are like me, introverted and don’t want to associate with neighbors. I try to have fun, I do what I enjoy, like mountain biking, as much as possible, but it’s not enough. I need a friend to enjoy that stuff with. I don’t know how to find that friend.

I’m lucky enough to have a circle of friends to reach out to when I have a free day from studying my ass off but it often feels like our connections aren’t satisfactory for me, mainly because they are more invested in their significant others or other friends than they are with me (not to say that I don’t think I’m enough). Because of that, I don’t really feel like I have a “go-to” friend and these friendships feel more like a way for both of us to pass time when *I* need company. Relationships have never worked out for me either, usually because they have all been one sided with all the weight on me. I’ve been using dating apps to find someone but no luck. Basically, I’ve just been wanting to lose myself in someone, whether it be platonic or romantic.
Last week I was hopelessly swiping through Tinder and matched with a guy who was visiting in town and looking for a hookup. I hadn’t gotten laid in a while and he wasn’t from my school so I thought why not. He came over a couple days later and we had dinner and drinks before heading off to the bedroom. This hookup ended up being different to anything romantic or temporary I’ve ever had before (and I’ve been with many people). The sex was more intimate than anything I can remember ever having. The known facts of why it was probably like that was because I crave passion and he told me he hasn’t had sex in months. Anyway, it ended up making us super comfortable with each other and he dropped by once more before he left town after texting me he loved spending time with me. The way we showed physical affection and attention to each other made it feel like we’d known each other for a while and it felt fueled by emotion, not just sex. It could’ve easily been an act, but I felt an odd sense of genuine comfort and safety around this stranger and a mutual investment in each other both physical and emotional. It made me wish I had this affection and someone’s need for my time longer than just the two nights. We had trouble saying our goodbyes because we didn’t want the night to end and we really held on to those hugs and kisses as long as we could. When he got back to his place he sent a text about how amazing the night was, thanking me for it, and then he was gone.
Who knows what was going through his mind, maybe he was really into me or faking it to fulfill a similar need for an emotional connection, though temporary. Though I loved learning so many things about him, I can’t say I caught feelings for him, but I did for his attention and affection, especially because it’s something I’ve wanted for so long. Since that night, I’ve been super depressed, wondering why things like this happen to me for either such short periods of time or never. I just want a long term and genuine connection with someone based on the desire for each other’s attention rather than just to be social and pass time.",lonely,Down in the dumps after a dose of affection,2020-10-15 05:43:54

Every single one, and I mean EVERY single one, of my close friends is in a serious relationship. So are my family members. I am the only person in my circle that doesn’t have someone. 

I’ve been single for over 3 years and I’m generally OK with it and enjoy my independence but the pandemic has seriously disturbed that peace. I live with 3 roommates, all of whom have significant others. I visit my family often, all of whom have significant others. For the past 7 months my only in person social interaction has been my family, my roommates, and their +1s. 

I cannot even begin to tell you how tolling it has been on my mental health. On top of dealing with the stress and anxiety that everyone feels during this time, I also have to watch my loved ones happy and in love. I have to live with the knowledge that they have someone to hold and talk to to feel a bit better about it all and I do not. It feels as though it’s being shoved in my face how single and alone I truly am. Of course I am happy they they’ve found their person, and truth be told I do enjoy the company of their S.O.s but it’s extremely challenging when you’re limited to your house to have that in your face 24/7. 

I’ve have countless panic attacks and anxiety ridden nights since the pandemic began agonizing over the questions, “what’s wrong with me?” or “why am I not good enough?”. I’ve spent entire days in bed listening to my roommates laugh and exchange with their S.O. while I sit and cry in solitude and silence.

Hello! My name is David, I am 20 years old and I am a student at State Petroleum University.  
I do love to learn languages - this is my big passion.  
A month ago I ordered something from an online shop and now I do play it every day. It makes sounds like magical water drops and it can literally make you feel nostalgic! Do you have an idea what this is? I can tell you or you can try to guess yourself!

I used to watch Netflix movies and sometimes I do it with my friend as a Netflix Party (well, now it's teleparty haha)  
I am not a real gamer, but sometimes I like to play some online games or very old offline. Recently I've been playing Among us, if you also enjoy this game, we can both try to find out who is The Imposter!  
I do not want to make you feel that I am a nerd or something. I can't tell for myself how active or talkative I am in a conversation, but I can make you sure that my friends find me funny. Believe them or not, it's all up to you :)

Why do I make this post?  
To be honest, I feel lonely in the last days. I've been locked in my house for the last 8 months, learning a new language. Now I can speak this language quite fluently but noticed that I have not that many friends and very little of them who I can really talk to.  
I won't say I am ugly or I have any issues that would make people pass by, not at all. Doing workout every day makes my body look athletic, one of the things that also makes me feel happier. Honestly, I used to be very popular in 10-11 grades of school. The thing is, that more than one year ago I decided to become a better version of myself. Self-improvement - that is what I found interesting to me more than walking out with people and drink some unhealthy drinks. I quit that, and now I feel better about myself and the things I do. But here's one more thing... now I feel lonely. Even those a few friends that I talk to can't always make me feel good, and they don't have to, though. They have their own lives they do live. I really appreciate their help and everything they try to do for me.

I am sorry I got off the track. I want to thank you for reading this! Feel free to chat with me, girl or boy it doesn't really matter. But the only thing I want to ask you about before you text - think twice if you'll feel comfortable chatting with me. I am a 20 years old student, so maybe if you're older or younger than me, we can look different at some things within our ages.

Not saying that I didn't have that with my family at least not really, used to have a father who's been closest person I've ever been with.

Today having one of my classmates pat me on the back after having some small talk with him sorta made me feel sadder and emptier. I thought that I kinda wanted this. I thought that I'd be happy with that and it turns out that I kinda hate that feeling. I kinda think that I can't be with people anymore. I've been distancing myself a lot. Rejecting connection.

I’m just trying to come to terms that I’ll likely be alone, relationship wise for the rest of my life. I’m an 18 year old guy who thinks that whenever I’m coming to terms with being lonely forever, there’s always something that makes me sad about it again. I’m not very desirable. I’m very ugly. I do have good hygiene and everything but I just have so many ugly characteristics that I can’t fix. I struggle with self confidence due to my looks. I’m about 6’ 2” 165lbs. Yes I know I’m thin. I never really got into weights because I can’t bring myself to lift alone. I do eat pretty good and I like to run instead. Overall though I’m not muscular and it’s obvious girls are into muscular guys so it’s not like I have that going for me. I’m more introverted and not super open about myself at first. Once I get to know a person then I’m more outgoing. I just tend to be more of a listener and laid back. I just have a more calm, respectful, chill demeanor when I meet them because I don’t want to be overwhelming and I like to get to know the other person first. It all boils down to the fact that I’ll probably never approach a girl first. I’ve been called ugly in the past, to my face. I just don’t like my chances at all if I were to ask a girl out. The thought of making myself look like a fool is not appealing to me. I know damn well that a girl will never approach me first. IF that ever does happen though, I know that they’ll have my full attention. If a girl were to show any interest in me, I’d be sure to try my hardest and make them feel special. I just probably won’t waste any time going out of my way to find a girl though.

I got married partly out of a fear of loneliness, yet I've never been so lonely in my life. So I've decided that being alone is better than being in this horrific marriage, and I'm filing for divorce in a few months. I'm terrified about being single again even though the divorce won't make me *more* lonely, but I'll be just as lonely without an end in sight.

I've read many many posts in this channel and the common theme is for people to want to be loved. I want to explore the following from both male and female perspectives

1. For guys: when you say ""All I want is for another person to share my experiences"" or something to that effect, I'm curious to know how many women you find a little unattractive have you *considered* asking out?
2. For women: I'm very curious to know the female perspective on loneliness. Are you lonely despite being in a relationship (like me) or is it because you're single? If you're single, how many men have approached you in the last 1 year (that you've obviously turned down)?

TL;DR: I'm trying to explore how much of our loneliness is of our own making and how much is out of uncontrollable factors, and trying to get both female and male perspectives into this.",lonely,A Dark Secret?,2020-10-14 16:41:45

1724,avocadorollss,1602626838,1,"I used to have quite a bit of friends throughout high-school. I always felt left out however, as we never really shared the same interests and I was always insecure about my weight, so I wouldn't put myself out there as much for fear of being judged. Teens can be brutal. So I kept myself in the shadows. My friends always wanted to smoke or drink and go to kick backs, while I had no interest in doing any of that. I'd much rather go to the mall or a theme park and hang out, no drugs or alcohol necessary. When my senior year came around I had to move to another city and school, I lost contact with my friends and everyone I knew. No one in my new school seemed to have an interest in talking to me, even after I tried. A couple people in my art class were awesome, but they all had their own friend groups so nothing came out of it other than just sharing the same class. I became a loner, I had my headphones in all the time and I hung out by myself on the stairs my entire senior year. I didn't even get to go to prom. I was supposed to go to my old high-schools prom but my friends stopped talking to me and they never updated me on the date or any other info.

Fast forward to today, I'm 21 years old and I still have no friends. Save for the two I knew from high school, whom I only hear from about once every three months. I have a boyfriend, but hes been doing his own thing and I rarely see or talk to him as he is always busy with work or he's out with his friends or family. I'm not really sure what to do anymore. I'm super lonely and it's been so long since I've made a genuine platonic connection that I don't even know where or how to even start. I avoid social media as everything that people post seems so be so disingenuous. I talk to people at work or school. But our relationships never go beyond just coworkers. It's just me and my cats...lol.

I honestly don’t believe that anybody cares about me, or possibly ever has.

Lockdown has just made it so much more evident.

I’m nearly 30 years old and still don’t have somebody that will check up on me when they’ve not heard from me. If I don’t reach out to somebody, nobody will reach out to me. Please don’t say it’s not true because I’ve lived it and tested it.

I have not felt genuine happiness or love in at least three years. Everyone says it will get better but it doesn’t. I am so fucking lonely.

I even used the opportunity recently to tell my friends and family that I’m just desperate for any form of happiness or affection or love and just get ignored or brushed off. I literally couldn’t say any more clearly how fucking miserable I am, but perhaps that’s what I deserve.

I am so depressed because of the title and the post below. It’s a direct copy of my post on r/depressed because I don’t feel like typing it up again
~~

I am 20M on leave from college and at home with family.

There is no love between my family and me. They love me, but they’re so oblivious to how much they hurt me; so much that I resent them. For context, my brother verbally and sexually abused me, and my parents are emotionally abusive and negligent.

All the people I care about were in college. No one even wants me in their home because of the pandemic. 

Last year, I spent Thanksgiving with my best friend, but she was seeing someone, which broke me. Thing is, she’s the one who cares about me so much and I do too. This year, being with her won’t happen (pandemic again). 

Christmas was spent at home where I was suicidal and had to call the Hotline. 

Can’t imagine them this year where we sit around the table, looking awkwardly at each other, eating mediocre food, and not having reasons to celebrate. 

I really want someone who loves me with me right now, but that will never happen. The Holidays this year are gonna suck.",lonely,I will have no one to spend the holidays with. x-post from r/depressed,2020-10-14 07:28:48

1738,OzzRamirez,1602614576,1,"I shouldn't love you, there's no point to it. But I cannot choose not to love you, it's a fixed element of my very being.

Ever since I saw you for the first time eight years ago, I knew you were on a league of your own, and from that point going forwards, getting to know you has only confirmed that hypothesis. 

It's not that you're flawless, though I may have put you on a pedestal from time to time, it's more that you are so mystifying that I cannot evade you.

I cannot choose to not love you. How can a person learn to unlove someone? I spent years of my life without you, and while they weren't bad years, and I was almost able to keep you out of my mind, it was dull, my life is colorless without you, it was just a monotonous mess, and there was this nagging feeling of what could have been.

And now you're back; and I shouldn't love you, I should avoid you, I should stop thinking about you, but you keep me on a loop, and while you know what I feel for you, and I know what you feel for me, I'm stuck in this spin, where I can't make a move, and I know you won't make a move, and the only choice left for me is to keep loving you the way I've been doing it for years.

You mean the whole world to me and I'm a fucking afterthought to you. I don't give a rat's ass if you love some one else or not, if it's just some platonic shit or not; I'd rather be that goddamn platonic lover and never physically be with you than being this fucking miserable wretch of a person, limping for some shitty breadcrumbs of love.

And also, you have the fucking gall to come back to me and try to just be friends? You dare to tell me that we have grown? Yes, I have grown as a person, and some things about me changed, but I can't fucking change the fact that I love you so goddamn much. I should be the one who leaves this time, I should just say ""Fuck it"" and throw it all to shit; but you know what? I can't even do it, because you haven't done jack shit to hurt me, it's just my fucking delusional unstable self that can't contain itself.

If this rant sounds too fucking passionate it's because I'm too fucking passionate about you, all my emotions go up to 11 when I'm exposed to you, you're my kryptonite, of all colors, all in one, my sadness turns to depression, frustration to fury, doubt to dread, joy to ecstasy, and I can't just be calm, I'm full of energy, euphoric, on the edge of collapse, on the verge of frenzy; full of contradictions, and devoid of answers",lonely,Letter to a woman I love,2020-10-14 05:42:56

1741,Destiny-wolf,1602612554,1,"I have been a long time lurker in this subreddit and have seen many people longing for friends or partners in life and feel alone and sad because they don't have friends(I myself have social anxiety).  But here is something from me: I had Social Anxiety since I was in 1st grade. Never made friends due to this and when I thought I had a friend or two they all ended up bullying me. And over these 10 years with social anxiety I realized that I don't need friends nor any partner to bring me up.

I have one thing to say and that is if you think you need friends or relationship to build you up back and feel happy then you are wrong. I felt that I have wasted my childhood and had formed no memories what so ever, that when I grow up I would not even look back at my childhood. But if there is one thing that I remember clearly was the joy when I entered into physics and mathematics. Whenever I did physics or maths I never had this one negative thought about having social anxiety or being lonely.

Same goes for you, you don't need anyone else to build you up or make you feel warm, what you need is a passion in anything you like from gaming to gardening to studying theoretical physics. You don't need a bond of attraction between a bunch of other atoms to feel safe. Lonely people are the most emotionally strong people since we didn't have anyone to apply bandages on our wounds when we fell down.

There are many people in my class who can do physics far better than me at the same time being in so man relationships than I ever could in my life combined but that doesn't make me sad because I am doing the thing I like. I have placed physics and maths far above than other negative things in my life. 

I have my mom sitting in the other room feeling ill and thinking that she has COVID-19, but when I do physics these sorrow don't affect me. I would like people that are lonely to be the same, find a passion and work hard on it. Being alone had many negative aspects but if there is one positive aspect of it is that we get far more time than others to work on ourselves and make something better out of our lives. 

Remember our wings always look far less shorter than those who are flying. It is only until when you spread those wings outward and move out of the pit we realize how big they really were.

I used to love them - I don't think they're bad people. However, they haven't changed much over the years while I've changed a lot (partly due to some personal issues) so I don't fit their dynamic anymore. Being around them makes me feel lonely - I used to try talk more with them and get closer to some of them (because I thought I was the one pulling away) but I've given up with that now. I get that drifting from people is a part of life but that doesn't make it any less painful, especially since it seems I'm the only one who drifted.

They barely feel like more than strangers to me now.

Some weeks it bothers me more than others. Overall, I've come to accept it. For me, it's difficult to make new friends (I guess because I've never had to make them on my own) and it's only gotten more difficult with the pandemic. It's hard to bring myself to let go of them because it's letting go of the past as well as the safety net they give me, separating me from really having no friends.

I’m just throwing this out there to see who finds it. I’m looking to make friends or something more if you’re interested in that too. 

I just really want to find someone I can talk to. I miss late night easy conversations and cuddling until I can’t keep my eyes open anymore. I miss getting butterflies when I get a messages from someone I really like. 

My preference in body type is skinny/tall men. I have a weakness for curly hair and a guy with a cute laugh. I like boys who will let me lay my head on their lap while they play video games. I just want to meet someone kind.

1749,lenore1992,1602602667,1,"I'm a 28 F and have never had a boyfriend. I've always told myself I still have time and I'll find someone, but these last few years, it's really started to hurt with how lonely I am. I told myself I was really going to try and get out more, but then Covid hit. I even tried online dating for a bit, but I couldn't get into it, so that ended up being a bust.

I've tried to put myself out there, tried to talk to people, but it's like it's not good enough, or I'm not good enough. I'm lucky if they want to to be just friends with me. Most of the time, I feel like I'm a bother and I'm just annoying them. What friends I do have, most live 1+ hrs away, and those that live nearby, we're not apparently close enough for me to be invited to anything.

Then 3 months ago, while I was working, my neighbor (30 m) comes in and starts hitting on me, calling me gorgeous and pretty, and going ""how does someone like you not have a boyfriend?"" No one has ever said stuff like that to me. No guy has ever called me pretty. He later messaged me on Facebook and added me.

He had been talking to my mom a lot, complaining about how his live-in girlfriend was mean to his kids, and how she was threatening to leave him because he getting called up for active duty. He did ask if I would go on a date with him, but I said no, because he had a girlfriend. I told him it wasn't because I wasn't interested in him as a person, but because he had a girlfriend and I was going to respect that. He then asked if I would go out with him if he broke up with her. I told him I probably would, but he needed to think about what he wanted, and he shouldn't ask me out again, unless he and her were no longer together, but to let me know what he decided.

He never replied to me after that, and ghosted me on and off for the next two weeks, even going so far as to ignore me in front of my own mother, but then would randomly talk to me about something. Then one day, his girlfriend comes in and buys a pack of condoms. If things were going so rough between them, why were they having sex? And if he wasn't interested in me anymore, why not say so? I was devastated and sent him a message asking what was going on. But then later he comes in, and my co-workers who checked him out said he also bought condoms. After a bunch of messaging later, he admits he and his girlfriend are going to work it out.

I was heartbroken, still am. He was just going to drag me along, never telling me anything. People tell me he was just wanting me for sex. And I'm pretty sure he was lying about being in the Marines. I've been trying so hard to get over what he did, trying to focus what a shitty person he is, and tell myself I got lucky and dodged a bullet. But it's hard, when I have to see him everyday, whether it's at home or at work.

Then the other day, he comes in and starts talking to woman that is his gf's stepmom. I couldn't hear the conversation completely, but there was something about an apartment and bedrooms and and just waiting to hear from somebody. And now I'm just...I don't know.

I feel so unwanted and broken. I don't know what's wrong with me, why no one wants to be with me. But at this point, I don't know why anyone would want to be with me either. What man wants an almost 30 year old woman, who's never been in a relationship, who's never been with anybody? High schoolers have more experience than me. There's nothing special about me. All the plans and ideas I have had never turned out. I'm so tired of trying, only to be constantly turned away. And I don't feel like I can talk to anyone. I have no one. Most days, I don't even want to get out of bed. All I want, is for someone to think I'm important to them. I want someone to get me flowers and to be by me, to wand me to be with them.

I was dealt a pretty good hand in life. It makes me guilty to say that in pretty much every category things have come easily to me. I am attractive, athletic, and muscular. I was born into a well-off, well-respected, loving family with a noteworthy name in the city I am from. I'll be the last to complain about any of these blessings but it is true that blessings sometimes carry a double edge.  

People judge me before they know me. Their preconceptions based off my name and my looks are that I am probably a douche for multiple reasons. I have to fight this by overcompensating more than most people. I have to be artificially quiet and overly humble. I can't tell funny stories about myself without them coming across as braggadociousness. I have high expectations from my family so have grown up heavily groomed. I don't want to embarrass my family/ hurt the reputation so everything I say is significantly filtered, which makes me feel boring. I also worry about the fake people out there who fake friendliness for proximity and favors. I have been hurt by a few. All of this adds up to me feeling repressed, unrelatable, and my keeping everyone at arm's length. Now its just built into who I am. I feel like nobody understands my situation, nobody knows me, and like people would just criticize me for complaining (which is fair). 

Also, if anyone had the perfect recipe to not be lonely, it's me. So I feel like an even bigger failure for feeling this way, given the cards I was dealt.

* *""Talked to my imagination. Confided into alcohol. ""*\- I'm sad and I try to tell myself that all will be ok which turns into more hurt which turns into me drinking because Mr. Tito has never left me lonely. This is also when I realize that I am in need of a fulfilling human connection and desperately wanting that connection. 
* *""I tried and tried and tried some more. Told secrets 'til my voice was sore. Tired of empty conversation. Cause no one hears me anymore""* \- Seeks connection. Connection made. Trying my best to maintain said connection. Giving all of myself, but being on a different page. Still, I'm optimistic. 
* *""Anyone, please send me anyone. Lord, is there anyone? I need someone""*\- Feeling like maybe I'm meant to have this feeling of loneliness for the rest of my life. This is usually when I go all in on the connection even though I know inside that I am headed towards more hurt. But maybe things will get better. 
* *""I used to crave the world's attention. I think I cried too many times. I just need some more affection. Anything to get me by.""* Things went to shit. Saw this coming. Anger. Pain. Disbelief that we are here again. Just want genuine affection. 
* *""I feel stupid when I sing. Nobody's listening to me. Nobody's listening.""* Why do I try when I always end up hurt in the end. STOP. TRYING. Sadness. Pain. Maybe I can drink until I figure out what's next.

I’ve lost the motivation to GO to these classes in person even though I think I’d be doing better if I did. I’m surprised I’m still barely maintaining myself hygiene wise, my day pretty much just consists of showering, putting on clean clothes, brushing my teeth, and then spending the time im not in classes crying in bed. Most days I wonder why I shower though, it’s a drag to do it. 

I don’t know what my deal is. I’m not even a good person, I’m a terrible person. There’s a reason I don’t have friends or really anyone. But there’s some part of me that is glad I have nothing and no one because I feel it’s what I deserve. 

I feel like I’m drowning and there’s no one around to scream to. Even if there was, I don’t think I’d scream for help anymore. I don’t deserve it. Im a HORRIBLE person, I’m so messed up, I’m not coping with life.

I hate my life, but I feel like I deserve it so I am trying to be content with misery. I deserve this, completely, I know I do. I’m not looking for anyone to tell me I don’t, I know I deserve this. I’m not going to accept anything but hearing this as the truth. I can’t stop hating myself because why like myself when no one else does. No one wants to spend time with me, but it’s because I don’t deserve it. I’m too clingy and needy and I’m a messed up person. I’m tired, I just wish it would stop hurting so I could accept my misery.",lonely,Loneliness isn’t something i would wish on a mass murderer.,2020-10-13 11:10:53

I'd go to extremes just to get a pleasure rush. I'd go to shady places just to be surrounded by free attention so I wouldn't feel so lonely. But I still felt lonely. It just was medicated I suppose. Whenever I walked away, the pit returned accordingly.

I hate feeling alone. I hate feeling purposeless. I hate not being able to connect with people like I want to. I want to be loved but I'm afraid I might not be able to love back... I don't know... fucking is easy but it just brings me back to square 1 emotionally... a black hole of a soul.

1814,taat50,1602544162,1,"TW: self-harm

I hate weekends, because I never have anything to do on the weekends because I don't really have anyone to do anything with. Watching everyone go out and have fun just makes me feel so much lonelier than I usually do, and this weekend was really bad. Idk why. I cried a few times, but only small cries. I felt so sad, but for some reason I couldn't just cry like I wanted to.

Because I was so upset, I didn't really get any work done, and I was already behind on my classes to begin with. This weekend, I was supposed to catch up.

I'm in a sorority and I'm a new member. We had an event for new members yesterday, and we played a game there where some of us stood in the middle of the room, while everyone else stood in a circle around us, closing their eyes, and they would call out things like, ""touch a sister who believes in you,"" or something, and we'd go and tap three or four girls that believed in us or whatever.

Well, I don't know anyone here, so I just did there awkwardly in the middle of the circle while everyone around me was walking around laughing and smiling and making jokes. With each thing they called out, it became more and more clear that they weren't gonna call out anything I could move for. I started to panicked and felt like I was gonna cry. Eventually, I did and I ran out of the room.

This girl followed me out and asked me what was wrong. I said I didn't know anybody there and I was so lonely and this always happens to me and a bunch of other sad stuff. It was nice to talk to someone about that but I still don't feel like anything is going to change. Nothing ever does.

Today, I had a test in my statistics class that I forgot about. I'm so behind in my classes that I don't even show up to statistics and I don't do any of the homeworks cause they're not required. My roommate tutors for statistics though, so she helped me as best she could, but I was just so mad at myself and ashamed for letting this happen and stressed out about my classes that I wanted to self-harm. When the test was over, I went out and started hitting my arm with a hanger, but I accidently hit my ear, and I couldn't hear well for like the next half hour.

I had an appointment with a psychiatrist online right after to be assessed for ADHD. It was very rushed and she was rude to me the whole time and it just made me feel like I was dumb. She barely asked me any ADHD questions and immediately started asking me questions about depression, then she went more towards anxiety and essentially came to the conclusion that I have anxiety and I really, really, really don't think I have anxiety. The whole appointment was like 20 minutes and she asked me if I wanted to try medication and I said I didn't know, because I didn't even know if I wanted ADHD medication, let alone anxiety medication when I don't even think I have anxiety. The whole appointment was a waste of time and left me feeling like shit.

Immediately after it ended, I left the room and started crying. When I came back, I started crying again. My roommate asked me how it went and I said terrible and that's when she realized I was crying. I told her what happened and she said that lady was stupid and that I'm not dumb, and then I kept crying for like two hours. When she was done with her class, she gave me a hug, and my other roommate did too. It was honestly the first time in my life I really genuinely felt cared about, and it kinda made the whole thing feel better.

TL;dr I had a few bad days, idk if things are gonna get better, but I got some hugs and people care about me so it's okay :)",lonely,"Lots of loneliness, but one nice thing happened",2020-10-13 10:09:22

Now replace some words, like how he say love and instead use your life. Basically interpret it like this

You once live a life you had, but you didn't really treasure some things in your life. Only when you lost it or think back to those moments, when you could had did something, you feel regretful. It was the most painful thing in this world. If you were giving one more chance, you would change your life for the better.

1831,katrmior,1602533064,1,"Hello there, fellow lonely hearts. Or heart. Or no one, I mean I'm just assuming this won't be seen as with other posts I made. But I doesn't matter. I just want to get things off my chest. I hope it will help, many people say it does, but hey, what could go wrong if is suddenly tell my story on a social network? Nothing much more, I suppose.

Let's just begin with the obvious. I am quite sure to have depression. I don't know what kind, nor how serious. I stopped going to a psychologist some time ago because it did nothing but help, but before we stopped she told me she was pretty sure that I had depression, and I looked around and it seems that I have severe signs of depression and anxiety and stress. But I haven't been diagnosed, so I don't really know. I also might have myself. There's a quote from a French song called ""somewhere else"" (written by two brothers that rap, it talks about suicide) and that goes ""I don't want to be myself, but I don't want to be anyone else either"". That's how I feel. I don't want to exist at all. Or just forget everything and start from new. Or i don't know. I don't fucking know.
I feel like I don't fit in this world, I feel like I hurt everyone, including myself and that it would probably be the best for everyone for me to just... Disappear. The only things keeping me here are my friends and my music. I love classical music, especially, I must admit, Franz liszt.
I have talked about my stress a bit higher. Let me just say that... I feel like I was tied to the end of a train and I am forced to run after it. And if I can run anymore, I'm dragged along anyways. I'm pretty sure school shouldn't feel like that. Also I regularly have something at school, or everywhere actually, where my mind can't control the input anymore,and then every sense just seems to attack me. Like really. Attack me. All the sounds are so loud, every sensation is amplified and it fucks me up. Also I've recently found taste in carving lines with my pencil into my arm. It hurts a bit, but I'd ont know. It releases some of my agressiveness towards my hated self. I had stopped some time before because of my neighbor in class, that girl who randomly appeared in my life, who started hugging me and now I'm addicted, I have to admit. The problem is that I have a girlfriend. Or I'm supposed to. That's a problem of its own. We barely talk, we saw each other some weeks ago, and left ike I could hug her was 10 weeks ago. And there are so many problems more. I feel touch deprived, because I try to not hug the girl too much, I think I'm seriously annoying her. But I think I'm slowly falling for her. And now idk what to do with my relationship. Or with anything. 
Have i talked about my anger yet? How angry I am, so much that I could actually punch a wall until I broke my entire hand, or that I could just.. I don't even know. Just angery stuff.
I just feel fucked up. Sad, depressed, angry, maybe in love, confused. I can't take it much longer...

Have a good time folks. Good luck to anyone reading this.

1842,Illustrious-Ad7420,1602524634,1,"1) You are lonely because you are depressed and depressed because  you are lonely. 

2)They say reach out to friends and family but if you reach out too often then you won’t have anyone to reach out to. 

 3) When you try to reach out people don’t answer your call then they wonder why you didn’t reach out before you attempted suicide. 

4)You are not a burden but dealing with your depression can be burdensome to loved ones. 

5) If you’re chronically depressed you should work on yourself a little before trying to reach out so as to not overburden people but if you don’t reach out for long enough you will have lost your support system. 

6) Once you have lost your support system you have the option to find a new one but you are depressed and fear abandonment. 

7) When you are low income you’re only option for therapy is someone with questionable credentials that will push whatever medication that they get perks for prescribing you whether that medication was designed to treat it or not. 

8) Even if you find a therapist who says they are willing to do a more holistic treatment and accepts Medicaid after a few sessions they will refuse to see you if you don’t take medication.

For context, I'm a 17 year old guy living in the UK. Due to depression and anxiety I ended up completely dropping out of school early this year, and I've not kept in touch with people there due to drama. I definitely don't want to try getting back in touch with most of them anyway: they're assholes. I've kept myself busy online, keeping a good presence in communities on discord, and I've just started an undergraduate course at the Open University (i.e. studying is entirely online). From the outside, I look better than I've been in years, but I don't feel any better. Reading a post on r/AskReddit this morning made me realise that that's probably because I've got nobody to talk to not on a screen. 

Fine, I've got people I can laugh with over a voice call, and then my family here, but that isn't the same as having friends I can see in person. I find myself longing for someone other than my mum to just give me a hug or something. Problem is, I don't have anyone right now. My colleagues at work are all at least 5 years older than me, and due to the nature of the Open University, there are few students on my course who are both around my age and live near me. I don't have any other way of really meeting anybody new right now, especially with COVID about.

I guess my question for you guys is, what would you do? I'm not majorly introverted or anything, I actually really enjoy talking to new people, my problem is that I don't know how to meet them.

I keep my head up and eyes looking around hoping to catch someone’s eyes and feel a connection with them for even a few seconds but it never happens. People avoid me like they would a leper.

On the rare occasion that someone is forced to acknowledge my existence (those in the service industry mainly) and make eye contact with me; I’ve noticed that without fail they will give me this wide eyed expression of surprise/fear. Mainly fear though. There’s just something about my eyes that inherently makes people afraid of me. Maybe they can sense the deep abyss of loneliness that lies just behind them.

With every passing year my sense of depersonalization and existential angst grows. Sometimes I swear that I’m already deceased and I just don’t know it yet. Maybe it’s the stench of decay wafting from deep within me that fills others with dread. 

I know people say you can always change yourself and become sociable but I don’t believe that. I’ve tried to reinvent myself so many times, to work on myself and my issues in order to be desirable to other people but it’s never worked. Honestly, I’ve always been this way even when I was a young child. There’s just something completely broken about my personality that I’ll never be able to change. The cement of my being dried along time ago and there’s no change possible now.

I'm not good with words, talking to new people makes my hands shake and my stomach gets filled with too many butterflies for it to be as nice as stories describe it-- but even with that being said, I really want to communicate with people more. Its been years since i've talked to people aside from my family and I don't want to end up going crazy.

I despise myself so much because of this process of overthinking, how do I expect myself to rid this loneliness without communicating with people? 

Some days I don't bother thinking about how alone I am because there's not much for me to do about it, but there's days where it bothers me most above all things and i'd end up feeling a mixture of irritating emotions to the point where I pull at my hair. some days, looking at stars in the night sky makes me feel dreadful because i've seen them for over a hundred times and I have ended up forgetting why I ever liked looking at the stars.

1894,going2carolina,1602482810,1,"The [original song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRIhSrWFeWM) was about a guy homesick for his home state, but for me, North Carolina was always a dream I had. Every winter, I went to Raleigh to spend time with my relatives and I had an unbelievable amount of fun. I loved spending time there and I fell in love with the beautiful nature of the state and the climate.

I keep dreaming about going to Carolina in my mind to keep my mind off how sad my own life is. If I ever try to think about what really is going to happen in my life, I just start crying because I know things will always go downhill. My life is so pathetic and meaningless right now, and I have nothing to live for. Nobody talks to me, and I don't talk to anyone else because there's nothing to talk about. I live the most boring, depressing life in existence, and I have no reason to interact with any other people because I have nothing to contribute to any conversation. That's why I just stay alone in my room working nonstop and daydreaming about living in my own North Carolina. Obviously I'm not really talking about North Carolina specifically, but I just daydream about being a better person who actually has the motivation to pursue relationships or friendships instead of just sitting alone every day living as an empty shell of a person. 

I just feel so empty. There's nothing to live for because I don't believe my life will get better. All I have to live for is what's in the moment, and all I have is work. The only reason I'm doing work is so that I can be better prepared for a better life in the future, but if I don't even believe I can ever live a happy life, what's the point? I think about an alternate version of myself who's living a happy life in Carolina or some other beautiful place.

About three months ago, I went through a breakup with my girlfriend of 16 months, and ever since then, I’ve been feeling worse and worse as the days go on. It feels like just a void of empty nothingness, and it’s especially prominent when I’m by myself. I just want that feeling again. Having someone who loves you completely is amazing. And now that love is gone it’s just been a downwards spiral.

I’m not going to blame coronavirus isolation for this, because frankly I have a really good friend group of friends that I hang out with. I’ve been with this group ever since my freshman-sophomore year of college and some even are from highschool. We share drinks and do all the stuff that you’re supposed to do in college. But as soon as I go home for the night, all these feelings return.

I’m just sad. Maybe im trying to cope with not having the high level of connection that I shared with my girlfriend. I don’t know how to feel. On one hand I can hang with my friends and forget about everything around me, and on the other hand, it’s sadness.

I’ve tried dating apps but I’ve never used them before, and I’m not quite sure how that culture works. Matches are few and when I do get one, the talking and texting never makes it past a day or two.

Anyone have advice for me? I appreciate anyone who has time to respond.

The ""friends"" I had during school were pretty much acquaintances, nothing more. Once I left them, I never saw them again.

Everyone goes along well in one single group and when I'm next to that group, I'm the one who talks the least. Or rather I'm the one who doesn't talk at all. I was always the one who gets isolated, ostracized, mocked, bullied, and hated by others.

Online is a similar thing. These past of couple of months/years, I've been dealing with similar things as to how I was dealing with in real life.

When I tell them something, they just get confused and don't understand my point of view because it doesn't relate to theirs.

I hate all kinds of positivity, happiness, optimism, fun, excitement, love, kindness, politeness, empathy, sympathy, whatever. They just feel so ingenuine, uncomfortable, and unnecessary. I'm not getting the purpose here at all, it makes no sense to me whatsoever. I need a clear-cut reasoning as to why people prefer positivity and happiness over anything else.

My last serious relationship (4 years, daughter together) was awful.

Any one I date now is either wanting a quick fuck and nothing else, suddenly realized they aren't ready to date because of their ex, or dps me for their ex within a couple weeks. 

I have sat and swiped right on everyone on tinder for 15 minutes before, only getting matches on bots or extremely overweight people (I'm no skinny person, but I'm talking arms the size of my calves). I don't mind women my size or even bigger, I truly don't, but a 75 pound swing is a lot to ask.


The last person I really clicked with on Hinge had a sudden panic attack and decided she wasn't ready to see anyone (this was after almost getting back with her ex the previous day, then saying no to him) and blocked me. It's not that I blame her, it's just my luck.


My previous serious relationship left me for someone half a country away, telling me she never actually loved me.


My friends all abandon me, and the ones that stick around don't have the desire or energy to do anything with me.

The prescence of these happy, innocent folk is unfortunately unavoidable, and don't get me wrong, I don't want anyone to feel bad for being in love just because I can't find any. However, just seeing a happy couple being affectionate towards each other makes a geyser of hate erupt inside me. I don't let any of this hate out though, because that would be stupid, so I either try very hard to ignore them or just leave. I recognize this as very much a problem, as it's getting to where I can't even see a fictional couple on TV without getting like that.

This is me first time writing here because I am really feeling so bad right now. I am planning to do internships in Germany and I've been learning German for at least a year. I've also planned to go to South Korea for an exchange semester and staying there for 8-9 months to learn the language. I've also been learning Korean for 2-3 months. I really want to go to South Korea and Germany too. I am dreaming to going these places every single day. This is giving me motivation to continue learning the languages.

 I am studying mechanical engineering at a very hard, intense school. I dont interact with people because of covid, I just go for little runs 3-4 times a week also do some lifting at home with my weights. 

It's been months since I talked with somebody in real life, talked with my friends real life. I am saying friends here but 1 only have 1 real friend and I am really thankful for that. Most of my friends have girlfriends, they meet regularly. I dont have a girlfriend and I also dont meet with anyone because of covid. I feel so alone, I feel so anxious sometimes. Lots of this language learning, university chores, online classes making me so busy and lonely. Most of my friends tell me that I shouldnt learn these languages, but I feel like I should to be a better and more qualified engineer. I also enjoy learning a languages but I become so stressed and anxious sometimes because I feel like I cant manage all of this of my own. I need someone to tell me you can do this man ! You got this ! Instead of this my friends call me a dumbass for learning languages. How nice. 

I feel like most of my friends dont care about me, they dont message or call me if I dont call or message them first. I just want this virus to finish man, I am just so sick of it. Thank you for reading.",lonely,Feeling so lonely because of what I've plan to do,2020-10-12 08:24:05

I dont know how to put it in words and convey what im trying to say but picture this ; if we are no longer together , he'll still have someone but as for me , i'll have no one.. 

My boyfriend and his friends (all guys) are planning on a graduation trip (after covid ends) and it makes me sad  not cause i dont want him to go but ive always dreamt about traveling with friends but I genuinely dont have any. I expressed that i want to travel with him since years ago but because his parents are VERY VERY conservative we are not able to travel together .. so seeing him travel with others makes me feel a little ... sad

I dont know if im the reason why i dont have friends.. i dont speak alot , i find it hard to create and continue conversations unless we know each other for a long time.. i feel like people always feel awkward around me .. im also super soft spoken . I dont like being rowdy and loud .. if i had to describe myself as a character , the closest visual and personality wise would be violet from incredibles ...

in high school i only had 1 friend . Of which after grafuation, we just lost contact, like she just found a new group of friends and didnt want to meet up with me . Ive offered her out for lunch multiple times but she always said she's too busy for me .. and even on instagram she posted the "" friends im thankful for post "" and i wasnt mentioned , im ok with that but few days aft that she removed me from her socials .. till today i dont know what i did wrong 

In college i had a 3 other new friends but they left me out and made me felt unwanted. They would go out for lunch or birthday parties and not invite me . For some reason they will always try to bring me down by mocking my flaws.. we parted ways since graduation.

Now im in pre-uni ( a sch system which is higher than college but lower than uni ) and i have 0 friends . I go to school, attend lectures and go home . Nobody takes the time to socialise even if they did its just like a "" hi-bye "" conversation .. i failed a module , so i have different modules to take from everyone, in short i dont meet the same people every semester so im a new kid in every class i joined each semester . From which they already had their own cliques. My house is not far from my school so i go back home to have my lunch during my breaks or ill just eat alone .

I feel like nobody understands how lonely it is for me ... some nights i would cry because i just miss having a friend . Dont get me wrong , i love my boyfriend he is the sweetest most kindest man ive ever had but i want friends too just like him.... i want to go on a trip with my friends , i want to go to a party with friends .. i want to go lunch with friends , i just wish i had friends...",lonely,I feel so alone...

I am not a very social person, I've never had that many friends, the ones i had have distanced themselves from me, only one person really remains in my life who i can call my friend.

But the ones i left behind did spend some time of their life with me, at some point, and i can't help but wonder, ¿do they think of me often? ¿do i have  any place in their thoughts anymore or have they stopped remembering me?

When i can't fall asleep late at night, my brain bombarded with these thoughts, i realize that there's spots of time in which absolutely no person thinks of me, not one person in this earth has my presence in their minds; moments in which i am not interacting with anyone in any way; moments in which absolutely no one can see me or notice me.

Those late at night moments are the ones in which i stop existing, not even in a intangible way, i simply abandon all forms of human interaction and i cease to exist to society.",lonely,I stop existing,2020-10-11 23:02:01
1983,Waste_Astronaut3589,1602415353,1,"I just wonder how different my life would be if I hadn’t read all those stupid romance novels when I was young that just instilled into my brain that I was only worth something if a guy like me. I wasted all of my adolescent and teenage years waiting like an idiot to be chosen and living in this fantasy world and missing out on so many things. And when no one ever chose me that hatred was so destructive, I didn’t think I deserved a good life, I wondered what was so wrong with me, I despised everyone for having friends and partners and people that just loved them. I never got asked out or had a first kiss or any of those stupid moments from all those YA novels and I just wonder how differently things could have been if I had actually tried to be social and friendlier instead of having my head in the clouds waiting for a prince that never existed. 

Those years of loneliness and bitter regrets have created a monster that I have to work so hard to fight against everyday. My mindset is much better now, I know I have things to life for, but sometimes all I am is just her and the loneliness. But I will never stop trying to make friends and genuine connections.

I found out that its actually been an issue even before the pandemic occurred. Hence, i wanted to do my part in solving the problem and started to brain storm different ways I could.

After attempting to help some of my own friends in the situation, I found out that the main reason for loneliness and anxiety is because the person dealing with it, quite literally, lacks the energy to reach out for help.

i like animals, video games, music, tv shows, movies, and sleep in no particular order. i’d really like to find someone that i can hold a meaningful conversation with throughout the day - whether you’re able to respond frequently, or a handful of times.

•i mostly play dbd and valorant, but i’d like to get into phasmophobia! i’ve also got a decent amount of hours in acnh, with little motivation or progress to show for it. 
•my music taste is typically involves mellow, sad songs - more specifically lauv, finneas, and joji. 
•the last show i watched was cobra kai, and i’d like another to (somehow) hold me off until the next season. pretty much any genre is fine!
•movie suggestions are much appreciated. if you have a favorite spooky szn one, send it my way!

I just feel like my life sucks recently.

I just graduated in college. The irony is I took the course in Psychology but seems like there’s no helping myself when sad days occur. I call it sad days because I am sure that I don’t have depression. At least I am over with the thoughts about ending everything. I thought graduating college is the answer to my dreams but how come non of those is happening? Once again, I feel stuck.

When emotional breakdowns occur to me. I tend to rant on twitter the most, I delete it the next day though because I feel silly sharing my stupid thoughts online when none of those people care.

I realized that even your friends don’t care when you’re sad. It’s been happening quite a lot. And the more I realized it, the more painful it is. I have friends during fun times but how come I don’t have them when I’m feeling down? I realized I cry alone and when I reach out to them, no one is available. I understand we all have our own circumstances but I always try my best to be there for them.

But then I guess I am also not available towards them when I see them being sad. How come that when there’s fun, everyone is gathered but when there’s someone breaking down in front of our eyes, we can’t do anything about it? 

Additional to the struggle I face right now is the mental drought. It’s been months we’re stuck at home. I am tired of being home so I did my best looking for a job. No one calls me back. I know I’m wasting so much time of my life and it comes to the point where I can’t endure it anymore.

I started to feel tired. I don’t have any motivation to do anything. I just lie here, watch videos online, listening to motivational speakers but how come none of them inspire me anymore. I have a dream and now I feel like it is impossible for me to reach..

I feel so pathetic. My life is filled with drama and though I pretend not to ne affected by all of these, it’s tearing me apart inside. My family sucks that’s why I need to leave sooner but now I am stuck with them. No. I’m living with an extended family and they made me live pathetically since my mom left to work. They do mooch money from her and when they’re not satisfied with what I give them, they talk behind my back. I know it. And I am always anxious about it.

I want them out of my life completely. I’ve cried many tears because of them.

2016,cassie_to_heart,1602389820,1," 21 years old, MtF trans *(not yet passing)*, moved to Australia with a family in 2008 when I was a 'wee child, in order to start a new life. I've had ups and downs since, mostly downs *(too much to detail in my post).*

Now, fast-track forward to the year of 2020 in August, I was in the middle of pursuing a career in Nursing, and in the middle of my degree *(which I'll get to shortly)*, I discontinued my hospital clinicals and entirely withdrew from my semester units. I had an ambition to pursue the career path of becoming a military flight nurse and if that didn't work out, alternatively, working as a RAAF or even if moving over to the US.... as a DoD civilian nurse at an Army hospital/Naval medical center.

**All in all, eventful things have happened** ***(no, this wasn't due to the virus)*** **in this particular order**:

1. Having lost my friendships over a previous partner *(served in the Marine Corps as a 0311)*... ""my former friends"" calling me f\*cked in the head for choosing a guy like him especially given his former background and warning I'd get abused *(farcry from the truth)*
2. Lost my then-partner when it came to a dilemma of him vs. Nursing career ambition
3. Lost any confidence and chances of career-to-be when I made subtle, major mistakes that ended up compromising patient safety during clinicals and in turn, not trusting myself and reassessing my stage in life from hereon.

Now, with everything that I've experienced, I came to the epiphany that as much as I tried to deny it for so long and clinging to old, dead friendships and accepting the littlest of crumbs... I have no friends. And where do I start when people ask me what kind of friendships I'm looking for? The essence of friendships I'm looking for overlaps with that of a relationship... or at least with a friendship with relationship benefits. I feel that intimacy, affection and closeness should extend to my male friends and be as caring for them as I am with a partner.

What existed in my university/professional/work life were only three things: isolation, loneliness and the feeling of disconnect . Each passing day presented a day of hardship where I felt truly alone.

I'm aiming to start my new, perhaps hopeful chapter of a life in the Fox Cities/Valley area in WI *(in the US)* there but I feel like I want to bring along some people in my journey from my old life here in Australia... where there's almost nothing for me here. All but unpleasant memories into a future where I can look forward to. However, that is all the more difficult in my present situation/circumstance and lack of male friendships.

**I am that extremely lonely in that it feels like I'm making up for lost time, as if the feeling I was released from prison, wrongfully convicted and trying to live the remainder of whatever life I have.** I have trouble connecting with people, and the same story applies to online. Oh, the reddit downvotes certainly don't help.

People irritate me when they have their success of striking up friendships and connections and I feel like I want to blow up in their faces and give them a reality check on how hard it was for me.

I just want a close affectionate, even intimate male friend... after being alone and lonely as a cause of it, don't I deserve to have something that makes me happy?

Today I'm deciding not to feel guilty. I'm going to do the things I enjoy and I'm going to enjoy them. I'm taking responsibility for my own life!

I'm going to watch porn tonight bodly. I'm not going to feel shy about it I""m going to pull up a tab, and look right at it. I'm going to look for a woman who turns me on, I'm going to embrace the fact that I enjoy looking at a woman naked.

I'm going to accept my sexual desires. I'm going to accept the fact that I enjoy talking sexually with women online. Its been quite a while since Ive tried to find someone due to the shame and tonight I'm going to post on r4r and other subs to try and find a woman to get to know, and be sexual with. I'm going to accept that I like the idea of watching porn together with a woman, and I'm going to accept that fact without judging myself about it.

I'm going to accept that I want a woman to see me naked. That I want to show myself to a woman in that way. I accept that I'm going to seek out a relationship with a woman online who will want me to show her my penis. (Consensually and not out of the blue of course).

I'm going to accept that its ok that I'm in my 20's and still a virgin. I accept that and when distancing from other people is no longer required I will go out and date more, and eventually have sex with a woman.

I have no idea how to find the things I want online. I have no idea how to find a woman to talk to , or interact this way with. But tonight, I'm giving myself permission to not feel guilty, to not judge myself, and to instead seek out the things I want, and to enjoy myself.",lonely,Ive decided to make a scary decision about my life in order to bring myself more happiness,2020-10-11 13:47:28

2048,JonSouljah,1602367922,1,"I (39M) have recently learnt (again) that the more someone talks about being a friend, or a social group claims to be a welcoming community of people, the quicker they forget about you.

&amp;#x200B;

I first learnt this 10+ years ago, when people I had pretty much known most of my life (growing up together in and around church) at that time seemed to just forget about me as they organised social gatherings. As a result, I slowly drifted away from them and the church, and into the pub that was less than a stones throw away from the church building, and none of them noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

This was also around the time my brother (2.5 years my junior) was serving in the army and deployed in Iraq. The few times I would stick around at church, all I was ever asked was ""How's &lt;Insert Brother's Name&gt; doing?""  I had no idea, as communication lines weren't exactly easy to maintain, but I wholeheartedly believed he was in a much safer place/position than I was as I began to spiral downward.

&amp;#x200B;

My increasingly more frequent visits to the local pub allowed me some escape from that, as the people I met there knew nothing about my brother.  As friendships with my fellow drinkers grew, I began to feel like I was welcomed for who I was and not simply as someone to be used for what I could do for others.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years later, whilst working in a voluntary role, I was invited to a different church and decided to go along as I didn't really have anything else to do that particularly Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

I met knew people and made friends, and initially felt welcomed.  I've celebrated engagements &amp; weddings with these new church friends, as well as partying with them simply because it was Friday and that was worth celebrating.  I felt like I belonged.

&amp;#x200B;

But this global pandemic, along with its lockdowns and restrictions on social gatherings has changed my mind, reminding me that the more people profess to be a friend, the less they actually are.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 7 months, I've had no contact with these people I thought I belong in a community with.  I've watched (not literally, but seen posts after the fact) on social media platforms as they've had online ""bake-off"" competitions and quiz nights, without a single invite to join in.  Even now, as I lay in bed typing this, my housemates are sat with mutual friends playing card/board games and having fun.  No invitation extended to myself.  I wasn't even acknowledged when I had to pass through the room where they are to make myself a drink.  


I should be (and I am) grateful for the guys I met and became friends with as I drank to excess. They're the only people I've had any half-way meaningful contact with for the last 7 months.  Without them, 2020 would simply have been ""Wake Up, Eat, Work, Sleep, Repeat"" for over half a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Often I put something on Netflix or listen to some tunes and just sit there and let myself feel all the things. Basically allowing myself to be alone and vulnerable for a night here and there. The next morning I always feel refreshed....slightly hungover....but mentally refreshed and relaxed!  

Now I know a lot of people say drinking alone is not good for you and a sign of depression, and while that is something I have been and am dealing with, I personally couldn’t disagree more. I enjoy it, especially after a long hard week. It helps to put things in perspective and reset!

And then if the same person doesnt show interest in me, or is rude—not into me, my brain instantly starts getting attracted + attached to them. 

When the same person replies late, my brain waits for them to reply. And i end up blaming myself for scaring them away. Or them finally seeing how bad of a person i am.

Is it weird of me to feel sad that my mom can’t even plan a dinner and cake and have my sisters come over? That I have to do it myself to earn their attention?

The way things are going, I’ll probably stay home with my cats and make myself food and get a lil drunk. That’s my go-to evening anyway. 

Maybe my dad will say or do something. But he didn’t bother to show up on my birthday last year. Last year I planned a trip to a local amusement park with my sister and dad. Dad didn’t show.

They're always playing this fucking card game in school and the only way for me to hang out with anyone is to beg a person i don't like: ""Please. Can i play just one game instead of you. I'm begging you!"". And if i tell anyone about what's going on with me they just laugh and dismiss it as a joke. Well i'm not just a fucking entertainer. I cry myself to sleep every night and fantasize about having real friends because my current friends don't care about me and you think i'm joking!?!?

Look if you're working that hard to please others you are surrounded by the wrong people, you shouldn't have to try to make everyone happy. And if you feel that you're unable to get a partner you are your problem. If you cant get people there is something else thats the issue if its your looks then work to change it. . .

Im not saying its easy but its no one elses fault your where you're at. No matter what an issue is you have a way to change it and the fact you self loath means clearly you dont like it.

2068,strawberrytaurus,1602344702,1,"() I’m basically a trophy kid. My so-called mom only wanted me so she could brag about me to the others and my so-called dad only wanted me because she wanted me. 

She used to be physically abusive, but now she’s only trying to manipulate me and make me feel bad about myself because she saw that beating me didn’t have the same effect anymore. She also screams at me, but more rarely. 

She does scream at her mother every day, though and I hate it. Her mom is also shitty, but she’s much worse and she’s absolutely parallel w responsibility. Her problems are mostly her fault, yet she always blames others. Won’t listen to anyone but herself.

While she was beating and screaming at me, nobody bat an eye. Even if she did those on the street. Not even the damn police. I also tried to explain that she’s abusive to some of my neighbors and they didn’t really care. One of them even yelled at me that my parents are intellectuals, maybe I deserved to be hit, “But they’re so nice!” etc. I also tried to explain that to some friends of hers (psychology majors, 20 ish) and they couldn’t care less. But the best part is that I always lose people when I tell them I live in an abusive household. But she never loses anyone. Yes, I told some others about that too. 

(Fun fact: she is also working on opening a psychological office this year)

Also to my cousin. I used to think of her as a sister, but then she befriended my “mom” on a trip I really wanted her to be with me. And her mom befriended her too.

My so-called dad lied to me that we don’t have money for my biggest wish. He also laughed at me and screamed that we don’t have it. I would ask him for it every single day of my life. And he would lie every single time. When I found out how much money he actually had, I asked him why he lied to me and he told me that I should’ve never found out. 

Not to mention the fact that he would enable her disgusting behavior. He would even help her beat me.

I see so many amazing family relationships and I wish I had one too. I wish I had parents who loved me. Whom I can visit on holidays after moving out, whom I can call. Especially when I also think about how I am. I’m not normal. I suck at socializing and many other things. Although I try. But yeah... I wish I was adopted by someone who cared. Actually, the closer I got to being 18, the more I cried because that became even more impossible.

I used to be bullied. It started when I was in Kindergarten and continued until the 8th grade. Although, I had some high school classmates that weren’t that nice.

I don’t have any friends. Everyone leaves me. Unless they’re homophobic, racist or shit like this. In that case, I leave them because they truly don’t deserve anyone’s time. 

Also, I’m bi and in a very conservative country, so it’s very fun /s.

I also used to have a girlfriend, but she left me too. She didn’t actually break up with me. She just blocked me on everything she could. I realized later that we weren’t together anymore. But I kind of understand her. She wasn’t going through a nice time and I didn’t know how to support her and I was insensitive from time to time. FML

I remember my Latin teacher telling us once that the only lasting friends we were going to have are the ones from our childhood and I couldn’t help but cry because I had none. 

Once, a guy was nicer to me than the rest and I started seeing him as a brother (I’ve wanted one since forever so I wouldn’t be this lonely) and I really thought he cared about me, but he didn’t.

I also needed help from this other guy once. His family is close to mine and we met once. And he was super sweet and we have much in common. He also made time to speak with me once. I think I fell in love with him, but then he started leaving me on seen because I fucked up somehow. I asked him what was wrong and he didn’t tell me anything. I still can’t stop thinking about him and I keep imaging myself going on some cute dates with him and cuddling and stuff like this. And I know he may have a girlfriend and that I should forget about him, but it makes me smile and laugh and a bit less alone when I think about those. And it’s not like I keep bugging him. Thinking about those also made me calmer before the exams I had.

I also keep talking to the void before I sleep. I imagine him or my fictive family or sth like that. It sort of makes me feel like shit, but it helps me a bit. 

And I cuddle w my pillow and sometimes kiss its head. But I wish it was a real person.

I can’t even succeed in things because nobody really cares. Even worse is the fact that my classmate succeeded in those even though she started much later then me. She’s adored by so many and people tell her she’s perfect.

Then, even on Reddit, I get downvoted and it’s not like I was insulting people. I made a post on my other acc, asking for advice and I thanked the people who replied. Once I asked a bit more because I felt I needed more details. That’s what I got downvoted for. “Thanks :)” and “hi! Thanks :) I did this because x, but I could do it your way. Also...” (basically what I wrote). And this makes me feel like shit too.

I’m sorry I wrote like this and left details out and it may not have made much sense, but I’ve got a headache from crying and not eating well and being too much on devices.",lonely,"Repost w some changes (I was shadowbanned, so you couldn’t have read it anyway): I hate my life",2020-10-11 02:45:02

2074,CrazyMorbidity,1602336016,1,"Just thought I'd pop on and share...

I'm currently on disability leave from my job because of anxiety. I'm a biracial Asian that has lived in San Francisco, but had to return to suburban Pennsylvania after a major anxiety incident (getting 5150'd when I wasn't an obvious danger really fucked with my head). I do like the job I have currently in just about every way except management and some of the white coworkers that refuse to accept they're racist. I mean, I'm on paid disability leave. As someone that's struggled with being able to cope in this world with my mental illnesses, it's a joy to have this option.

Anyhow... While on leave, I'm trying to focus on my creative work, which I had difficulty of doing because of how much stress I would have from work and then spend my time off just de-stressing. I'm writing a series of book. The first one I finished at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Pennsylvania. I'm currently on the 2nd book (as I don't like doing the informative essay/synopsis part to send out to agents). I hit writer's block and realized that all the mistakes I knew from even the first book needed to be addressed. I went through all that work and now I back to where I left off with Book 2. So I'm 26 chapters into what looks to be a 35 chapter book.

I'm taking a while to get to the point, but here it is... I'm excited... With nearly no one to share my excitement with. I've never really felt accepted anywhere, so it's been pretty hard to keep friends. Most of the ones I want to reach out to I met in SF... But it's hard for me to initiate conversations all the time because it gets aggravating on my anxiety. Not to mention I had a bad falling out with my FWB at the start of COVID-19 that has left me having a hard time trusting.

2088,depressedlumvia,1602319153,1,"This is a family matter. I’m the youngest out of the 3 siblings, my family kinda sucks. My dad is a total asshole to my mom, he made her suffer a lot, he never defended her against his family, he used to hit her i think, he also didn’t let her work at the time. My mom now is a very rough, angry person. She can’t let anything go, like she makes the fights really long and she always yells, she even explains herself to a random cashier if she doesn’t enter her credit card password wrong and it breaks my heart. At the same time, my mom sees me as the total failure. My sister and brother are in one of the greatest technical school in our country, I was supposed to be a doctor but I just realized I can’t do it, my school is not even that good because I changed my college exam field the last second. She said that I’m her biggest failure a few times and she never ever backs off about this. She thinks I hate her, but she yelled me for weeks and I couldn’t stop crying all days because of her and says stuff like “I must be a horrible person in your mind.” I’m just cold and bitter because she said she’ll never forgive me for not being a doctor and she doesn’t accept me, she tolerates. 

My dad treats me well but at the same time I worth nothing to him. He thinks I can’t do anything. Like I’ll always be the last option at every chore, he sees me as the annoying zoomer who can’t live without her phone. He doesn’t even care about my career plans. I’m really incapable and lacking in his eyes. Everyone in my family seems to think dad spoils me but since I know his real thoughts about me I don’t even take him seriously. 


Everyone thinks I’m the video game addict even though I always take a break when I have something important to do, I don’t even open a computer in my school terms but everyone thinks I’m an addict when my brother who secretly gives money to games, throws tantrums is there. He wasted his college entrance exam years for playing video games, he’s ahead like 70 levels in League but everyone just thinks I’m the addict, if I get angry they think it’s because of the video games. 


I said it before, my dad thinks I’m the zoomer who can’t live without her phone. It’s pretty much everyone, actually. Two days ago, I put everyone’s plate to the table, then started eating. My mom gave a glass of water to everyone except me, she said that I should’ve also put the glasses to the table, for her I just sat and started eating without giving a fuck about everyone else. I was the only one who helped her for the table. They just treat me like I do nothing, I don’t help anything. I’m the youngest, so I know I’m actually more spoiled than I think and I have to do less stuff but it just hurts. No one respects me, no one thinks I’m capable but at the same time they treat me like shit if I ever try to help. I’m really weak compared to them so I can’t carry stuff as they can but I still try my best. Sometimes I just act like that brat they see me as when they disrespect me, I ruin the day for them, I know I’m a bad person for doing this, I feel satisfied and bad at the same time, but then bad feeling takes over and I think I deserve their attitude. 


I’m insufferable, irresponsible for them, I don’t pay attention the things around me according to them. My mom and dad fights for no reason, my dad acts as a passive agressive dick with his words and body language and attitude, my mom snaps and yells and makes everything long and I just don’t want to hear it. Then sometimes my dad yells loudly and I got scared and I don’t want to hear it. Then my mom says things like she’s not that weak person in the past and he can’t lay a hand on her and yells him for yelling her and I don’t want to hear it. My sister snaps and says awful things to dad about how he made mom suffer and I hate being left out because they see me as incapable and narcissistic. If my sister says things about how my mom can’t have anything with yelling she also shames and guilt trips her about this is the only way she can defend herself. My mom goes inside and cries sometimes but I panic, I know she’ll reject me like always so I don’t do anything about it. I hear it, I hate it and I pretend that it doesn’t exist. That’s why everyone hates me. My mom went to my grandma’s summer house and she’s not home. My sister is in charge. Today she cried while hitting me how I don’t care about anything, don’t know anything, don’t do anything, I don’t how she and mom suffers... I was supposed to take my stuff from the balcony and that’s all, I was going to do it soon. She probably snapped to me because my dad bragged it. But I got angry because she hit me, I hit her back and I probably hurt her badly and she started crying so bad, my brother somehow left his video game and tried to hit me for hitting her while making me crawl, saying that I’m awful and all. My sister stopped him, I took my  stuff and put everything back to place. I opened this account specially because I wanted to hide this from my irl friends, now I’m crying alone in my room, I didn’t want to tell them all this stuff. Maybe some of them will see this anyways. I actually don’t care if someone reads this or not. Personally I wouldn’t read it. I just feel lonely. I wanted to tell all this to random strangers. They’re trying to make me the villain so they can shame me and hate me instead of dad. I’m an easy target anyways, I’m weak, I’m emotional, I’m a spoiled brat who can play the part well. I’m probably awful and just whine even though I don’t deserve it. But I still have feelings.",lonely,Sick of being the villain,2020-10-10 19:39:13

I guess because I feel lonely my standards are low and if a girl talks to me consistently I guess I just start liking them. I never wanted to tell her because I feel like it would make our friendship awkward and ruin it. Today she told me that from that morning she felt like she sort've liked me but said it was gross so she was going to block me for the weekend to get over me. She said it was one fo those phases, 1 day crushes. That really hurt but it's a great oppurtunity for me to try to get over her, issue is I know myself and I know I won't.

2123,taco_bell83,1602297759,1,"I shouldn't have done it. 
Today was a really shitty day for me, and the main cause was me. First, I cheated on a test and was caught by my teacher, who had high expectations for me and really only wants what is best for me. She has been dealing with a lot lately, and I feel bad for disrespecting her like that. Fuck the grade. She really had a lot of trust in me, and, for her, it was painful to see what I was doing. I asked her for a letter of recommendation, and she was happy to do it...now, probably not. I feel horrible about it. We've had a good relationship for a long time now, and she's helped me a lot with my anxiety and loneliness. And to let her down like this really was fucking dumb of me. I want her to know that I'm hoping against hope that she'll give me another chance, which I admit I don't deserve. But, if she can forgive me, I know I can build that trust again. 
Then, today I told this really annoying chick to shut the fuck UP, and no one likes this girl. Literally NO ONE. She is blatantly rude to EVERYONE, and she's just a fucking bitch. She flips off random people and goes out of her way to piss anyone off. And, I, after telling her to LEAVE ME ALONE, just let loose and yelled at her that ALL ANYONE WANTS is for her to SHUT THE HELL UP and to simply FUCK OFF. That that's ALL. that no one fucking cares what she has to say and that she should fuck off. 
What happened after was...just bad timing. 
Everyone went quiet, and then immediately, people either clapped or shouted compliments/thanks to me. The chick looked around and noticed that people were COMMENDING me because SOMEONE finally told this bitch to shut her damn mouth. She then told on me to a teacher, and I told the teacher that ""hey, I told her to leave me alone and when she didn't, i told her to stop."" 
People were STILL complimenting me about it, and that did NOT help matters. I didnt get into trouble tho...at least not yet, I think, because this chick left school after...before she left tho, she CRIED because she realized that no one actually likes her. She's also a lesbian, but I didnt know that, so I hope she didn't think I was attacking her for being a lesbian/hope she doesn't make it seem like that's why I told her to snuff it. 
So, I disappointed a teacher who thinks very highly of me, and I made a fucking junior cry (I thought she was a freshman, so I felt a LOT of remorse...and then I found out that she is not much younger than me, and I found out that she treats everyone in her social group like dog shit, and thus I lost all remorse). 


Why is this on the lonely subreddit? Because I'm a fucking loser, and both instances reminded me of how I disappoint those who respect me and just let people down. The latter instance reminds me that after 4 years, I'm still the guy who will tear someone up publicly. I've made someone cry EVERY year of high school, and then I wonder why I have NO friends - because I'm a fucking asshat to people at the WRONG times. Truly, I don't think im an asshole. Am I a great person? Ofc not. I dont think I'm a dick tho. Only when I have to be. But people only ever see the asshole in me, not the kindness. And I've just fucked up too many times that I am very scared that I will ruin my new social group - I found a group who isn't all acquainted with my past transgressions and issues, and they think Im alright. I can't fuck this one up. I'm tired of being lonely. To find a group who accepts me for me, accepts me because they don't know the old me...I want that...and I have a chance now. I just have to play it cool.

It sucks but I don't feel as bad as I did years ago when the feeling struck me at 21\~22 years old. This year I am 24, no family, no friends, no relationship. People say find the happiness inside, I tried to accumulate hobbies and I actually got really good at them. Let me tell you my experience with it: it doesn't work that well. I forget loneliness momentarily when doing things and when I go to bed it is always the same. Hugging a pillow is enough but nothing I can do to change it. I put myself out there but it doesn't work. I hope one day things will turn around.   
The biggest problem is moving to a country that you know nobody. It is unfortunate.  


For anyone who is in a similar position, I offer you my sincere hug and will be rooting for you in the corner to turn your life around as the way you wish and dream. Let's stay hopeful long enough until things change. Don't get used to being lonely completely, accept people going into your life and you'll make it. If nobody is going in, well, you should work for it yourself.   


Stay healthy, hopeful, and cherish every day because you are alive and can see the sky and trees. Taking a walk in nature with relaxing music or reading under a tree helps to me.

2148,drugsnpugs420,1602276922,1,"Hey guys, so I’m going to be completely honest about what’s happening in my life right now. 

Currently in my third year of college, I’m repeating one module because I failed. Bummed. I’m in debt because the bank cancelled my direct debit without informing me and a big bill came in, struggling to pay it off. Not a huge debt, just about €3k. I’m in court in December for dangerous driving. I was just speeding. Recently moved back into home with a family that hates me. I’m mentally ill (bpd, depression, anxiety and ptsd) but overall I’m a pretty normal guy. 

I like sports, gaming, tv, eating and sleeping. I’m going through an extremely hard time and I often feel like my life is not worth the effort. I’m often high risk for suicide. I feel isolated, alone and constantly on edge. No one or any of my family knows about this. I bottle everything. I only have one parent, my mother and she absolutely despises me. Not sure why but it hurts because she’s my only parent, my father committed suicide. 

What am I looking for? Just some company and someone that’ll be nice to me. It’s something I don’t get much. 

With all of this negativity put aside, I’m actually quite a nice and caring person. I’m mature and somewhat intelligent. I’m not a drug user (username) but I do like to have a doob to calm me down at times. Having a hard time tonight and feeling more suicidal than usual. I’m really trying to hang in there for better days. I’m extremely easy going and I’d love to talk to anyone on absolutely any platform that you’re comfortable with. I know I sound pretty bad in this but I’m worth giving a chance to.

Thanks",lonely,"22 M Irish, hate my life",2020-10-10 07:55:22

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a 27 female from the UK I'm into

Cosplay

Changing hair colour alot (currently blue)

I play PS4 alot with lots of games I do have an Xbox one but I don't go online with it

Marvel/DC

Space/planets and what could be out there

I watch Netflix alot the things I watch the most are The Umbrella Academy, Doctor Who, Friends, IT Crowd, The Big Bang Theory, Friday Night Dinner and MisFits

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am looking for someone

Age 20+

Is kind

Not impatient 

Who never leaves messages unread or open

Who puts some effort into most of their messages and not leave one word answers or a few words that is hard to reply too

(I understand that people get busy or might not be in the mood to talk and that is totally fine it's just I say the previous two because I've put in effort to make fiends elsewhere recently only to find out they don't want the same as me and they never do any effort back so it felt pointless making it a one way friendship and I've wasted my time)

Who also plays PS4 alot as that would be the main thing to do as I'm on there alot 

Someone with similar interests having different interests is fine but it would make it easier to chat as we have things in common

And finally preferably someone from UK elsewhere is fine too but the UK is ideal because it would be easier to do stuff and I forget about the time zones and I don't want to wake you in the middle of the night or something

2179,theloneuwu,1602244749,1,"(apologies beforehand this will be a long post as I wish to vent. I'm also on mobile as I'm not sure if that changes the format)

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I need to let out my thoughts. I never discovered how sad I was until my doctor suddenly asked me how I am doing and ""so do you have a best friend?"" to which I came up with  some made up name. I haven't had one for years as she moved away. It hasn't been since February/early March this year since I have talked to another person I know personally face to face. It has been since early May that I no longer have phone service which keeps getting a higher bill as that's the last I have texted a friend. I've never kept any social media for many reasons which would need its own lengthy post but to sum it down, I don't want people to see me as different with my 0 friends on whatever it is and treat me differently or make fun of me because of it. I want to be normal.

Life keeps moving forward while I stay behind. This seems to have been my theme for idk how long. I was always shy and have had bad anxiety kid who was also bullied in school. It didn't help that I had family drama between my mother and father divorcing and dealing with custody bs for several years. I have since left that issue, but I always thought once I graduated I'll be fine. I told myself that a lot. I forget that I'm an adult sometimes as I haven't really changed. I'm doing worse now...I talk to no one let alone see people outside of my family aside from strangers on the streets and at the store. I'm still the shy kid with bad anxiety now people have moved on and have expectations from you to be normal all the while I have trouble just adjusting to everything around me. I cry too much for it to be normal. I shouldn't be so nervous so much or be afraid of what everyone thinks of me. I feel like if I had a friend it would help but I live in a different city this year....and then this year isn't helping 

I can't seem to find a job as I need to earn myself some money but its been over two months applying to every local restaurant, every chain, some warehouse, Target, car wash you name it. I've only had five interviews since and its extremely hard for me not to choke up, not to look anxious, and not to mumble. I am trying and I feel like my family thinks otherwise as I am once again a loser. I already can't stand it when they ask about my friends I don't have. I am though...I am not taking my college classes this semester as I don't have a laptop for online courses...I'm doing nothing besides being alive. I have no job, no money, not doing school, no friends, and have never been in a relationship as I know very well I am not ready to seek one (I doubt I can open up to show intimacy) I'm trying to be happy with my interests but those are all I got aside from my family...but they're basically all busy except for the weekends. But I need to branch out from them too.

I just don't know what it is. I've always been called sweet by people and have been in friend groups before, but I just fade in the background over time and am forgotten. I have never gotten in trouble or even been a part of drama, but maybe I shielded myself too much from others...I am decent looking I guess as I am trying to accept my body and continue to exercise...but I just feel defeated everyday. I'm always asked if I'm in a bad mood or why I don't talk much...and usually I'm not particularly in one and I naturally just don't talk much. This is the most I've talked (or typed) for strangers to see at once all year!

I'm sorry if I sound pathetic. I don't blame anything or anyone but myself for being so weak. I just get nostalgic of happier days, and then realize the sadness that the only people that appear in my dreams are those I knew from high school that I haven't see since...

I have visions of what it'd be like to be happy. What it'd be like later on...I always wanted to be a part of a friend group and travel and have fun with. I remember my childhood best friend and the faint memories of what it's like to have a sleep over, to talk to, and to feel supported. I'd be content even with just one close best friend again. After all the years wanting to finish school, I wish I can be with them all just to listen and feel like I'm a part of something. I've always wanted to live comfortably with a normal social life, I've always wanted to go on a date at a theme park, and I've always wanted to go to a baseball game with my dad. It's just sometimes I feel its impossible to be normal. It's impossible to get better. Some days I wake up and wish that I didn't.

I try to hold onto hope. I know I shouldn't give up, but its just so hard and I'm so weak. I couldn't help myself from crying again right now admitting all of this. And I'm posting this at such an odd time of the day as this is going through my head keeping me awake all night

2183,DLMND,1602243188,1,"Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. 

In my case, whenever I feel like my mind is on the fritz (thinking “I’m worthless”, “I don’t like this about me, I don’t like that about me”), I focus on my breath and I realize these thoughts don’t define me and I can live not limited by my damaged self esteem. Loneliness isn’t caused by what’s factually happening right now, no matter what I’m doing, but rather by these judgmental thoughts in my head. But we don’t have to let the thoughts control our lives 

We can just accept the fact that we feel lonely, that’s okay, we’re human; and use that for the betterment of our lives. Let it be your power to be more open to people and get the life you want. If you’re having trouble with social interaction, call a psychologist, book an appointment. If there are people in the world meant to understand what you’re going through, psychologists are definitely at the top. You can succeed if you keep pushing.

I have no friends, because I am not a very social person in the best of times, and I live in a foreign country. My job is to talk with people on the phone so that they can practice their English. It's the only social interaction I have apart from talking to/being with my kids. It makes me even more lonely because the people I talk to rarely ask anything about my life. I feel like a mirror. I'm just there to reflect them and help them improve. I don't blame them, but it's not good for my mental health. After my separation, I decided to try to become more social, and the pandemic happened. It's currently getting worse where I live, so social events with strangers are not safe at the moment. I'm not afraid of getting it, I'm afraid it would put me in quarantine, and I don't have anyone who could take of my day to day needs, like getting groceries. I joined a pen pal site, and made one friend, so that's a start. It's just a hard life.",lonely,Loneliness is being happy there's a fly in your room.,2020-10-09 18:41:41

2196,Ashley3Anne,1602226250,1,"I like to think I'm a good friend, even with low self confidence in other areas of my life, I can say for sure, I come through for people.

But I feel like no one cares as much about me as I do for them.

I feel this most when It comes to my birthday.

For the last few years I've dreaded my birthday, knowing it's the day I can feel extremely alone on.

Going back a few years to university,  I was the only person in the shared house that didn't get a birthday party thrown for them.

Even several other people who didn't live there I helped pay and organise some amazing parties for, and when It came to mine no one cared.

I actually spent that year on my own.

I've single handedly thrown Birthday parties for people I barely knew, just because I didn't want them to feel empty on their birthday.

Several of my friends birthdays where recently and despite having lost my job and having no income I hand crafted, saved and scraped up money for presents and organised events to make them feel special. 

And when It comes to my birthday, nothing.

It feeds into this feeling that no one cares about me the way I do for them. I love people in my life so much, and it just hurts.

But especially on this day.

Does anyone else feel this way?",lonely,My Birthday hurts,2020-10-09 17:50:50

The worst part of all of it is observing yourself spiral down into a dark hole that has no end in sight.

Asking myself every day what I did to deserve such loneliness and pain, started thinking maybe I was a monster in a past life.

Right now my bf, the streamer, and my bf's friend are in there playing a game but a few others have popped in and out. How do I know that you may ask? I've been watching it the whole time, it's been like 2 hours and I've been watching who is in the chat from the outside.

I do this a lot, I keep the discord open on another tab and I stay awake watching who is in it, wanting to join but being way too anxious. I watch people join and leave and sometimes keep up with the memes they post in the channel created for the voice chat. I watch the public info, like looking in a window. If there's ever a time to join one it's tonight, only 3 people in it and 1 I'm super comfortable with but no, my brain won't let me. I just watch from the outside wishing I had the courage to even just ask to join.

I heard enough times to just do it, just start etc etc but it all goes down the drain very quickly. And I think it's becouse I feel lonely.
Most of my day is spent inside, so maybe if I had someone who I love to support me, and for me to have someone to support back Ill probably feel way more liberated and just.. happy. At least I think that's the case.
I can't seem to find any other deep sources of all of that crap.
So.. I don't know why I'm even rambling about all of this. Maybe I can ask how do I limit my internet consumption?

There is this one guy I often find myself thinking about, he was a coworker of mine and he would always text me. I loved the attention but I never took him seriously because I knew he didn’t take me serious. I ended up leaving him on read because I knew he was just messing around. But it still hurts that I have never met someone willing to take me serious. It’s almost like I’m not good enough to be loved. I just hate feeling like this. I hate feeling vulnerable.

Nobody would really miss me and I can say that confidently. If this is what my life is going to be like I honestly am not going to want it for much longer. I know life is a gift but mine has been miserable and lonely lately as pathetic as it sounds. I don’t make it any easier on myself because I’m a pretty private person who is slow to open up to people. I am known to be pretty outgoing around people who I get to know but I don’t open up right away to new people. I mean it doesn’t matter due to the fact I haven’t been able to even really meet new people anyway. If I’m being honest I literally hug my pillow as I sleep because it’s the closest thing I can get to simulating something like touch or a hug.I came into college hoping I’d be able to make friends and meet new people and it has been the complete opposite and taking it’s toll on me.",lonely,"I’ve honestly never been so starved for a conversation, interaction, attention, human affection or touch.",2020-10-08 19:02:48

I signed up for a club at my university and made friends. We weren't that close but I know I could talk to them. I wasn't just a bystander anymore. I wasn't invisible like I was before. Most of the time I just met them during club meetings but I met two of the other members in private.

I got extremely close with one of them and even considered a relationship. And then everything went wrong.
Covid hit and everyone left the city to stay with family during lockdown. And no one contacted me. I tried to reach out but my messages were ignored. I wasn't mad and just waited because it was a difficult time for everyone.

We are back at uni now and still no one cares. We had an online club meeting with another club where I discovered that everyone from my club is together at the house of the person I got so close with. It's ten minutes away from me and no one asked if I wanted to come as well.

I feel so hurt and lost. Like everything was a lie and they just spent time with my out of pity. I wish I could run away and hide from everyone and never come back.

2300,unknown_marshmallow,1602133038,1,"I’ve been hospitalized on a mental health ward since January. When I was admitted I had a boyfriend who I cared about deeply and a friend I absolutely loved platonically. In March I broke up with my boyfriend and I ended up cutting things off in June because of some personal issues. It hurt a bit but it didn’t hurt that much because I was mostly angry and relieved.

In May my best friend texted me. The person I called my soulmate, who I loved immensely, who had been there for me and mostly visa versa for years, who I cuddled with and kissed platonically, told me they couldn’t bear to be my friend anyomore.

I fucked everything up. I didn’t communicate enough, I was distant, I had problems setting boundaries with my ex that made my best friend feel left out, I forgot to respond or left them on read. I was a terrible friend and I deserved what I got.

And now I have no one. I’ve started school in person but everyone there is bonding over smoking weed or drinking. They’re meeting up after school which is something I’m often either too tired to do or my parents won’t allow me to do. I hang around these people but I always feel like a tag along. I barely talk, I leave early at lunch to get to school on time instead of being late, I’m always walking at the back of the pack.

I wish I could have my best friend back but it would be unfair to them to try to rekindle our friendship when I can’t actually promise I’ll be better.

I miss having close friends. My family feels suffocating, as much as they try to be supportive. I feel trapped and I’m so lonely.

I just want hugs. I want someone to cuddle me. I want someone to stroke my hair and kiss me on the nose or the forehead. I want someone to watch tv shows with, I want someone who will tolerate when I pause a scene just to rant about how much I love it or hate it.

2317,cretinousgeorge,1602123660,1,"Feel free to ignore this post, this won't be anything special and there are other lonely souls here who deserve more attention, I'm mostly just rambling here.





I've felt suicidal and very depressed to varying degrees for seven years. Rarely does anything good in my life ever stick, no friendship has ever stayed good, I haven't had a proper relationship and I'm not the most desirable. Generally speaking I have absolutely nothing about myself that makes me special or unique, I have no talents or anything I'm actually good at and none of my hobbies or interests ever stay consistent. While I know this is pretty common for a lot of people I have found very little sustainable joy in pretty much anything at all.

I often feel as though my purpose to most people is to fulfill a need of theirs. To be more specific, I feel like with a lot of people that I'm only around because I'm needed in some way, not because I'm really wanted. I feel like if someone talks to me, chances are it's because they want someone to talk to rather than they want to talk to me. Take that sort of idea and you can apply it to more things, that's sort of what I'm on about what my purpose is. The variables and circumstances can differ greatly but those kind of things have caused me a lot misery  I'm not sure if that makes sense but I hope it makes at least some.

This year has been the worst for me so far and not because this year on its own or any personal crisis but rather what it's amounted to. Most social aspects of my life have staggered greatly since last year and have continued to decline to this day. I feel as though very few in my life actually make an effort for me, regardless of how much I have tried. I do not feel close to anyone in my life and I had my heart broken pretty hard and that meant nothing. Strangely enough lockdown and self isolation have been very minor factors in my plight although it has lead to previously mentioned social aspects worsening.

I have waited a long time for things to improve in a legitimate/long term way but nothing has. I have been somewhat patient about it and don't intent to stop it's just it would be nice to have something. I'm pretty tired of hearing the same things, I get a lot of pity and while I completely get that it's very well meaning it's just kinda tiring and patronising at points to hear repetitive things that come from people who just don't seem to understand completely.

None of this is to say that my suffering is entirely not my fault as it is probably mostly mine.

I don't think I will ever end up doing anything damaging or fatal to myself for a few reasons, one being that I'm legitimately too weak to harm myself properly, I have tried on my upper arm (so I can hide it easily) several times and my hand one time and I can never do anything that actually leaves any noticeable marks or damage and while this can be seen as a positive in one perspective, to me it just reinforces that I'm pretty useless. Another reason is that I'm a coward, I have very little courage to do anything that bad to myself out of a paranoia that I'll mess up in some way which ties into my last reason which is that I'm too picky on how I would take my own life, like really really fucking picky, the circumstances I would have to be in are near impossible.

I don't want to potentially make anyone afraid, especially considering I'm just a stranger. I don't have any real intention of taking my own life, I really really don't want to hurt my family, they've suffered enough as it is.",lonely,Been waiting a long time.,2020-10-08 13:21:00

2324,linnerz2000,1602118187,1,"Today I realised just how lonely I am in university. I mean yes I have a “group” but I don’t have someone inside that I’m particularly close to, I think they just tolerate me. 

Today I went to the toilet without locking my laptop. I mean I was sitting with some part of the “group”, and the thought that they were going to do what they were gonna do didn’t even cross my mind. Came back and saw them looking at my chat messages, specifically the one I had with another member of the “group” who wasn’t there. Don’t really what they were looking for and what other chats they had also looked at. It was only later at night I found out they had also impersonated me and messaged the boy I had ended things with. Saying things like “hi I wanna talk” which made things so awkward???!! Well lesson learnt, now I know to never leave my laptop unlocked again.

Worse part is that one of the girl just msged me saying “oi im sorry” whilst sitting next to me. The other 2 didn’t even say anything. Maybe I’m being dramatic but I felt so disrespected and violated. To them it probably didn’t even mean anything and I think they won’t even rmb this in the future. Why am I so hung up on something so seemingly trivial?? 

I told the girl in the “group” whose chat they were looking at about this but she didn’t even feel angry on my behalf. Didn’t want to tell the others as I didn’t want to start drama but I at least expected her to be a little annoyed. Well guess what, she and the girls who violated my privacy has since been closer than ever. That makes where I stand super obvious does it not :) 

Today I went home and waited till my mum was sleeping before cutting myself. I have so much pent up anger and I don’t have anyone to open up to. I’m kinda angry at myself for cutting but on the other hand I understand why I’m doing this.

2328,atomicExistentialism,1602115495,1,"Ive been on this group a while and the negativity is something else, with good reason, so I've tried to be positive in this, and I'm going to try and give a quick summary on what loneliness is. For those who haven't seen the Kurzgesagt video, here's a brief explanation about the biological nature.

Since the dawn of time we're social creatures. Our interactions with other humans are just like eating food, breathing and drinking water. What happens if you're starving, dehydrating or suffocating? Your body floods you with hormones in the same way as if you're being chased by a snake to try and stimulate it. Helps you catch that deer, run away from that bear, swim to the surface, run to the pond. However in the modern day, many of these hormones have the same effect. They make you paranoid.

This same thing happens with a lack of interaction. You go into overdrive. You begin micro-analysing every little expression but most of the time, this backfires. The body gets worse at interpreting social interactions and turns pessimistic, you misinterpret good or neutral expressions for neutral or negative. As a result it gets worse, your body continues to tell you you're doing something wrong. But not how to fix it. This causes a feedback loop, and can negatively affect life expectancy, as many of those hormones cause harm in prolonged doses.

I would recommend you watch the Kurzgesagt video on YouTube. Just type 'What is Loneliness Kurz' he explains it a lot better than me. He also offers some basic solutions, and you never know, you might find some of his other stuff interesting.",lonely,The Truth About Loneliness,2020-10-08 11:04:55

I am a 23 yo girl. In the last two years I ""lost"" a lot of friendships along the way.
The girl that was supposed to be my best friend of 9 years ""ghosted"" me (I don't even know if it makes sense in this context) after she started dating one of my friends. 
My group of friends excluded me once I moved in a new city to study, not calling me to go out when I was here or just ignoring my messages when I proposed to got out. Some of them were male friends that lost interest in the friendship when they fully understood there wasn't going to be anything more; some were just some superficial ""group"" friends. I tried to reach out with some of them in the past to rebuild bridges but it just made me feel more lonely and stupid to notice how little they cared.

I tried to create new relationships in the new city but after less than 1 year the lockdown brought me back in my hometown. I can say I have 2 real friends from the city I used to live in and some friends from my year abroad I talk to sporadically. I wouldn't know who to call just to go and grab a coffee here. It's been like this for months and I don't know what to do anymore. Since in the last 3 years I was always busy with university and living abroad, I never really had the time to fully metabolize it, but being stuck at home in my hometown during quarantine really threw it in my face. 

I don't have a stable relationship right now, I go out with guys I meet on apps but I understood that's not really what im looking for at the moment. I have to live here with my family at least until January and I don't know how to meet new people because of the Corona situation. I'm writing my dissertation for my master and don't have to go to classes anymore. The job I'm doing is also online and will end soon, without even meeting my coworkers in person. 
I'm living a very alienating life, which brings me anxiety, panic attacks and anger episodes against my family.

Around two years ago I met this girl who I consider being my best friend, but for the past year I have felt really lonely by her side. I do and give my everything for her while I get nothing in return. I tried meeting up with her during my worst times but she always declined, even though I was always clear on why I even wanted to meet up with her. I spend all my days alone at home, because I have nobody I could talk to, have fun with, enjoy nice time outside. My friend was a couple days ago clear about not wanting to meet up with me. All she talks about is how excited she is about moving in with her boyfriend to the other end of the country, and I feel like an awful friend for wanting her to break up with him. I never told her about this, but it wouldn't her bother anyway, because he always comes first. It was actually since she started dating him that I fell out of her picture.

I eventually started losing all hope for a better friendship for us. It feels way too one sided. But it's unbelievable to see how a person close to you can make you feel so lonely.

I see all those people around who spend their days and nights outside with their friends and having, and it always makes me question everything. How can they do this? How are they able to just become friends with everyone? Is there something wrong with me?

And what makes me feel even worse is that I feel ungrateful for crying about something like this, but I can't help it. I feel like there is an empty space in my heart and I just want to fill it up with just one person.

Usually in these relationships, I’d show more interest and care for them, and they therefore get bored of me with time. Because of this I believe there’s something wrong me, it makes me feel undesirable, unwanted, and unloved. Why am I always loving others more than they love me?

The recent event that made these feelings even worse is my ex coming back into my life. I initiated the breakup out of fear that he didn’t love me anymore, so I did it before he did, he confirmed it when he told me he was going to break up with me. It’s been several months and now my ex is back into my life but now again I’m feeling so fucking stupid because he’s told me he’s talking to a girl and I’m still in love with him.

Moving away from everybody I knew and leaving the past behind was exactly what I wanted - a clean slate and a fresh start. On top of all of that, I promised myself I’d be more confident, and try and involve myself with others more. I wanted to escape the cycle of anxiety and depression I had built for myself. 


The day of moving in to uni, I fucked it up. I hid away in my room for a large majority of the day, and I failed to make a good first impression with any of my housemates. Long story short, all five of them went out to a freshers event that night without me, and I completely understand why. They then talked and partied in the kitchen while I was too afraid to join them. 


That was nearly a week ago, and nothing’s changed. I’ve barely spoken to a few of my flatmates, and I’m sure some of them haven’t even seen me since that night. As much as I want to be friends with them, I find myself too scared to approach them. I’ve given them no reason to like me so far, so I doubt they’ll appreciate me pursuing a conversation with them. 


The thing that really saddens me about this is that freshers was essentially my only chance at making friends for a while. I have no in person classes or lectures, and most of the campus societies are cancelled. I’m going to rot away in a house that actively makes me anxious for the next year, and I would have completely ruined my chances at turning my life around. If I drop out, I’m exactly where I started, but I won’t get anywhere staying here either.


If I tell my family I’m not feeling happy, they’ll get me sectioned again - no question. I have no friends or peer relations to reach out to, so I guess this is my last resort.

2361,Joshkoshtosh,1602089935,1,"Warning: this is going to be a long post

I’m in my 20’s and I’ve never really felt like I belonged much of anywhere. I had friends growing up. Not much but enough. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression around 15. I used to go to therapy and take medication but it didn’t last a year. I’ve kind of just been dealing with it myself ever since (just to give some context as why i feel as strongly as I do).

After I graduated high school a few years ago, 90% of my friends moved away. Like far away... as in across the country. The only friends that stayed around are the ones who basically already started their lives and families. I’m still in college and I plan on moving as well after I graduate, but that could take up to another year and idk if I can handle this another year.

I met this guy (yes I’m gay) last year. We actually became really good friends and we consider each other best friends at this point. I developed feelings and he didn’t feel the same (of course). At the time he was just settling into his sexuality and wasn’t really comfortable with “gay dating”. Even went as far to tell me he could never be with a man romantically. I let it go and I try not to harp on it with him because we’re really good friends and he’s pretty much the only friend I talk to or hang out with on a regular basis now. I don’t have anyone else.

Anyway... fast forward a few months, and he has a boy friend now. I have so many emotions going through my head. I’m angry, hurt, sad, etc. he’s been telling me for months that he could never be with a man and I would be his first choice if he ever decided to try it, etc. and now he’s with someone else. We still hang out but I don’t see him like I used to... for obvious reasons. And I know I have to be happy for my friend but it’s so hard when I have to watch him be with another guy after everything he’s told me.

I feel lied to. I feel betrayed. I feel lonely. I’m hurt. I don’t feel good enough for anyone. I can’t help but think why not me? At this point it’s mentally hard and draining trying to remain as good if friends because I just feel bitterness every time I see him now. But at the same time, I genuinely care about him and we are legitimate friends even with my feelings aside. I don’t just want to drop him because he technically hasn’t done anything to me.

I don’t really have a purpose for posting this other than to vent, because as I’ve stated, I only have one friend and this is about him lol

I guess I’m asking how can I get over my bitterness? Or how can I find another guy to fawn over? Or how do I get rid of feelings in general? Whatever you think would help me.",lonely,I feel terrible. Lied to. Alone. Not good enough. Everything negative you can think of.,2020-10-08 03:58:55

2363,QuoteExternal2731,1602085712,1,"During my childhood, I thought prioritizing my education and working hard on my academic and career goals would put me in a good position in life and make me happy. I was of course wrong, as after all this I am still a 21 M virgin, and I can't even get excited about the prospect of going to medical school because I am so alone.

In reality, many people in my life made it apparent to me just how worthless and pathetic they viewed me as because I tried hard in school. Despite the fact that I had other interests and wanted to be a well-rounded person, mostly everyone in my life based my entire identity and their image of me on my intelligence and the fact that I was just some nerd who spent too much time studying. Despite knowing very well that other things matter besides education, no one in my life wanted to see past my GPA or academic accomplishments. In school, I lied about my grades so that others would not view me as intelligent, just because I hated being given this identity so much.

What I've come to realize is that those people are right. Prioritizing my education did nothing for my life and only made me a miserable virgin. Not only that, despite trying so hard, I've never been able to form the identity for myself that I want. I feel as though so many social and romantic opportunities were unavailable to me just because people don't like hanging out with or dating people they view is nerds, and that this prevented me from developing into the person I wanted to become.

I am so sad and alone. I wasted my childhood and college years and have nothing to show for it. While everyone else has had multiple sexual experiences and memories of spending time with others, I'm stuck with my worthless GPA and valedictorian award from a high school where no one gave a shit about who I was. 

All the hard work I did in life was pointless, and I know that if I was a worse student or less intelligent my life would not be like this. I hate the expectations that are placed on intelligent people to do well while also having to face the expectations of being able to get laid, be muscular and built, and every other masculine quality that I lack. I am tired of constantly hearing the lie that because I'm intelligent and because I have career prospects that my life is great and that I should feel happy. Everyone in my life who has everything I want didn't try for jack shit in life and realized just how worthless academics and education is.

For all those who feel alone on their birthday, it does hurt and it does suck. To feel special is a wonderful feeling and in a sense, we truly are all special in our own way... we can only hope someone would recognize that and acknowledge it.

So, this post is being written for all those who are feeling/felt lonely on their birthday. For what was/is supposed to be a wonderful and exceptional day, still very much is. YOU are someone distinctive and someone valuable and I am thinking of YOU. YOU are what keeps this community strong and you may not get from it what you feel you need, but there is someone out there taking the time to read and reply to YOUR post... YOUR message you are sending to the world. Someone is taking the time for YOU and that is better than no acknowledgment at all. 

And if you ever happen to pass over a birthday post, make sure you give it a thumbs up and leave a kind comment, as that comment make make that person's special day. Any kind gesture, however small, is a significant one.  So thank you lonely community, for supporting one another and giving your literally valuable time, to one another.

2378,bluekitten123,1602067887,1,"So, I’m a 16 year old girl who’s at college and without sounding vain I know I’m considered attractive. In theory, my life should be a breeze. I should have tons of friends and a boyfriend and I should never feel alone because at this age being good looking is usually the only qualification for popularity. 

However, I have never been able to find a friendship group because no one is like me. The ‘popular’ girls who dress like me and look like me are usually VERY dumb and are all carbon copies of each other with no personality. They label every ‘quirk’ as weird and in order to be their friend you must sit and talk about their boyfriend as they don’t have the intelligence to speak about anything interesting. I try and conform to that persona but popular girls have always had a habit of shunning me and I don’t know why. I am nice to them but maybe because I don’t have that aggressive streak they all have I don’t seem fun enough.

I have always gotten along much better with boys. To boys, I can make jokes about whatever I want and they don’t tend to label it as weird. I’m smart enough to realise that a lot of them have other motives than being my ‘friend’ so it makes me paranoid that even the people who allow me to be myself probably still do think it’s weird but just want to get me into bed.

No matter how many people I’m surrounded by, I feel alone because I have never had a strong connection with anybody, I’m smarter than most people my age so I enjoy intelligent conversations that no one can provide me with. I am waiting until I’m 18 to get a boyfriend so that I can get with someone a bit older as I’m hoping that will make them smarter.

I woke up from a dream today in tears. It was a dream where I was in a relationship, and surrounded by friends. It just seemed like a typical day of that life. I can’t remember how I got there, but everything just seemed so happy. Then I woke up. I was alone. I’m not in a relationship. I don’t have many friends. I’m just a second year at uni unsure of my future. I don’t know who those people were, but it felt like I lost something. I wished so hard for the dream to be true, for some miracle to be real, but of course it wasn’t. If anything, I wanted to at least dream for a little longer.

I want to run away from reality.

My coping mechanism is to just imagine scenarios, like maybe I met someone or made a good friend. I do have some friends, but I can’t help but feel a little lonely seeing others with their whole group. The amount of real friends I have is an amount you can count with one hand. Maybe it’s a bit selfish, but sometimes I want more. I see all these people having fun and hanging out with their friends, and I wish I could as well. Normally I was the one making effort to celebrate occasions like my friends’ birthdays, but no one ever celebrated mine.

I feel really useless. I normally get too scared to actually socialize and back out last minute if I had plans to improve myself. I remember walking away from a place where a uni society social was being held and when I went home I cried. I didn’t even make my university friends myself. They were friends that my old school friend made. I can’t help but feel frustrated by how pathetic I am, and I try so hard to at least progress a step but I can’t. 

University is a lot lonelier than I expected. I thought it would be an opportunity to socialise and it would probably be the best years of my life, but I was pretty wrong. I got put in a flat in a quiet zone with people that were all shut-ins. It feels like I was just dealt a bad card in life, by the time social events were occurring everyone were just with their flatmates, having so much fun. I spent my first year pretty much alone. I knew some people at the start, but then we drifted apart. Now it’s second year, and with the pandemic, I don’t even have an opportunity to try and make up for it.

She tells me that I’m a bitch or I’m stupid, I’m lazy I never do anything. My mother compares me to other kids such as my cousins. And always sees how much better they are compared to me. How well they do in school compared to me or how much of a better kid they are to me. I write stories but none of them will read it, I have achievements such as my medals for athletics but none of them will acknowledge me. I do well in English, Biology, Chemistry, French, Creative Writing And even History But my mom always tells me I’m stupid due to my Algebra being so low. I believe I am, all my life I’ve been the lonely kid at home. My two sisters would always gang up against me (and they still do) whenever we got into a fight. My mom would always take their side. I’d always lose each fight and my little brother (he can’t help me nor talk to me.) it hurts, he’s right there yet I feel so lonely. My father left my family due to both my mom and him fighting. She keeps drilling it into our heads that his a bad person. But I feel like I’m slowly becoming him. Maybe it’s his curse I don’t know. My dads family was never close and I hate to say this (but I don’t think I’ll be close with my family either) I’ve been alone soo much I find the darkness comforting, I still talk to people at school and make friends with them because I care about them. I don’t want anyone to end up like me....I’d never wish that on one soul (Including my Brothers). I fear that if this all continues which I believe it will. I’ll end up just like the man alone in his castle (A.K.A. - My Dad.) I won’t want to have any interactions with my family, I won’t want to have any human interactions at all in fear of getting hurt or hurting someone. I wish I knew what to do, part of me wishes this too. I wish I was a better person or maybe I didn’t exist at all. It would be best if I didn’t. I could end my life but I’m too scared too, but my body wants me to. My Soul doesn’t. I’m scared of what will happen to me after I’m gone....I just wish i knew what to do.

2406,RunningOuttaSunlight,1602043506,1,"Hey everyone, I'm posting here this one time to try and vent tonight- but I'm not going to make it a reoccurring thing because I've seen firsthand how miserable you can get when you let loneliness be the center of your life 


I've been alone my entire life, and the ever-increasing chances of me dying alone is a hard pill to swallow when I watched all my friends get into relationships in high school (and some are even married to this day). It was even harder when they introduced their girlfriends to the circle of friends I was a part of. It was even **worse** the day my ""friends"" made a facebook page: ""Get &lt;my full name&gt; a girlfriend"" and invited my crush. I wish not all good things came to end, because it seems this looming... ""Issue""... Is here to stay.




This isn't an easy thing to post, because I'm sure a handful of people are going to read something like this and immediately type ""lol virgin"" or something to that extent in the comments. Hell, outside of my own typing, I can already hear the clacking of y'all's mechanical keyboards going to town typing the same damn thing I'm talking about right now. 




I'd like to think I'm a simple man. While unmotivated outside of work, I put in 110% while on the clock and actually *enjoy* a hard day's work... I guess that's an oxymoron innit 



Either way, what I'm trying to get at is, I've never wanted much in life. Sure, I'll go out and splurge every so often : A brand new computer that doesn't run like ass, a cool revolver as an eventual nest egg for my future hypothetical kids... Yet, as time goes on, I begin to adapt to the idea that maybe there *ain't* a lid for every pot. 



I'm going to be 25 next year, and yet the closest thing I've ever had to a ""relationship"" was a ""long distance thing"" for five years. That's a story for another day, but needless to say I'm not entirely sure if I fully recovered from investing so many feelings, so much time into a girl that was fully aware she never wanted to meet me since day one. 



It really does a number on your self-esteem when the general consensus is ""There's someone for everyone and if you're single, it must be something wrong *you're* doing. Take a shower sometime, neckbeard."" I had girls pick on me way back in middle school when my self-esteem was supposed be developing. Most guys would get the usual ""bro I think she likes you..."" I got ""Hey, see that girl that stares at you every so often from the back of the class? She told me that she's **terrified** of you and that's her way of making sure you don't get anywhere near her.""



I'd like to think I'm not horribly ugly... Until I try places like /r/rateme and Photofeeler. People will swear up and down the street not to trust these places because they're all people with inflated egos trying to make themselves feel better, and honestly I'd almost be inclined to believe that. The problem is, though, that I can't trust the people in my life to give it to me straight. Friends would say shit like ""you're not **that** bad looking,"" and my Ma doesn't say much outside of ""you're a handsome young man"" and ""well **WHEN** you get married you can..."" like she's obligated to, like a supporting parent would. 



I'd rather the opinions of complete strangers at this point because they have nothing to lose by telling the truth. It doesn't exactly help that I had chemo as a kid and it stunted my growth, because that's not a good enough excuse for women in the dating world. I mean, hell - what girl wants to date a guy that's shorter than her? 



People on here swear up and down the street that ""&lt;looks, height, weight&gt; doesn't matter, it's all about what's inside"" yet I can't even get my foot in the door **because** of my looks. Photofeeler? **Three out of the 75** women that saw my photo said I was attractive. Sure that gives a sliver of hope, but they're the same people that constantly rate high so I can't imagine it was anything towards me in particular. /r/rateme ? **Two**, on a good day -- which is actually 3 more than I thought I'd get. I could go on, but I think you get the idea...




Circling back to the ""neckbeard"" thing before you get the wrong idea, though... I have a soul patch on my chin -- that's it. I hate anime, mountain dew sucks and the only time I'll buy doritos is to light them up to show everyone how much oil the chips are drenched with. Seriously- try it sometime. A single dorito could be a fire starter in a pinch



Anyway, this is kinda a long post just to say ""am lonely,"" but that's all this post is about. I've tried all I could to get out of this. Lost some weight, gained it again, got a job, left to get **another** job, got several different hobbies, lost my glasses and got contacts (which seemed to be the hardest fuckin thing on that list, ironically enough), got a new haircut, tried some new music genres to make me more interesting, tried dating subs, tried dating *apps* ... It all seems to be in vain when this was the same advice people kept pounding into my head since the beginning. A buddy of mine even tried hooking me up with a girl. She ghosted me, **and** him for introducing me to her. Or, so he says.... Maybe he's dating her now. Who knows?

That feeling of them fluttering so hard that you swear you could feel their little wings grazing against your heart and it takes your breath away. 

The first time they say hello and it's the most amazing sound you think you have ever heard in your life. That first wink.....and you smile so hard that you are absolutely sure your face is has frozen and that you might look a bit crazy but you don't care.

That shiver of excitement that runs up your spine when you hear the PING! of their text coming through. Wondering how to keep the conversation alive and not sound dumb at the same time. All of the firsts of meeting someone new. The high of getting to know and eventually, hopefully falling in love with that person.

I miss it..........I miss the lusty glances, the passionate kisses. The way your skin lights on fire at their touch. The scent of their cologne and the way they smell fresh out of the shower.

I know what you're thinking....not everything is champagne and sunflowers. What about the fights? The little annoying habits you notice. When you start getting all comfortable and they make noises you've never heard before and the funky morning breath and  the toenail clippings all over the floor and the hair clogging up the shower....again.

Yes. I even miss those moments. Where it gets hard and scary and words are shot at each other  and feelings are hurt and there you go making your bed on the couch. Why do I miss those? Because that's when you find out how strong you are.....how strong they are and if what you have is all smoke and mirrors or if it's solid and stable.

2441,cassie_to_heart,1602029823,1,"Much of my life and certainly after living in Australia for 12 years, I haven't found anyone that I could connect with. Compound with a series of negative and harsh experiences, I've grown tired and wary of connecting people here geographically and just with people, in general.

The things have happened in this particular order: 1) Having lost my friendships over a previous partner *(served in the Marine Corps)*... calling me f\*cked in the head for choosing a guy like him especially given his former background... whom accepted me as MtF trans 2) lost my previous partner when it came to a dilemma of him vs. career ambition 3) Lost any confidence and chances for my then-Nursing career when I made subtle, major mistakes that ended up compromising patient safety during clinicals and in turn, not trusting myself and reassessing my stage in life from hereon.

I've had a stringent criteria for guys in terms of a prospective friendships. But after searching for a year in my life of ever-present loneliness and isolation and not having any fruitful outcomes, maybe I'm going to start becoming more carefree and relaxed in my criteria....

With the traits I value in people especially guys, it's those who are fiercely loyal, caring and who share an unspoken understanding that life often isn't kind to some people. Some people get the short straw. Most importantly, it's the value weighted of people taking each other... and if I were to make a comparison, fellow infantry/grunts in the military dropping their bags to help their fellow buds in their unit when help was needed/asked. I try to implement that military mindset into my life.

There isn't enough people who believe as I do. And with some people, I guess I care too much for others and sometimes it works.... sometimes it doesn't but I'm owning it and I will not waiver from it. Nonetheless, I still feel extraordinary isolated.

It doesn't help that my existing, perhaps only male friend *(nothing romantic)* is in a 2 month long MC training rotation deep in the foxholes and looking at the stars and having to wake up with a message that the brass has given his unit the green light has left me a little lonely in that I'll miss him... hopefully, no mishaps in training exercises. He's one of an only, male friend who's equal in my age who understands my sentiments. I miss his cynical attitude of a jarhead...

I'd like to have a **close, perhaps intimate, extremely affectionate male friend** whom I could feel I could place a significant amount of vulnerability of myself, trust and safety.

Regular voice calls and if I feel comfortable, video calls as well *(though I feel extraordinarily self conscious since I'm MtF trans)*. One who's very open to having everyday calls.

I'll be moving over to the US *(in particular, the Fox Cities Area in WI)* though it will be in the distant future *(maybe in a few years)* since I'm in an LDR.

Now my partner knows about my desire to have a close friend who's extremely affectionate, kind open-minded and understanding.... stemming from the manifestation of my crippling fear and anxiety in the possibility that my partner *(who carries all these traits)* might pass away suddenly or from a tragic accident. His words: ***""I'll write two letters, one to you and one to your male friend. It won't be opened until that day comes but when that day does come, I want him to know how my female partner would like to be treated and the fact that she does not want and can't be alone...ever.""***

I don't want to have an epiphany where I realize if he does pass away, I have no else to turn to. I want my male friend to know how much my partner means to me... in that he's been the only one who saw me for who as I really am... soul and mind of a woman in a man's body. For a male friend to reciprocate the affection/intimacy I have for my partner and be reminded by being understanding &amp; open-minded, it means a lot to me in that my male friend would too understand me as the woman I am... having no qualms about it. In a sense, he'd be akin to like a second partner... with benefits of a relationship minus some things of course *(some things I choose to just reserve for my partner)*

I will say, that if you are a guy who is into hunting/firearms/fixing cars/manual labor, you are encouraged to feel free to respond back in kind to my post. You could be a total dude's dude and that won't really faze me. I'm very open-minded for a person and in fact, I try to encourage that sort of thing with any male friends.

And please refrain from sending messages of platitudes and that of me going to therapy... that has not worked for me during those 12 years.

Now, one last thing is if you're intention is to try and connect with me then disappear knowing I'm at my most vulnerable, don't bother to try and message me. I've had my fair share of them already. And any ""Hey/Hi/Hello"" posts will be swiftly blocked.",lonely,"21F - Extremely lonely gal not having any close male friendships for 12 years seeking very affectionate, open-minded, kind and understanding men",2020-10-07 11:17:03

I just want to say that it sucks being alone but doesn't mean you're lonely. I've been thinking about my past and wondering why I burn so many bridges of my friendships. Its that they never cared about me in the present moment, people like to say certain words tell you certain things to keep you around to be the toy so they can play with because of youre just a nice person and willing to be there for them so when you want the favor to return back to you. Suddenly everyone is busy, can't answer the phone, or truly never cared to begin with. It's hard to separate oneself heading towards a journey of being alone too carry the weight on the shoulders, in reality, you've always had and always will. No matter the amount of people in your corner or not remember the one who wakes up behind your own eyes are you. Don't let other people discourage you from your dreams or tell you to do something else in your life cause they don't see the full potential you have.  Remember act like you're the shit but don't stink don't like these clones stop you from being pure.

“If we hide or hinder ourselves in fear of rejection of others, are we not in essence, rejecting ourselves first?”

17[M] In junior high I was one of the “cool” kids who had tons of friends, I played sports and would often hangout with kids on the team, also loved skating so I’d spend time with the skater dudes, and I was in the advanced classes so I would occasionally hangout with the smart kids. It seemed like there was really no one who DIDNT like me but man when I got into high school did that all change.

Freshman year I decided I wouldn’t play football so I could focus more on school and my grades, I noticed how quickly everyone’s view of me changed and once I was on the outside I could see how the entire football team were dicks and I saw how they treated people so I decided I’d not associate with them anymore. As soon as that happened everything changed and by sophomore year I only had three friends. After that I switched schools due to how toxic of an environment my current school became. Ever since then I’ve had not a single friend and that’s not exaggerating, I’ll just lay at home by myself every single day, time has flown by and I’m almost off to college now.

This is at the same time telling of my deep longing for love, a clear indication of something my heart truly desires for; and the source of a great deal of frustration, proof that in the end I am incapable of forgoing my own needs for the a greater cause.

I want for love. This desire seemingly appeared out of nothingness around when I grew out of childhood. It tucked itself away in a little corner of my heart observing until one day it erupted and took over my being. I fought my own desire, as I have become accustomed to sate my frugal nature, but alas I could not win. Over the course of a few years it consumed my very being.

My journey during these changes, taught me the folly of seeking love out of mere sexual attraction. I found myself lying next to someone in bed at dawn and at the same time wishing I was alone. I took this lesson to heart, but was soon distracted by another desire that had appeared in my soul: the quest for my mark on the world. So I set forth hoping to accomplish both. It was however down a path that took me further away from one.

I must say at this juncture, that for all this I have never been alone. I have people I treasure in my life. I am neither inept at the art of navigating a club at 2am nor am I so insecure that I find it difficult to express myself. Nay, my problems are of love. My problems are one that my peers, for whom romance seems to come as naturally as breathing, do not understand.

So now I lie in bed at 5:30 am in the middle of global crisis— a quarter of a century old. Outwardly performing well in comparison to my peers: a person who has made great progress in the game of capitalism. Yet, I find that for all my work and my effort to be a force for good in the world I am still lacking. Lacking in human warmth to replace the cushions I find myself embracing in the dark.",lonely,Musings at 5am,2020-10-06 23:57:39

I had no friends there, all my friends (all 5 of them, now more like 3) lived 250 miles away. I was alone most days that year, except for working in a warehouse early AM and when i would see my ex girlfriend once a week or so. 

It has changed me a lot and i am very easily troubled by loneliness now. I actually thought i used to be mentally tough lol. 

It's been what 17 months and i have ups and downs in mood, and even months have gone by where i feel emotionally stable if nothing else. I moved back around my friends in May and it helped a lot initially. Felt like a new start and everything, finally. But now i've been here 6 months and have settled back into a monotonous depressing life, and hate this apartment already.

A couple of times i have met a girl i became interested in, talked a little bit, not ended up as anything. Every time i feel lonely i still think of my ex. It's like she's become the symbol of how it feels to have love around you. Like my body remembers how it was and wants to go back there when i wake up feeling lonely or try to go to bed at a reasonable time.

It's been so long, we don't talk anymore, she asked not to a long time ago. I so easily turn to the memories when i'm lonely, i try not to. I truly want her to just be happy and do what she wants to, but i don't know how to be that myself. I'm so tired of feeling bad, of feeling slight relief from therapy sessions and friends but then returning to this feeling. Having days of no social interaction is tough.

# *a b o u t  m e*
**personality**: i’m an infj fo the core. if there’s anything that i fail to mention, you can find it by searching up 16personalities. generally speaking, i’m a laid back person that can be a little shy at first. i’ve been told that i’m easy to talk to, and people feel at east with me. my voice is soothing, yet deep and i “sound like i’m narratoring audio books, even when i’m pissed off.” &lt;— a friend told me that, which quickly became my go to description of my voice lmao. i’m not white to anger, and i like bringing others happiness. i like to have fun and can be immature, but i can be serious when needed. 

**animals**: i have three dogs and one cat, all of which i love dearly. let’s exchange pet pictures and share funny stories!!

**video games**: at the moment, i mostly play valorant and dead by daylight. i also own among us, fall guys, and phasmophobia (which i have yet to play). if i’m feeling lazy, i like lounging around while playing animal crossing—still looking for a terraform pro to give me a few lesions. 

**music**: i’m the type of person to listen to the same songs and albums on repeat. recently, those have 
been ‘nectar’ by joji and ‘blood harmony’ by finneas. i prefer sad, mellow songs over upbeat ones. if you’ve got any suggestions, that’s an easy way to my heart. 

**shows**: i haven’t watched anything new recently, apart from ‘cobra kai.’ i’d like to check out ‘away’ as well as a few other netflix originals, or shows that i haven’t gotten the chance to watch yet. tell me your favorite show(s) and let’s watch them together!

**movies**: i’m planning on rewatching the ‘scream’ movies, and i’d love to have someone to watch them with! once i’ve finished those, i plan to move onto the ‘halloween’ films and go from there. just like with music and shows, i’m open to new things.

you’re an animal lover. ideally, you game too.. 
or you’re at least willing to try ones like among us (free on mobile). you’re open minded and have similar morals—treat people with kindness, support minorities, fight for those whose voice cannot be heard. you enjoy messaging and calls; i understand if you need a bit of time to warm up, i likely do too. 

above all, i’d like to form meaningful connections with people. if you think we’d get along well, send me a chat. looking forward to hearing from you, don’t keep me waiting too long. :)",lonely,25m - seeking longterm friendships.,2020-10-06 15:16:11

This year for many has been difficult because of Covid alone. The isolation it’s caused, the distancing of people you usually see or hang out with. 

Now, being an election year, you’re isolated more from those who support the opposing political party. I’m not old enough to have experienced many elections, but it wasn’t like this not too long ago. I’ve been shunned by those who have opposing beliefs than I. Those who I once called close friends are now people who don’t speak to me. I never decided who I spoke with or became friends with based on a political leaning. I’ve felt empty for a long time. Now, its just an added emptiness to an ever expanding thought of darkness of feeling continuous abandonment.

I was watching a reality tv show where multiple people are dropped off in a remote location and they have to survive off the land for a certain number of days in order to win a substantial amount of money. 

One of the female contestants was having a rough go and she was remembering how she would work through her troubles w/ her partner and seek comfort in them during difficult times. 
As she was crying about not having her support system I realized I was annoyed and had zero sympathy for her. 

In the same moment I realized how callused I’ve become. There have been countless times where all I wanted was someone to lean on and talk me down off the ledge I’d worked myself up to and had zero help. I’ve been alone for almost all of the important/tough decisions and moments in my life and simply had to deal.

I'm 25, and I feel like I lost friends/my current friends don't invite me to do anything because I don't drink (pandemic aside, of course). 

What set me off tonight in my own thoughts is that weeks ago, I asked my friend, who I've known my whole life, to get dinner with me on her day off at a restaurant she's never been to but has been wanting to go to. We made plans days in advance, and then of course the morning of she canceled on me. Like she always does when we make plans.

My nan and grandad are whining saying I need to go in for my GCSEs but my mom has been the worst.

At first she was supportive saying I could have the day off but now she’s pressuring me to go in when I know I can’t. She just doesn’t understand that I mentally can’t do school right now. She doesn’t see to care about my mental health so long as I go into school. Just the other day she told me that I was being stupid and needed to just get over it. I haven’t told her but it really hurt because I know I’m being silly but I can’t help it. Like I wanna go in and get good grades but I can’t help this anxiety that comes over me when I think about school. 

I feel like my most support is my five year old sister who doesn’t even what’s going on. My mom just brushes me off, my Nan and grandad just whine and get mad, and my brother teases me about it. I’ve never felt more alone when I need help the most. 

My mom wonders why I can’t talk to her and it’s because when I do, she brushes me off. She doesn’t understand that I’m not okay and I’m not normal. That I can’t just get over it.

I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone without them brushing me off. And school just isn’t helping. I don’t know what to do

TLDR; my mom keeps invalidating me and making me feel worse about myself when I really need some support. Any advice would be appreciated but I’m not expecting any",lonely,I feel so alone when I need help the most,2020-10-06 09:07:54

I wasn't looking for a hook up just someone to talk to and possibly date. I matched with this beautiful girl so out of my league I was certain she was a bot. She wasn't. We hit it off but as always, there was a catch. She is from Sweden. I know everyone's catfish flag just went up but that isn't the case here. We started face timing and pen paling. She sends me things from Sweden and I send her things from the US. After a few months of talking we decided we liked each other and we made plans to meet in Egypt in March. Then covid hit. Leaving when we might be able to meet up uncertain. Forcing agates we continued to talk. Wewould always start the day with a ""good morning"" and end it with a ""goodnight"" ...until last week. I noticed that I was talking to her with very little responses. Then one day there wasn't a good night. And the next day there wasn't a good morning followed by another silent night. I don't know what is happening or why she's suddenly gone. I asked if things were OK and she told me that she's fine. I left it at that. Writing this seems foolish at 36 years old but here I am. I don't know what to say day to her anymore. The emptiness that she had filled is starting to make itself known. The kind that tears at your chest and reminds you that you have no one to hold. That no one has ever cared enough to stay.

2590,TinaTiger13,1601923770,1,"You might see this as immature because this takes place in my current life: high school. 

Ever since I left elementary school, I have realized that many of my friends were changing. They started to develop new interests and started wanting new friendships. Although I only had 2 friends before, 2 or even 1 was enough for me. They began slowly drifting away. It was subtle until it finally hit that I was losing them, losing them to a more popular crowd. I understand why they would want that. Who doesn’t want more friends. No one wants to be the kid that no one remembers in high school. So they left. This broke me. I felt I had no one. No one to talk to. No one to laugh with. No one to share happy moments. I felt truly lonely. 

I read an article that mentioned, “Relationships are the most important overall contributor to happiness.” Knowing this made me feel even worse about myself. It made me feel like I wasn’t capable of happiness. It made me want to think about everything wrong with me, the reason why I could get or even keep any friendship. I started to think about every flaw I had. ‘Too ugly. Too boring. Too annoying. Too needy. Too pathetic.’ I thought about my looks. ‘Maybe it’s my nose. Or lack of breasts. Maybe it‘a cause I’m too hairy for a girl. Or cause I don’t try enough.’ I thought how I could change, but not in a good way. “I should start wearing makeup to hide my ugly face. I should start wearing cloths that are more revealing. I should start acting like someone else, like the pretty, popular girls.” 

All these thoughts raced through my head until I just gave up. I didn’t care how I looked. I didn’t care how I felt anymore. I just wanted it all to be over. I fell into a depression. The loneliness took over me, leaving my heart empty. I needed someone. I needed a friend. That part of me was gone and all that was left was a hole. 

I continue to struggle, not knowing what to do. I started trying more. To be more interesting or social but it seems I’m just not a likable person. Nothing seems to work. Now, I sit by myself writing this story: The story of a lonely girl.",lonely,Story of a lonely girl,2020-10-06 05:49:30

I've never been outgoing, and my first response to romantic pressure is usually to withdraw.

What's worse is that I feel unlovable. I know my flaws and I know that a girl could never want to deal with them...indeed no one *should*.

I don't deserve to be loved, and I never will be when I'm trapped under my shell. But I don't know how to break out. I want to be able to be outgoing and meet someone special, but don't know the steps to that. I'm not even sure I have the willpower to take those steps.

I've heard advice from many friends, ""you have to learn to love yourself first."" 
I'm sure many of you here have heard the same old, empty platitude.

That isn't to say your friends or my friends don't care...but they don't exactly help by saying that either. How is ""learning to enjoy being single"" supposed to help me not be single? How am I supposed to ""love myself"" when that empty pain in my chest is surely from the lack of emotional intimacy?

I'm not sure if this is the place to go for advice, or if it's just a place to vent. Maybe I just need to know that I'm not the only one feeling these frustrations?

I understand that during times of hardship we want to look at things externally to validate us. The only way to really achieve the inner growth you are looking for is to accept your loneliness. When you accept loneliness you then become alone. Being alone is a choice that you make to push past the current situation you find yourself in at the moment.

My brain fixates on the problems I have so it becomes the only thing I can think about and this makes it extremely hard to talk to people too. I can't leave the house and haven't been out except for on drives in 8 months due to fear of covid. I literally have not a soul to talk to and I'm dealing with one of the hardest phases in my life right now. I'm in a rough spot and I feel like the only thing to help is to have someone but I can't and don't and won't. Since everyone leaves I know there's gotta be something wrong with me. I can't work on it because the depression says what's the point if they're gonna leave anyways. I started taking prozac so I'm praying it gets me out of this hole I'm stuck in atm.

2641,idkguesssumminrandom,1601877594,1,"Some behaviors and thought patterns I've noticed in myself after honestly examining myself:

Tendency to overthink

Fear of being inadequate

Tendency to distance myself from others

Desire for order in my life (I don't like conflict, but I understand it's inevitable and I accept it)

Desire for love and affection (I really want to hug someone. Specifically in an ""I love you so much way"", not just a friendly way, ya know? I'm not sure if this thinking is toxic/delusional).

Perfectionistic mindset, which I think ties into being afraid of being inadequate

Social confusion/awkwardness, anxiety, poor mood

Another thing -- I guess my brain is like, on overdrive ALL the time? Like, I have trouble sleeping, and feel hyperactive mentally throughout the day. My brain is almost like a wheel that just keeps on rolling. Not much rest. Always thinking of something. I also tend to pace a lot around my house when not really doing anything

Not looking for a solution, as the title says I just wanted to say what's been bottled up in me for a while. I've already been to therapy and I'm working on these issues. Currently working on my driver's license at the moment. Once I (hopefully) get it and COVID clears up I plan on maybe hosting meetups for others in my age group plus. Just something where people can meet up and chat about games and other nerdy stuff. On another note I've always had the desire to help people. It's one of the most meaningful things there is to me, so I might also do volunteer work and see how that goes. Just gonna try different things out. Damn, I could go for a loving hug right now.

my best friend and I had a falling out. one where idk if we will ever go back to how we were. and tbh, im not sure i want to go back.


I do have a boyfriend. but i only see him on weekends. and even then not always. he is pretty busy during the week and he's my only means for any type of socialization but I don't want to make him feel obligated to do anything extra for me. so i give him space, even if I desperately want it filled.


I'm struggling with my mental health. and I really have been trying to get the courage to see a therapist. but thats a journey in and of itself it seems.


I really find meaning in being able to connect with someone and be there for them. im introverted, but social when it comes to wanting a person to talk to and connect with on a semi recent basis at least. and i don't entirely have that.

Always. I have my cats but it's just not the same as meaningful human interaction. I haven't had a kiss for maybe a year? A hug only when I force one which obviously isn't fun. I've talked to him about it, he just... tells me he doesn't have time to listen because he's busy working.

I have my own work and hobbies. I have a few close friendships too but can't see them due to covid.

My parents moved abroad so I can't spend time with them either. When my mum came to visit I tried to discuss my loneliness but she threw it back in my face. We had a disagreement about petty household stuff. She escalated it and said it's obvious my bf leaves me alone because I'm so horrible. And that I've become weird because I'm always alone. When I was younger I had a couple close friends at school but not loads of superficial friends. My dad laughed at me and called me ""lone wolf"".

They would left me just like that and i wouldn't even know ( which when i think about it would possibly be better).

Or maybe its because you feel you are lesser because of your race. 

You need to start thinking about others as others as an energy.

No matter what we look like on the outside whether you are old, young, ugly, beautiful. we all have a special and unqiue energy inside of us to share with others.

Knowing this really helped my self confidence as i understood that it wasn't physcial looks that made you friends it was being yourself and connecting and vibing with other people's energy.

so if you are constantly feeling lonely and sad then maybe you need to approach life differently, improve yourself, and embrace your own energy. 

because at the end of the day that is the only thing that stands through our life. We all become old but we all keep our energy. 

by making energy the source of your confidence and knowing who you are as a person then that confidence and happiness will be everlasting

They’ve plotted against my well being before. They see all I do but still don’t help. They remind me of parasites. Living off any happiness that enters my soul. See, cause the happy feeling is always fleeting and they’re always hungry. Hungry for more. The more I feed, the hungrier they get. I’m running out of energy and patience. 
There are times I fantasize about ending it all. Sometimes with a knife. The imagery seems painful so I switch to a quicker way. Like a gun. That just seems like a lot of work.

This makes it super simple and quick to find people that both want to talk to each other. You are instantly shown matched people, and then you can send them a friend request, once they accept then contacts details are shared with the both of you.

2725,namethatisnttaken11,1601825494,1,"It's like ""summer love"" but ""covid partner"" :D  I know there are other subreddits intended for this but I think you understand me better.

Basically my problem is that I'm from a poor family that moved quite a lot. This gives me hard time when I try to socialize, I don't feel like I fit into people surrounding me. I gave up on social networks long ago cuz watching other ppl lifes only gives me envy and low sef-esteem. I do get connected with people from time to time but they wander off eventually - make families or move to another cities or spend time with more significant friends. I haven't lost hope to get irl friends yet and I have some ideas but covid events drop my chances to zero. I have noone to talk to about lot of stuff and get somewhat equal initiative from next time. So here I am slowly losing my sanity from loneliness, finally having a courage to make this post to look for buddy to hang out online with :D What happens after covid? I'm not clingy, and if you get irl friends and start to spend time with them - I wouldn't mind. I can understand, this is something I crave for too. 

For females - I don't expect romance. I think I crave for it, but I have a little faith in LDR. Well unless there are plans to hang out irl. 

I'm straight white 30M. I work as a software developer (mobile apps, but I know a lot of stuff besides that). As a hobby I do hardware development (arduino and stuff) and digital painting (i've started a course this year). I watch quite a lot of memes and youtube vids. I play PC games regularly. Right now it's Overwatch primarily, I play both competitive (stuck in gold) and casual. Also I have a big Steam library and I don't mind to try something new. My music taste is wide but picky, most of my fav songs are from metal subgenres. If my appearance matters - I look okayish :D A bit chubby, but I'm working on it. I'm available online almost all day when I'm not sleeping, and I'm free after work during about 14:00-18:00 UTC.

I'm laid back and somewhat empathic. I can listen you up but I won't let you dump all negativity on me, neither I will do same to you. Let's instead do something together - talk about things or share memes and music or waste some spare SRs at Overwatch or draw another one rare Pepe or teach each other something new or make a piece of software, maybe even a game, idk :D 

Send me DM. But please make sure first you are about my age (25-33? idk I feel younger than my age), we have some common grounds (not just gaming) and schedule. Mic is must have with time. Please don't do it if you have a significant other or a family - this only makes me envious, besides you should spend time with them, not with a stranger from the internet :D",lonely,Be my Covid partner,2020-10-05 02:31:34

2730,ANTYmusique,1601822508,1,"A little bit about myself. 

I’m 20 years old (M) and I’m studying psychology at the University of Ottawa. Since the age of 14, I’ve hated social medias (Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, VSCO) because I feel like it distances human beings instead of bringing us together. I’ve outgrown my generation (and technology) and I feel extremely alone. 

Some problems with social medias

1. Social medias programs us to value our self worth based on other people’s opinion of us. Most of the time, when someone posts a picture on Instagram for example, they want to be approved by their followers, they want to get likes. If they don’t get the likes they think they deserve, some feel sad and others go as far as deleting the picture and feeling bummed out for the rest of the day. 

2. No one cares about what you do. With stories becoming a thing on snapchat and instagram, people feel the need to keep their followers know what they’re up to for the day. People want to show others that their life is exciting even if it’s not true. 

Social medias makes me feel alone.

As I earlier said, I absolutely hate social medias. Sadly, when I delete my social medias and go for a walk or a bike ride, there’s rarely people my age outside. I feel like social medias define who they are and that most of them are stuck in that false world, in their homes. When I do see people of my generation outside, they’re often on their phones walking like zombies. I feel like there’s not a lot of people who feel the way I do and it makes me feel like I’m alone. It also happens that I’m spending time with someone and that they pull out their phone and visit their social medias while I’m there, waiting for them. With social medias growing at this rate, I’m scared that this problem will just get worse and I dont want to feel the way I do for the rest of life. I just wish I could meet people with the same mindset as mine.",lonely,Social medias &amp; loneliness,2020-10-05 01:41:48

And now I am in a point in my life where I am breaking down daily from this sensation of being truly alone and worthless. I feel like friendships are fickle and lack depth and that dating is futile Becuase I lack energy. My loneliness is both tied to my depression and my mental health but also a lot of things I’ve been through growing up. I just want to be happy with my own company. I don’t want to find happiness in someone else or a hug or sex or a relationship. I truly just want to feel happy with my own company when I’m sat in a room by myself.

So i have this crush who’s in my class, well he’s very out of my league, he’s tall and beautiful, and he got these 2 sparkling brown eyes and shiny brown hair, he haven’t hadn’t a girlfriend since like gindergarden which is kinda nice i guess
Even though we’ve been in the same class for 3 years now i have almost never talked to him, i’m way to shy, but the times we do have to talk because of school he always says my name before saying something to me, i haven’t heard him doing this to anyone else so i dunno if that’s a sign or not

I’m too scared to look at him but the times i look at him i mostly catch him looking at me first, for example in the school cafeteria, i remember this one time i sat at the table across him w some people and i looked up and he looked at me smiling 🥺 kinda sounds creepy but my heart literally melted

It would be very weird if he liked me because he’s kinda popular ( not w the girls though cuz hes kinda awkward and not like other guys and he has a baby face - very cute i must say ) and he plays sports, and i’m this awkward shy girl who’s never had a boyfriend, i don’t have a single friend ( like i’m alone all the time at school ) and i am kinda fat, but i guess some people like that? I dunno, even if he did like me i am that kinda person you deny having a crush on until ur like 40 years old and don’t have anyone else to marry so u marry me instead 🤠👍

All my “friends” if you could call them that are stoners and screw ups who only really talk to me if they need something like a ride. I live with my parents I’m 19 but I get the vibe they’re reaching the tail end of their tolerance of wanting me. Being honest I don’t blame them for not liking me. So I’ll be transferring to a different college this spring. As for romantic relationships I’ve been in one it was hell and I’ve avoided them since. 
Unfortunately I live in a smallish southern town and I’m a nerd. They’re isn’t shit to do unless you’re into hunting or doing drugs. Neither of which particularly interests me. Hopefully things will be better in college next semester but given my luck I truly don’t have high hopes. 
As for things getting better in college with my luck it’ll be more of the same at best or dealing with dickholes on the daily at worst for the sweet sweet price tag of 15000 dollars plus tax and interests. A year. 

Either way I don’t blame people for not liking me anymore. As of lately I’ve gotten more bitter and unpleasant. In fact I’ve stopped really seeing people as people and more a means to an end. Wanna get a raise and better job security go hunting with the boss even though I don’t like that. I’ll smile and give them compliments if that’s what they want to hear. Just as long as their willing to pay me. As for college academically I do fine I don’t expect that to change. As for romance I don’t see myself in another relationship unless it’s a means to an end. Not to mention where I am currently doesn’t have an exactly great selection of either gender to choose from.

I guess the best way to say it at this point is while I am lonely I’m not willing to open myself up to any vulnerability romantic or otherwise.  Man this who thing seems contradictory reading it out. Oh well at least I said it to someone.",lonely,Almost completely alone.,2020-10-04 17:27:26

2788,fishdishwater,1601780628,1,"Hi all.

I confessed my love to my best friend at the beginning of this year. At first it seemed to be working, but I ended up going to quick and we fell out as a result shortly after. Ever since then I have been trying to recover the friendship we had before, but I can't shake my feelings for her. Currently, we seem to have almost fully recovered our friendship, and she considers our dynamic to be ""more than friends"" and that we have a ""spark""; however, when I bring up the possibility of a relationship, she says that she needs time because she believes she's in the wrong place mentally to begin a relationship, which is completely understandable.

Where I begin to question her mentality towards a relationship with me is that she doesn't want to commit or make promises and wait for the right time, and she seems to be considering the possibility of other options. Before I confessed to her, she had a crush on a housemate but he doesn't share the feeling. We have talked about her feelings towards him fairly recently and she said some feelings for him remain, but she has mostly given up on him.

At this point, I'm beginning to drive myself crazy about whether we are going to end up together or not, I really love her and think we are ""meant for each other""; after all, shouldn't your loved one be like a best friend to you? When I ask her if I should just move on and focus on just being a good friend to her (ultimately friendzoning myself, but I'd rather know where we stand than to carry on with uncertainty), but she doesn't want me to give up on her. It's like she's just keeping me around as a last resort and when I push her on this and ask if she's holding out for someone else, she then changes how she sees us happening from ""we either happen, or find someone else"" to ""we either happen or we end up alone"".

I'm at a crossroads where I'm not sure which path I should take. Continuing to hope it will work out seems to be setting myself up for a fall, but deciding to move on from her seems like resigning myself to loneliness forever. I'm not a very outgoing guy, nor am I attractive, and so I doubt I would have another chance with a girl, definitely not one as great and likeminded as her. I find myself thinking, if even she doesn't want me, who else ever will.

Another option could be that I'm just being totally unfair here and this all lies completely with me. I'm completely open to that possibility, so please let me know if you think so.

I look forward to your responses and thank you for taking the time to read this post :)",lonely,Am I being strung along?,2020-10-04 14:03:48

2792,Meverhart7,1601777932,1,"I deleted tinder months ago and am thinking about downloading it again after a few lonely days this week.  But I’m hesitant to make a new account because:

- I would prefer to meet someone by chance, opposed to on a dating site. 

- I still get sad over my breakup back in February sometimes. I saw my ex with his new gf recently and I was unexpectedly very emotional. It took awhile to feel better and in this moment I was relieved to be single. Otherwise my reaction would’ve been pretty inappropriate. 

- Im not over the guy I met shortly after my ex and I split. There was something special there that I can’t seem to let go of. It’s been 4 months since I’ve seen him and he still pops into my mind every day. Unlikely scenario but if I was with someone new and he came back in the picture, I’m not confident that I would be able to ignore him. 

- I have enjoyed this time by myself. I only have to plan my schedule around my dog and I. If I want to go to the movies on Saturday and play video games alone all day Sunday I can without checking with anyone first. I would never think this way when I’m in a relationship. I have always put more energy into my partners than myself. But because of that it’s been kind of nice to just worry about me for a minute. 

- I’ve had.my heart broken twice already this year and I’m terrified of going through it again. 

It doesn’t seem fair to date someone when I’m not sure if I can fully commit, I’m still reminiscing about my past relationship, and im longing for someone else. But I do miss not having a SO. When I see couples in public holding hands it makes me question why I’m not trying to pursue that. I have a lot of love to give.

2810,totallynot4throw4w4y,1601760741,1,"I'll cut the crap because I'm probably just a typical sad college student. Anyway. I'm in my second year of college (where I absolutely hate my course, but that's a different thing) and it's just getting depressing that no one truly gives a crap about me - like I don't think I have a single ""real friend"" with whom I can discuss anything at any time and with whom I have a ton of stuff in common with. 

I've lost the 2 people I was closest with in the past year and a bit - I broke up with my first and only (so far) girlfriend (who was basically my best friend before we went out) in June last year and haven't spoken to a single girl romantically (which obviously also means my sex life quite literally hasn't existed for over a year now), and me and my best friend of over 10 years parted ways, because that friendship was getting toxic. And those were the only 2 people in my life who I felt actually cared about me, and with whom I could share a lot of my issues.

I've also drifted with a lot of my friends (well, by friends, I mean people who I saw on an almost daily basis and got along with), and almost never see anyone who I went to school with, outside of college. It doesn't help that I live far away from all the people who I liked to at least some extent.

Anyway, nowadays the people I interact with most outside of college are people that I don't, and most likely will never meet in person. I am in a few chats across multiple platforms, some to do with my interests, some just general chats, but in those I'm just one of many people. As for my social media? I could probably delete them all for a week and come back to messages from maybe 3 people max, if I'm lucky.

I guess it's sort of freeing to not rely on other people like I used to, but it gets very lonely and depressing. I really don't know what I'm expecting by writing this, but it just feels good to write about my problems (because once again, no one in my life would ever care enough to listen to these kinds of things from me), so if anyone does read this, thank you very much.",lonely,"No one truly cares about me, and I have no real friends.",2020-10-04 08:32:21

2818,Altagraciaaaa,1601755765,1,"Dear Friends,

First of all, I would like to thank you for reading my post. It means a lot to me.

Unfortunately,  my heart keeps aching for someone every single day. At the end of a  hectic week, I want nothing more than to be within the loving arms of my  significant other. To just keep staring at each other and continue  smiling endlessly. To feel safe, secured, protected. To have plans  together, to have something to fight for. To guide each other through  dire times.

All these things sound  great, but in my opinion, not many people want to go into a  relationship with the intention of eventually getting married and having  a family, and that hurts me deeply.

I  consider myself a high-caliber woman, and I feel like my expectations  are too high. I have tried looking for my soulmate online. After I make a  long post in which I invest all my emotions and time, I get a dozen of  ""hi, how are you?"" replies, and that really puts me off. I never seem to  get responses that are actually meaningful, ones that would make me  interested and leave me wanting to chat more.

I  would like to find myself a man who is at peace with himself,  intelligent, educated, and who does not consider himself a loser or a  failure. The thing is, if you just keep being desperate, if you keep  telling yourself that you are just ""average"", that you are bad at  everything you do, how can you expect a change? If you manage to  identify the problem, work on it.

What  do you think, are my expectations too high? Should I lower them? Will I  be able to ever find myself someone that I am on the same level with?  And if yes, where should I be searching?

Take care,

2840,lnknew,1601736495,1,"I’ve been alone most of my life. I was married for a decade, had three kids. Left my ex a few years ago because she was selfish and quite happy with me being miserable. Anything I tried to change she blocked. Eventually I realized she didn’t care about my well being as long as she had everything she wanted, which didn’t include me. And my wants, needs, and desires were bad, because they weren’t hers. I always struggled with depression, and she fed my negativity to keep me controlled.

My family and I long ago became estranged. Barely ever talk. Usually only if I call. I have a big family, during the collapse of my marriage I tried to reach out to them for support. I would hear all the things you want to hear when you call family “we love you” “we’re here for you”... but after a month they stopped answering my calls. They never called me. No one calls me.

My friends all decided to dump me as well, as none of them were interested or cared about my problems. I had to make new friends, and it’s hard when you’re in your 30s, when you work long hours, when you’re broke. I had a little bit of success, for a time. I joined a gym, I joined social groups. But no relationship ever stuck. People would find girlfriends or boyfriends and I’d be left out. No one was ever available, I was never invited to things, I might get one or two dates with a woman and be told “wow you’re a wonderful guy! But I met someone else/you’re not for me/I’m moving away/someone else will make you happy. Goodbye.”

After a few years of therapy to recover from my devastating divorce, I finally left the miserable city I lived in and moved to Europe, hoping to meet people, date again, and travel... and instead I landed here just in time for Coronapocalypse and all of that becoming impossible. I lost touch with the couple of people I knew, through the move and the virus. 

I had a close friend, and moving her brought us closer in distance. We were talking about adventures, we were moving towards dating. We had stolen weekends and vacations together for the last couple years. We talked all the time, texts and phone calls for hours on end. Held each other close when we were together. Told each other about our love. It’s hard to describe, but I felt confident about her and I this year.

She got a boyfriend in lockdown and told me to stop talking to her. She was the last person I called friend. I love her, deeply. We have something special. But this damn virus we couldn’t spend time together.

So here I am. Alone in a country where I can barely order dinner in the language, let alone talk to anyone casually. It’s all the same though. I meet people. I get phone numbers, but nothing is ever set up. People tell me they’re having parties or going out with a group but I’m never invited. 

I tried online dating. I get scams and solicitation for services. Any real people I talk to never have time to meet up. Or just go silent.

My coworkers don’t care, they have family and lives. Heck when there was a day the trains in my area had issues and it took me two hours to get to work, multiple colleagues said “oh I thought about calling and offering you a ride to work. But I didn’t.” I wasn’t just forgotten, I was remembered and then actively excluded.

The only people I can reliably talk to are my current and old therapist...and I pay them money to listen.

No one cares.

I have a good job, I supervise 30 people and I pretty much love my crew. At work for the most part I’m at least happy I’m around people, even if work is stressing me out, there’s always a few people there who make my day.

But my outside of work life is a complete disaster. I’m actually sad to leave work because then I’m alone. I hardly have any friends who reach out, they barely text or call, when I reach out they barely reach back. It’s just so soul sucking. I live in the middle of nowhere, and while I have hobbies that occupy my time, there’s far too much time of just me stuck alone with my thoughts and how fucking lonely I am.

I’m so depressed I don’t even spend my money, I just keep banking it because I’m too unmotivated to even buy the things I could buy. 

I need a girlfriend, someone to spoil with attention and affection and look forward to their conversations and hear all about their life, to look forward to their texts and know that they miss me or are thinking about me.

Because far too often I feel like I’m in no one’s thoughts, like I’m invisible or worthless or am not even worth a phone call or a few lines of text messages.

Seriously, what good is a great paying job or a nice place or having lots of musical and artistic talent if you don’t have someone to share it with, if you don’t have a muse in your life. If this is my future then I’d rather die now, there’s gotta be a beautiful woman out there eight now who is just as lonely as I am, who just wants attention and to feel needed, ok I’ve been ranting far too long but I’d give anything in the world to truly feel loved.",lonely,I’m soooo tired of being alone all the time.

I genuinely enjoy being there for people and making others laugh, and I’ve gotten the “group dad/daddy” joke put on me for basically any friend group I’ve been apart of (most online ones) but I’m realizing bro this shit sucks. I was fine being an emotional crutch for others, I’m rather stable in my own emotions as well but I think this is the longest I’ve gone without someone I’m genuinely connected with. I’m single, I don’t have a person I consider my best friend, nor someone I naturally look forward to speaking with daily. 

The friends I have, I interact with in the moment it feels like, they don’t bleed into other parts of my life like I feel a close friend should, or maybe I’m just lonely over being single and hard staring at everything.

Somehow we all just start pretending. Or maybe I feel like that. All the ""I love you""s and ""I can't live without you""s must've been lies coz both of us are still alive. Time isn't a healer it just stacks other stuff on the mind. And slowly we start to look ahead instead of behind.

I miss her that can be a bad thing too. But I dont just miss her I miss how we used to talk about almost anything and everything. About the books music movies shows games.

2914,legalalyen,1601670396,1,"Grew up in an awful city for most of my life. Super conservative, most people are very low on openness, and the most interesting/kind/good natured people seem to be leaving the city and even the country. There are few communal activities going on and the culture is to generally to keep to yourself and socialize within your family and immediate circle. There is also a mild form of caste system going on, and a fair amount of classism. I had cultural problems in my city of birth. It’s religious (and I’m not), it tolerated nothing less than conformity. Needless to say, few young, open-minded and educated people truly like it here. The few friends I was able to make left. I’ve had what I can comfortable call a chronic loneliness. It’s too damn much and I sense it’s ruining my life and memories. I don’t want to go on like this. Two decades of my life have been tainted with loneliness. 

Would going to a bigger, more cosmopolitan city make me feel less lonely? I’ve always felt best when I’m somewhere diverse. I’m not diversity obsessed, but difference of origin makes me feel at ease, and accepted. I traveled a bit and lived somewhere multicultural. It made me feel somewhat better. Then I had to come back to my city of birth. And it’s painful. 

I’m considering making plans to move somewhere like London in a year or so. It’s very ambitious but feasible for me. I thought about this deeply and I theorized that being in that kind of environment would open some doors. More hobbies and communities, which would allow for more friendships. I generally adore cities, and find most difficult aspects about them tolerable. But I worry that people in cities are too busy for deep friendship, that the culture favors making “convenient” acquaintances (which is fine, but does not bring me happiness). I also think that in big cities, as people go into their thirties, they want to move somewhere cheaper and more spacious, so I’d end up losing the connexions I value. I worry that my escape plan will not solve my problem and will only present me with another, more expensive form of loneliness.

I was supposed to move to Florida with my best friend. I'm male and my best friend was female. Things fell through completely and i put myself under trying to make it happen. This was Wednesday. After she told me that it wasnt going to happen, she ignored me because i was upset and she was too. I felt bad but it also somewhat upset me because she wasnt willing to stick thru it with me and talk to me, when i would always stay and talk to her thru anything that was wrong with her. 

We used to talk and play games every day. In complete honesty, i was in love with her and she told me she was in love with me too and admitted she really believed i was her soulmate. We've known each other for almost 3 years now. She has lied to me before, about wanting to be with me and stuff like that. But i always looked past it, because i just wanted her to be happy. She told me she never wanted me to leave and you know, things like that. But after this all went down on wednesday, she just kind of blew me off. I started to think. I started to think of all the times she put me down, lied to me to benefit her and all the things i did for her that she wouldnt do back for me. Dont get me wrong, she was the BEST FRIEND i have ever had. But i realized that the more i went on holding onto some false hope, the more my mental health just collapsed worse than it already was.

So i walked away. I told her i wished her the best and told her i loved her but i needed to go because i wasnt who i wanted to be. To be honest, i dont know how she felt. idk if it affected her. All i got was a ""Idk what to say"" and a ""I love you"" and that was that. I know im supposed to feel good because i had the balls finally walk away. But i have no distractions. It was a wake up call for how alone i actually felt. When she wasnt there, there was nobody else i could play with or talk to. If i go on discord, i see her name. If i want to play games (cod or fortnite) i see her. All of my favorite games i played with her and every time i open them i just remember everything and feel all the pain come flooding back. 

The point of this is, i was wondering if anybody would want to play and maybe hang out and just help me distract myself. I currently dont work but have applied to jobs to hopefully distance myself from everything but for the time being i just dont want to be alone.

2932,alexcarusofan1,1601659292,1,"I (22M) just started my first semester of medical school at a DO school in the Midwest. And just like everyone, the transition to medical school from college has been incredibly tough. Academically, the change has been very substantial obviously, but that's actually not the thing that's been making me feel depressed. It's the social aspect, or the lack thereof. Coming from college, an incredibly social environment, to medical school, where it feels like everyone eats, sleeps, and breathes anatomy atlases and biochem textbooks, has been a tremendous change. I always prided myself on being a person who didn't let my studies consume my life during college. I had a steady relationship, took leadership in a cultural club, had hobbies, went out, and did so many just ""fun"" things.

At my med school, all the first years are ""nice"" people, but that's about the extent it goes. No one cares about meeting new people or making any little effort to prioritize people. I try to organize hangouts and events, but everyone flakes on me. They will tell me to my face they want to hang out and then leave me on read. Perhaps, that's me being naive, idk. Everyone always talks about this collaborative environment in med school because all the competition of getting in is done, but I have yet to see that. There are lots of gunners in my class and frankly, people who don't want to talk about anything non-medicine related.

To make matters worse, I just got broken up with before class started. She was someone I thought was going to be my soulmate, but of course she cited med school as being a major factor to why she had to cut it off. No one wants to date a person who has to study all the time.

To make matters worse, COVID has just accentuated all the loneliness that would have been there anyway. Online class does little for me in terms of mood. I try to get out of my apartment to study in different places, but it all feels the same. Just study, study, study. Don't get me wrong, I love what I'm learning, I just don't love it enough where it can be the only thing that makes me a whole person. There are no in-person events because of COVID and our school seems to not care about the whole situation. They've increased tuition yet they are so bad about communication and our online classes have so many technical issues. I do most of my learning from Youtube.

The lone bright spot in all this has been my roommate and one other friend who feel the same way as me. That was a lot of complaining, but I just don't know how to go about this, with no future in sight. How do I stop feeling incredibly lonely?",lonely,"My first semester of medical school has made me feel incredibly lonely.

Some general things about me. My birthday is on Halloween, freaky right! That means I’m turning 21 at the end of the month.
I love working out. I try to work out in between my working day. 
I’d say I’m quite fit, definitely have toned muscle definition. Being light brown helps a lot too.
Though it is hard to stay motivated at home, especially when my bed is so close by. But working from home has always been a dream of mine.

I play a lot of games on my PC. With a decent steam library. Thinking of getting a PS5 and the Xbox game pass some time over the next few months.

I have a nvidia shield tv on my desk, which I use to watch a lot of tv shows and movies. 
I’m also into reading books.
I’m into fantasy, action, adventure, crime, thriller, comedy, drama. 
I did use to write and let me imagination go wild. Always thought about writing a book one day.

Also hoping to start something that helps people learn about personal finance and investing. As well as build a portfolio of data related projects.

I’m into discussing most things academic, scientific, technological/technical, political, social, psychological, philosophical, economic/financial. Really anything.

I’m 5’9, dark brown hair, light brown eyes. Have a light brown skin complexion.

2946,MikaelV3,1601639169,1,"Not sure if this type of post is allowed here, but it's not just a message of kind of hope imo but also just an invitation.  


You see, I've had a rough time with girls - both in the sense of relationships and friendships, I just end up feeling like I gave so much effort and received little back - I'm sure a lot of people can relate with that.  


My last relationship was more of a tragedy, where the girl I was with had a horrible life.   


Just when I motivated her to LIVE and she was finally starting to be happy, she got hit with lung cancer and sadly died not long after - most of the relationship was me taking care of her mental health but she still made me happier than others.  


Before my relationship with her, I've had very one sided relationships where I just felt I offered so much more effort and value, one particular ex has thanked me several times for teaching her how to better think and behave etc her parents were a very bad influence and as a result she already had 7 ex's at a young age.  


In my very first relationship I was heartbroken due to this depressed suicidal girl that ghosted me because ""she wasn't good enough"" and at the time I didn't have much confidence so I thought it was my fault and it killed me - but furthermore, the close female friends I had did not emotionally support me with the heartbreak and I was incredibly disappointed with that, months passed and they didn't even ask how I felt (they later realized it and apologized, but it was too late by then).  


Bad experiences with girls aside which btw I have tons more to tell, but getting to the point.  


These experiences are not just related to friendships and relationships but also just ATTEMPTING to make female friends which let me tell you, it's not a fun experience in a world full of competitive males am I right?.  


I am lucky enough to have a childhood friend who even though sometimes he has moments where he prefers other people over me, I am still happy that he chooses me at all to play games among other things.  


Here is the thing, like I said he is a guy - after this last relationship that broke me, I realized that it's much easier to at least fill those lonely spaces with a GUY friend.  


And really, I feel this also extends to girls - but my main message is to the lonely guys out there struggling with girls in any kind of way.  


DO NOT, focus so much on girls - on ALWAYS having the potential of there being romance, that you underestimate the power of friendship with a GUY - or in general.  


I'm telling you, in life you will suffer and suffer - it will seem like it will never end, and THAT'S why you need someone RELIABLE, consistent - that isn't just in it for superficial or emotional reasons.  


I have been a victim of this mentality, of wanting to find long lasting love so badly that I look around and have no one - it's truly a PRISON.  


There is happiness beyond just love, your value as a human is not dependent on a girl and neither should it ONLY be praised by a girl.  


I have found that despite guys being often worse with emotional talks, they are more loyal to other guys because they just want to CHILL - they just want to hang out and have fun, play some games laugh till it hurts.  


And this very well might be the same for girls, so girls if you are so focused on finding this hero in shining armor or whatever you are looking for - STOP for a second, and think first ""do I have someone to fall back on if this goes bad?"".  


Because that's the thing, a best friend will be more likely to stick around no matter what happens - with no ""love has expired, so loyalty has expired"" contract.  


I see this time and time again, and as I said I am a victim of this myself and will likely make mistakes regarding it again - but I feel it's very important, let's recognize the value of the same gender - of friendship.  


We see poems, songs, everything written in honor of love - but we see equally as much pain messages related to love.  


Love is magical when it works, but when it leaves it HURTS - and if you have nothing else in your life, no one else - it's gonna feel even worse.  


So as my final message, recognize the value of friendship - and recognize the value of having someone loyal, regardless of gender.   


Instead of just looking to meet girls, think about this.  


You had a relationship of one year, ended horribly.  


How many guy friends would you have met in that time, that would still be hanging out with you - playing games / making you laugh etc?.  


I rather have at least 3 loyal guy friends, that I can fall back on to take my mind off the pains of this world - than to dedicate all my time to a relationship and just end up lonely in the end.  


So before you go around putting all this effort into finding a girl, which often consists of a lot of heartbreak - make sure you got homies first, make sure the aftermath of a failed love won't leave you miserable.  


Hopefully that helps someone, whether it be guy or girl - I am working on this myself.  


Cheers and good luck to you all if you decide to put this mentality into action.  


And to anyone interested regardless of gender, feel free to message me - I DO NOT GHOST, if it seems like I did I probably got distracted AF.",lonely,We have to stop underestimating each other's value because of gender,2020-10-02 21:46:09

2966,Escape_Front,1601615986,1,"Nobody ever wants me first. I have no friends or people who care about me. Just the same things everyone is obliged to say because it’s socially correct. 

I’m tired of being friends with people who are “fake” or who don’t say their true feelings/aren’t blunt or straightforward.

I’m tired of people acting like they care. Going “Wow” or “that’s crazy”. Honestly just say you don’t give a shit it would make my life so much better. Just shut the fuck up and don’t make me feel like strangling you. 

I consider suicide everyday. I hate myself so much I just jerk off and hope it makes me feel better. It just makes me feel a million times worse after the “after climax clarity comes”. 

I have no friends who hold the same opinions or has the same personality as me. Or I should say at least similar. I’m tired of making exceptions for friends or people because I’m desperate. I care too much and try so hard not too. I’m so done with everything I’ve attempted at suicide twice but didn’t do it good enough I just ended up failing because I pussied out. 

I’m just so frustrated and I’m giving up. I just want to not care and do whatever I want and let nothing stop me. Once I get my life together by losing more weight and get my new job I just want to fix everything.

This post is meant to act more as a question then a story or personal record. Or somewhere inbetween the two. (If that makes sense)  

So I've been lonley my whole life but not alone. I've had friend groups and been invited to parties so I know I haven't had it rough like others have. I also am aware that I'm decent looking (on a good day) and I'm grateful for that. I still was never added to group chats or really involved in conversations. My friendship groups picture at the end of highschool was taken by me, instead of being a part of the picture. And the entitled me back then was furious because I thought I deserved friends, I thought I was a great person and therefore I am entitled to friends. 

Here I am a few years later and I'm alone at 3am. I did come to terms with my loneliness a while ago and even though I have friends I don't have any close connections as I struggle to form them. It really came to show in highschool when my group never messaged me or called me. I was just another person they knew. And in college I was so afraid of this happening again I actually confronted my friend group about this. Told them I was scared of being forgotten over night. They assured me that I was unforgettable, too kind or funny and I believed them that it was okay. But literally a week passed since college ended and I was forgotten. I see then hanging out together on social media the whole group and I'm watching from a phone screen at home. 

The reality im facing now is that I'm not scared to be alone anymore, it's me being scared to become part of a group again. I fear being abandoned, cast aside and forgotten but just as much as that scares me, being alone indefinitely scares the life out of me. I'm scared to go out and get laid because I don't wana form an attachment and any slight chance of it happening is horrifying to me. I am afraid of intimacy and affection because it's not somthing I'm used to. Other peoples touch is somthing I'm not used to. This feeling of limbo being afraid or both isolation and being in a group of people has really been messing with my mind.

I currently have nothing to my name. No job because of the pandemic, no close friends due to my own nature.  All I have rn is myself, and I want to hear from people who are like me?

So my friends don't like me, and it's obvious.
Generally, they pretend like they like me but today was different.

First when I arrived at school I saw my ""bestfriend"" ( i don't even know if I can call her my bestfriend, two years ago we were really close but now she's becoming more and more distant and always going with my other friend for teamwork ) I went up to her and said hi but she looked at me like I was an alien. I speak french where I'm from so I don't really know what word I should use but she looked at me like she didn't want to be seen with me and as if I had just said something weird. Yeah I told you guys, I'm bad at explaining.

So, we went to our classroom together and I tried to talk to my other ""friends"" but they all just ignored me. They looked at me but didn't answer and continued talking together. They were all in a circle but I was left out, when we left the classroom I was behind them, I mean it's always like that but I felt like they were trying to block me from talking to them.

Later that day, we had gym class. My friends always tell me they don't want to be with me because I suck but that's not the point,  luckily that day, the teacher made the team so I wasn't alone. I was with my friend, let's call her Anna. I thought she was the only one who liked me or didn't hate me in the group but maybe I was wrong because we were talking and we started laughing and I turned around for a second and when I looked back at her she had stopped smiling and it seemed as if she had just roll her eyes or sighed.

I have so much more to say but I don't want to make this 2 years worth of lecture. 

So last thing, I have this friend i've known since primary school. We used to tell eachother everything and she's the only one I really considered as a bestfriend. We were really close but once we went to high school she looked ashamed of me. She became popular (she always was) and more and more distant. She would never mention me and stuff because she didn't want people to know we were friends. Maybe i'm just overthinking it but oh well. She's the only one I told about my depression. When I told her, less than a year ago, she was so supportive I thought she started caring for me again. But no, randomly I would text her things like ""thank you so much for being here for me"" and she'd say aww thank you. She used to send me texts like these two but eventually she stopped. I never stopped but she kept leaving me on delivered for longer and longer. ( we don't go to the same school and we live kinda far away so this is our only form of communication ). Now, she leaves me on delivered for at least 20 hours. I confronted her but it took her 2 days to read the text. ( I text her on snapchat and she has her snapmap open so I can clearly see she's on but doesn't want to respond ). When she answered she said sorry. Just sorry. That's it. Now we haven't talked for 4 weeks so that's just great. The only friend I care about is gone.

Oh god, this is so long. Sorry, I just wanted to let it all out I had been holding it inside of me for so long and I have no one to talk to so hi reddit!

I hope you have a great day and thank you so much for reading it means the world to know that someone finally listens to me.",lonely,my friends hate me,2020-10-02 10:37:31

&amp;#x200B;

So it all started at a dance when I was in the 8th grade, which was September 2017. There I met a girl who I started really liking after a few months of being friends. To say the least, she lead me on for months, really only talking to me when she was upset but if I just wanted to have a conversation about anything she would be really dry. Eventually I asked her out and got rejected. Now at the beginning of 2018, I got extremely depressed as I did everything I could to make it work and the first thing I did was  blame it on my appearance, which is a possibility but really the whole thing just killed my confidence. After months of still being friends and being ignored by her more and more, blaming myself for everything and acting like she did nothing wrong, and being on the brink of suicide and having the cops show up to my house, her friend tells me that I basically make the girl feel like shit by being so nice to her. Which blew my mind and made me feel worse. But regardless, I wanted the best for her, so I said that I wouldn't talk to her again if it would make her happy. There is no happy ending to this section, as eventually (September 2018),  we started talking again as friends and made up until I let her know about the night the cops came to my house. She said I was lying because it didn't make sense. So then I just cut ties with her and realized that, despite the many things I did that were stupid or shitty during that time, she also did many things that were unreasonable that made my mental state worse and I shouldn't beat myself up about it. Also the entire time this happened, I was being picked on by my group of friends and my childhood friend went after the girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

On to the next, which will have to be split in two. In May of 2018, I met a girl online that you could say I fell in love with. She lived across the States from me. She was just like me in many ways at the time. She was cute, pretty, nice, she complimented me which no girl had ever done before as I am overweight, she had the same dark sense of humor and we became very close after just a few weeks. She had a boyfriend, though. I would never try to break up someone just to be with them, even back then when I made the worse decisions. Eventually they break up because, catch this, the mother fucker was using her for things that anyone, especially a 13 year old should be used for. So this just destroyed her. I had only known her for about 3 weeks at this point. Then, in late May of 2018. I stayed up until 3 in the morning with a girl I had only known for a couple weeks trying to make sure she didn't die. And I am not saying she was ""on the brink"" like I was. We were facetiming and she had about 50 fairly deep horizontal cuts across both undersides of her arms, which I saw. She also took about 8 pills of some medicine she either was taking or had found. I guess at this point I have repressed it but none the less, it is the most traumatizing thing I have had to witness. This just made me love her and want to take care of her, but as a dumb 14 year old on the opposite side of the country, all I could do was tell her how to treat the wounds and research if the medicine she took was a lethal dose. Thank god it wasn't, and that didn't kill her. We stopped talking after she got back with the same guy later, believe him when he said that his friend who had told her what he was doing was lying. He made her block me so I didn't talk to her until maybe July, probably early August of 2018. I never forgot her although I had gone in and out of a different relationship with a girl I really wasn't happy with in the mean time. So after, I soon got together with this girl from across the country. It was most likely because she was so traumatized to realize the truth. After a few weeks, we broke up and she told me that she needed to get over her ex, so if I waited a few months then maybe we could work it out. I know now that if she truly did get better over that time, then it is most unlikely that she would have ever gotten to me, once she understood the only reason she dated me was so she didn't feel so alone. Still, this was probably the biggest mistake I have ever made. I am going to cut  in really quick and say. I treated her horribly. I didn't know it at the time but all I can say is that I am no better than her piece of shit ex. Ok maybe not as bad but I still did some scumbag shit. Anyways, I was still very depressed so I left looking for anyone that would date me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, now for the last girl I dated. We had been friends for year but got really close around June of 2018. We stayed friends for the rest of that year, until October, about 3 weeks after the last girl and I broke up. My depression was getting worse by the day. I went on a date with this girl and her friends. They ruined it and I was barely able to talk to her. This spat and stepped on what was left of my confidence. That weekend I did a civil war reenactment, which was one of my favorite hobbies before covid. On the way home I cried because the friends that I only saw at those reenactments were the only people that made me happy. I had nothing other than that which gave me purpose.  About a week later, the girl I went on the date with asked me out and we have been together ever since. At least that is what I would have said if things went well. This girl has had the hardest life of anyone I have ever met and had bad depression and anxiety. We were together for almost 2 years, just up until last week when I broke it off because I just wasn't happy anymore. She made me block every girl because it gave her anxiety, including the girl from across the states. For a year and a half our relationship, despite the deep and true feelings I have for her and she for me, I was very upset and unstable and depressed. It really sucks and I wish I was just happy with her because she really was amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, late late September 2020, after all that I am alone, and it gives me the chance to find someone new who will fit me better. But something was eating me up inside. I realized that the girl who I had fallen in love with first 2 years ago, I treated like shit, and I had to make it right somehow, especially with the possibility that she had commit suicide. (One last note, this girl was also being bullied and harassed daily and was jumped by a gang of girls and sent to the hospital multiple times, and also wound up in the hospital from attempting suicide on at least one occasion when I was talking to her.)

&amp;#x200B;

Here we go. The last 7 days of my life and what has brought me to this Subreddit. I had to get back in touch with the girl from across the country. Now, I will just refer to her as A so it is a little less confusing. I had lost all contact after blocking A as a result of my last ex. I did remember lots of things about her, including the town that she lived in, her full name, and most importantly, the names of her friends. After days of trying to find her social media, and coming up empty handed or finding ones that A doesn't use anymore; I was about to give up. I couldn't eat, sleep, or relax for 5 days straight. But then, a few nights ago, I was talking to my friends and they suggested that I look for a school yearbook online by going to her schools website. This lead me to success but making me realize that I could use the location to my advantage. I found an instagram run by students that went to her school and I looked through the followers. I had found her friends!!! I remembered their names and because of this, I was able to finally get back in contact with her. This made me so happy, but I had another obstacle ahead. What if she doesn't want to talk to me, she ignores me, or she thinks I am a creep for tracking her down. Lucky for me, she was super nice and we had a great conversation. I was able to apologize for all the stupid things I did. I finally felt like I was getting the closure I needed but then A said somethings that changed it all for me. She didn't remember hardly anything from those months that we knew each other. All she remembered was that I existed and some of the things we had done. I reminded her of as much as I felt would be comfortable for the conversation, including the night where I stayed up with her, which she just vaguely remembered. Of course, she assumed that I wanted to come back to her to try to date again. Honestly, now that , I have a drivers license and my own car, if I got the chance I absolutely would, but I knew going in that not only is she probably dating someone at the moment, but she also would probably never date me again. To this day I still have terrible confidence, and even though I don't think I am ugly, I do believe my weight and appearance have a big role in why she would probably never date me again, especially when she doesn't even remember those things I did (I still apologized to her for them anyways). She does in fact have a boyfriend judging by the date with hearts on her instagram. This doesn't really upset me since it is what I expected. But. The way that she talks to me is extremely weird. She asked what I looked like, to which I made some self-deprecating joke because of my low confidence. She replied that she looks the same. Just to be nice, and because I still believe it, I complimented her on how she looked and she really appreciated that. We went on talking about other things but the conversation never came to a natural end. She just started taking longer and longer to respond. Being on instagram and posting but never looking at my message. She didn't ""mute"" me, which makes it so that it doesn't give you pop up notifications for a conversation. Then eventually she just left me on read. That was last night and I slept horribly. So today I woke up to see a message from A, where she apologized and said that she had fallen asleep. This makes me feel better and I reply. She has never replied or even looked at my message, despite me also asking her something, so there would be a reason for her to respond. So this whole day. She had been posting and ignoring my message and now even though there are some very obvious answers why. Maybe she just doesn't want anything to do with me. Maybe she doesn't want to be friends. Maybe she hates me for what I have done in the past. Or more realistically, maybe I am just not that important to her or she isn't that invested in our me/our conversation so she is being really dry. None of these answers make me feel good and just worsen my mental state. My friends are busy so I can't talk to them. That is why I came here. This has made me feel extremely lonely and awful and I just can't see how my future could get better from this feeling. This has all made me realize that I missed out on being with the most amazing girl I have ever met and I fucked it all up because I was stupid. I don't know what to do with my life at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for this being so long, and if you didn't read the whole thing I don't blame you. I can't really put together a TL;DR for this as it would still be extremely long. If you did read it, please.

The thing is, I don't want to meet anyone new. Im going to a new enviroment/community and there are a lot of New people there. But i don't want to talk to them. I don't want to have any contact with them. I don't want to meet them or even talk to them.

However the world is big and unpredictable and I am a bit overwhelmed by this business of having to expose myself to a number of people in an embarrassing way before I find someone who likes me. Not liking light chats doesn't help, I'm an introvert. I also have a few precious interests that are quite important, I don't want to share that with strangers, and I don't care about a lot of common generic topics... this gives me a reputation of snobbery that I find hurtful, I don't know why people think I feel my interests are ""better"", they are just precious and private and I don't care about other things to the point of wanting to chat, smile and fake it as if it's worth the effort.

I make friends that I can't seem to keep because I'm just not ""normal"". I'm broken. No matter how I try to look at it, I'm not ever going to be anyone's definition of ""normal"". People ask me about myself, my past, the present and they either judge me or shun me. We talk for a bit and then they disappear. We play a game for a bit, then never again.

""You can talk to me about anything"" but when I talk, they don't respond. My mental state isn't the best, but I still try to socialize with people no matter how painful it is.

Right, this is my first time posting on any form of social media so it's probably gonna sound way too personal but whatever, needed to rant and get things off my chest. I have absolutely no friends. I have no job. I don't know how to talk to people and lose any chance of getting a job because of it. My awkwardness around people is throught the fucking roof. I share too much. I don't understand or use social media so I automatically lose contact with anyone who's ever shows interest in me. I've been alone for so long I've forgotten how to interact with others and not come off as desperate. I've lost hope in myself. I frequently think of not waking up. It's slowly killing me seeing others seemlessly mingle and get to know each other. Whenever someone asks about my social life I lie as if it's all hunky dory. I don't know if this is normal but I'm dying. I remember as a kid giving myself to the age of 21 before I end myself out of sheer neglect. I am past that age and am now trying to get better but it's so damn hard with no one around. Every time my efforts to socialise are passed under the rug, I feel like it'd be nice to just fall asleep and never wake up. I am so so tired. It's gotten to the point where it is effort to breathe. I don't know what to do, so I thought if I could at least type it out it won't be so bad in the end. Anyway just sharing.

On the other side, I was never a social person, I never had many friends that would last me a decent amount of time, they would just change me for other person, I had people that would consider me their ""Best friend"" but I just never knew about one again after we graduated,  another had to go live to another state, then this one simply stopped talking to me and changed me, then when I entered highschool, I obviously didn't know anyone there, but I easily made some new friends, but this one was the first one I made in that school, he started talking to me and that, we talked alot and hanged out alot of times, I would invite him to my house alot too, and we would play videogames or do other fun stuff, but after awhile I started talking to another person which I still am friends with and talks to me occasionally, the 3 of us were best friends basically, we we would hang out and talk alot the 3 of us aswell. After awhile, the guy who I first talked to (let's just call him Angel for now) Angel, started talking more to the other one, I felt kinda jealous but It wasn't much so I thought I could get over it, but it was just more and more, he still talked to me alot though, just not alot more, I felt lonely, and they would do stuff I never did with him, without atleast probably remembering I exist or inviting me. I just didn't like it alot, when (lets call the guy I was kinda jealous of Sawyer), when Sawyer didn't assist school, Angel would just talk to me more instead, it felt good that he was talking to me more again, but it still didn't feel right, Angel even told me he liked talking to me more than Sawyer, but I just knew that it wasn't true, the last day of school before quarantine started, Sawyer did not assist school, but Angel and I did, he was obviously talking to me more, but I tried to ignore him, I simply didn't want to talk to him. He didn't say anything at all, but near when school was over he started noticing and was acting somewhat serious, he talked to me just about something else which had happened in the past that was funny, I felt like I was forced to laugh, but well, school was finally over and I walked home with another one of my friends, when I got home, I messages Sawyer telling him almost everything about this but he said he did not know what to say. A few hours after, Angel messaged me if we wanted to play Minecraft, I agreed but I said I had to go after awhile and he said it was okay. After that I was thinking of blocking him or not, I wanted to keep talking to someone, but I did not want someone who treated me like this and lied to me. I did block him after thinking it, feeling guilty, but I can never have friends that will last to me for a good while, so what was the point of still talking to him? Every person I know that has called me best friend has always left me behind. It's maybe just me not knowing how to appreciate friendship and doing something wrong. Or I am too jealous..

I know she is probably not a great girl to be with based on the way she handled this but it still really hurts! ive been lonley for a while and i just want to meet a genuine person you know? 

I lost all my friends druing my bad relationship and it feels like im coming into this pandemic totally alone and it feels impossible to meet people IRL now.

I dont know why im even posting this. It just sucks that people cant just say what they feel/think.

3032,QuoteExternal2731,1601576128,1,"I was valedictorian for my school, and the only thing I remember thinking was how little people actually cared about me at graduation. I did close to nothing social in high school. I only went to one party, smoked weed once, and never even touched a girl. How I am supposed to be proud of the work I did in high school when none of it amounted to something I actually wanted? Being valedictorian had no positive impact on my life and meant nothing to me. If anything, it ruined my life by preventing me from socializing and having a normal childhood.

I then went on to go to a top 10 university, and nothing in my life changed. Despite having a 3.97 gpa, college was easily the worst time of my life. No one at my university gives a shit about intelligence, and I was of course deemed a nerd and loser, just like in high school, for taking my academics so seriously. Despite being in a fraternity, I still have never touched a woman and had very few friends. And much like high school, I can't even be proud of my achievements. I am getting interviews from medical schools, which has been my lifelong dream, and I can't even get excited because I hate being so alone and hate being such a virgin. I feel as though the world has left me behind and that I will never catch up to live my life to the fullest.

I went from a good student to a drug addict, a steroid user, and not being able to change or brush my teeth for months because I was so depressed. I went from being a good person with hope for the future to someone who hates himself and feels robbed of having normal life experiences. I've even planned my own suicide because I genuinely just can't live this way anymore. Nothing I do in life will ever bring back the time I lost or the mistakes I made. I'm nothing but a loser and an imposter, and everything is finally starting to catch up to me.

Everyone else was right. Being a virgin is my fault and I have no one else to blame for being this way. I also never asked to live this life. I never asked to be the smart kid, I never asked to be valedictorian, I never asked to be one of the smartest students in my college. All I wanted was a normal life, and if it really is the case that I am the person who robbed myself of that chance, then I have no problems with killing myself and ending the life that I fucked up.

That is not a mental illness, it's called being a human being. No human deserves to live like this, and I am entitled to these emotions. I am tired of people saying that I am depressed and need help. No, what I needed was the security and knowledge growing up that someone out there at least loved me enough to be physically intimate with me. Without that knowledge or experience, I cannot be happy. I have never been happy due to my loneliness and virginity, not some made-up mental illness. And as a psychology major, calling this a mental illness is just disrespectful to those who actually have them. All of this is my fault, and people have made it apparent to me that I deserve to kill myself. Maybe if I actually do it, I'll be able to make others happy in a way my intelligence never could.",lonely,I can't feel proud of anything because of how lonely I am.,2020-10-02 04:15:28

3040,ladycustard,1601571625,2,"In the span of a day I lost my entire friend group and someone who I thought was the love of my life. I lost it all on Sunday and I’m doing my best to pick up all the pieces. 

My ex boyfriend, let’s call him Joel. I loved Joel and the way things ended were incredibly confusing and gave me the impression that he was going to better himself before coming back to me. I saw pictures of him on a girls Instagram account and he owed me a lot of money so I thought to myself “well, if he’s in a new relationship I might as well try to get my money back”. So I reached out and he said he would write me a check and that was that. A couple days later I saw him put it in the mailbox and drive off and I wrote him a goodbye letter about how saddened I was about how everything went down and how I still cared but was still hurt. I wished him good luck and blocked his number. Within 30 min he reached out to me on social media saying he was still in love with me and thought about me every day. I was excited to hear from him so I unblocked his number and we talked a lot. We talked about our lives and how badly we wanted to share things about our summers (I started a business and he became a race car driver) we both didn’t know what to do and we both wanted to fix this. I was excited to fix everything but the next day, I heard nothing from him. 

Meanwhile on top of that I have this friend, we’ll call him Mack. Mack has had feelings for me for about a year but I never reciprocated those feelings back and even told him he shouldn’t like me cause I’m a mess. Mack bought me food a lot, like every day when he would pick me up from school. It got to a point where I felt guilty and would ask if this was okay, he always said yes. Sometimes I’m not the nicest to Mack but I always apologized for my actions within an hour. While Joel was ghosting me I was freaking out to Mack about it and he was giving me rude responses so I asked what his problem was and he responded with nothing to which I said bye because I was stressed and didn’t understand why he was acting like that.

The next morning I had noticed that Mack had blocked me on everything. My first thought was that he was being dramatic and making my problem about himself which is exactly what I told our friends. They all told me that I was a shitty, manipulative friend and by that point I was completely lost. I asked them all what they were talking about and they said that I walk all over Mack to which I asked if this was about the food because I always made sure if that was okay. They told me that I constantly made everyone uncomfortable with my jokes and draining Mack mentally. I told them all I had no idea of any of this and that the jokes were all lighthearted and that they all made jokes too. They then told me that they tried to talk to me about it but I yelled at them? I’m sorry but I have no memory of that maybe I did do that but I feel like I would remember my friends telling me I’m hurting my other friend. They all blocked me shortly after. 

Meanwhile while Joel is ghosting me, I text the girl I found the pictures of him on her social media. We’ll call her Harley. I texted Harley in case she is Joel’s girlfriend and to let her know everything he said to me. She responds, telling me that this isn’t the first time this has happened with Joel and that they have been dating on and off for 4 years. Apparently the night Joel and I had plans for our first date he also had plans with Harley and then ghosted her. When Joel began to ghost me, he went back to Harley. Harley’s friend who we’ll call Scarlett then reached out to me and told me how Joel and his friends have been emotionally abusing girls they all went to high school with for 7+ years and that they’ve too insecure to be alone and constantly lie. I felt sick to my stomach and confronted Joel who then threatened to kill himself and proceeded to block me on everything. Harley and I kept talking about how identical our relationships were and how he told both of us we were married in a past life and took us to all the same places and it was really sad. The next morning I discovered Harley had blocked me on everything and I assumed she forgave Joel and went back to him. Scarlett told me she was going to block me too and that Harley is trying to forget that all of this happened. By this point I was all by myself. 

A part of me is trying to understand where everyone is coming from, another part of me thinks I didn’t deserve any of this. I don’t know, maybe I am a terrible person, maybe I’m destined to be alone, maybe I’m self destructive and selfish. I thought my intentions were good, I didn’t mean to hurt anyone. If you’ve read this far, wow you must have a lot of time on your hands. Am I crazy? Is there something wrong with me? I don’t know what to do.",lonely,I lost everything.,2020-10-02 03:00:25

I have not seen my girlfriend since quarantine started and we got out of school over 6 months ago. We had our 1 year anniversary at the end of August. She’s very busy, so generally when we texted, it might take a couple days for her to respond, but she tended to always answer. When we started school again, she had to do virtual learning, so we still didn’t get to see one another.

Well, her grades weren’t doing well, so her parents decided to take her phone. No texting. Not even a little. After a week, knowing her parents read her messages, I asked when she might get her phone back. Her dad left me on read. After another few days, I was frustrated because I was really anxious and needed to know how she was. I called her dad impolite for leaving me on read. Critical error in judgement, to be fair, this is not a rational man we’re dealing with, but also, all he had to do was say “when her grades improve” or literally anything else, I needed to know she was doing okay. Still, admittedly a bad decision. He left me on read again. 

I realized I could email her. I did. Her parents had been yelling at her nonstop even though she’d started doing her work, and when the week started, her dad sat her at a table, told her to do all of the work available for the week, hit her if she spoke at all, and would not let her up to do ANYTHING. Get water, use the bathroom, nothing.

During that email conversation, she was still at the table, and she just stopped responding after a couple emails. I assume her dad realized she was emailing, probably read the conversation, and gave her some repercussions for speaking to someone when she was grounded, which I blamed myself for since I contacted her.

My mental state went down the shitter, because that is legitimate physical and mental abuse, and I could do nothing about it, so I messaged her dad again a day later after what I believe was a 24 hour long panic attack. I apologized for being moody, explained that I was just worried and cared a lot about her, and begged for any word on how she was doing.

He told me some bullshit about how “her studies had been unduly interrupted by distractions of late” and that if I cared about her future, I would care how she was doing in school. I do, but total social isolation and threats are not gonna make her perform better. Anyways, he told me that calling him impolite was in “poor taste,” and that I could write her, because it would give me time to choose my words carefully, giving me their address.

Physical letters, baby, that’s what it came to.

So, I wrote a lovely letter, some song suggestions, enclosed with it a colored pic of me and my new puppy, and a nice sketch of me about to give her a hug, since my art skills aren’t half bad. I put as much love and as many things to latch onto as I could in it, since mail is slow, and I knew it might be a while until I got to send her something again, even though she lives about 14 minutes away.
I sent the letter 2 days after he said I could write her, and that was a week and a half ago.

I still have not gotten a response. The mail system is already stupidly slow, which has worsened because of the pandemic, but I also have to remember that her dad is an ass and he might have interfered because he hates me. He could have given me the wrong address, burned the letter, refused to mail her response, whatever. I know I’m definitely just paranoid, but I can’t help it.

I haven’t been able to sleep. I’m touch starved and miserable. I used to have severe depression and some signs of anxiety, then fixed myself and got better, having the best year of my life before the pandemic. This situation has made me backslide so insanely hard I cannot describe it. I cannot function lately. It’s 3 AM, and I’ve been tossing and turning and shaking for 3 hours because I just want to see or hear from her and I can’t. 

Everything is gonna be fine when the pandemic is over, and I have the rest of my life to live with her assuming we stay together, but that’s so far away. When you feel this way, time itself stretches. The last month has felt longer than the year before it did. I don’t know what to do, and I just really needed to get all this out. Sorry it was so long.",lonely,Separation anxiety is terrible,2020-10-01 17:10:47
3067,queenseauni,1601536147,1,"I’ve been alone in ways that others haven’t. I (late 20’s F) spent the first 13 years of my life as an only child, raised by a single mom who also isolated me, in home and social life.
I watched friends go to parties I never got to (birthdays I got invited to, had to decline)
I was sooo happy every chance I got to be around other children and absolutely destroyed when I was forced to stay inside for something I did that didn’t make sense (parent was controlling even at a young age) this caused me to not be able to talk to people like everyone else can.
I actually love being alone. I can stand being lonely. 
I grew up as a very lonely child. I talked to inanimate objects, sometimes I still do. I prefer my company over others mostly. But I am human. I still get lonely, too. 
My lonely is different because I’m USED to it. My lonely isn’t wah I wish I had friends. My lonely is “does anyone understand?”
“Can anyone hear me?” My lonely is the loudness that is my personality and person being converted into quiet, little rocks. Enough to fit into whatever space society demands of me.
But, I am lonely now. My lonely is chronic as it started in the isolated childhood. I do, and can admit I isolate as an adult. It’s not intentional and I crave intimacy, but my most intimate relationships are spacey because I’ve been spacey. All I want is to be seen, heard, felt, understood. I feel lonely with others and by myself. I feel lonely so often it’s normal for me. My lonely isn’t like others when they’re missing someone far away. My lonely is like a personality trait.

3111,MrSkelital,1601504154,1,"Hi all,

Hope you're all doing well during these times. I wanted to make a post as over the past month or so, I've been really struggling internally. Some background before I go into it; I'm  a 22M who was used to having a girl to talk to and love everyday for 5 years - we were even engaged.

When that ended (she left me for someone else) it broke me, but motivated me to be a much better person; I went from working at Maccies on minimum wage to being a Network Vendor Engineer on a decent wage for my age, all in a year. The breakup happened 15 months ago. I moved out of my parents house and now I live alone.

Ever since I moved in to my own flat alone, Its been getting increasingly lonely. I miss having someone to talk to all night, to hold, hug, kiss and... Yanno. I haven't had a hug or any intimacy with a special someone since that last relationship. 

The rest of my life is going pretty well, but this loneliness is really crippling me inside. I stopped caring about how I look, I've gained weight, my hair is messy; I just don't see the point. I work hard and have friends, games and table tennis as hobbies, but I still feel lonely. Anybody have any advice? I've really been struggling since my last (and first) relationship ended.

Thanks everyone, really appreciate that you took time to read this. Really just need a hug.",lonely,Beginning to miss that special someone,2020-10-01 08:15:54
3112,tjockisman,1601503062,1,"I’ve always had friends but even since I completed 9th grade I’ve been thinking that this wasn’t ever considered a friend. I used to hang out with a group of 5 or 7 guys and we were good friends but they’d always hang out and never once asked me if I wanted to join them. And now that we have started high school it’s gotten even lonelier. 
My ex-friends all went to the same school whereas l went to a school in another city because it was just a better school. Ever since then none of them have texted me once, they only send streaks on Snapchat and that’s about it. 
However, I have now become friends with some guys in my new class but sometimes I just feel left out when they have conversations. And it’s kinda hard for me since I’m mostly introverted and I can’t really get along with anyone else because my class only has 8 boys and 26 girls. 
I’ve tried talking with some girls but we couldn’t keep a conversation going because it was kinda awkward. But I don’t wanna put myself with the girls a lot because I don’t wanna fall in love again just to be broken. 
On the other hand my religion and parents don’t really want me taking to girls or even forming relationships ships because they say i am to young and did I gotta become an adult to get a girlfriend. I get where there coming from but how am I supposed to get experience for the future if I don’t do nothing, u know. 
And don’t get me wrong I’m not bad looking I’ve had some compliments from people before but I’m more on the shorter side because of my genetics, something that I can’t control. Therefore I think some girls usually don’t wanna talk.

At school concentrating is hard because I'm just thinking about sucide. Just end this loneliness. I can't take this shit. nothing helps. maybe exercise does for 30 minutes then I feel shit again.

What's the point of doing anything??

I never said I was depressed. I haven't even been diagnosed. Since that day I slowly isolated myself more and more. till today. I left l the group chats as people there don't see just there for memes and shit like that. When I ask if we have a homework or tedt everyone ignores me. why did they add me ?

I value it so much too that I'm always trying to be better at it. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I am getting what I dish out. Thoughts?

2. Maybe my bar is too high? As I said, for work I listen to people and they listen to me. I see how good it is. I expect this from personal relationships. So maybe my bar isn't too high, but maybe I'm using the wrong measuring stick? What I mean is that maybe personal relationships and professional ones can't be compared?

""What are you playing? Sounds nice!""  
I turn my head around, away from the piano, and there she stands, with a big smile on her face, carrying the scent of fresh, cold air into our living room.   
""Oh, I just improvised over some melodies that came to my mind, no big thing. How was your walk with Sammy?""  
""It was great to see her again after her semester abroad, we had a lot to talk about.""

She takes off her yellow beanie, revealing the long, tousled hair under it. Once again I notice that her eyes and her hair have the excact same color. A deep, mystical brown, looking like a whole forest is trapped in her iris.  
""Your hair looks like a mess"", I say with a mischievous grin.  
""Easy for you to say, you have none."" We both have to laugh and she lovingly strokes my head, which is, in fact, completely bold.   
""I'll go make some tea"", she says, ""maybe we could continue with the puzzle?""

She kisses me on the forehead and goes to the kitchen. I get up from my piano stool, making myself comfortable on the couch with a blanket. It's almost dark outside, so I decide to light some candles to avoid switching on the bright ceiling lamp. 

The cover of the puzzle shows a picture of a couple walking down an avenue at night. The leaves of the trees shine colorful in the light of the antique street lamps. The man carries an umbrella. She walks really close to him so she is safe from from the raindrops.

Next to the cover is a small pile of puzzle pieces which still have to be put in their right place. And the puzzle, that is almost finished, except a small part in the middle. 

I can already smell the scent of wild berries as my girl enters the living room with two hot cups of tea.

""Don't you think it's a little too dark to see what's on the pieces?"", she asks.  
""Naah, I think we can manage it. Come here, there's enough space under the blanket for both of us.""  
She snuggles up to me and there we sit, dimmed light, the soft sound of rain outside. 'This is home', I think.

""Ok, seems like only the couple in the middle is missing. Can't wait to finish this finally!"", she says, full of excitement. ""I'll make the guy and you'll make the girl"", she adds. 

We start searching the pile for the right pieces.  
""Uhmm, I think there are some parts missing"", I note after a while.  
""I can't imagine that"", she anwers. ""I did a lot of puzzles and this never happened before.""  
She already put the pieces of the guy together and included him in the puzzle. Only the place where the woman should be is still empty.

""Yes I swear!"", I insist. ""None of the pieces I need are there."" 

I turn my head to her, but nobody is sitting next to me. I close my eyes and picture how it could be one last time. It could be so wonderful. It could be home.

He said that he wanted to meet up and I said sure, which we did today at a local bar. I had forgotten but he said he also was 2 meters tall, which I'm as well but I felt tiny in comparison. He sat down and he was like reaaaaally into asking me personal questions, I felt extremely intimidated but I didnt know what to say, so I answered the best I could.

I also exposed a lot about myself which I now in hindsight shouldn't have done, it's like I feel gross in some way and thirdly and most important; I do remember having a lot of ""friends"" that see me as a second-rate friend and not one of their closest circle, they probably felt what I felt when talking to this guy and it made me think of what garbage human I am.  
I at least told him afterwards that we didnt match that good and he seemed okay with it so at least there's that.

3136,Puritykill,1601488829,1,"I (25F) have been through a LOT. Since I was 8 years old everything went downhill.   
I was a happy kid and had a few good friends. I did good on school and was very good at  athletics. When I became 8 years old we moved to a house 2 km away. Every day after school I would play outside, twice athletics in a week and one match/training every Sunday. But a few week later after we moved I felt not good. I couldn't run as fast as I normally could, I just became bad at everything. I always felt tired and I can't 10 kilos in 6 months times. I had to stop with athletics because after each training I couldn't walk the stairs anymore or barely ride my bicycle back home.   


Since than I also lost my friends, I had to move to a different school and got extremely bullied there. Everyday I come home with tears all over my face. Lucky enough I had a pet rabbit who helped me a lot trough those years, miss you Snuitje &lt;3 r.i.p. but I became more sick each day. Even the whole summer vacation I spend inside sleeping. I could sleep for 4 hours in the day and 8 hours in the night, in total I slept 12 hours a day. I again had to change to a different school, I did got bullied there to, but way less than on the previous school. But sadly enough my older sister also bullied me a lot at home.   
Everyday was a hell. Not only on school but at home too. Because I was sick a lot, my parents took me to doctors, hospitals etc etc.. All claimed that something was not good, but they didn't know what. Sugar? No that was good, thyroid? kinda low, but good enough. for many years I have visited many hospitals and doctors. Never with any result. But they did agree something was wrong.   


I stayed many times at home, which cause that child care came after me and my parents. THEY WERE SO HORRIBLE! They never believed me that I was sick, and even when I had 0% energy, I still had to fight against them, even one day I was extremely sick. I had an appointment at the office of youth Services, and I was as white as a ghost. They told me to go to school after the appointment, but I felt so HORRIBLE SO SICK and I just threw up over their desk. Oh boy they were mad and still didn't believe me. Because I missed some days at school I had many lawsuits, me getting community service and my parents fines, even one time €2000,- Even when we had a note from the doctor that I was really sick, but that they couldn't figure out what....  


So this all happend from the age of 8 till 21 and everyday was hell at home thanks to my older sister who bullied me, stole from me, hitted me etc. My parents fighting because of youth service, because of the lawsuits and because of my older sister..   


All this time I had nothing but my pet rabbit who died when I was 16. and my stuffed animals. I always have them on my bed and I am really attached to them. I don't know why... but all this time I never had friends and still don't have. I did have relationships, but after being in a relationship the changed and started gaslighting, cheating etc. I did have a psychiatrist where I talked about my relationships and she told me that I should stop caring about people so much even if I was in relationship.. and that I pushed these people away because I was ''too nice''   


anyways, thanks to being bullied on my work I got fired 2 months before corona happend. (I was the only Dutch person, so racism was there aswell). Since than I haven't found a new job yet. I only finished highschool but nothing after thanks to my illness back than.   


Everyday since I finished highschool I only talked to my parents sometimes (I still live at home) and when I was in a relationship I had sometimes my than bf to talk to, but that was more listing to them talking about their family and work, and playing games and watching series they want to play and see.   


I do try to work hard everyday to become a better person, and I have been on dating sites to find a good relationship and friends, but I have only been on horrible dates. And the good dates did end in a relationship, but only to be gaslighted a few months later.  Trying to find friends in online gaming didn't work out either.   


So for many many years, I am alone no one to talk to except sometimes my parents. I just spend most of my days trying to sell items online, gaming, reading, listing to music, going outside for walks with cleaning up garbage. Going to the cinema, musea, concerts etc but I have just never been succesful in getting friends. Its not that I am extremely ugly, or awkward or anything, but it just didn't happen.. I have even 0 friends on discord. I even got made fun of by my sister that I have 0 friends and that a girl should be easily be able to have many friends.   


I am sorry for the long post and I am sorry for my bad english.  It is hard to explain everything here, so if you got any questions, feel free to ask me =) I hope you all do a lot better than me!

3137,acstitch,1601488782,1,"hi! i’m a twenty-five year old guy from the us, more specifically the east coast. i’d prefer to find people that are also in north america, given time zones. if your sleep schedule is as messed up as mine, i’m willing to befriend people from anywhere, really! i’m an infj to the core; if there’s something i fail to mention, it‘s described perfectly by myers-briggs. i put my all into everything i do, though that has bitten me in the ass more than i’d like to admit. will i continue doing it? absolutely. i’m a loyal friend, easy to talk to, and i enjoy making others laugh.

i love animals. i’ve had pets ranging from puppies and kittens to fish and hedgehogs. i’m a dog person, but my cat changed my view of felines in general. i’ll send you photos of my dogs and cat, but only if you promise to do the same! free pass if you don’t have any, but i might make you send me memes to compensate. 

i’ve found that music is therapeutic for me. what’s on repeat for me? joji’s new album nectar. if you’ve listened to it, what’s your favorite song? in addition to nectar, i like lauv’s album “i met you when i was 18.” and finneas latest release “blood harmony.”

i enjoy gaming. i typically stick to 1-3 games at a time, but i’ll play something else if prompted. at the moment, valorant and dead by daylight are my favorites... as well as animal crossing when i’m relaxing in bed. if you have any terraforming tips, please help. i’m lost out here haha. it’s also worth mentioning that i’ve had internet issues recently, so gaming isn’t *as important* as it typically is. 

i’d love to find someone that i can watch shows and movies with. perhaps we could binge watch halloween movies given the fact that it’s spooky szn? more specifically, i’d like to rewatch the scream and halloween movies to start with. i’ve also gotta watch nightmare before christmas at some point! if horror isn’t your thing, i’m open to other genres as well! 

above all, i’d like to meet likeminded people that i can form meaningful connections with. i’m looking for friends, but if something develops beyond that and i gain someone to mutually annoy for years, i’m down. if you feel like we’d get along based upon what i’ve written, shoot me a chat or a message!

The problem with me is that today I had a text chat with someone that used to really cheer me up in the past. It was short and nice talk. Also I played some video games with my mates and yet... I feel like I am still not happy nor feeling any better.
Like.. like I just let my mind focus on something so I'm not overthinking and it's just going back after I'm done. For the past few days I felt like shit. I am sick, and got nobody I could just truly trust and feel good with them. I'm too afraid to chat with anyone, that even claims that is in similar situation and I could understand them.
My life is, I would call it, a stable mess. But with my moods I feel like.. I'd just like to disappear.
I just want to hug to something else than the pillow, talk with someone and be accepted with all my imperfections. Yet I just can't make a step to get to know someone, I know they will get tired of me, that I can't think of anything interesting to talk about and I'm going to be just a fifth wheel.

It's being at a party, or at a stadium full of people cheering for something, that I might feel loneliness. I'll quote Ibsen, ""The strongest men are the most alone."" I've never thought, ""Well, some beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuck-job, rub my balls, and I'll feel good."" No, that won't help.

I have no freinds becuase no one thinks about me enough to ever even check on me or talk to me once I lose the energy to do all the work in maintaining a friendship.
