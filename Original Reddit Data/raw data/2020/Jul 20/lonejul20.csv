4,CuddleTea,1596197629,1,"I got out of a terrible relationship earlier this year. It was my first relationship ever. It's been especially hard for several reasons. I always had trouble making friends and never dated in my teens. I was bullied all throughout my school years and abused as a child. I could go on and on, but I don't feel like going into detail. I felt unlovable. I didn't want to be defined by my trauma. I didn't want to be bitter, negative, or mean. I tried to be as nice and sweet and supportive as possible. I wanted to be the person I wish I could depend on when I was younger. I thought if I tried to be my best possible self, I would feel lovable.

Eventually I entered a long distance relationship. There would end up being many problems. I was never good enough. For example, apparently they didnt like my fashion taste. I began having them approve of my clothes before I bought and wore them. I never got christmas or valentines gifts because I ""wasn't special enough"". When I moved in with them on the other side of the country, they revealed they had just quit their job with saying anything first. I would have to pay for everything, because they didn't wan't to get a job. I wasn't allowed to bring the subject of job hunting up. It made them angry. The appartment was disgusting too. Full of trash, empty pizza boxes with moldy pizza, and no furniture. I slept on the floor. I cleaned the place and bought nice furniture. Not cheap Ikea stuff either. I would cook, clean, work, and support them. Holidays were extra lonely. I bought ny own birthday cake.

I immediately became isolated. I wasn't able to make friends. They never approved of any friends I made. Their friends refused to meet or talk or get to know me. They didnt want a new person joining the group. They didnt like my family either. They got angry whenever my mom called me to see how I was doing.

Also, they didn't like spending time with me. My hobbies and interests were too stupid or childish. They only wanted to hang out with their friends all day and not come home till 2 in the morning. They constantly gushed about their one friend. Saying she was better then me. More important than me. Gush about how her boobs have gotten bigger. They constantly compared me to her throughtout the entire relationship. I turns out they were cheating on me. The claimed it wasnt cheating.

They claimed ""lots of friends flirt, and drink while naked, and have sex with eachother."" That I was just jealous. They said I had no right to be jealous and that they could do whatever they want. They claimed it technically wasn't cheating cause there just friends. I couldn't take it anymore. I havent even listed all thw things theve done. I tried to commit suicide. It survived. Then later, I finally broke up with them and moved back home. I even took the furniture because I paid for all of it.

I haven't been the same. I had loved them. I wanted to be the perfect girlfriend. Apparently they didn't love me and I would never be good enough. I'm currently seeing a therapist. My family is also worried about me and has been very supportive. I'm trying to heal and get better. Most days recovery feels impossible. I don't want to get up in the morning. I feel completely broken. I'm scared I'll never have friends or find love and be happy again. I'm too everwhelmed by the cruelty of humans. I trying to learn plant care as a hobby to help. I also have a stuffed animal collection. The best I can do is keep busy and take things one day at a time. But even that is feeling impossible.

It can be something as mundane as having the same meal and talking about it. I just want it.

I want to be able to watch a TV show with people and talk about it. I want to be able to play the same game with someone and play with them. Heck, something as simple as just being in the same room as someone, even if we're chilling in completely different ways, just knowing that if we find something cool, we can say ""hey check this thing out!""

**But I think what I want more than that is for it to be personal.**

Reddit has so many great subreddits for different hobbies, even some of my incredibly niche hobbies like cryptography and conlanging.

But none of the discussions are ever personal. I never build any connection with any of the posters or commenters. Sharing my excitement for something cool, while it does get attention, while it does give me notifications, feels like a one way street.

I see a notification and I know that it's a response to something I posted. It's not a message to me personally.

I wish they were though.

Over the last year and a half, I've lost touch with the majority of my close friends due to moving away, being sick constantly, drifting interests, and in one case being completely shunned from a group because of a misunderstanding.

Everyone that I had a personal connection with is so far away now, and I have no easy way of making any close connections in a quarantine world where meeting in person is a no-go, where everyone is tired of video chats, where every place I would go to share my interests isn't a place I would necessarily got to make close friends.

I am a 20m, the oldest or triplets to caring parents. About to start my third year of college online (my choice, I think it will end poorly on campus with all this stuff going on) and yet I feel so absolutely hopeless about everything. Friends, my future.  

I have always been insecure about friend abandonment, yet now I just feel alone even when around those I have left... I lost one of my longest friends during college, basically cut me off due to having irrational beef with my brother (three of us go to same college). It has made me even more scared about the others. I feel like they are phasing me out, only letting me see a mask of tolerance or just a mask, yet I have no proof. Only my fear and lack of trust. Why bother making new friends if they all leave you right?

And that doesn't even get into my future. You know the normal trope right? One sibling is the really successful one, another is comfortable and the last was a failure who faded into the unknown, rarely or never seen again. I feel like that right now. What my future holds. I may pass college, get my degree. Maybe even get a first job. But I see it happening. I'll be alone, everyone else dealing with their lives. Left in a hole of my own making or from some event outside my control.

I lay in bed every night with a pit in my stomach thinking about this stuff. I just stop breathing for a sec and feel the emptiness inside me. Sometimes I want to cry, yet I can do it.

I don't consider myself at risk or anything (I am deathly afraid of needles or getting a bad/deep cut from any sharp object. Don't like pain at all), sometimes I do wonder what would happen. Kinda like those thoughts of who would show up to the funeral when you pass. Sometimes I wonder if I am meant to hit my 30's, get old.

In these past few months I‚Äôve put together a lot of my pieces of my life together, in remarkably quick time. And for once, I can say in full confidence I am proud of how far I‚Äôve come, and know my worth too know where I can go. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to do that for years too come. Growing in my own company has been the most painful, yet eye opening experience in this short life I‚Äôve lived, but I‚Äôve learned and gained great examples through new people, that trauma and baggage won‚Äôt address itself, and could be the demise of good things too come for you. Making my biggest focus to drop my ego for a change, and coming to terms with anyone deserving of them. You have never been any exception maddy, I‚Äôm so proud of how far we came in terms of communication when we were together, but especially the extent when went too, for ourselves, together. The day we broke up, and many, many, more to follow, the only sanity I held in myself, was the fact you were open to continue to grow with each other, with passion and romance aside. That I could meet the new person you‚Äôd soon become, I found more comfort in just that alone than I can express, but up too this point I‚Äôve heard more about others around you, than the person I cannot help, but unconditionally love.
 You cross my mind in any sense of a memory I‚Äôve had of you, every pretty moon, any Kanye reference, Beatles melody, and fuck, every time I see a yellow light.  Since the day I read your last note you gave me, I‚Äôve been waiting as patiently as I can, with utmost respect too you, too meet the person you‚Äôve become, without me. but as my days dwindle by, I can‚Äôt help but feel it won‚Äôt come as organically as it could have, as you said in my car, tears filling your eyes, and a despair so heavy in the air, that if I unclenched my jaw in that moment, I‚Äôd lose it too the point I couldn‚Äôt  drive home. That opportunity seems even further more escaping too me, I don‚Äôt even know if I can say for us anymore. Now that months have surpassed, I can‚Äôt beat myself up anymoree Than I have over a dynamic I‚Äôm currently blind too. I want nothing more than to support the person I‚Äôve grown to love, in a spiritual connection, fuck I tell my homies I love them in the same sense every week, knowing my time is short.  But you need too allow me to do that, and you haven‚Äôt up too this point. I took you off my socials, not out of anger, and never resentment, not in the slightest. But the fact My heart becomes debilitatingly heavy not knowing where I stand in that woman‚Äôs life anymore. I‚Äôd love to grab a coffee, go by the lake, or check out the new exhibits in art museums, but closure seems far fetched at this point. Granted the opportunity, I‚Äôd enjoy meeting the new, bad bitch, kicking ass, and taking names Madeline sometime. All I ask is refraining from social media and me until that point, because I could never block a person like you out of my life. But any interaction with the new you, is strange too the point it saddens me, and I‚Äôm hoping this message, in the least, will help me let go even the slightest degree of pain in my heart, and leave room for new people, with my past aside, because people deserve that of me. A clean slate that a companionship can healthfully be built on. I‚Äôm sorry this was time consuming to read, but I couldn‚Äôt cross my fingers for a call anymore.

I feel the need to brag about my accomplishments.  Pretty stacked resume, not too ugly.  If I try, I can deliberately look ""good.""  Used to act/fitness model (TV shows, commercials, etc).  Bachelors and masters degree.  War veteran of Iraq.  Used to be ambitious.  Never really felt lonely.  Never really had trouble getting laid.  Never really had a problem finding people to socialize with.  One of the guys with more fake friends than real but ran with it. I'm a natural introvert but can and often play the role of party/nightlife guy.  Not a morally terrible guy, in fact, I'd say I'm ethical and principled but far from being an angel or saint.  Always been the guy to break up the relationship. 

But beginning two years ago, life started to take a fat shit on me.  Financial ruin/hardship, physical injuries. Muscles/physique all gone.  Started a new career that was going well then covid struck.  Furloughed.

I've lost several friends the past two years due to egos/pride conflicting.  Last date was last year with a cool girl but again I ended it because i didn't see a future and she seemed more emotionally selfish than me, which is pretty selfish.

Anyways, I find myself these days feeling genuinely lonely.  Sort of wish I had a gf.  My ego, pride, ambition and high self esteem (predicated on insecurity/fears) is waning (but pops up now and then).  Feeling lost.  Thinking about moving, but where?  What career choice moving forward? (I've had several and achieved high success in most where I wanted to achieve). 

I wish I can meet a girl who i can chill with, who understands the multiple roles we play (public vs private), (i'm pretty boring, intellectual, sloppy, disgusting, cynical, stressed in private ie human but will often play confident, well put together in public). But maybe this loneliness stems from covid lockdown?  Once the world opens up again, it's time to hit the ground running.  I don't know.  

Chasing an ambition used to be my cure for loneliness but again, I'm aging and the energy and drive just isn't there anymore.  Maybe I should settle down but I don't know how - mentally, behaviorally, emotionally.  I see my friends from childhood do it and i'm partly disgusted and partly want it.

God damn it, how ironic it is that back when quarantine wasn't a thing and we still went to school I kept saying things like ""I wanna go home"".

Almost 5 months into quarantine and I regret saying that every day. This is the worst time of my life. I've never felt so lonely. No one's reaching out to me anymore, unless they need help with something. Everyone lost interest in me. I don't feel like I have friends anymore.

What's worse is that by the look of things I'm the only one from my group that feels this way - everyone's got some friends outside of school that they still talk to. Except me. I'm the only one that has this problem.

Hi everybody. I‚Äôll give a short blurb about myself to explain who I am and what I‚Äôm struggling with I guess. I‚Äôve kind of lost any will to move forward recently and don‚Äôt really care about getting help anymore either. I‚Äôm in my late twenties, college graduate, work as an engineer, great job, home owner, great family life growing up and still to this day, decent friends, no girlfriend or anything like that anymore. Not much to complain about. I have hobbies like fishing, video games, cooking, playing music, building things in my garage, lifting weights, and cooking, as a few examples. 

Long story short, I‚Äôm miserable. I‚Äôm able to have fun and I go out with friends and stay active and enjoy things in life. Really like my job with a great income and being independent. But I share it with nobody. My family (parents and siblings) are very supportive and I continue on knowing that they care about me. But I‚Äôm losing faith in myself because I simply feel alone a lot. I don‚Äôt have a family of my own and I have nobody to share my successes and life experiences with. It‚Äôs just me. By myself. In my little house.

I come home some nights during the week after the gym and will just stare at my wall for hours. Or read for a minute and stare at the same page for hours. I cry on a regular basis and am simply unhappy with my life. 

I could continue typing about things I do and feelings I have, but there are so many posts here that already explain similar symptoms so I don‚Äôt see a point in doing so. I‚Äôm no different. Hopefully I convince myself to get help or find more joy in living.

110,BlueWolfAnonymous,1596127165,1,"This is gonna be a bit of a rant.

I don't know why, I really don't, but I just can't seem to get a girl. Never mind, that I can't seem to make friends with anyone who isn't unpleasant towards me. Like, the only people who ever hang out with me are people who are extremely negative, get mad at me for small stuff, or just... 

Look. The only relationship I've ever been in was an abusive one. She dropped me six times and I accepted her again everytime. She never tried to find a way to cheer me up when I was sad besides insisting I needed a relationship with God when she knew I was an atheist. Everyone said I should drop her, that she was bad for me, but I was scared that if I did, I would just be alone. And guess what? I was right. 5 years later and I've never been able to get so much as a date from someone.

I really don't get it. I'm not ugly, I'm really not. Some even tell me I'm cute. A lot tell me I'm a nice and kind person. So I don't understand why I can't find a relationship. I know a lot of people don't value money that much, but I'm so demoralized that I've become obsessive over money. Like, if I can't win affection with a kind heart and sincere effort, maybe I can buy it? Maybe someone will be around me if I give them enough stuff... Maybe someone will think well of me and accept that I'm only decent looking if I seem successful.

But what about my title, yeah? You know where I HAVE gotten attention from? Guys. I really think I could hook up with or date a guy any time if I wanted to. I've had guys openly express disappointment that I was straight. And not bad guys, I mean really genuinely cute guys. Guys who would be fun to hang out with. If I were bisexual, I wouldn't be so damn alone. I could actually have a relationship. So I hate that I'm straight.

You know why being straight is really so horrible? Online dating. No, online messaging. Females can post an ad on any number of subreddits and, so long as they haven't posted a dozen times before, get flooded with options of who to talk to. I can post an ad, with three times as much information and effort, and not get a single response. Scroll through them, yeah? Kikpals and whatnot, scroll through them. Page after page of guys posting because most of the time when they respond to a female post, they never even get a reply. And ya know, I bet they still didn't really get a reply from their own post. Cuz online, females get options and guys don't.

You know Tinder? It was crazy hearing that a woman expected they could jump on pretending to be a guy and get plenty of matches. Imagine the shock when they went from a 50% match rate from their own real profile to one that was less than 2%. Why use online dating, it just destroys self-esteem. Used it for years, never gotten a single date.

Yeah, I'm bitter... Bitter that I have put in so much effort and time trying to even find someone to talk to and have failed so miserably. Like, I get it, I COULD talk to guys. But I'm gonna be honest, I don't want to. I dunno why, I just don't enjoy it. I guess it's cuz I'm not really looking for friends. I want to feel intimacy. I'm an affectionate person, and these days I feel physically cold. I want to trade backrubs with a girl, and cuddle, and relax. I want to feel warm and like I'm worth something. I feel cold. So damn cold. It's hard to focus on anything now because I can't stop craving affection.

I guess I've rambled long enough. I just needed to vent... I can't tell if I'm being selfish, or stupid, or what, I just know that I desperately desire intimacy.

129,030819,1596106752,1,"First thing I'd like to say is I'm not suicidal. I'm just stuck in a weird place.


I'm a 24 year old guy that works full time and lives at home with my family still. Since leaving high school, I got straight into work and I lost contact with pretty much all my friends. Whilst I'm as much to blame for not reaching out to them, they didn't reach out to me either. We drifted apart and a few months into work, I lost contact with them all, except one who we would chat a handful of times every few months. I didn't feel anything wrong though, I was fairly happy in my life, my job, my personal life too. Then about 3 years ago I made a good friend at work, however they were only here temporarily, so after a few months they left, I tried to keep in contact but once again things drifted. It hit me hard, it brought new issues into perspective and I started to feel lonely and missing something for the first time. 


I worked on being more regular with the one friend I still had and I reached out to a couple of others. Unfortunately things didn't get back on track with them. So all I was left with was my one friend still, we chatted more regular now. 



The next step in my life was falling in love, someone new came into my life and she was the best thing that happened to me. We spent so much time together as good friends, we were inseparable and worked together every single day! Eventually we both let our feelings slip out and after a crazy few months she wasn't ready for it and decided she wanted to make it work with her boyfriend that she had drifted from when we were close (I feel bad for that, however it was already happening before I knew her, to be completely honest, they don't get along, they never did, they are both better without each other but they don't realise that even when their friends and family all point it out). 
It caused a lot for stress, mixed with work stress too, it all came to an end. We hardly speak anymore. We both always said the one thing we never want to happen is to lose each other over anything as we meant a lot to each other. However once again I tried my best, I did everything to keep us together as friends only. It never worked out. She no longer has any time for me. 



Work is no longer a good place for me, that has been slowly getting worse for the last few years too. Covid came along and have me time to work from home, I managed to get through each day, hoping that the time would not only allow the work situation to improve, but also allow my friend some time and that once we returned to work we would get along a bit better again.



So far it's still getting worse, I've had to return to the office but she hasn't or anyone else from our small team. I either spend each day at work alone in the office or with just my boss. I think being alone is marginally better.



There are no real projects to get stuck into and most work used to be with my friend, she has gone extremely distant in recent weeks, I don't think she's even doing any work from home now, just the absolute minimal. 


I feel so bored and isolated. I spend each minute at the office trying to find something to actually do that feels worthwhile and I'll get some self satisfaction from. I end up just browsing Reddit and things as there is so little going on. I then go home and have however many hours to waste until I go to bed and the cycle starts again.



I have no motivation left anymore, making friends is too much hard work, it's great whilst it lasts, then when I lose them, each one I lose gets more difficult for me to deal with than the last. I used to be happy in my own little bubble, but not anymore. 
I feel like I have nothing to look forward to in my life or anyone that truly cares about me like I used to have from my friends. I've never had a real relationship, but the closest I had was with my friend above and at that moment I felt content in my life. It gave me motivation and allowed me to enjoy all my hobbies again. I know I need to be happy in myself and I can truly say I am when I know I also have people like her or another friend I've had in my life. For me happiness includes others.

I gave her a lot of shit but she never judged me for any of it. Around a month ago, I realised that I've developed feelings for her.
Two days ago I asked her what's the first thing she's going to do once (if) things go back to normal. She said she's going out for a drink with her friend and that she also has a date pending. Now I feel like shit for having feelings for someone who only sees me as a friend. I feel like shit for feeling shit over something so trivial.

These things include:

„ÉªJoining clubs and classes to find like minded people
„ÉªBeing myslef and establishing to everyone who I am
„ÉªTrying to find people subtly through chance and proximity
„ÉªBeing myself
„Éªknowing and loving who I am on a personal level
„ÉªSetting boundaries and standing up for myself
„ÉªInitiating opportunities to connect with people
„ÉªShowing I care and am enthusiastic about them and their unique qualities
„ÉªBeing sensitive to their boundaries, needs, personal life, etc
„Éªbeing (respectfully) honest and asking for honesty
„ÉªAsking for help and being (healthily) vaulerable if I need it

Having a girlfriend has been a life goal of mine since I was very young (11) and honestly it shouldn‚Äôt have been but it has. As time progressed since high school the yearning to have a girlfriend and know what it was like to be in love kept bothering me and began to get worse.

I‚Äôm still very close with them but, knowing that I‚Äôm the only one who is still single Extenuated my yearnings to be with someone. Freshman year passed and I found myself still single. Sophomore year was no better in this case. Now here I am about to start junior year of college still single and the kissless dateless virgin.

I'll keep this relatively short; what I'm referring to is the fantasy of friend and kinship. It's quite an interesting tale, a tragedy at best and suicide inducing at worst.

I've talked to a lot of people about this fantasy, of having friends that just care about what you have to say and vice versa. Always having each others' backs and understanding your differences even when they are drastic. I used to believe in this fantasy, now I believe otherwise and am slowly coming to a really scary conclusion. 

We all hope for better, create our subreddits that hope to unite people like the lonely and disabled that just can't catch a break. We all want to join hands and just have something real, we offer friendship and get half-baked replies in our inboxes that diminish over time because we're strangers. We can't do it.

And that's where the fantasy ends, I just don't know whether to be relieved on the conclusion and continue with my art until I die in a lonely existence of no connection or relationships. Or to just sink and become one of the desperate clingers that drop into horrible relationships and pretend they're happy for the rest of their lives with their dog and two kids.

190,TerriblySleepy,1596050696,1,"29 M here, fighting with loneliness. Last year, the relationship I was in collapsed and left me minus one lover and best friend (one and the same person). Couple that with the lockdown and the fact that I am by nature a fairly distant person... well, lets just say being alone is a lot more lonely than I remember.

I've taken a few actions over the past year and a bit to try and combat the loneliness. Some have worked, some have fallen flat. Someone suggested I share my efforts, that they may help someone else. I'd also love to hear anything you may have tried whether it succeeded or failed. Even if your efforts have yielded little benefit for you, the strategies you employed could prove useful for others in different contexts.

I hope this helps, and thank you in advance for helping me!

# The strategies:

\- **Go outside.** I'm a homebody, but leaving these 4 walls once in a while really helps sometimes. Usually just going for a stroll.

\- **Make yourself available on social apps.** I don't mean twitter/ig/fb/etc. I mean apps specifically designed to help with social voids, not enhance them. Patook is one I've had luck with in the past, if it's available in your region. Presently, Slowly is doing quite well for me. It's a pen pal app. Admittedly, women do have a different experience with such apps than men, but both of the above have safeguards to at least make it more difficult for the creeps to creep.

\- **Discord.** This was where I've had the most success. I hopped in a few random servers (via Disboard) and out of the dozen or so I hopped in, just one of them suited me. In that one server, I met someone that I now consider a very good friend. Additionally, I'm still in that server and can usually count on having someone there to talk to when I feel down.

\- **Reach out to old friends.** Yes, this is terrifying. No, it hasn't worked for me. It worked for someone I know though. Maybe it could work for you?

\- **Meetup.com.** I used to be fairly active here. Went through a phase after the breakup where I thought being an introvert (and quite introverted I am) was my biggest problem. Indeed, it is not a problem but rather one of my strengths. That said, I spent some time faking extroversion *hard*. Overall, Meetup was a failure for me simply because I did not make any lasting friendships. This is on me though - the people were amazing, the experiences were fantastic, and there was no shortage of people who wanted to be my friend. It just wasn't my style and I exhausted myself trying to fit my square shaped mind into a star shaped hole. For the more extroverted among you, I *highly* recommend giving Meetup a shot.

# The current state of things:

Most of the connections I've made via apps are surface level - artificial in many ways. I figure the longer I maintain them, though, the more satisfying they will become. Of course, it's better to just let some of them die off than try to cling to something that just isn't working. I'm still lonely, waking up still sucks, but every once in a while there's a message from a stranger that takes it all away for a little bit.

So what about all of you? What are you trying? What have you tried? What worked and what didn't? And to any lonely souls lurking quietly in the background - Hello :) we'd love to hear from you!",lonely,Strategies to Combat the Quiet,2020-07-30 05:24:56

Hi - [https://imgur.com/a/QDctwkE](https://imgur.com/a/QDctwkE)

I know I'm not going to be everyone's fine cup of Yorkshire Tea on a wet and windy day, but I am going to try a more open and honest approach in the hope there is someone out there who can possibly relate to me. I will also do my best not to come off as some sort of miserable bastard, just someone who is a little lost and alone.

You see, I always feel like I am constantly drifting through life, or at least I have drifted long enough to feel I have no real connection to any particular place or person anymore. Today, in spite of my desire to just browse through Reddit and discuss serial killers, I still want to reach out again and feel some new human contact. I have ambitions, yes, but I am absolutely realistic in my expectations here and I am not enforcing on you the obligation to fill some of the voids in my life. I mean, I will buy you a nice pack of digestive biscuits and four cans of Stella if you do but there is absolutely no pressure on you to be the greatest friend I've never had.

I have become alone partly through choice, partly through situations out of my control and many embarrassing mistakes I have made on this little journey to oblivion. I am not a particularly shy or introverted person, I enjoy social contact with others but I am caught in this limbo between needing contact and trying hard not to become too enthusiastic and annoying. I like to talk a bit too much and like to share but equally, I'm mature enough to cope with being told to get a grip and shut the heck up for once.

Whilst the day continues to bring gloomy looking skies, I can still look back fondly on a time where I thought I was actually complete as a person and feel the warmth of that happiness. The life where you had someone who cared for you, a small but strong pool of friends who were there to pick you up and the mental strength to actually go out there and have fun. I have lost a lot of that through the years and I don't even know If I can cope with trying to find it again. Actually, that is kinda nonsense... who doesn't bloody want that in their life? I know I am a strong person and will always try going on but it gets exhausting as you get into your third decade of life.

Insert my usual pug picture to temporarily reduce the difficulty of reading this - [https://imgur.com/a/WUVf4h5](https://imgur.com/a/WUVf4h5)

It is perhaps important to recognise and discuss the flaws I have if only to show my appreciation towards honesty at the very least. Firstly, I can sometimes get a little carried away with my jokes and come off as being a bit of an arsehole. Whilst my intentions are purely innocent, I am starting to understand I need to get the feel of another person's personal space before I open my blabbering mouth. If I start getting to know people well and like them, I sometimes like to push towards connecting our lives closer together, whether that be sending the odd postcard or joining you for a pint of sorrows. But I understand we all different and I am starting to be aware there are people who need more time and space to start trusting a wandering little idiot like me.

You should also be aware of biological issues I face and I absolutely do not represent your image of a manly man, although maybe I sometimes get away with being a loveable little rouge. I am happy to discuss that further, it just involves dodgy chromosomes and the resulting bullying I had to endure because of it. I used to rely on the drink to get through a lot of it but I have woken up to the absolute idiocy of becoming something I hated.

Should I just stop being an absolute mope and just talk about the things I actually like?

I have already mentioned postcards somewhere and this is something I really enjoyed during my more innocent days. I do enough wandering, plus I live between two countries, to find some decent ones to send out to any corner of the world - I also have an excellent array of cow postcards on offer to anyone that wants one.

There is a PS4 somewhere and I have been considering dusting down the poor bugger and trying games again. I am nowhere near the gamer some people here are, yet I have a passion for games like Life Is Strange, Walking Dead, The Last Of US, Fallout and so on. I am trying to rediscover my old desire to read, Stephen King mainly, but I am currently reading a book about Hitler's political maneuvering into power... I like to mix it up a little :) - I cracked a smile there!

I also spend way too much time just thinking and I've previously enjoyed sharing my ideas with others and getting their opinions. I sometimes thrive on feedback on others and I really like praise, I like being good. We could do that in any form you might want, whether than be a postcard, text, voice chat, or the reliable typing we all seem capable of.

But what I really like above it all is the company of open and honest people. I'm not asking you to start sharing every damn detail about your own fuck ups, nor will I always want those deep conversations with you, but it's important you aware of who I am at least.

A few things are telling me I should start bringing this little introduction to a close. Partly because I am showing my ability to yap away but also because I've had two cups of tea writing this, my legs are crossed over and I am absolutely busting for a piss!

Whilst I understand it is not particularly important for me, I will let you know I am chap in his thirties and I currently live in Sweden as a little Brit in exile. I have tried my other approaches, this is the more honest one, so I do believe I may need to soon close the friendship-seeking chapter of my Reddit life... but not before hopefully taking a few of you down with me.

To all good day! I‚Äôm here to wish you a hell of a stay in this world of dismay. 

That was a sucky rhyme...

Anyways guys I just wanted to offer some encouragement to the lonely, heartbroken people who have suffered at the hands of others or even at their own doing. I feel the latter can be more debilitating as feelings of guilt can weigh a persons soul into a despair unlike any other. To those that have been abused I know it‚Äôs like someone ripped your heart out and spit on it because you wouldn‚Äôt care if you didn‚Äôt care about them right? 

A lot of people here just want life to end but maybe there‚Äôs someone out there we haven‚Äôt met? You know it‚Äôs true or you wouldn‚Äôt be here you would‚Äôve already given up. 

Have hope for the future because if you look at history there is always a downfall and an uprising again! This goes for counties and people. 

My word of advice is ‚Äúdo unto others as you would have them do unto you. I think a lot of us have forgotten that we live in the society we create. We live in the society WE create. people who have been abused please don‚Äôt let your anger affect the next generation so the cycle continues. And to the people who have abused please show your remorse in a way that is so humbling that you help yourself and the person you wronged.

I wish I could tell them how bad me day was, or why I was crying, or why I don't respond to their text for a few weeks because I didn't want to bother them. I hate when people worry about me because anything they say or do to help never works but I appreciate it. I occasionally harm my self but I'm ashamed of what they will think.

i really don‚Äôt know where i‚Äôm going with this but i just needed to get it off my chest because i really have nobody to talk to and lockdown really hasn‚Äôt helped since all my friends have decided to leave me out of any online interaction and now that they‚Äôre starting to meet up i‚Äôm again left out which once again i really don‚Äôt want to paint a picture that i‚Äôm the victim here because i don‚Äôt really get along great with them in the first place but still i suppose having some shitty friends would be better than not having any at all but i‚Äôm just worried for what‚Äôs going to happen in life because i‚Äôm pretty sure this is how it‚Äôs always going to be and i really can‚Äôt take it anymore i feel like i‚Äôm constantly miserable and just hate how i can‚Äôt even seem to meet one person i remotely like i mean seriously i would fucking kill for just one good friend in life because i cant stand the loneliness anymore because i tried to tell myself that i would just have to live life this way but i can‚Äôt stand it everything just feels so pointless 

sorry if this doesn‚Äôt really make too much sense or seems stupid but i really feel shitty atm and i just want to know how i‚Äôm meant to get happier and if these years in my life really mean anything because i just wish i somehow could get a new start",lonely,I‚Äôm worried for the future,2020-07-29 09:55:32

My older brother was sent to the east coast to live with our dad's aunts after the divorce cause he started hitting mom and my older sister and I've only seen him a less than 4 times that I can remember. I've mostly spent my time playing games on steam/watching youtube and twitch. When I was 10 or 11 I watched lots of huskystarcraft and totalbiscuit along with a ton of documentaries about random stuff. None of my friends at school have ever been interested in the stuff I like. 

In high school I got solid A's and B's but took zero period and left at 12 before lunch so most of my former friends thought I left school.

272,morningshifttomorrow,1595964999,1,"Its really hard to put my thoughts in words, hang with me. Yes, its a throwaway. I just need to clear my mind.

For a little backstory about me; Im a male turning 27y in next month. I haven't been in a ""real"" relationship ever. I have always been turned down by everyone I had feelings for. Slowly and year by year I have started to feel more and more lonely. Falling into nothingness. Feeling like nobody really loves me and that Im being just used. Im not ""alone"", I have friends and Im invited to stuff, but I still feel more and more lonely each growing moment.

I have been seeing this girl for a few months. We became really close, hanging out a lot and being intimate. The affection that she showed you could think that we were ""a thing"". We didn't really talk about what our relationship actually was or was it really anything.  She was a single mom with not so perfect breakup. She doesn't know my not so perfect relationship history, and because of that history its increasingly hard for me to open up about my actual feelings. 

So we've been hanging out a lot. She has always been saying that she won't use tinder ever. I was hanging out at her place for a few days. She showed me something on her phone and a tinder message pops up. She of course swipes it away immediately, I don't really know should I say something at this point, but I just ignore it.  Couple more days go by as I hang out at her place, I notice constant tinder messages at her phone. She still is being really flirty and showing affection for me. Million different things are running on my mind what is happening. Is she just teasing me with tinder? what is going on? But.. I gather my courage..

Due to my past, its really hard for me to open up face to face because of the fear of rejection. And our ""thing"" had me feeling really good also mentally. So I send her a message with a TLDR of wanting to be together. I haven't heard from her since. I was left on ""opened"". I waited for a couple hours, you know, maybe she needed time to think? But no, nothing. Again my feelings go ignored. I just broke down and cried. I just couldn't hold it in anymore. I feel like I was just used again as an easy emotional support and a bandage after a break up. I just feel like I'm meant to be alone and there really isn't no one for me. Maybe I just expected too much.. Again..

276,Ellie-mai-morg,1595964286,1,"How your feeling is completely natural you are not alone. Sometimes we search for things we want and along the way we lose stuff and forget about what and why we are doing it : which can put us in a lonely place. The main thing to remember is. In 5 years your going to be different to how you are now, and in 5 years after that your going to be different again. The fact is with each year and month our meaning and what we want from life slightly changes. It‚Äôs better to take each moment and realise that where your trying to get to and what you view as the destination of your purpose will never be the same. With each 5 years it‚Äôll be different because you will have met someone or you have a new job from an opportunity you took or you may even have a kid. Your purpose in life will always change based on where you are in your life. It‚Äôs the journey that‚Äôs the most precious thing, it‚Äôs when your old and you reflect on life you will realise what your purpose was all along. For example, in 5 years you may have a job that your progressing in and you may have a partner. So at that moment your purpose will be to be a good partner and to carry on doing well in work. 5 years later you may have a dog or a child with your partner and your purpose will grow - youll be a partner, dad and proud fur daddy. It grows with life and new experiences. Embrace who you are what you are now. Maybe for you it‚Äôll be a case of - the more you find out who you are and what you like the more you‚Äôll find things affect you less and being hurt over things and being unsure  won‚Äôt affect you as much.
So for those who feel lost and unsure of themselves just remember- it‚Äôs okay to be unsure about things. Consider each day a a new gift ; a chance to feel better and try and do better than yesterday. Sometimes it feels like the entire world is against you and that‚Äôs okay because one day it‚Äôll be ‚Äúyour day‚Äù and things will get better. When you hit rock bottom it‚Äôs best to think the only way is up. 
Your not alone you worth something, your not a disappointment and you will find the courage to carry on.

And given how hard it is to get girls, I'd think like 10% of guys would have a girlfriend/active sex life. And yet way more than that do. Actually around my age probably 95% do. 

It's so painful. Sex is everywhere. I'm not able to do much IRL because I have no friends either, so I need to use media. But sex is EVERYWHERE on media and it's constantly reminders of things I'll probably never get. It's so painful feeling so worthless and unwanted. 

And there's this stigma about guys who can't get laid. They must have a bad personality or be horribly ugly. It's absolutely not true. I'm probably a 6 or 7/10 and my personality is fine. The only major problem I have is that i have no friends so I'm not really ""fun"" cause I don't get invited to stuff. So that really limits the type of girl I can date down to introverts.

I'm married. He's a great guy. Save for mood swings now and then, and being raised to be an entitled brat, it gets to me sometimes. We've been together for over 5 years. Over these years I have made every effort to be accommodating, compromised, changed my behavior to protect myself (not letting his bad mood affect mine, not taking things said in jest personally), taking up extra household chores so that he doesn't have to put in additional effort and ruin his mood instead - the whole jazz. Like, this has been our everyday life.

We've also communicated a lot on how I feel about ^ and he's also making some effort to change. But, it is always changing his ways for 7-10 days and going back to the usual behavior.

I've been raised to consider myself a burden to one and all, to earn love and generally not consider myself in high regard in my own eyes and that if I'm bothered by something, I am the problem, I need to change myself (be more patient, tolerant, ignore, compromise, etc) I know this has deeply affected me as a person, it has affected several relationships and friendships, my spouse is also aware of this and supports me and I've been working on myself for a year or so now - not apologizing unnecessarily, standing up for myself without feeling guilty, demanding things without any guilt.

But, through all this, I feel a crushing loneliness. That I'm all by myself. That I'll never have anyone to lean on. That while I'm working on myself, nobody will be standing by me. This is despite being married, mostly happily, having a decent set of parents, a loving set of friends and siblings.

293,QuamPlures,1595952670,1,"This will sound very selfish but here I go....

Since my early teen years, talking to anyone was close to impossible, there was never anything to talk about, my inability to hold a conversation (even about topics I know) prevented me from making any connection, no friendship, no romantic interest, there was never anyone in my life outside of my family, and i can't even talk to them either.

It's not anxiety or awkwardness, I'm confident while doing some activity (work, exercise, whatever), the problem is that my mind is completely blank when it comes to talking or texting with somebody, I'm unable to start conversations, and even when someone else starts, I can only give a quick answer and it ends there.

This always made me feel worthless and lonely, because I'd always try to make friends, date, go out and whatever social stuff people normally do, but a failure rate of 100% just crushes anyone's morale.

Then quarantine hit and I just didn't talk or text anyone in months, and honestly this is the best mental state I've been in since I was 11 (I'm now 21). I finally don't feel any pressure, don't feel any rejection, it's just me, my hobbies and my dog, this whole mess is the best thing to ever happen in my life, and I'm not planning on coming back to try making friends or dating, fuck that, fuck people, everyone only made me feel lonely and worthless, I'm alone now but I'm finally not lonely.",lonely,Quarantine was the best thing to happen in my life.,2020-07-29 02:11:10

It was no different with my girlfriend as I'm more of a listener than a talker. I've never felt wanted in my life before these last 4 years. I was a loner who always felt insecure about every single thing in life. It was always me in my own world with no one around. Never being fully understood by anyone. So when a person came around, I put everything into that one person not knowing how bad it could become if that person were to leave. She left me countless number of times in the past 4 years and I always believed that we would somehow get back together and things would be okay. I was wrong. It's been 4 months now since I've talked to her properly and I've never felt worse in my life. I invested all my emotions into her and now I have nobody around to even talk to. 
I'm struggling to do day to day activities without being anxious about where my life is heading. Life wasn't supposed to be like this. Never thought it would go from spending every single day together to never talking to each other again. Even if she didn't want a relationship anymore, I still wanted her around as my friend because I'll always value her for being there for me when no one was. It went well for sometime before she decided this wasn't okay with her and told me that she's going to keep me on her socials as long as I never text her hereafter. I'm struggling to hold myself together to do anything. I still have friends and family but they're not people I can open up to. I feel suffocated with no one to talk to.

316,rawonionslice,1595931499,1,"I came here to ask a question but I see this isn't the right place for my question. And then I saw people that I feel for so here is my story.

I'm 28 dude and never been in a relationship. Sometimes I feel like I am just cursed. I learn everything around me that it's okay.

I've been a barista, worked at a chocolate store, a waiter, and been a community college student. I've interacted with plenty of people. I feel I've always been a late bloomer. I am sorry I can't seem to conjure up any examples at the moment.

Now I totally have no friends, was friends with this dude for 6 years but it became toxic and I had accepted the toxicity as normal until last year and cut ties with him. I feel NOW my brain is REALLY ACCEPTING that I am not friends with this person and THAT""S PERFECTLY ALRIGHT!!!!

It was much worst with this girl in my college. I was seriously shy and still shy to a lesser extent. I never confessed and made things weird via Facebook (I left that stupid website 3 years age, TYVM GOD).

I spent the next 5 year or so obsessing and missing her. Even though IT WAS FREAKING ONE SIDED. Jesus obsession is a sick lil bastard. But fortunately I would constantly tell myself to never have any online connection to her. I had looked her up a total of 4 times during that duration at most I believe.

I mean all I could ever think about was HER HER HER. It's like I couldn't really move on. Moving on means your doing like other CONSTRUCTIVE THINGS in your life. And me, I had nothing going on, just hanging out in my man cave of a room (Yoh, dats where im at right now). I still feel and believe if I had just done things to keep myself busy in life then I would have naturally been able to let her go.

But my mind would play tricks on me. I had these thoughts of I STILL HAVE A CHANCE with her. But again it was ONESIDED. Time had gone by and I slowly forgot about her and feel good again. Also there was another man with a story like mine but it took him more time to recover and his story helped me. I don't know if I could find that old story of his so I won't bother.

I lack common sense. It's like somethings don't click and I always wish that I had a book of common sense and a book about social norms in my brain cuz I FREAKING HAVE NO CLUE AND FEEL LOST. Everything I do know is from EXPERIENCE so sad. I fear people now and tend to run away. Even now I feel the need to delete this post and run away. But hmmm I think I can do this and hope it helps a buddy.

I actually don't need friends now, I mean I've just had rotten luck. Some people are mean and don't give a bleep and sometimes I'm the prick cuz I don't know. Now I am trying to learn how to be respectful and treat people as I'd like be treated. Honestly if it wasn't for my family, life would be sooo much colder and cruel. They keep me sane and healthy. I just wouldn't where I would get my daily human interactions from.

Friends should be respect your wishes. I mean its really a balancing act. But ultimately if you legit don't want to do something it should be like RESPECTED. No peer pressure and no need to take any BS. And you should feel strong, respected, and happy with your mates. That's what its all about, no toxic sandwich plzzz.

Slowly trying to quit my addictions with my phone and games. Just wanna take a vacation from all this stuff. Read more books or shits. Exercise. lol this is the rambling paragraph of my current GRIPES.

I don't trust people and fear being taken advantage of just cuz were m8. I hope I will get stronger kanye west lol jk. 

As for women (THE WHOLE POINT AND I BEEN RAMBLING) well I want that. WARNING I TALK WEIRD SO BEWARE: I feel like men soooo many sexy women I want a piece of that then I think .... I am uneducated and don't stand a chance. Fine I got a low self esteem. Ok.

I felt as a teenager I want you know innocent love, kiss and stuff (So pure at the time). then in college it was like the sex obsession. Now I just struggling telling myself fudge all those carnal thoughts and focus on just the love and holding the hands stuff. GAWD DANG hormones, they really take control of the mind you know.  porn helps, black dog makes good doujin imo.

But yeah, it sucks for me personally to lust over and yearning over a fine lady. but you know tough titties to me. I feel I need to be a place with my mental and physical health. I need to be stronger and more confidient.

I always look at guys whole look like 'what' with personalities that are like 'what' and end up with ladies that are like 'HEY' and say what in the world why not ME!!!!???? But it's perfectly alright MY TIME WILL COME. Honestly I repeat that sentence to myself like everyday to keep my sanity. Weird as it is it does help. WELL GOOD LUCK LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. LETS LIVE AND BE BETTER. GANBAROOOOOOOO. (Oh I thought there was a text limit meh, pz out. LOVE YOU XOXO!!!!)

My nephew birthday is coming. I am in a very tight spot financially. I can't buy anything particular.

I found on amazon some Marvel Lego toys on discount and went to buy one. Thanks to a colleagues I took some textile with toys and Spiderman logo and made some cloth masks for him and his friends. I wrapped everything and ringed my younger sister telling her that I have bought this and that hopefully not everybody got the same stuff.

Got shamed by sis and her husband telling me that the family got $1000 check each to deposit in his college found, and various gifts that sounds expensive. Like the new apple tablet for a 4 years old.

It's never enough in my family. Now that I am one step closer to a mental breakdown due to huge insomnia, lost my job, found one as waitress where Karens and Kens are shouting orders all day, living with my parents and dealing with much more successful, rich and well connected siblings.

I was really looking forward to see my little nephew. I guess they will kindly ask to leave the gift somewhere and leave their fancy party early to not get shamed in front of the rest of the family.

Most of my friends in my life I met before high school and have remained close with since, when I was 14 years old I ran away from home and had trouble making new friends ever since. I think a lotta it has to do with me never really opening up to people so I never really trust any one so I never have a problem pushing people away or making an Irish goodbye cause they‚Äôre not my ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends anyways. 
Just a little background but my loneliness has been killing me today. I got another award at work, they gave me a bunch lately and have advanced me from e1 to e5 in the less than two years I‚Äôve been in. Every time I get something it just reminds me I have no one to share my accomplishments with, no one to take care of etc. I call my parents and tell them and they‚Äôre proud but they‚Äôre 3000 miles away. Plus I just feel like a looser calling my parents to tell them I got an attaboy at work at age 26. 
I made a few good friends since being in the military tho. Mostly guys and one or two female friends. One of my guy friends I would hang out with occasionally and he worked for me on my shift said something to me the other day that I really didn‚Äôt like. He made a joke to female I work with that I‚Äôm friends with about me raping her. I immediately yelled at him but I couldn‚Äôt let it go. I talked to the girl and she told me way to many times it was fine and she knew it was a joke and I wasn‚Äôt that kinda person. The next day I took the guy behind the shop and ripped him like 4 new assholes. He made a lewd joke I didn‚Äôt appreciate and maybe I over reacted but now I just want to shut down and finish my contract and just regret trying to put myself back out into the world. Put my on night shift in an asphalt factory so I can help the world without having to be part of it. 
But like hey atleast they can give me an award to hang on the wall why I hangout alone and cry",lonely,Trying to not feel bad for myself due to my own actions. It‚Äôs not the military it‚Äôs me.,2020-07-28 11:48:42
358,classicmusclecar,1595899461,1,"Hear me out. Unless you and all her friends and your homies are all in a large friend group (which I've never had and probably never will because fuck people), then it is NOT worth it, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP. I've been best friends with two different girls throughout different time periods and struggles of my life that were both in a relationship while I was friends with them. Now I'll tell you why it's not worth it. 

Number one: CATCHING FEELINGS, I caught feelings for my first one and it was constant emotional torture to not even feel safe to tell them you got feelings for them. 

Number two: NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO AND WHAT THEY SAY, you will NEVER be their number one even if they are your number one (simp ik lmao haha). They'll always have their girl best friend and their boyfriend which they value higher than you. And that's not really their fault because it would be the same if the roles were reversed. And this will constantly haunt you when you're lonely and she's one of your only friends. She could even love you, but it will never feel enough because at the end of the day you prioritize them higher than they prioritize you. 

Number three: You'll be too attached and when you try to leave her and end the friendship for your own good, you'll notice that you can't do it because it's way too harsh emotionally, feels worse than a breakup for me at least. 

Today is the day I finally made up my mind that it's time to say goodbye to my second girl best friend (mistake) and just be normal friends with her instead of close friends. Her birthday is coming up and she told me that she wants to hang out with her girl bff in the morning and then watch the sunset with her bf at night :) (aka what I said at number two). I'm happy for her, and ik she loves me as well. But it's not worth it when you could possibly find a guy best friend that you won't have those problems with and it won't be an emotional roller coaster. I'm going back to being lonely once again, and it sucks but hopefully, I'll help me be in a better place sometime in the future.",lonely,Having a girl best friend as a guy is the biggest mistake I made twice.,2020-07-28 11:24:21

It‚Äôs hard to even keep a conversation that way and I end up forgetting that I even sent a message in the first place. I always hated people like that. Why even add me in the first place? Was it to be nice? Did they want their followers count to increase? I get that people can be busy but I know that the people I added would instant respond back had it been someone else. It is almost like I have to offer something in order to get a message. I was always the homework guy and nobody would text me unless I was willing to give up some notes and answers. 

It just blows how much I have to go out of my way to talk to someone and it usually ends up with me sending schoolwork or no response.

Is it weird that I don‚Äôt expect people to text me despite them following me? Is it weird that I always have my notes ready just in case someone wanted to text me for them? 

It‚Äôs all stupid. Nobody ever wants to text just to talk. They never want to catch up or start learn about each other.

Im a really shy and socially akward person (being trans doesnt help my social anxiety) however im really friendly and open and silly once i get to know you and im a good listener and will try and give the best advice i can give. Im very self reflective but also a avid selfhater/doubter sadly so if thats not for you be warned i do genuinly care for people i start to get to know or have known since a while i probally care too MUCH wich has bitten me in the ass more then once.

Just looking to talk with someone i been feeling pretty down and lonely recently and i would just like to have some more human interaction I gues?...

Not looking for people that just stop talking after a while or lie to me or act fake just genuine friendship or whatever my luck with friends havent been great online so i can be a bit skeptical sadly online is all i have though.

Im a pc gamer (steam) so if you got steam let me know i would like to add some new friends for steam too besides talking about other stuff ofcourse... i also got discord ( im insecure about my voice though) 

I mostly play Action games/Horror games/ Rpgs/Shooters/Story games/Grindy games/Platformers.

One of my two only friends, both people who I'm extremely close to, the one I'm speaking about I've know  since I was 12. He recently, at 19, thought it was a good idea to get drunk, make out with a 15 year old, and then tell her to call him when shes 16 and therefore legal.

I don't get it. What happened to that nice kid I used to play video games with. What happened to turn him from a decent person to a self-loathing, obsessive creep? As selfish as this is probably going to sound.. why did he do this to me? I can't tell if I feel more disgusted or betrayed. Hopefully this last friend doesn't end up doing something reprehensible as that.

That last friend is an ex. While it's been a few years, and we've both had stuff go on since. it's been two years since I've had a relationship which was toxic and short lived to say the least. I'm over her, but feelings on both sides still linger. It was nice to have someone I could actually talk about that with, without feeling worried about possibly making things awkward, or  uncomfortable.

This year I turned 21. It was supposed to be a turning point. There's absolutely nothing to do around here but drink. While I don't like large crowds, bars, or drinking I figured it was at least a way out of this fucking pit. Of course rona had to happen, and my parents are high risk.

I haven‚Äôt had a decent sleep for weeks, and that makes me feel worse. When I‚Äôm awake, all I can think about is every insecurity and phobia I have, from worrying about a scary video I saw back in February that I couldn‚Äôt handle and just can‚Äôt forget about, to worrying about that all my friends don‚Äôt care about me, or worse, hate me. I‚Äôm getting gray hairs because of all this worrying. It didn't help that a few weeks ago I messed with a group I shouldn‚Äôt have, and I ended up getting harassed so much and so badly that i had to change all my social medias. I know I should just forget about it, but I still worry about them finding me again, and I always think about how it was all my fault and I should have handled it better. Since then, I started caring what other people think more than ever. I just unsubscribed from  r/fivenightsatfreddys because im worried that people will hate me for liking it and think im cringy. I threw away all my old art and sketchbooks because there were anthropomorphic animals in them and im worried people will think im a furry and bully me. I abandoned my plans on trying my hand at making costumes because im worried that theyll turn out not good enough and people will make fun of me if i wear them. I even stopped drawing and abandoned my dreams of learning to animate and setting up a youtube channel because im worried that im just not good enough and itll end up on a cringe page and ill get hate or something. I worry about going back to school because im socially awkward and never say the right thing and can come off as annoying and even mean, so im worried that people wont be happy to see me. i even worry about posting this here because compared to all of the problems you guys have, mine is just so stupid and selfish. People tell me to tell my parents about this, but i know they wont understand, and i dont want them to worry. I dont want to get help because theyll probably just say the same things everyone else is saying. im trapped in a cage of endless worrying and i dont know what to do.",lonely,All I ever do is worry and I‚Äôm getting so stressed but I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt tell anyone,2020-07-28 05:57:39

Throughout college, I was constantly rejected by people both platonically and romantically. Likewise, I basically prioritized my academic career and I socialized through clubs and organizations with people who shared common interests with me. I also tried learning new languages to make some productivity out of my free time. Despite my academic achievements (such as gaining a master's and getting accepted into a doctoral program) and increased linguistic abilities, my stock as a valuable human being and romantic partner has not increased in the slightest. In fact, I have realized my value and self-worth is rapidly declining. I recently tried online dating and that completely destroyed any ounce of my self-esteem that was left. The only people who are remotely interested in associating with me are distant acquaintances who lost interest in me after graduating. No wonder I was getting all these good grades. I really didn't had the option of leaving my apartment and partying. No wonder I was joining all of these organizations. This was the only chance I had at interacting with people who weren't my shitty professors who saw me as nothing more than cheep labor.

I won't bore you all with how it happened, but my life went to shit pre covid. For the past decade I have build my identity around my family, not my career or friends. When that collapsed around me, not only did I lose the family that I built, I also lost my identity. 

For the past year I have truly been alone. Some days I feel like I may as well be on the moon. Sure, things could always be worse. I am lucky to have a stable income, roof over my head, and food in the pantry, but what is that without happiness or companionship. 

Yes I have heard it before, don't find happiness in others find it in yourself. Yes I have been working on that for over a year. And have been making good progress in that. This pandemic sure is making it harder. I have been out on dates, but found it hard to make a real connection when so much of who I am is lost and fractured. 

Honestly I just want someone to talk to. I don't even have a normal buddy I can turn to, I had invested so much of myself into my family I never even focused on friends. I'm not even writing asking where to begin, as I already have. I suppose this is more of a vent than anything.

But then I stopped because I felt like the circlejerk of sadness was just really toxic and while it's good to express that stuff, after a while of being in that environment, it just brings you down even more. And that's no offense to this sub or depression in general, but while misery likes company, it usually doesn't mean anything.

Anyways, I was strongly against getting prescribed SSRIs after seeing the negative side effects they had on people around me. I looked into nootropics and after hundreds of hours of digging, I came across this supplement called ""Agmatine Sulfate"", and started taking a dose of 1g in the morning, and 1g after work. I expected nothing from it, but ever since I started, I noticed something bizzare: I had no more depression. Like at all. I still knew when things were wrong, but the repetitive thoughts vanished, and I was able to just live my life without constantly feeling like it'd be better to die. I became okay with being alone. After a while I even stopped bugging the few people I did know on a daily basis.

I later did more research on it, and I can show you my post where I compile all the studies on it, but agmatine is a neurotransmitter that people with depression or related mood disorders actually lack in their brain. It also is an atypical NMDA antagonist like ketamine, minus the dissociation and recreational potential. I'd say it's a little emotionally numbing, so it isn't exactly... normal... but it's an improvement from how I was before.

You can actually get it on amazon, but it's banned in europe (not because it's bad, but I believe their pharmacies don't like the competition. It's currently shown to be safe and without side effects in all clinical trials).

I wish my parents were together, and that we could have fun family trips. Or I could come by one weekend to just visit my parents and go to my old bedroom (which doesn't exist anymore).

479,memories_torn_apart,1595811419,1,"I have no social life. I‚Äôve never had any, and quite frankly the prospects of me getting one any time soon are nil. Never had friends, let alone anything deeper. For a few years now, I‚Äôve tried some more practical methods of fixing this, but they‚Äôve all fizzled out horribly due to my own social ineptitude. 

No, my tried and true recourse is daydreaming, for a long while. My day dreams can be more fantastical and imaginative, but mostly I just imagine I have people to talk to. People like me who like me. I‚Äôve created characters with detailed personalities and I‚Äôve shared false memories and experiences with. Sometimes I involve real people, but mostly just as set dressing if anything. Generally I‚Äôve only ever done character at a time, and the one I‚Äôm stuck on now I‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen with‚Äù since like the beginning of the year, and with all the time at home I have really been able to zero in on her. She feels so real. I‚Äôve imagined an entire life together. She‚Äôs quite possibly the most intricate project I‚Äôve ever worked on. She‚Äôs in every other thought. And whenever I imagine that other reality where she exists and is a force in my life, I‚Äôm briefly happy and content. I can discuss my worries and issues and be soothed. Make stupid jokes to myself and have someone, even if technically my own mind, laugh. I grow old and achieve my wildest fantasies, and she‚Äôs there along the way. And in my mind I‚Äôm not selfish, for I do the same for her. And the thing is, it‚Äôs not even like I‚Äôm wildly socially successful in these daydreams, no not at all. If anything I‚Äôm still a rather lonely person, but at least I‚Äôm lonely with someone else. And as you can imagine, this obviously morphs easily into romantic fantasy. The extended life daydreams can get stupid intricate. But there‚Äôs no need to get detailed, for you see...

Then I remember it‚Äôs all so very fake. And I feel pathetic. Instead of trying to do something about my state of affairs, I retreat inside my own mind and create a very pathetic fantasy. And I attack myself from all angles. About how it‚Äôll never happen, about how it will stunt me permanently, about how just weird it is. How wrong it is. I know fantasy has damaged my social skills, as bad as they were already, or at least I think. And the despair of remembering that it‚Äôs fake hurts. And the weirdness stings, and I‚Äôm constantly self-conscious about this. But at the same time, I think I‚Äôve just stopped caring about the downsides. Mostly I think, because how isolated I am. Who‚Äôs going to be affected really? I have no social life. My family don‚Äôt have a clue. My own little world won‚Äôt do anyone but me harm.

But at the same time, I‚Äôm getting slightly worried at the lengths I‚Äôm taking things now. I‚Äôve unironically started looking into r/tulpas to see if I can turn my daydream character into one, but i ultimately decide against it because I‚Äôm too self-conscious, but not because of other people, but rather how my own tulpa would view me. I have control in daydreams. But the amount of time I spent considering it all worries me, on top of all the time I spend daydreaming.

You see mostly I do ‚Äúpassive daydreaming‚Äù where I day dream as I‚Äôm doing other things and going about my very limited day. And I do this practically all the time. Sometimes I do dedicate serious time to this, but mostly I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm a ‚Äúfunctional daydreamer‚Äù, I can at least get by and not be massively interrupted. But at the same time, I‚Äôm literally always doing it, finessing the reality I so desperately want. It‚Äôs just second nature now, and this is where I feel I‚Äôm getting lost in my own head. If I feel reality getting too boring or unpleasant, time to just slip away. And it‚Äôs not always to my reality with my literal dream girl, it can be one of many alternate lives that range from the highly fantastical to more plain stuff, more ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù dreams of the future. Sometimes I think I know more things about my other little worlds than I do about where I actually exist. And this frightens me slightly. I think I give myself false memories like this. 

But I don‚Äôt think I could exist without the daydreaming. It holds me together‚Äîa little bit of hope, a little bit of (imagined) social interaction, a little bit of fun, etc. Whenever I read a book, watch a film, or listen to music, there‚Äôs a place in my head where I can talk about it with someone. Whenever I feel down and upset, there‚Äôs a place to get guidance and cool off. Whenever I feel happy, there‚Äôs someone to share the joy with‚Äîyou get the point. If I had to confront my reality as it is, I‚Äôd crumble. Especially in this whole pandemic situation on top of summer, which means I don‚Äôt even have any actual solutions available.

And that is pretty much it. Was there a point to any of this? Not really. Quite frankly, I just need this off my chest. Might delete eventually, who knows. Thanks if you actually read it, and sorry too. Have a nice one.

482,GeneralWalters421,1595808408,1,"Maybe this title is a bit of a exaggeration. Basically my parents split up a while ago meaning my Mum lives in New Zealand whilst my Dad lives in Canada. I'm a  and I live and study at university with my dad in Canada. Even back there I was feeling very lonely and isolated pretty much ever since I was forced to move across the world after the divorce. I have aspergers and am generally introverted so making any friends is very difficult. These feelings got so bad that I eventually fell into deep depression. It didn't help that I also got rejected by a girl whom I had pretty strong feeling for around this time. Because of this my Mum invited me to New Zealand so I could spend the holidays there with her. She runs a campsite by the beach with lots of people at it so she thought it would be better than being stuck home with nothing to do while I was already feeling lonely.

So I agreed, but during this time the coronavirus started to shut things down including my university. I left early, worrying I couldn't leave at all if I waited any longer and since university was now online that was doable. Traveling during the virus was hard and I had to lock down for 2 weeks but after that I arrived at the camp and things where alright. I got to walk my Mums dogs on the beach daily and I eventually started working part-time. Despite this, I really despise the guy who manages the place who is also my Mum's boyfriend. He had a role in the divorce so things were already awkward but he was generally just a very emotionally manipulative and abusive person. He'd force me to do jobs I wasn't comfortable doing while I felt I had little choice and then get really mad when I couldn't do them properly. I just generally felt uncomfortable, I wasn't in need of money at the time, and I was still feeling sad and anxious about things so I was not really looking to work that much, yet I was kinda quilted into doing so, slowly getting more involved then I initially agreed. I was just feeling really uncomfortable working there, but eventually my Mum's BF crossed the line when he really viciously insulted me over something really dumb. I was nearly crying at the time, as he dug deep into my character so Mum took me away from the camp to her house where I am currently staying.

I have been here for a couple weeks now, and because my Mum has had to work I'm mostly alone. I wasn't comfortable at the campsite but with my Mum, Brother and other people at the camp I at least had people to talk with. Despite this I was mostly fine staying here. I have games to play and schoolwork to do so I was mostly busy and the dogs are here with me so I have company and a excuse to go out for a walk every day. But then the news arrived that my flights out were cancelled for another 2 months, and probably more. I could leave, but I'd have to go through the US which seems to be in a mess quite now so my parents are reluctant, and even that might change. 

My Mum felt bad for me being insulted but now she has seemed to have relapsed back to her BFs side. Because I'm staying here longer, she wants me back at the camp given I can't stay here forever. Yet I feel uncomfortable with that, I tried to tell her I didn't want to work but she started guiltiling me, and now I don't know what to believe. I already feel confused about my future but have some general ideas about career options. Yet my Mum and even my Dad have been pretty much calling me lazy, but I'm not sure what to do about that... I have been doing schoolwork, procrastinating slightly due to feeling unmotivated and anxious, but still confident that I'll be able to finish on time. In terms of part time jobs I can really only work at the camp given my situation but I don't feel comfortable with that. 

Now I might even have to do my next university class online, which greatly depresses me, given that I have been struggling to even do a few classes online, let alone a full course loads. My favorite part about uni was going out to lectures and learning, not being forced to lay in bed and write essays. Frankly I don't even know if I want continue with my current career paths, but I feel like I have little other choices other than sticking to university and studying what I know is a useless degree. I have a great passion and understanding of history, philosophy and politics, but not any practical skills which I tend to despise doing. I had ideas about maybe even joining the military as an intelligence officer as it seems interesting and actually achievable, but I'd still need to finish a degree while I'm stuck here for who knows how long. 

Because of all of this I feel lonely, anxious and depressed once again. I'm talking to a counselor online but she seems to be rather useless most of the time, repeating useless platitudes over any over again. Because of my general loneliness I have been looking online, doing some debating on discord as it was a hobby in high school, and trying online dating (changing my location back to Canada), but I have found little success with the latter. After about 5 months of trying I only went on 2 video call ""dates"", one of which I didn't continue from a personal lack of interest and the second never continued after she suddenly told me she found someone else. I have well done photos, I think I'm decently attractive and I have a lot of hobbies and interests which I have listed. I mean I have been reasonably picky, but only about not actively pursuing people whom I know I have nothing in common with, not about looks or anything like that. 

So I don't know what's wrong, and I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and incredibly alone. Everyone seems to be against me. If anyone has gotten this far into this long rant, thank you, and I hope you can give some advice.",lonely,I'm stuck across the world from my home and I am pretty confused about what to do...,2020-07-27 10:06:48
483,Chnky_Grvy,1595807082,1,"I have been going out at night for quite a while usually walking or cycling. I have have always found sleeping to be a struggle. I can sleep, however I cannot switch off before sleeping most of the time and on quite a few instances been able to somehow keep myself awake just from have an anxiety attack just at the moment I am about to sleep  almost constantly during the night. I found walking got me tired enough to collapse in bed, sometimes working for 2-4 hours until the sun came up. got so bad that I was sleeping during the day most days, even skipping 48 hours sometimes even after a long shift at work when I have to drive for an hour after midnight working. Now that I am unemployed and am currently fucking myself by breaking expensive stuff recently that I am very much on a bit more on edge about since I have no routine. I feel my life only has meaning through activity and talking to friends so when I am bored or just can't think of something interesting to say I get an intense feeling of pure disgust at myself and stare blankly at something while I consider suicide for a fraction of a second.

I used to think that walking was like pacing in a waiting room and I was just waiting for my life to be fixed. When I used to think that I used to walk miles away from my house a cry somewhere uncontrollably on too many times that even I feel stupid thinking about it.

A few months back, at night sometimes I would just be staring blankly at night, thinking about killing myself and telling myself I was a pussy for not doing anything and just sitting there for hours, but I don't know if I will think this again. I don't like this constant creeping feeling I have that I am useless and unworthy of life or anything it has to offer, but it is situational and I hate it like someone is on my shoulder judging me all the time.  


My current state feels numb, I want to feel love but I am a weak node in a relationship. I have connected with people but I have never found someone who gets me. I get asked who my type is and I fucking don't know, I only lost my virginity to see if that would change me somehow but it was as realistic I imagined it would be for drunk sex. I didn't even want to feel it, I just did it without enjoying it? Sex seems to be like this stupid little dance we all have to do. I cannot be bothered approaching random women for sex in an appropriate setting, paying for it or going on dating apps. I just think it is meaningless to me.

Sometimes a thought pops into my head about mortality and how I am going to die some day and when I look back at history and all the different cultures we are somehow capable of building I wonder how long I have to walk until I truly find myself, all culturally unique peoples have had to agree on how the all live together at somepoint, their language, clothes, everything. Do we all have to have some group identity so it is easier for us to find the niche that we fill. I don't have an idol, nor a group.  


I have never been officially diagnosed with anything and you'd think I'm normal I guess. I just hate strangers when they are disrespectful even down to just simple curtsy, I have been 'avoiding' the general public for years and I can never relax around them while on busy streets. I like to walk to just make a change from being inside and I have found that randomly looking at things helps distract me from my anxieties but sometimes I start darting to look at too many things at once which I think is brought on by anxiety and if people are near me I start freaking out that they have noticed me being weird or something and I try and walk away because my anxiety likes to peak right when someone is walking too near me and they are walking the same direction as me...or they are staring at me.  


I don't know my own ego. I notice it, but I can't explain it to myself. I feel emotions but I don't cry about most shit that should be upsetting sometimes, I can cry on demand; not instantly and sometimes I think that emotions are just super weird, because to some degree we are just telling ourselves this is the appropriate response to have for the situation. I often laugh at myself for being an idiot now, but I used to get super meta with my internal conversations until I was basically talking to someone who wasn't there as if I were some sort of guest on a talk show I were explaining this to you the reader, but I was doing this in my head, so there was no audience...I would talk about my problem and try an anticipate the audiences reaction to gauge if I did the right thing or whatever it was I was worried about at the time.  
   
TL;DR

I find it hard to connect with people because of some pretty embedded trust issues. When I do, they realise that I am somewhat depressed and I don't want to have to explain myself to people I'm trying to get to know because then it burdens people with my problems so I just don't speak to them because I feel that I am broken. When I do speak to friends I am still the same. I feel like my persona has developed down the wrong path quite a while ago and I just feel like a ship with broken sails and I'm in a storm.

I've never been good at making friends on my own in real life mostly because I'm quiet and always look mad (but that's just my face). In school I was always the kid who sat alone and never willingly took part in socializing because I just felt so weird and awkward. I haven't always been lonely at home because I had an older brother that I always hung out with and bonded with.

Im 27, work 9-5, am studying my second university degree and spend all my free time with my dogs, geckos and fish, our house is like a zoo. I never kept in touch with any high school or university friends. I hate nights out which seems to be the only way to socialise nowadays and that's all my work colleagues do. I prefer playing games or doing crafts which isnt a very social activity. My boyfriend plays games a lot too but they're multiplayer and he plays in party with his friends and is constantly in a group chat with them. My multiplayer game consists of playing elder scrolls with my mum, dad and sister (which i love to be fair). How do you go about making friends, i just dont really understand it? Anyone out there who likes playstation games and animals and wants to be my best bud?

I was SO happy and it felt good to have these butterflies again. It took him a week to text me and when he did he almost made it seem like I was one of his biggest fans or something. Like when he texted me, he said, ‚Äúhi this is Erik... ‚Äú and I replied to him saying, ‚Äúhi Erik‚Äù with a smiley face emoji and he replied back saying ‚Äúwell it looks like you‚Äôre happy to see me.‚Äù And throughout our whole conversation, he would take hours to text me back and would mention things like I text a lot which I do because I didn‚Äôt want to seem boring with one sentence answers.

Here are a few of mine:

* My grandmother had a table with 3-4 stools in her kitchen that was where visitors would sit over tea or coffee and something sweet. It is where I have many of the warmest memories.
   * When my grandmother's brother would stop by, sometimes because he was going to pick something up, or just because he was in the area.  I could just listen, sometimes asking questions, but really just listened to the conversation, hearing a special bond they had (they had 5 other siblings)
   * My Dad stopping by would be the nicest treat.  I wouldn't often get to see him, and often wouldn't know what to talk to him about, but when he was sitting there talking with my grandmother and I could just listen. I could learn about him and her without having to ask anything or respond.  I could just be there.
   * I would stop by too after work in the last few years of her life.  She always seemed happy when I visited.  I didn't do it as often as I would have liked, especially since she seemed lonely those last few years.  There was something wonderful about the way she was so easy to talk to, and usually we would talk for an hour, sometimes an hour and a half.  (I'd often stay long enough to take her up on an initial offer for food that I was only hungry for after an hour had passed.).

My sister: Married and two kids at 21
My dad: Married and a kid at 19
It feels like everyone from my high school is engaged, pregnant, or already married.

I'm going to be 20 this September and I haven't even had a semi serious relationship. I had one in middle school and one in high school but neither lasted very long. I've been... we'll say invested/interested, in this girl for awhile now, but she recently became unavailable. With Covid-19 how am I supposed to meet someone, I dont leave my house, not even for work. All of my classes are going to be online this fall, so meeting someone there is a no go. 

Idk where this is going, my heart is honestly broken. It feels like someone put it through a paper shredder. I've been dumped, but it's nothing compared to the feeling of someone you're in love with choosing someone else over you. I just feel like I wasnt good enough. 

 I used to talk to her every day, about everything. We'd text all the time, play games online, I knew I couldn't have her, but at the same time it felt like I already did. Now we barely talk, she texts me occasionally, but normally it's to help her with homework. We dont play any online games anymore, or  just straight up talk or just joke about random little things. It's only when she needs help with homework. Every word I speak to her is agony. Every response is even worse.

Now, I know she wasnt my only chance at love, especially since she didnt feel the same way back. I know there are people out there and that I'm probably going to meet someone else. I just feel lost, it's impossible to meet anyone right now. I'm terrible at talking to girls, even if its just talking to them as friends or for school. With her it was different, I could talk to her so easily, my anxiety didnt spike when I hear her voice. It was so easy with her, easier than it's been with anyone else. She just made me  feel comfort. She brought me up when I was down, and brought my anxiety down when it was up. She understood.


Getting ahead of myself here, this isnt about her.

I know I'm not alone, I have my family and my really close friends. That's more than some people, and I need to be grateful of that. I just feel so ungodly lonely now. Like I'm just missing somthing that should be there, but it cant. I feel like I'm so behind everyone else in terms of love, I'm going to be 20 soon and I'm a virgin, I haven't had a girlfriend in years, I'm not super attractive, I'm kinda funny, but it's mostly self deprecating humor, I have some other good personality traits, and I like to think I'm a nice person all arround.

Someone who was lucky enough to be where the universe doesn't want me to be. The right time and the right place. I don't wish I was him. I just wish I was where he was when he talked to her instead of being where I unfortunately have to be. Maybe me and her could've developed something. That would've been nice.  Just another reason why i hate this job. I want out but the universe won't let me do that either.

&amp;#x200B;

This is usually the case for me. I can never be around a girl i'm attracted to at a place other than where it is unacceptable to even try approaching her as someone who wants to be in a romantic relationship with her.

546,Throwaway125737,1595765807,1,"Everything in my life has led me to believe that optimism is only possible if you are lucky. If you are not lucky enough to be born rich, or confident, or into a nurturing family, or attractive, or healthy, mentally or otherwise, chances are, you are going to have a shitty life. Life is a lottery, and many of us draw bad numbers. Optimism, in a situation such as this, is illogical, and downright detrimental, because you will never meet those idealised goals and dreams, and when that inevitably does happen, you are left with a feeling of failure and inadequacy. I see a lot of optimists that fail to understand pessimism, but it is a defence mechanism. When you have been rejected, ridiculed and excluded all your life, when you have lived a life of failure, watching your peers surpass you in almost every way, when you see those around you succeed at things with very little effort that to you are incomprehensible enigmas, optimism can be soul destroying, and can easily lead to suicidal thoughts and actions. You can of course, try to turn things around. You can improve your life, you can try to reach equal footing, but you will fail in the process, often, and the fact remains that you have had to put an intense amount of effort into something that should come naturally. When you have experienced very little happiness in your life, and it is very likely that that trend will not change, pessimism protects you. It protects you from hoping for a life you will never have, and the soul crushing realisation that it will never be yours. It protects you from the disappointment that accompanies failure, in a world where failure is the rule, and success is the exception. The best you can do is try to improve yourself for your own reasons, regardless of your peers, because you will never stand shoulder to shoulder with them, and they, in their ignorance, will never understand why. don't be motivated by other peoples opinions, because humans are, on the whole, self centred creatures (self centred, not selfish) that rarely extend more than a fleeting thought for the wellbeing of those around them. All you can do is try to find and make a life that provides you with a feeling of contentment. This is all many of us can hope for, a mediocre life that we don't hate every second of, one that, while it might not provide you happiness, you can at least accept for another 50-20 years. You may die lonely, with no meaningful relationships. You may die poor, and indebted. You may die in pain and delirium, with none but an overworked nurse to tend you. All this may happen after living a life of much the same. This could be your future. Accept it and try to make what you can of this life that has been inflicted on each of us, snatch each moment of goodness and hold onto it for dear life, but know when it is time for it to end, as all things do. Take every opportunity you see, because when you live a life of depression and apprehension, you really have nothing to lose. Take risks, fuck it, it might lead to something good, and a chance at a good life is worth more than a slightly less shitty life. Try new things; we are pitifully small creatures and our individual understanding of this vast universe is pathetic. There is always the possibility of a radical shift in your thinking, any change is probably a good one. Death will come soon enough, in a cosmic heartbeat, and then you will find a peace in oblivion that you only knew in life as sleep, so do what the fuck you want, and only care about people, and not their petty vindictive opinions of you, imagined or otherwise.",lonely,"Extreme bitterness and self pity ahead, you have been warned.",2020-07-26 22:16:47

549,Rodihupfpferd,1595763125,1,"Hello Reddit,
 y.o. and from Germany. I once was one from the popular people, they all liked me and I had a 4 very very close friends. We all got invited to many partys and did dumb stuff, that teenagers do. But one day it got a bit too extreme for me. We broke into our school and stole a key. Nobody from the school realised a key was missing. From that point on we had access to every room and the school itself. We lost the key, but no problem. We broke in again and stole another key. And again nobody else realised. We stored the key at the house from one of us, who lives next to the school. But my friends started abusing that key and kept stealing little things, which were very obvious from the school and doing shit I didn't appreciate. After a short time they went nearly every weekend to the school and messed around in a way, that y they would be discovered soon. I didn't want that and started arguing with them how dumb it is to do that and that we should bring the key back or throw the key away, because we saw everything, also the secret places and there isn't anything to discover left. They said, that it is dumb to get rid of the key, because we could use it to get information for upcoming term papers or the graduation, but these aren't stored in the school and I just thought that's too risky. I just grabbed the key and ran away, while I was chaised by my friends I made it 500m to the next sea and threw the Keys into that sea. After all I don't know if that was a mistake, but since that point I wasn't a close friend anymore. I even can understand them but I don't get invited to partys or just normal hangouts anymore. I don't have much social contact and I feel bad. I really like social contact and I really like messing around a bit, but I don't know how I should meet new people or friends. Also my self-confidence suffered very hard and before that point it wasn't a problem for me to speak Infront of 50-60 people, but now I have problems with my breathing when I speak and struggle with myself.

Having an amazing and very affectionate lover? I feel lonely even in our love. I just feel so alone. I can't talk to anybody. I don't know who to talk to. I don't know that I can go to anyone when I really just need company and someone to hear me out. It hasn't gotten better at all, it continues to get so much worse. Why do I feel so alone? 

I guess it doesn't help that I've always lost people I cared about, they always abandoned me. I remember every year in elementary anytime I had a best friend, they would be gone the next year, worse case scenario I upset their parents over a misunderstanding and then we weren't allowed to interact cause their brother would snitch. Not to mention, the one I had loved so dearly, someone so special to me, after verbally abusing and emotionally manipulating me, ghosted and left me alone. Everyone always just leaves. Everyone is just a ticking timebomb to the day that they disappear or just stop caring. 

Even my own best friend, a sister to me, can't even let me know when or why she isn't available or get back to me when she missed my calls. Instead, she just ghosts me. I don't want to have to prompt every conversation ever. Is it so difficult to say hi to your brother once in awhile? Even my own parents barely interact with me or aren't curious about what I do or think. It always ends in me being left alone. Even my boyfriend had no problem abandoning me in a heartbeat. Sure there were other things, but assuming that it couldn't be resolved by communicating (what we were apparently so strong in) made evident that he just wanted to leave anyway. 

I can't stop the loneliness. It's a neverending, predictable cycle that I've been subjected to for years. I just want to feel stable. I just want to know who my friends are. I just want to know who I can depend on. I want to feel like I'm not alone. I just want to feel loved.

555,Xynsh0,1595755015,1,"Before I get into it, I'm a 19M, and I'm currently a second-year at my university. I'm normally very social and have a great friend group, but my past habit of burying my emotions has caught up to me.

Growing up, I was always quiet because of the favoritism my sister (who is a year older) was showed by most of my family. My parents got divorced when I was around 9, and it got pretty nasty between my parents, often putting me in the middle. Most of the problems were due to my dad and over time, I retreated more and more into my schoolwork and video games. I dealt with a lot of bullying growing up as well, which further influenced my decisions to bury all of my emotions and just game and perform well in school.

The situation with my dad only escalated. My parents had shared custody and lived in separate houses. He did a lot of bad things throughout the course of my time with him, and it only made me feel more isolated and depressed. He would talk badly about my mom, force me into the middle of arguments, and make me feel guilty and sad about things out of my control. My sister was more strong-willed and rebellious at the time, so she dealt with it a bit better. When my sister was around 15, she decided to stop seeing my dad for the sake of herself. My dad helped her move out because he didn't want to deal with her anymore. Afterwards, his house was quiet when I was over, and he would talk worse about my sister and my mom. After about 6 months, it got too unbearable, so I ended up leaving as well. After all this time, I'm confident that it was the right decision, but the things he did were very lasting. He broke into a family member's house. He tried to turn us against our mom and leave her behind. He even called the police with a fake suicidal tip to send them to bring my sister to a mental hospital after giving up on her.

During high school, I channeled all my attention towards my school work. I joined the tech theater club and was able to use that as a way for me to cope with everything. I ended up becoming president of the club as well because of my efforts. Though I loved doing theater, I felt extremely lonely during all of high school because I wanted to be in a relationship so badly. My junior year, I built a strong friendship with this girl, and we started flirting a lot and hanging out all the time. We would talk till 4am on school nights and fall asleep in the call talking to each other. After 8 months time, I fell madly in love, and after she said yes to going to prom, I was on cloud 9. I've never felt strong feelings of being wanted by someone really, and I thought I met the one. Fast forward to prom, we spent the whole day together, and we ended up slow dancing. I kept falling deeper in love with her, and I finally felt the feelings of validation that I had always wanted. Three days later, she came out as bisexual and stopped talking to me completely. Later that week, she posted that she was in a relationship with a girl we were friends with. I completely shut down and felt hollow from head to toe from feelings of betrayal and loneliness.

As my senior year wrapped up, I found out I had a defect in my heart that had been limiting my physical abilities my whole life. After facing my fears of having a permanent pacemaker, I ended up getting heart surgery to fix this issue. However, three months later, my heart had healed itself, and it returned to its defective state. The physical exhaustion came back, and I needed another surgery that had a higher risk of requiring a pacemaker. I still felt lonely though all of this, and balancing my schoolwork with medical issues did not help.

Since then, I've moved on from my past experiences, though I still feel lonely. As I adjusted to college life, I met many great people and felt that it was getting better. However, three months in, I ended up getting into a car accident with a semi truck on the highway on my way to campus after a weekend home. I went to a therapist and was diagnosed with PTSD. My friend group was there to comfort me, and I'm grateful for them. Since then, I've overcome it and don't have flashbacks as often or as severe. However, I further buried my emotions with this, and with quarantine happening, I feel that I'm starting to face the consequences of burying my feelings for all of my life.",lonely,I've never felt lonelier.,2020-07-26 19:16:55

I‚Äôm really comfortable being by myself at home and in public, but sometimes I really crave being with someone romantically. This usually happens whenever I see happy couples together or whenever I watch romantic movies (I realize this is probably just FOMO). The thing is, whenever I imagine myself being with someone, there‚Äôs always this fear that pops up that even if someone were to fall in love with me, one day he could just wake up and decide that he no longer wants to be anywhere near me (this is also fuelled by my low self-esteem). 

Basically, the thought of being in a relationship with someone gives me anxiety, and I feel that I would probably be anxious the whole time while in a relationship, constantly wondering/checking if the other person still loves me. I‚Äôd hate to be that person, but at the same time, I really want to feel what it‚Äôs like to be in love with someone and just sharing experiences with that person.

I stay in bed all the time because it's been really hard to get out so it's not her fault entirely, but it makes me sad that I'm having such a hard time and it feels obvious but the person that's supposed to care hasn't seemed to notice.

Left a well-paying job to finish my MBA and just graduated in March. I also finished up my CFA this year, so I was ready to kick-off a new career before Covid. Now we enter the worst economic depression since the dirty 30s, with no signs of relief. It's depressing to think that when I click that ""apply"" button, there are minimum 300 other candidates that are in the same situation as me. 

Unfortunately this was a school that required mountains of debt to complete. Living with my parents at 29 to avoid extra bills, \~3 hours from the city so visiting friends is not happening, and completely screwed up my previous relationship so no significant other.

Finances are ticking time bomb, and I have resorted to doing freelance work to at least cover the bills. It's ironic that I've spent my whole professional life trying to become financially literate, when in reality I can't even get by without taking more debt. 

I am prosperous that a job will come, and life will begin to sort itself out. But holy shit I never expected it to be this hard. If you're going through a similar situation just know you're not alone.",lonely,"Unemployed college kids who graduated during covid, how we feeling?",2020-07-26 14:43:48

I‚Äôm a 25 year old guy, I‚Äôm a ‚Äúdecently attractive person‚Äù I don‚Äôt really look down on myself or anything.  I just don‚Äôt really have any friends anymore. Like for example ever since I broke up with my ex couple years ago I kinda just lost any connection I had with my friends over time.

And I mean occasionally whenever I‚Äôm bored I‚Äôll check my social media, and I have days where I just get super depressed. Seeing how happy everyone is, like legit everyone of my old friends from high school and all that are married or married with kids.. 

And it just sucks because all I do is work and go to school. Just feel like I‚Äôm wasting my life away working and what not. And just not having anyone to talk to or anything just sucks so much.

I have a sibling, but she‚Äôs got her own family to deal with. She‚Äôs married with kids, so that‚Äôs outta the question. I live outta state from my family. I live in Texas, and my parents are retired in Spain lol. And my sis lives in Chicago..

582,samanthax95,1595738199,1,"I feel like either my depression is coming back or I‚Äôm about to have a breakdown or something. I‚Äôve been in bed all week, usually only getting up in the evenings to then go downstairs and watch tv. I can‚Äôt muster up the energy to do anything else.

I‚Äôve dealt with depression before and I really thought I had overcome it, I used to self harm but I‚Äôm way past that now, it definitely has something to do with the fact everyone in my life is moving on and I‚Äôm stuck in a rut that I can‚Äôt seem to get out of. A year ago I lost my job, my long term boyfriend, pretty much my sanity too and I had to leave the little flat I lived in due to me becoming so depressed. Everything I had worked for I lost. Since moving house last year I‚Äôve been a lot better, made progress in little things, got a dog so I know I have some responsibility now which makes me not go into a complete meltdown. But I‚Äôm still jobless, I rarely see my friends, they‚Äôve all got children and/or partners, I live alone so it gets quite lonely. Lately I‚Äôve just been coping by drinking but I noticed that it was getting a little bit out of hand so I have stopped. But when I drink, I usually feel really good, and productive and want to do all of these different things and I wish I was like this sober. But drinking isn‚Äôt the way. 

Yesterday I tried telling 2 friends how I felt as I don‚Äôt feel ashamed to speak up about mental illness, but they didn‚Äôt really respond how I thought they would, I just kinda felt fobbed off so I just said that it didn‚Äôt matter. Ive also noticed recently a few people that I talk to on the reg have stopped talking to me as much so now I‚Äôm over thinking wondering if I‚Äôm just an awful person to be around. I really do try to positive and people keep telling me that things will get better but it it doesn‚Äôt feel like anything is improving, mood wise. I know we all have problems in our lives, but it just sucks that even though I‚Äôm going through all of this, I‚Äôm still there for people despite barely seeing them or barely talking to them, I‚Äôm not the kind of person who over thinks if a friend hasn‚Äôt spoken to me in a few days or anything so that isn‚Äôt an issue, I quite like my own space. But I‚Äôve been there for them so many times, I don‚Äôt give to receive but in this instance, I feel lost and I don‚Äôt know where else to go. 

My last single friend recently got back with her ex, I turn 25 in November and I‚Äôm just honestly freaking out about not having really anything in my life to be proud of. I‚Äôve been looking for work but it‚Äôs still so difficult with covid-19, and I can feel myself slipping deeper into this horrible hole I feel stuck in. I never used to be like this, I loved living alone and being single and being able to be myself and not having to change for anyone etc. But now I find myself crying most nights, I can‚Äôt sleep, the only sleep I get is a few hour naps here and there and I‚Äôve had this headache for like 3 days. I‚Äôm so sick and tired of feeling like this and I always say to myself that I‚Äôm gonna get up early and maybe go for a walk and do some exercise but I never do, I‚Äôve become so anxious to even walk out my front door, the only time I do is when I walk my dog and even then I still feel anxious and I don‚Äôt know why. 

I know my mum would support me and try to help but she got so worried last time as I ended up in hospital, I don‚Äôt want her to worry again because it‚Äôs not like that this time, it‚Äôs literally just me feeling all of these sucky things!! I think social media has a lot to do with it also, I get so jealous of everyone who can now go and see their big group of friends and they post everything and I just wish I had their lives. I have about 4 friends individually, we‚Äôre not a group. Everyone‚Äôs getting married or pregnant and I clearly can‚Äôt even hold down a relationship. Me and my ex separated in may last year and while I was bad for a while, I got over it but recently he‚Äôs been in my dreams and I‚Äôm not sure why, sure there‚Äôll always be something there for him but I‚Äôm not in love with him anymore. 

Often when I watch movies I just picture myself as them to just try and sort of escape my real life, it used to help but it‚Äôs not really a permanent solution. I know this is long just reading this makes me think I‚Äôm just so messed up, I think talking to a counsellor would benefit me but I don‚Äôt have the money and it‚Äôs a really long waiting list on the NHS.

Anyone get that feeling at night? You put down your phone, close your eyes... a minute passes. Another. You ponder it, and the sharp pang that hits your heart as you think, but can't exactly find the right words to explain it. The longing for another person, it really doesn't matter. Just the feeling of wanting to hold another person, or someone to hold you. Someone you've cared for and you want them to know that everything will be fine; Everything would be fine if they were there. Just a thought that will never become a reality. Trying to push down the feeling, you turn on your side, clutching your pillow, trying desperately to fool yourself into thinking it's the person you've cared about, dreamt about. After what feels like hours of not being able to sleep, twisting and turning in your bed, you sit up, and look around. You can't do anything to fix this feeling, no one is there to even talk to. You just sit there.

I feel lonely because she gave me the first experience in what physical warmth is like. I was never hugged before. Never kissed before. Cuddling is one of the best things in my opinion. Now that I don't have her for that anymore, I'm back to this state of ""I want to cuddle with someone"". But now I know how good it can be, and I miss this warmth.

I will get used to it eventually, and I'm distracting myself with training sessions, cleaning up, doing chores, work, planning stuff, and so on. But just like now, I'm laying in bed, feeling this lack so intensely. I don't care if it's just an arm on my back, or someone's head on my arm. I just want this warmth again.

It‚Äôs been such a tough year. I lost my grandad to COVID and shortly after coming back from travelling with my partner we broke up (we‚Äôre back together now), went into lockdown and have not been able to find work. I left that job at the end of last year to go travel.

622,4xdepression,1595717579,1,"19m here. I'm relieved I managed to find a place to vent on reddit, and that there are more people like me, selfish as that is. I just finished my first year of college and it was probably the most lonely year of my entire life. I was able to make at least a few friends, but pretty much all of them have other main friend groups that I'm not a part of and I feel like I'm just a peripheral character in everybody else's life. I told myself that I would just have to take the time to adjust to college life, but most of it consisted of sitting in my dorm room alone. I was unwell both physically and mentally and was just so depressed that I seemed to have been barred access to the kind of rosy college life that everybody around me was able to enjoy effortlessly. I just recently made the decision to go back to school in-person instead of staying at home, but some days I just get that sinking feeling in my stomach and regret that feeling so much. I wanted to come back to get another change at making friends but I'm scared that I'm just making the same mistake I made when I decided to come to this out of state school in the first place and I'll be just as miserable as I was in my first year, or even more so, given the quarantine procedures and how hard it'll be to make friends and meet people because of that. I never really learned how to make friends growing up, I always just had one close friend throughout all of elementary middle and high school and I just became friends with his friends instead of making my own. Now that I'm back home and quarantining, I think they are all hanging out without me, I see them playing together on steam all the time and so it looks like they went and made a new discord server without me as well because the one that I'm on has been inactive since march. I always thought that no matter what happened when I was away at college I would always have them to come back to at home, but oh well. I knew that I'd manage to push them away eventually, it just took a longer time than usual. All of my friends that I made throughout my childhood are now either out of my life or leaving it rapidly. Some of my closest childhood friends I haven't talked to in 5 or 6 years. All the friends I initially thought I'd made at college also started to exclude me even in the first week, I thought I was part of their group but they just split off and left me alone.

I feel like something inside me just broke since I left high school and made it impossible for me to truly connect with any other person, I feel like there's just something fundamentally wrong with me sometimes and that's why everybody I see is able to just easily make friends with everybody else, but when they talk to me they can see the brokenness, they can see that I'm less trustworthy, or that I'm just a shitty person, subconsciously, and they avoid me as a result. I don't know why I ever left my home, I should have just gone to my state's university like everybody close to me did. I even had to break up with my hs girlfriend when I left to go to college out of state and she's ghosting me now too. I don't know how to wrap this up, but I just wish I could be normal. I wish people treated me like they treat everyone else instead of acting so guarded and wary. I don't even think I'm that unattractive, it's just purely my vibes I guess. I wish I was approachable. I wish I could have a normal life, and if that means mediocrity or averageness then I'd fully embrace it just so I could be like everybody else instead of having to feel like such a freak all the time. Maybe I'm over dramatizing everything, maybe I made my problems sound worse than they really are. I just don't know. I hope I can figure out how to fix my life before it's too late, I want to spend these years making memories, but I'm not, and that just means that I'm making regrets instead. What I'm most terrified of is looking back on these years when I'm 40 or 50 and realizing that it only ever got harder, so I should have seized these years when I had the opportunity instead of spending them all depressed and lonely, but I don't know what to do. I don't know how to get out of this. I just hope it gets better. I don't want life to stay the same.",lonely,I feel like I've missed out on too much already,2020-07-26 08:52:59
623,dvali,1595717273,1,"Im a 34-year male with a job I quite like but nothing else going on in my life. I have no friends, and no romantic prospects. Very few family members who I see very rarely.

I hate weekends because I just see it as an empty gulf between the distractions of work and the return to same on Monday. In the evenings, I get home at about 5:00, and usually just stand in the doorway for a while trying to think of some way to pass the hours until sleep. On Friday evening it's the same but even more soul crushing.

Often I can distract myself enough to get through the day. I'm not suicidal, exactly, although I have been in the past. But I also can't bear the notion of spending the next 40-50 years in this state. If I make it to forty without any change, I'll be surprised.

I've had one serious girlfriend in my life. I thought we were in it for the long haul. We were together for about three years, had a house together, pets together, spent Christmas with each other's families. I really thought we had a good life. I found out she had a large debt that she'd been carrying around for years. She was slowly chipping away at it, though the interest meant it would take decades. I paid it off. Three days later she was gone when I got home form work.

I've tried online dating but after about six months I had to drop that. The constant reminder of how unwanted I am was too much to bear.

I lied at the start. I do have one friend. Platonic. Someone I've known for about a year and we go on walks together, the occasional movie, stuff like that. A few days ago, out of the blue, she told me that she only sees me as a friend and there is no possibility of any romance. I mean, ok? That's fine. But now I'm being rejected by people I haven't even approached. That might be my new low.

So that friendship is going to be a challenge to keep alive. How is it going to work now that that elephant is constantly in the room? I can't see it lasting very much longer.

And the part that makes it even more unbearable is that I keep allowing myself to HOPE. And every single time, I'm disappointed. I wish I could learn to accept that I'm going to be alone and be ok with it, but I don't really think that's possible. I guess I'm not built that way.",lonely,Loneliness will almost certainly kill me eventually,2020-07-26 08:47:53

I just can't seem to place myself. I'm not engaged enough in social media/YouTube/Reddit/4chan or whatever there is out there to understand ""internet humour"" (I really don't know what else to call it), so conversations with people who spend most of their time online usually fall flat due to us having no banter or common interests. 

I love reading but have barely read anything, so not much to talk about with bookworms. I am not academic in the slightest so no luck with that crowd. I value politics, but don't know enough to engage in deep debates and discussions about it, however if someone takes 0 interest, I'm immediately put off. 

I want intelligent conversation but when I enter into it, I feel completely out of my depth.. I value philosophy and psychology but lack the intellect and eloquence to put my thoughts into meaningful words, it's rare I am able to carry the conversation past the first few messages. I seem to have a hard time educating myself on these subjects and I'm not sure why.

I have always wanted a feminine friend, any friend really but I'd feel much more comfortable with a woman/feminine man, I've usually only managed to befriend men and after some reflection it's been clear why, they will accept our lack of compatibility and common interests because they couldn't give a fuck about either of those things. They just wanted sex. I am not saying this is what all men aspire for when they communicate with a woman, I'm just talking about my personal experiences. It's left me alone and miserable. 

I just can't tell if it's something I'm doing wrong. Is anyone else in this boat?

Why on Gods earth would anyone want to be with someone like me? I don't blame them of course, I wouldn't want to date or be friends with me either. And all this is happening because I got absolutely fucked when it came to mental health and home life. My mental illnesses have included ADHD, depression, social anxiety, and OCD. Damn it do you think that's enough? And on top of that I couldn't have even been born smart either. If you're gonna do this to me at least give me 1 useful skill or talent.

I don't even really know where to start this but I'll try. I'm 32 M Live in Australia. because of some unfortunate events and shitty people I ended up being afraid of relationships, and a depression that I hid probably a little to well (suicide is something that has crossed my mind daily for over 20 years, and yes I've talked to people about it. It is something I know I won't act on, but the depression was still everpresent)  


Recently I got into my first relationship where I really thought everything was going to be good. Saying it was literally the best thing to happen to me is an understatement. But the events of my past have broken me too much, everything I said was misunderstood, All my actions were questioned to the point I didn't know how to act without being taken out of context so the girl  broke up with me.  


To explain the break up I had to explain everything to the few friends I had who now don't know how to act around me and avoid me.   


So at the time I needed people the most I have kind of lost everyone, I am so very alone right now.  


and to add  
10 years ago I slipped a disc which has pinned and crushed a nerve in my spine, meaning I have very limited mobility, and I live in a very small town of less then 200 people.

They're always the one who talks about themselves non stop and we don't even have anything in common.

Can we stop talking about this now? It's making me sad. "" And then I just was like alright I guess and continued on like normal.

I'm disabled, extreme pain all the time, maintain no social connection to the outside world, and distract myself with other things. Recently I got a job and I met a girl my age, she is my coworker. I'm 20 btw. I think she's awfully cute. It's difficult though, because I'm always really messed up while I'm working because of the pain. Also quite socially dull because of that and many other reasons. This is the first time I've spoken to a girl my age in three years. She seems to enjoy talking to me, asks me a lot of questions, laughs at my dry humor, and generally just appears to like me. Which is very weird coming from my past history. 

It just reminds me how lonely I am. I tried to ignore that fact for a long time. But it's evident, people assume I hate people, she thought that too, I agree cause it's easier to explain. But I'm honestly really lonely. I'm a super affectionate person deep down. I really desire intimacy in general. Just snuggling up in someone's arms. Feeling their body heat. Hugs, holding hands, embracing each other. I've never felt that before. It's weird cause again everyone just assumes I'm an emotionally destitute recluse. I'm very emotional and tender though.

I think my estranged persona is kind of a mechanism for me to protect myself. In my formative years I was always brutally bullied. So somewhere along the line I just stopped expressing any vulnerability (emotion) at all.

Feeling alone though, is whole other kind of different, it's a sucky feeling to be surrounded by friends but still feel like you're the only person who knows you. Either way, sometimes, the way out of this well of low emotions is to connect with someone, and just talk.

Talking is great, but connecting with is better.

Covid has forced many of us into a deeper lack of connection, that truly sucks. For those who alr feel alone, this situation surely made it worse. As a Counsellor, I've had an uprise of patients seeking for help during this time. For me it was upsetting that we were treating patients like a number, checking off the list.

686,poisonhonei,1595659675,3,"okay so when I say this people get really confused and question my gender identity or whatever but it‚Äôs not like that I just want friends. My entire life I‚Äôve always been into ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù things for females to be interested in, when I was younger it was bugs and sciences and as I grew older it grew to video games and power tools. I‚Äôve had a hard time making and keeping friends because of it. I‚Äôm not anti social albeit introverted but I still enjoy talking to people and meeting others. Sometimes I worry that my personality is just really fucking boring and uninteresting to everyone but myself and the only reason people choose to stay friends with me is because I‚Äôm a girl. 

I‚Äôm not trying to gate keep my interests or anything but most of the other girls I‚Äôve ever met who are interested in video games for example either A. use it as a platform to receive male attention or B. view it casually and non competitively or C. their personalities suck or their situation isn‚Äôt open to adding another friend, and it super sucks. With all the guys I meet and talk to they just want something more out of the relationship and I have to end things because they‚Äôre trying to force me into a situation I don‚Äôt want to be in. (and have been forced into in the past due to my desire to have people like me, super shitty and traumatizing)

If I were born male I could make all the gay jokes I wanted without it being awkward, people could actually critique my mistakes and skill and not sugar coat it or straight up lie just because they‚Äôre worried they‚Äôd hurt me allowing me to actually improve, I could actually talk to people with similar interests and know that they like me for me and not just because I‚Äôm a possible romantic interest, I could actually receive the loyalty that friends can give without worrying about hurting someone by not wanting to date them and getting excommunicated or all of the jealousy involved with most of my female friends from real life. There‚Äôs just so many benefits I‚Äôve been able to come up with over the years with minimal downsides exclusive to male friendships. and don‚Äôt even get me started on the whole females hating females because of historical treatment of women by other women and men alike to where women don‚Äôt want to see other women succeed. (It really sucks but if you‚Äôve seen it you know what I mean.)

That‚Äôs also not to say that there is more drama or anything with female groups just that the activities and topics I enjoy don‚Äôt and have not aligned with females I meet. Even now the closest I am is friends who enjoy video games but solely single player story based or console exclusives or softer relaxed games, not necessarily things I can‚Äôt enjoy just something I can‚Äôt relate with. And that‚Äôs only a side hobby for them where as most of my time is playing games and other genuinely nerd shit that no one seems to enjoy discussing like political philosophy or quantum physics or anything. 

And this high key transfers into my beliefs on relationships where I feel that I am going to have to settle because I physically cannot find anyone who either views these things the same as I or is open to the point where I am free to pursue and discuss. Right now I‚Äôm just at a point where I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about anything as everyone has their motives and they use those to drive them. 

Oh yeah and no one cares, not even like oh boo hoo I‚Äôm depressed because of xyz but I‚Äôm a girl so if I say that society will value me I would hate to ever stoop that low. I‚Äôve tried so hard to detach female from my personality most of my life it‚Äôs forced me to almost hate femininity. Only recently have I realized it‚Äôs not wrong to be female and enjoy stereotypically feminine things. The sad part about this realization though, is that I won‚Äôt ever be able to achieve what I‚Äôve been trying to get for so long, a stable set of genuine friends. I don‚Äôt care for gender either it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve found more similarities in all areas of my interests with random males than any female I‚Äôve met.

It makes me feel like this will always be an issue in my life and I‚Äôm going to be alone in all aspects just pursuing what makes me happy minus people which is a huge aspect but never mind that. All of this just makes me so envious of those people who have consistent friends for years and actually enjoy each other and live their lives together, loving each other as brothers as just a family and trusting with their lives, there is no place for me to find such connection. 

realistically I hope things will work out and seventy years from now I‚Äôll look back and pity myself for feeling this way but idfk I guess it‚Äôs just more internalized anxiety 

anyway tdlr I want genuine friends but (I believe I)am struggling to do so bc of my double X chromosome",lonely,I wish I wasn‚Äôt female,2020-07-25 16:47:55

Im 26 i live in Brazil, never had a gf, kissed only once, and Also never Felt attracted to people (neither girls nor boys). 

At my home my parents are always fighting they dont talk to each other, neither to me, they never showed many love towards me and i feel rly awnkward when touching people or getting close to someone, i could Just say i dont know How to love or show It.

It took me more than 20 years to find a group o friends that i Felt like i was part off, but the group suddenly became smaller, people are getting too busy, some of these friends took me to another group of friends they have so i wouldnt be all alone, but these days one of this friends come to talk with me how i was stealing his place and its kinda depressed because i dont rly like this new group, they re good people but the reason i talked to them was to be close to exactly this friend who came talk to me, i Felt so shitty, the way he puts his words made me feel like i was doing nothing but bothering and that i was less than everyone else... And i rly fear going back to ground zero, complete alone, im trying to focus on my career and studies, but im at a point where my body is too tired and almost falling apart.

I suffer from depression and anxiety disorder and i've been tooking my meds that makes It even worst to focus on work



I still love this friend of mine, i love him like a brother, idk If he was having a bad day, but im tired of being the punchbag, last time someone hugged me was two years Ago and It was this same friend. Also is It worth to life alone when you hate yourself and cant stand staying by yourself, i've choosen to give myself some time, and after It if i was still feeling like this i would end It all

As dumb as it sounds, I just can‚Äôt cry. I can have tears in my eyes while lay for ages but emotionally i don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm crying in the slightest of manners. I just feel lost further in the depths of depression and loneliness and with everything happening, it‚Äôs not been a great time trying to search out new people to become acquainted with. I‚Äôm feel like on a last draw here looking for a way out in suicide but i also feel like i‚Äôm trying to look forward to something. I‚Äôm just floating in an abyss of space and time. On the other hand people are dying in the world, others are being activists, all with more things happening to them and they don‚Äôt necessarily complain, so who the hell am I to. I don‚Äôt really know. I know this sub isn‚Äôt for looking to meet other so i‚Äôm probably gonna head over to r4r i suppose. But then again idk wth i‚Äôm thinking i‚Äôll find there. I crave being in a romantic relationship so badly, but when it comes down to it i‚Äôm not much of a candidate to be considered with how little I offer. All I do is stand around frozen with anxiety or stay in bed because of it. Lying down just feels so easy, so I do it all the time. But with nothing there to motivate me, i feel to urge to get up. I‚Äôve gone outside and breathed some air but I feel just as cramped as my cluttered bedroom environment. I don‚Äôt want to go out anymore, but I don‚Äôt want to feel trapped. All I know is when night comes, everything is dark, and i close my eyes, the lack of everything settles in and i‚Äôm back plummeting into the abyss of more racing thoughts of anxieties and desires that constantly clash to no ends. i‚Äôm tired of it all and i hate that i‚Äôm scared to leave it, but i feel so lost and alone despite seeing some of my family occasionally during the day. i want it all to end but i want to see it through. these views aren‚Äôt ever changing but i feel like it‚Äôs getting worse. i‚Äôm not really sure what to do but if you read any part of this if even only this sentence, thank you. i hope you‚Äôre having a better time than me even though i don‚Äôt really have much to complain about thinking objectively. regardless, thanks~",lonely,I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in limbo,2020-07-25 09:55:42

734,TheGreatWario383,1595633148,2,"The only people I see face-to-face are my parents and brother, all my friends are online only, I just want to talk to a cute girl and go on a date so badly. I live all alone in this house with a roommate who doesn't give two shits about me and I never go out, I just stay in my room and play games and draw and fap a lot. I don't even wanna fap half the time, it's just the closest thing to the touch of a real human being that I can get without going outside and exposing myself to disease (I'm a huge germophobe). 

It was hard enough for me to socialize before quarantine because of my constant fear of judgement and social anxiety, now I have no idea what to do, I want to go to a bar but I'm too scared that it'll be socially distanced and I won't even be able to talk to anybody, I live in a small town and I have 0 friends close-by, my closest one lives over half an hour away, so if I'm going to a bar I'm going alone. You need to have friends to make friends and you need to make friends to have friends, it sucks. 

I know I should be grateful that I have a close relationship with my family, I can hug my mother whenever I want, and that I have online friends who love and support me, some people don't even have that, but I still feel isolated and I just want a darn friend who I can see IRL and touch IRL and maybe hug 'n kiss if it ever gets to that point. I've tried online dating but it never seems to work out, I managed to get one girl to message me back and that's it, no dates, not even a simple conversation. I'm at my wits end and I don't know what to freaking do.

I guess I'll end this with some great lyrics from a great song, if you know what they're from PM me and we can chat maybe ; )

738,wayawayx3,1595629105,1,"Sorry this will be long and just typing out of my mind 

I have been talking with this girl on and off for a year. I don‚Äôt remember where but I got her Snapchat. She‚Äôs from my country she lives in US. We started talking normally, she told me she was selling pics. But she says since you‚Äôre so nice and we talked in our language and having fun. I could ask for anything I wanted and she was going to send. So we started sexting and talking and wow she‚Äôs just my type in every aspect from the hair, body, smile everything. She had some financial problems later I helped I really don‚Äôt paid no mind I like helping people. Interesting she was having trips to Mexico and Dubai with her family and got the IPhone 11 Pro with the watch and AirPods. Just a week you couldn‚Äôt paid your phone and now you traveling and stuff you were even not eating, but ok I‚Äôm nobody to question her finance. We would talk like two or three times a week. Then like only once and such, sometime 5 days. A couple of times she has been in our country for a week or two for vacation but really never we can meet she also has said she really wants but it‚Äôs hesitant because fear and questioning from her family or friends like where you going alone?? And I understand woman and basically a stranger. Earlier this year she just didn‚Äôt reply back and since we were talking very briefly just hey, how are you? I lost interest I sometimes reply just for replying. Sometimes I was wondering how she was with the quarantine and if she was ok she lives alone. But didn‚Äôt text her because her Snap isn‚Äôt her main I got a Hi message from her. And I was just happy. She told me her grandma died around January, she got in a bad car accident but everything was ok now. We started talking again she tells me I‚Äôm just an angel they way I treat her. She think she‚Äôs fat I think she‚Äôs not even chubby maybe a couple of pounds more but an amazing body. I really like her she told me if we were close she would give me an opportunity to be together. Now again she‚Äôs not replying or just one liners every two days. Like what keeps you so busy during quarantine you can‚Äôt even text back haha. Or just tell me I don‚Äôt want to talk anymore. Now I hate what I did I feel so bad about myself. Every time she sends a picture or video she covers her face I have seen her face like 4 times. She won‚Äôt say much details about her life pretty much stay anonymous since Snapchat gets deleted. I think that‚Äôs what I like about her the ‚Äúmystery‚Äù of who she‚Äôs I really want her not her body or anything just for who she‚Äôs. I went to FB and put her name I only knew her first name. I searched by location and found her easily like the second girl there. I stared to her pics honestly she‚Äôs way cuter. Saw her family everything, saw her friends  everything fit numbers of brothers her mom. Past location where she used to live. I went through her FB all the way back to 2011. Saw her HS pics her ex boyfriend. She used to miss him was recently she finished with him when we started to talk almost got proposed. He used to abuse her basically physically and sexually she told me she woke up without her clothes and he used to get her drunk to have sex and force her. I don‚Äôt get it if we are a couple why force me?? If that‚Äôs not my kink. She felt like since he‚Äôs my bf I need to please him. Never talked to him about it. Anyway I went to Instagram since her full name wasn‚Äôt common I just tried it and again there she was. I know it‚Äôs wrong asf. But couldn‚Äôt look away. I typed her a message and wanted to send her on Insta but obviously I won‚Äôt. I express everything there how bad I wish we could be together (basically I catched feelings ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) plus I took clues from her FB of what she likes. Many times she had said ‚Äúlike come here, I wish to be with you, I‚Äôm so alone or I want you now‚Äù. On Snapchat I texted her the days we don‚Äôt talk are so shitty. She replied two days later at 2 am with ‚ÄúAhh don‚Äôt say that‚Äù I texted her again when I woke up and now waiting she replies. I‚Äôm thinking of sending the message without telling her I basically stalked her I know it‚Äôs creepy and so wrong I know!! I‚Äôm thinking of send  her the message on Snapchat and delete the app I only use it to talk to her. I will leave my Insta and phone number and see if she writes (I know she won‚Äôt). Last time we talked she said that she could travel here just to meet. Another what if, another lovely girl that we can‚Äôt be together.",lonely,"Lonely, ghosted",2020-07-25 08:18:25

I am a physicist, major in particle. 

Much of the non believers in God or ghosts( but you knows when the the things go down deep, you turn on the god praying mode ) 

So usually I live alone in my home, and due to lockdown I am locked up, but I manage to up and go for work, which is mostly of research a week.

Not having much intraction, I once lost my count of time, and 
Good as day, I would randomly start skipping time, like I was reading a journal and next time I remember gaining concious that I was standing to my door, I tried to check time and it was already 15 min skipped. Later is started having hallucinations, I know it isn't true but going back home from a mart make me see phantom boxes in street. I think I am going mad of something serious happening to my brain, I went to my psychologist, and she says that she have never seeing something twisted like me. It's been a week now that I haven't got any time skip but random hallucinations occurs daily, I see waterfall on streets, people in 2000 fashion standing out and black boxes laying on floor. It's very frustrating. I don't know my problem. And I fear. 

Also at random moment, I feel sleepy and can sleep for 18 hr and sometimes I can't sleep at all for 2 days 

I thought of having my lab assistant stay with me but she is a girl and kinda akward, but she sure checks up on me and help me with not going out for shopping.

Can anyone help me out for atleast just remond me daily that  what is real abd what's not, as I am getting confused lately with reality and randomly wave hands to my hallucinations.

i have nothing to offer other than when a glitch in the matrix happens and i make the person laugh sometime.. 

after i ask what they do for a living or what are their hobbies, i have nothing left to say, how do i continue when i dont have questions left? how do you people do it? my convos feel like im interviewing people with yes or no questions. i feel like im boring everyone and no one likes me or cares about me.

its always me chasing after people never the other way around. its always me working harder and the other doesnt care a bit. never. i my self got bored of saying ""how are you or ""what you doing"" but its all i have in my brain.i never had a best friend. dont think i will ever have one.

and what do girls want from guys? a nice personality? charming ? successfull? or they just want someone that makes them happy?

its like figuring out a jigsaw puzzle when i try to talk to a girl. feels a bit easier when i talk to guys. but i struggle with that too.

how do you guys not run out of things to say?? how do i make the convos where both sides work for it?? how do i not force convos?; how do i make them more open ended?

they end up ignoring me so its me ignoring all the human race or i have to people please.

College is over and I'm living with my parents and my sister. I've always been a person who enjoys their alone time. I could literally spend the whole day without speaking to anyone and because of that I didn't make friends in high school.

Since last year (I'm 22 now), I feel so empty and alone that I can't focus to do the things I used to enjoy doing alone.

There's so much I want to do and I don't because I don't have anyone to do them with me. I feel like everyone formed their group of friends in high school and that's it. If you didn't, you're screwed for the rest of your life. I try to make friends but like I said everyone prefers to hangout with their high school friends and everyone thinks I'm weird because I have like 4 friends in total. 

I feel really bad. This is supposed to be the time where I enjoy my free time with friends (travel, party, etc). Everyone knows that when you get to your 30s your social life gets worse. But can it get worse than this? I'm afraid I'll never experience things I'm supposed to by this age and it makes me depressed. I don't know what to do and my parents keep calling me anti-social and other things I prefer not to say. Can someone help me?",lonely,Missing out on life,2020-07-24 23:10:26
769,XanDer_Dune,1595595610,11,"I've been experiencing extreme feelings of isolation and loneliness for about 5-6 years. But as of recently, these feelings/underlying issues I haven't dealt with for so long are starting to amplify and quite frankly take over my life.

It all truly started after publicly embarrassing myself through a couple songs and ""music videos"" I made about a girl who was a great friend of mine who did not want a romantic relationship with me. This was the end of 2014, beginning of 2015. I didn't understand how to accept her multiple rejections to the point where I thought bugging her about it more and more and writing songs about it would eventually make her want to be with me. Cause that's totally how that works, right???? That led to her leaving my life for good in the summer of 2015. It's been hard to recover from ever since. I was very close friends with this girl.

That started a trend of me losing the rest of my friends for the next year or so. Around the same time in 2015, most of the friends I had, about 3 or 4, stopped talking to me. The only friends I had left at that point were my best friend and his girlfriend. But slowly, my best friend's girlfriend started to distance herself from me, and in the fall of 2016, my best friend left my life after I had a severe mental breakdown and did something fucked up.

So, from October 2016 to the present day, I haven't hung out with any friends. It's only been my intermediate family of 5 and occasional acquaintances since that time. Which isn't nearly enough to satisfy me socially. The only person I hang out with in person is my sister when I see her at my parent's house. I also have my best friend back in my life now after forgiving me in March 2019, but he only talks to me online. I haven't seen him in person yet. However, he brings up all the time the fact that he and my sister are not enough to satisfy my social needs. And he's right. Which is one of the reasons why I'm even posting here right now. Along with the fact that I am chronically lonely and just want to talk to other people, especially people who have similar interests to mine.

All this loneliness and isolation is really starting to consume me. And on top of those feelings, I have strong feelings of sexual frustration and touch starvation stemming from being a virgin at my age, 26, which is a whole different story in and of itself. It honestly frightening. I'm not even suicidal, but sometimes I just want to die. Am I the only person who feels this way? What can I do to try and work on these issues? Any type of advice is welcome. And if you feel like you can relate to my story, don't be afraid to message me. I'd love to hear your thoughts.

775,Zlat1x,1595585952,2,"I'm a 24 year old guy. 

Never thought of making something like this considering how I normally am. 

Ever since I was young I moved around often. From country to country due to parents divorce. It was a rough split. Because of these circumstances I become quiet, shy, insecure and just never really loved myself. 

I was rejected by all family I have being left with only Mum and Dad (Step-Father) after everyone cast us out. Was forced to never be able to make friendships.. love.. anything. Not going to school for 2 years because of moving around and just being excluded from society until I was 15. 

I was always a upbeat child when I was in my own town before the moving started. 

I wonder what happened to my emotions and if they truly exist. I been through so much loss that I don't know emotion anymore. Countless times being bullied in school, excluded for being shy, strange for liking music everything. 

I felt a pain and attempted suicide twice landing in hospital once with heart stopped for 2 minutes. 

For years I tried to build friendships at school to then throw it all away and disconnect from everyone I had close to me. This all took place around the time I found out my dad had colon cancer at a advanced stage. 

The battle was hard and tough but he pulled through to find out last week it had spread to the lungs undetected. 

For the first time in years I cried today.. I faced emotions I had bottled up for years. The heartbreak, the sadness, the loneliness. 

I don't know anymore if I can ever feel emotions again. No matter how much I try to change I never push through and succeed. I stop short of everything I try. I feel like I am not good enough to do anything. 

Every person I know has always said I was smart I could talk to anyone about anything when I open up but the thing is, its nothing but a mask I put on when I leave my room.. I feel the mask falling and I don't know what to do anymore.

I used to have relief in music in anything I could do to distract myself but it's becoming impossible. 

Life can really be a journey... But in the end all comes to an end. 

I just wonder when I look back If I will be able to feel anything towards it.

yesterday i just finished revising my lessons for my last and final exam, language 2 french.  But then i remembered something, i had to practice my letter, but i was too droopy that i had to get a bit of sleep. I promised myself to set an alarm for 2 in the morning to wake up and study. When i reached out to grab my phone it turned out my dum shit of a brother played that Walmaart version of minecraft, killed the battery and hid it somewhere. Just like Indian rapers, do their job and kill the victim. I just can't seem to remove my anger for anything, if i try to hit him, my overprotective parents come out bealts blazing to hit me instead. I somehow tried timing my sleep by waking almost every 45 minutes to check if it was 2 yet, which was the dumbest thing i've ever done. I ended waking up by 5:48 AM, 48 minutes more late than my usual time, see this is why siblings are annoying. It should either be one of us, me or him although preferably me because life is not worth living for me. Somehow dressed up for my van to school and got 15 minutes to study in the van(Yes lockdown lifted for us just to go to school for 6 days and complete our fucking exams) thanks to my fast memory i only did 5 lines even though i was supposed to do 10. Finished my exam with a BIG LOSS OF 5 MARKS! My parents get so crazy if i lose even 2 marks out of 30, LIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? Felt deppresed throughout the day, but then suddenly remembered KSI WAS RELEASING A NEW SONG!! YAY that immediately lifted my mood, but in an unlucky peasant life like this there was no happiness. Me and my friend wanted to do the ""Diamond heist in GTA online"" which most of you know of, we planned that when we reach home he would call my mother saying to let me play as she doesn't believe me. The last period was when my hope and happiness was again broken like i expected. Our chemistry marks, I destroyed myself with a huge fail. I mean can't the answer sheet read my mood? It killed it leading me to go into heavy deppression, sucidal thoughts and even more sucidal thoughts. Now i had little or no hope of happiness. When i reached home my friend called my mom convincing her to let me play. BUT THAT LADY JUST WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE WITH TIME TO PLAY, she lied to him saying that i wasn't home and i was in school even though i was right next to her and told him not to call again. Like how cruel is that? Now my friends are all playing and enjoying 60+FPS in fortnite, GTA, Minecraft JAVA, Valorant, and i'm stuck in here with a crap laptop that couldn't even start windows. WTF is my life? She had a laptop with the best specs you'll ever see in the market and all she uses it for is typing in word,PPT, surfing the internet, WOOOW i mean WOW that much power to do shit?(For those of you wondering she has an Acer Triton  500 with RTX 2080ti) That broke my heart even more. I begged my life out asking her to let me play with my friends, and i got a really respected and great answer. GUESS what......................... FUCK NO, yeah she swears at me.All that humiliation for nothing.  Know i am in my dad's second laptop that he gave me for online classes use, No i don't game in this because my dad told me not to, i am loyal and have a heart unlike them, i think i deserve a bit better than this? NO? 

well take my life in a nutshell - ""I have no life""

778,premfenderz,1595581779,1,"Hope is a good thing they said. Just hold on to it and things will get better, they said. I don‚Äôt know dude. Really?

I hoped for a peaceful family; my parents fight constantly and there is nothing I can do. It‚Äôs been like that for as long  as I can remember. It always stressed me out throughout my life and affected it greatly. I never blamed them, I just blamed myself, like I always do.

I hoped for a reason to live; the only person for whom I cared and loved (my brother) passed away and I pretty much lost the only thing I lived for. He was the sole reason I didn‚Äôt end it all years ago.

I hoped for a better social life; I‚Äôm 24 now and never had the normal social life like the others. No circle of close friends, no hanging out and living the best times of life. I was just invisible, an outcast. Either ignored or hated. I was always a loner. 

I hoped for a partner; I thought I found the love of my life and my future. Finally something to live for and with in peace. Gave her all my love. Got nothing in return. Turns out she had someone else in her heart the whole time and all the hope of a future together was just a mistake. A mistake. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äòll ever recover from that.

I hoped for a better me ; I always hated myself. I could be successful, but I didn‚Äôt put enough effort. I could‚Äôve been more social but didn‚Äôt put effort. Abused drugs to numb the pain of loneliness. The list goes on. I want to have more self love but It just seems impossible.

And now, I‚Äôve run out of all hope. What good is it to trick myself and believe that things will change when I can see that it won‚Äôt ?

I love self improvement. Being able to see myself grow and slowly morph into the person that I‚Äôve always wanted to be is a lovely feeling.

We first matched on SweetRing 45 days ago, chatted online for a week and went on our first date one week later. I never liked talking on the phone but because you, I agreed to that I'll talk to you on the phone every single night before you go to sleep. 

You said you are not feeling well, so I took a day off from work and took care of you. 

I know you have a lot of time during summer cuz you are not taking any summer classes so I've tried my best spending as much time with you whenever I'm not at work. 

And yet, you said you'd rather have someone who can spend more time with you. 

Yes, you did apologize to me telling me that you didn't mean anything you said but I just can't handle this anymore. 

You've crossed the line and I don't think I'll ever be able to love you in the same way. 

I do feel lonely because now no one will text me or call me through out the day. I do miss you but I also need to move on with my life.

I can‚Äôt remember the last time She told me I was beautiful, or the last time He held me close and told me I was loved. I sat and watched from a distance as they ran into their loved one‚Äôs arms with joy, so full of life and comfort. It looked to nice. Sometimes I found myself wishing I could feel that way too. But before I knew it, everyone was gone.  

I try to find those pretty moments. I tried to remember the times I used to laugh, the moments I used to smile, the memories where I felt safe and content. Instead, it‚Äôs the things I didn‚Äôt want to remember that creep back in, keeping me awake and searching. Searching for something or someone. Maybe there was someone there once.

I know myself too well. I used to think I knew the world and people too well that I could almost see everything  coming. And it always did. But can someone prove me wrong just once? To  show me something different. Someone to stay for a while...

I can't breathe. Hopefully I float away soon. 

But there was always something there to lead me back to shore no matter how badly I wanted to drown. There was always something there but I never knew what. A little sunlight, a tiny breeze blowing through my hair. Maybe there is something there. And I thought about it. That beyond all the filth I found something pure. Something reaching for me in the water. Something warm in the color of His eyes. Something there in the way She smiled.  Enough to pull me out of there before I fell too deep.

so i been lurking on this reddit for a bit. hate to admit that i feel lonely (really a shame sort-of trigger), but i guess i just have to let that out. i‚Äôm married and thankfully so, as this would be an unbearable life without my husband.

i‚Äôve been reading about loneliness and it‚Äôs effects on people; the cognitive/executive declines, the irritations, etc etc. i think it serves as a sort of objective analysis of the phenomenon of loneliness, as it manifests in us, which is interesting and validating in some way. i know i‚Äôve experienced loneliness for quite a long time, and my intelligence disrupted by this experience; that as well as my distorted interpretations of my interactions with anyone. i know that sometimes, i just feel like people are messing with me if they say something that has little to suggest whether they are. small things like that really.

not really sure what i‚Äôm trying to say here, but i was wondering if anyone could relate, or at least understands the experience and could relate, but also who isn‚Äôt and doesn‚Äôt want loneliness to get the better of them. i‚Äôm looking for advice, helpful tips, even if it‚Äôs the same old emphasis on ‚Äúexposure to new people, reframe your thoughts, persistence!‚Äù

i haven‚Äôt had genuine quality friendships (well, there‚Äôs one guy i know, but i guess i feel like such a flake around him that i don‚Äôt know if i should meet up with him or if he‚Äôd take it the wrong way, or if my loneliness would rub up on him (reading an article saying that lonely people makes other people lonely could be quite damaging in attempting to make friends (i also don‚Äôt know if that science report has weight anymore)).

I'm a 26 Year Old Male, Still a Virgin, Still Lives with My Mom, No Car, No License, No Job ( I can't work because of my asthma because of this fucking Coronavirus going on), Don't got a lot of friends, and My First Relationship In Nine Years Only Lasted A Week. 

No girl will ever find me appealing because of where I don't got a car or a job. They'll look at me as being someone who is unstable and dependent when really that's not the case at all. I WANT to learn how to drive, but I can't because my mom's truck is messed up and doesn't work right and we don't have the money to get it fixed. We do have my grandfather's car as well, but same as my mom's truck, needs work on it and we don't have the money.

The money that my mom does receive goes towards paying the bills and my mom's boyfriend does the same with his money, but that's all that he does. After that he just sits on his ass all day and does nothing and doesn't help around the house. He and My Mom constantly argues and as bad as Mom wants to leave him and as bad as I want her to do the same, she can't because we'll lose our house because it takes both of them to pay the bills. If my grandfather were still alive, she would have left him by now.

I was helping out with the bills before I got sick with Type B Flu for a week and was being threatened by management about getting fired and I had no other choice but to quit. I got hired on at Lowe's shortly after and was about to start working there, but my town got it's first positive case of COVID on my first day of orientation and I couldn't go in. I tried to get my orientation postponed where I have Asthma and wasn't comfortable going in and was told that they would talk to the managers about it and call me back and never got a call back. That was months ago. 

I tried for months to see if I could qualify for at least SOME form of Unemployment to help out around the house, but come to find out, I don't even qualify for any fucking type of unemployment. Not even the lowest type of it.  Because I didn't work long enough at my old job. What a load of horseshit. Shit like that should be waived in a time of a Worldwide Pandemic that we're facing. 

I can't get back into what I love to do which is Broadcasting and Radio because the piece of shit that sexually harassed my mom is still in the business and he will try every which way to fuck me over by taking all the opportunities like he used to do when I was associated with him. I do a Wrestling News show for Spotify, iTunes, and Amazon Echo Devices, but I feel like not a lot of people listen to me anymore and spend more time on another Wrestling News show that someone else started that's been getting amazing reviews. I also don't make a lot of money from my show. 

This is the lowest point of my life since my grandfather died last year. I've never felt so helpless in my entire life since that day. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of hell and anytime that I try to get out of it, I fucking can't because I get dragged back down. I want to try to stay positive and say things will get better, but I just really don't know anymore. With how old I'm getting and still being a virgin and what I went through recently with my breakup I really don't think that I'm ever going to find true love. I honestly think that I'm probably going to end up dying a virgin because I don't think no woman is going to lay down, love, and value me as a person and partner as long as I'm in the situation that I'm in currently.

Do you ever just ask yourself 'why me?' I'm 19, and ever since I can remember I had been an outcast, basically. Primary school, secondary school and even now in college. I've been feeling lonely for so long I don't know anything else, I don't know what friendship feels like, I never fit in, I'm always alone. But I ask myself, what am I doing wrong? I must have some mental disability that prevents me from socializing. I never got bullied, rejected sometimes, but sometimes I just freeze inside my head when I get a chance to make friends or whatever, something just shuts my thinking off and I end up alone.

Let's not get started about sexual relationships, because I never had one or nothing that comes with it. I always expected years ago ""maybe my life will turn around in college?"" well, it didn't. All I do nowadays is just stay at home and literally do nothing. I don't have a single person I can text write now (NOT A SINGLE ONE) whilst everyone else my age is out there enjoying life like normal human beings.

To be honest, it's gotten so weird I think that I am paying a price for something I did. I ask myself, have I done something bad and suffering because of it? I was born with a non beating heart but was barely saved; so I wonder, was my destiny to die that day? I know I'm going too deep into this shit, but I can't stress how tired I am of this shit, there's not a day I don't consider suicide. Where did it go wrong? Why me? It's been like this for years and years and I don't think I can continue living this absolute misery of a life. And, everyone thinks I am usually happy and uplifting, but they don't know what's happening behind the smile.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am stuck alone with no one to socialize outside of family, have been since I have memory of it actually. 

This year, I was abroad in The States for the year, and for the first time I actually had friends, people around me that gave me joy every single day.  Then COVID happened and I had to leave early, lost a month of my exchange and everything sorta turned to shit. I had to leave an amazing group of friends to come back home and feel like garbage again. I am lonely, even though I am surrounded by mi familly. Sure I may have some online friends from League of Legends but they just don¬¥t feel ""real"" I guess.

I really believe that the only reason I stayed sane during lockdown in Spain is that I had to study for 10 hours everyday, which in turn made me exhausted by the end of the day and I simply didn¬¥t have the energy to feel down or think about stuff at all. 

Living here in Spain feels like I just don¬¥t connect with people, maybe its my personality, maybe its just that I don¬¥t like the values that I see in people idk really. Could this be a side effect of moving constantly and living in a lot of places? I¬¥ve moved at least 7 times in my 21 years alive and maybe thats part of the problem. 

I graduate from Engineering School next year and I am completely terrified about what to do.

Other than that, I'm pretty much dead to the world as I choose to be invisible in social media.

I had my 5-10 minute scrolling-through-Instagram session in which my feed mostly consist of people's selfies, food, repost of stuff happening around the world and the stuff you expect from good, quarantined human beings.

And, secretly, I like that everyone is staying at home. It means they are subjected to having the same less-hectic, uneventful life as I have and I'm not alone in experiencing something for once. But with our country's success with Covid-19, locations are slowly starting to open up again. (which is a nice thing btw! But I'm selfish so...)

With thay said, I saw a picture my friend with her two other friends (making a group of 1 girl, 2 boys) out at the beach smiling at the camera.The first thing that caught my eye is that fact there are out in public and which triggered me because 'guys you shouldn't be outside just for fun'. 

I checked the comments but the responses were overwhelmingly positive. I sigh, defeated, and thought 'at least they are doing a good job social distancing there'.

It should've been just that. I should've finished and kept scrolling but for some reason my heart is starting to pound rapidly and I don't like what my body is anticipating on doing to me.

'This is not the first damn post you've seen people go outside why the fuck are you acting like this' so I swiped between the pictures between of the three friends, eagerly and looking intently for something wrong about the pictures.

There is actually nothing wrong with the post. They are not posing suggestively for the camera. They are showing off their pudgy bodies with no shame or hesitation and they are enjoying each other's company. It's all genuine bliss and the reality that I'm going to have to face.

Lol what a massive punch the gut. I'm jealous that they have a life with friends and people while I don't. I have no friends. I can never get that level of attention. How pathetic of me ain't it? 

I kept shit-talking myself for a while and let the full blown anxiety attack happen while I'm alone room, in bed, hugging all my pillows. That part is finished. I have transitioned to the sad-tired-teary phase.

881,binary_bin,1595492357,3,"Hi,  here. This is gonna be a long rant one so bear with me...

Just yesterday I was quite happy and motivated. But, it all changed when last night I suddenly became sad and depressed. Perhaps, this is just one of the many emotional 'slumps' that I will have to encounter in life. But I feel like there's no way out of this. I have gotten out of many depressive episodes that always lasted for +/- 1 week, but I don't think I can ever get out of this one.

Why, you may ask? I just think that no one truly cares about me. Sure, I have many friends and acquaintances, but to be honest, I think my friendships are quite shallow. We just talk and talk with no real substance. What's more, my 'former' best friend has been taking advantage of me. He made me do his work and asked me to help him do his 'stuff' many times. So, I just feel like people want to be my friend 'cuz they can gain something from our friendship.

And there's my parents who say that they care for me, but they don't really show it. I feel like they want me to be successful just so that they can brag about me in front of the family and their friends. This is especially true for my mom. She once mentioned that she posts pictures of my medals and certificates on Facebook, just to get more likes and make their friends jealous. I know probably she didn't mean it, but it feels like I don't really matter to her. Only my successes matter. Also, I can't be tell them anything about this since they'll just brush the issue aside. I don't even think they can empathize with me. Last time I mentioned being sad they were like, 'just stop worrying and be more thankful to what you have in life.' But, the truth of the matter is that I don't know how to stop worrying about my life. It's so easy to tell people not to give a damn but how to do it is still a million dollar question (for me, at least).

Now, I only have this girl who is really deep and whom I can connect with, but I don't wanna bother her for the time being. She's probably busy and doesn't even care about me. If I'm vulnerable with her and ask for a piece of advice from her, she'll probably think I'm a weak and needy guy who doesn't know how to deal with problems on his own. Actually, thinking about it, I don't think that she'll judge me, 'cuz she's been a great friend :) but I just don't wanna disturb her since we all have exams 1 month from now. She's probably busy studying with her other friends or something. And this covid-19 thing has made it worse since that means we can't meet in person. Thus, I don't really have a support system at the moment, which is extremely sad.

I really have no one to talk to. I just want a shoulder to rest my head on. I think this is the root cause of my 'emotional slump'. FYI, I got that phrase from Eric the INTP (link: [INTP Fe Explosion + Loneliness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjGyBPK2FAo)). As an INTP (my Myers-Briggs type), I can very much relate to this video. Although I'm introverted by nature, I still need some human connection, and I just feel like there's no one out there who is deep and truly cares about me and my well being. I'm feeling that slowly my life is becoming more and more meaningless over time. Although a lot of people say that I'm gifted and talented, I feel like all these talents and intelligence are simply without meaning if there's no one who truly cares about me. I lost all motivation and felt worthless doing nothing today.

Hmmm... I spent the whole day today pitying myself and having harmless suicidal thoughts (not a karmawhore here... Please, I won't kill myself unless I really have to). I tried playing more Star Wars TOR and Minecraft but it just got boring. I tried to distract myself by watching Rick and Morty but it just didn't work. I also spent some time today doing a math essay that I've been working on for the past 1 week or so, but after I finished it I was like 'what now?' ...I just feel my life is worthless 'cuz no one really cares about me, everything becomes boring and uninteresting. I think my life is kinda uninteresting too.

So I just wanna post my rant here. I think enough has been said. My exams are in 1 month, but I just don't have the motivation/inspiration to study... since whatever grades I get, no one still cares about me. Even if I get straight A's people will still take advantage of me. So, thank you for coming to my TED talk, I really appreciated it!

Also English is my second language so yeah sorry for grammar mistakes and stuff.",lonely,No one truly cares,2020-07-23 18:19:17

889,DometLen,1595485533,6,"I‚Äôm not sure what this is supposed to be. This is the sort of thing I write in my journal. I think I am desperately struggling wanting a reason to want to be. I feel like I am drowning and all I can do is flail my arms hoping someone will grab me when I should just stop and accept my reality. I recently had a chance conversation with a stranger that got somewhat deep / existential. They told me, before we went our separate ways, that I was ‚Äúunique‚Äù and I ‚Äúmattered‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. There is nothing special, unique, or interesting about me. My life ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter. It is a very lonely feeling. Whenever I try and talk to anyone about it, they never react well. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone about it anymore. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve wanted to be alive for a very long time. I‚Äôve lived a relatively good life I‚Äôd say. Fine family, good enough jobs, I even had ‚Äúgood friends‚Äù and a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù at one point. Even still I have always felt empty and alone like nobody really wants me around is only just putting up with me. I turned out to be mostly right. My ‚Äúfriend‚Äù was kind enough to leave me with the words ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt worth the trouble.‚Äù Almost every day I think to myself, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù There is no point. I drag myself forward, day by day, toward some ambiguous end game of self-fulfillment that ultimately doesn‚Äôt mean anything. I can‚Äôt live my life for myself. I simply have no desire to do so. For a long time, I thought if I could make someone else happy and give them a good life, i.e. my ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù, then my life would have become one worth seeing through to the end. I guess, as it turns out, nobody wants to be somebody‚Äôs existential crutch. So, I‚Äôm not good for much anything. I‚Äôve given up on people pretty much. Nobody wants to be around a cynical, bitter, downer who‚Äôs obsessed with playing make believe anyway. I‚Äôm not going to fake being some happy clown just to make some pretend friends for some fleeting sense of belonging or to be stabbed in the back after I get invested.

I‚Äôm looking so desperately for a place to belong, but it turns out I don‚Äôt belong anywhere. I just don‚Äôt belong on this boring, depressing, hateful, world. I don‚Äôt really know why I am still here frankly. I think I have some small feeling that I still have some unfinished business. There are a few projects of mine it would be nice to see through to the end, for no other reason than them being pretty much my only anchor onto this whole living thing. I could say something romantic like ‚Äúpeople would miss me‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt really matter if I was dead. For the time being I‚Äôll continue marching forward, pretending like finishing what I set out to do will actually mean anything in the long run, and once I have completed my projects or I run into unavoidable financial peril I‚Äôll just take the easy way out because why not? This is what happens when I sit on a park bench for three hours and stare at clouds. This rant is also probably why I have no friends.",lonely,untitled. dont read,2020-07-23 16:25:33

So I went to secondary school (11-12 years old) I made a few friends and obviously the group changed over the years and that. But towards the end of year 11 (15-16) I had a decent group of mates with my closest mate the one I had been pretty much best mates with for the last 5 years, even though we didn't meet much out of school coz we lived quite far away and both don't go out much and he wasn't around much out of school. I constantly told him that I'm willing to make the trek (only about 30-40 minutes bike) to his or go piss about at the park with him and the rest of our group, but they all live in the same little village. And then covid broke up our school and I'm missing my exams and that and I went out to eat with my best mate and another mutual friend I'm close with but I haven't seen him or anyone since.

so because of lockdown I haven't seen them (for the first month or two anyway) but I have texted quite a few times to try and see people but they can't ever come out, or even come on a cross platform video game because they all have a different console. The next fucking day after I text asking if anyone can come out, I'm SENT streaks on Snapchat by one of the group, of them all at his pool. Fair enough I'm not that close with him personally and just didn't think I'd want to come, but I still sent a different mate a hint that I would have wanted to come (because I'm too scared to say directly) but then a week later their all messing about at a lake with a rope swing. So I said directly (and politely) and asked if I could be invited next time. Again was left out though.

They're going out regularly, knowing I want to come, and the people I wasn't as close to are posting it and shit. I don't they even think about me now. So yeah I've blocked them all on Snapchat and have deleted Instagram because I don't even want to come out anymore, but I still do as well though coz I miss them. That's all it is I've seen them all almost everyday for 5 years and suddenly they won't even bother trying to contact me since fucking March.

I've made new friends now but I'm not close with them and scared about kissing more mates, especially since I only got 2 years before I'm probably leaving for University so I'm scared I'll get too close. To be honest I'm more scared of making them feeling what I'm feeling now. Fuck",lonely,I don't think my friends remember I'm their mate,2020-07-23 09:46:31

Loneliness begins with you telling yourself,
""i don't need anyone"". It's when you start living inside your head for too long. When having a meal alone doesn't feel weird at all.
It's when you are in a room full of familiar faces, yet have no one to talk to.

It's not loneliness when you don't have anyone to tell why you're feeling sad, it's loneliness when you don't know whom to tell that happy news. It's when you stare hard at your screen, smile slyly, and keep it to yourself.

You go to the movies alone, or binge-watch six seasons at home. It's when you keep discovering new songs and have no one to share them with.

It's when you scroll through your feed endlessly with no one tagging you on memes.

Loneliness is often leaving things midway. It's starting a book but never knowing the end. It's you skipping and shuffling your playlist, but finding no song to suit your mood. It's you starting to write or paint, but never coming around to complete it.

It's sleeping with an empty side on a double-bed. It's when you're packing your bags and no one says,""have a safe journey"". It's when you don't have any reason to return home. It's when you have a fever and you go to the doctor all by yourself.

Loneliness is leaving things the way they are, and still finding them in the same place, untouched. It's knowing nobody can fix you. It's knowing that you've to live with yourself alone, forever.

955,Epersonalthrowaway,1595444003,1,"What happened;
We matched on bumble and I was very happy to match bcos the app said she was 1 mile away yet I was confused how I didn‚Äôt know who she was. A very hot girl living so close that I‚Äôd never met, or course I wanted to match. We started chatting and got on really well then things got flirty and ended up exchanging nudes which became quite a regular thing. To try put a bit more effort in than I normally would we even had a phone call for ages which was good tbf. Talked more and about meeting up to have sex when lockdown was lifted enough. She said to me multiple times ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre not going to drop me when lockdown is over‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt thinking of it as just casual but also wasn‚Äôt thinking of it as more because without meeting her in person it was hard to know my feelings. Another factor of that was when I turned 23(in May) I realised she‚Äôd just turned 18 so it was a 5 year gap which I thought was a wee bit strange. After talking since about the start of May, so for a good few weeks, about a week before lockdown lifted the way she was acting changed and her mood too. When I asked about it, she said ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been single properly in a while and just need some time to myself‚Äù. I asked if I had done anything wrong but she claimed I hadn‚Äôt. At the time I didn‚Äôt think to question what caused the sudden change of heart to needing that time to herself, now that is something I wish I did know because it especially confuses me since she was saying the I hope you don‚Äôt drop me thing. After that the talking became very minimal and it wasn‚Äôt the same at all. Fast forward to this Saturday (28/7) I went out with my friends, I knew she was out and part of me knew I shouldn‚Äôt go out when I knew she was. In a very drunk state I spoke to her but don‚Äôt remember what was said and also left her a voice message claiming she was a liar. Apparently I was also staring and being a bit creepy. I woke up Sunday and asked if I left a voice message which she said yes and that she doesn‚Äôt think we should talk again. That hit hard. Monday I decided to message her and just apologise for acting like a dickhead explaining I didn‚Äôt remember much, she thanked me for my apology and we agreed not to leave things on bad terms. Although I‚Äôm happy she accepted the apology and it‚Äôs not been left with bad blood, the situation has left me feeling super Shitty and a bit hung up on her despite not having feelings. 

And now here‚Äôs the problems that have arose. Firstly the fact that I feel like I need to talk about it all (like writing this), acting like it‚Äôs a girl I‚Äôve been in a relationship with and the fact I can‚Äôt just let it go. Feel like she would think I‚Äôm a freak writing this. But then I can‚Äôt help that it bothers me and it‚Äôs on my mind, can i? So to talk about it and get it all out is best. 
Just feel like everyone else in my position would just forget about it and move on without caring, yknow just be like ah well least I got nudes from it but I can‚Äôt. 
Its also got to me because it‚Äôs another case of someone being part of my life then never seeing/speaking to them again. 
I thought I had worked through past problems with girls and was ready to date again but after how I acted at the weekend I‚Äôm not so sure. 
Linked to above, again it‚Äôs a situation of them having all the power and me just being the one left caring.
Which makes me feel weak etc. 
Why have I ended up being so hung up about it is a question on my mind. The answer to that, I think is because I‚Äôm really lacking that companionship/intimacy and it was someone new, not a recurring person (eg People
I‚Äôve got with before). Someone that is very hot with a great body. And the things we‚Äôd talked about were so good and would of been so hot to do. 

But furthermore, why am I getting hung up on someone just because they‚Äôre a new person and hot without having feelings for them? And why has it brought up a lot of self confidence issues?
I‚Äôm obsessive because it‚Äôs not something that I get or happens to me often at all. 
I would say she was going to be the hottest person I‚Äôve slept with. 
But then thinking on it, the fact that Someone 5 years younger than me would be the hottest person I‚Äôve slept with feels embarrassing. Can‚Äôt even get anyone my age. 
And it‚Äôs that fact that has made me realise how rare it is I pull or anything. 
Realistically all the girls I‚Äôve got with/slept with haven‚Äôt been that fit.
The girls I fancy never fancy me back. 
It‚Äôs making me take not of how insecure I am. Despite my body being in the best shape of my life I still feel ugly. 
Like I go on nights out and my mates get attention from girls but I don‚Äôt and haven‚Äôt really for years now.

BACKSTORY: So, we were friends since 2006. When we were 5 yo.
Our friendship was like a bond. We were inseparable. We grew up. We still had the same respect and care for each other.  She might be a girl be she always liked hanging out with me. I was here ""I'm all ears guy "" and she was mine.

I remember how fun that was living the best moments of my life. She liked video games because her father did. But she was the one introducing me to Halo and Metal gear solid series.  Cool games.
Anyways, her parents are working people which means they only home at late at night or Sats or Sunday's. I use to stay late at her place cuz she was scared to be alone and we would do our school work and assignments  and play games. Still it was fun.

HERE is what happened:

I never had any sexual attraction towards her. It was platonic. But one day I was sexually aroused for some reason. I was 15 and a half at the time. That time it was at its peak (puberty thing). We were playing minecraft. And she just got real close. She usually would that never bothered me but she did that at a wrong time. And I kissed her. She was totally shocked by what I did .  She got scared. And I just left. I apologized but never worked. I kept apologizing for months. She just wouldn't look at me as her friend. We go to same school. We have 3 subjects in common. I used to see her every day before the corona. She'd still ignore me.

 I used to wonder. Why did I do that? I had the perfect friend in the world. And I Ruined it. Now here I am. Sitting lonely babysittin my sister. 

Thanks for whoever read. This is might feel better now. 

I would like to ask females here. How would you react? And would you forgive?

Safe place-

I am looking for a safe place
To hide the pain behind my face.
Somebody to feel less lonely
But I remember only...
The doubts and worries in my head.

Tired and weak
I think I need some sleep
To scratch my arms until they become raw and red.
Wishing not to be alive, but not to be dead.

I‚Äôm tired of trying.
When every step feels like I‚Äôm dying.
My mind screaming at me to end it all.
Speaking with such exhaustion and drawl.
I promised to not end my life,
Yet I still linger at the blood-stained knife.

One day I hope for an answer to this.
Because I know if I left, I will be missed.

I'm starting to feel like I will never have friends again. Even when I try to make connections, people just ignore me. I'm so sick of being left on read that I can't even bring myself to message anyone anymore. It makes me feel so worthless and unwanted. Even if someone tries to engage with me, they always stop responding in the middle of the convo. I hate it. Why is it so normal to treat people like they're robots behind a screen, as if their existence is only real when you acknowledge it? 

I've heard over and over people defend the lack of responsiveness - saying that people have their own things to deal with. I get that, but when it happens over and over again, and you keep reaching out just to pull back empty handed, it starts to feel hurtful. I've always been the kind of person that people talk to when they need something yet never reciprocate the support, so I'm getting really sick of feeling like a ghost until I'm useful in some way. All of my friendships in the past have been shitty, disingenuous, and toxic, so this feeling of loneliness has pervaded my entire life. I'm at the point where I'm too tired to try to make friends because I either attract users/toxic people or people just ignore me and make me feel worse. At the same time, my loneliness gnaws away at me like a hunger, and I'm desperate for some kind of connection. I've resigned myself to sitting with the discomfort, but I can feel myself eroding. Sometimes I don't even know who i am anymore because I keep trying to fill the void with things that dont matter and I lose sight of myself trying to accept something that I don't want to.

I can't deal with how turned on and alone I feel. I have tried the apps Tinder and Bumble and (I'm good looking you would never guess I had so much baggage) I get too self conscious and always wind up deleting them, I also struggle to deal with when a girl ghosts me when we was having a nice conversation it's all a bit blunt for me.

Nobody has ever or it feels will ever use the words I love you to me, I have had enough of feeling so unloved and rotten. Why do I have to feel so insecure at times? Particularly about not being intimate with anyone. Why?! :(

I deal with my loneliness by spending too much time on this stupid site. I constantly create and delete accounts, meet very nice people get along with on Reddit r4r and makenewfriendshere but I just crave the physical intimacy soooooo much I end up cutting myself of from everyone because I feel too shy and self destructive.

Definitely put on a few pounds with ongoing depression, loneliness and plain boredom. Due to my husband's illness is he able to take care of basic needs but he's chronically fatigued and in pain. It breaks my heart. I used to not understand it but now I do. I love him so much and take my vows very seriously but I am losing my mind. He was never romantic or even very affectionate but he did things if I asked. After his illness over 10 years ago it has a complete survival and desperation. With nothing to look forward to.

I crave intimacy. I crave attention. Someone to come up behind me and tell me I am gorgeous. Not just once in a while either. Someone to be playful and laugh with. Go to the movies, late night walk, take a drive, swim, hike, go see the ocean, watch a sunrise. Anything, something! Not all the time, I'd take once or twice a week. His illness also leaves him with a flat affect. He doesn't realise how uninterested he seems. Most the time I feel he is just irritated. I am considering becoming a companion to several people (building connections) or finding a partner that can accept my situation. 

We have had our kids young and we should be enjoying the best years of out lives. I am seriously about ready to rent myself as a companion for those lonely! Is that even legal??

Basically a perfect life that I am so immensely appreciative and grateful to have the opportunity to live. But on the inside I have been so extremely lonely and longing for a relationship with a girl for so long but have never even been close to having one, Im not particularly good looking either slightly below average on a normal day and slightly above average on a good day. When I was a little kid from kindergarten to about 4th grade I was one of ‚Äúthe popular kids‚Äù if that‚Äôs even a thing at that age but I didn‚Äôt do well in school then so my parents put me on ADHD medication which basically made me focus but turned me into a shy hermit on the other hand and completely destroyed any social life I had, until around 6th grade when I took myself off of it. By that time I had no friends or anything like that and wasn‚Äôt even doing well in school anymore (or to this day). But, I eventually made 2 good friends who I can 100% count on, but recently I have been really wanting/needing a companion to share my life with but have absolutely no idea how to approach someone, I think I have a good personality but my lack of confidence, looks, and knowledge of talking to just people in general is really getting in the way. I‚Äôm so lonely and unknown with women I started thinking about all the interactions I‚Äôve had with women and realized that other than my mom or grandmother I‚Äôve never actually received any sign of attention, attraction, or interest from a woman not even a single compliment. I‚Äôve never even been approached by gold digger type chicks which my school is packed full of, because other than hearing my name on the attendance list they have no reason to know I exist. Sex or anything like that isn‚Äôt even what I‚Äôm looking for I just want someone to really love me and care for me, someone I can pickup and go get lunch with and talk about our day together. This has got me really thinking about how lonely I am and how much just a random hug from a girl would mean to me...it would mean someone actually saw me and thought about me, I would be so happy if that happened I would be smiling for weeks. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even getting at anymore and I don‚Äôt want this to sound like a big pity party but if anyone has any advice that isn‚Äôt the generic advise you would get from a parent, friend, or YouTube video because I‚Äôve heard and seen all of them please let me know.

23M. A little info about me.  I was ‚Äúpopular‚Äù in middle school, which really isn‚Äôt saying much, but I was friends with everyone. I was a star athlete, I was smart, I had a bright future ahead of me. 
Then something happened, and I still can‚Äôt figure out what it was..  I still remember the last day of 8th grade.  I was standing back by the locker room with my friends just shooting the shit waiting to get picked up. I had already said my end of the year goodbyes to everyone else, and these guys were my closest friends so everything was awesome.  We were all talking about what athletics would be like next year in high school while we threw the football around.  AND THATS IT.  That‚Äôs pretty much the last time I ever talked to anyone.  I remember freshman orientation, I walked into the auditorium expecting to shake hands and give hugs, but no one said anything to me?  Afterwards, I walked up to 3 or 4 different groups of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and none of them seemed to want me around.  
Anyway, I get through freshman year alright, occasionally I‚Äôd hang out with some people, but that was a rare occasion. Me and my baseball coach didn‚Äôt really get along and at some point in my sophomore year we came to blows in the parking lot behind the field house.  I‚Äôve always regretted that. He deserved an ass whoopin, but I deserved to play ball, I worked hard for that shit. I wasn‚Äôt going to be allowed back into athletics, so instead of serving a suspension, I dropped out and went to an alternative school.  
It was a great school, it wasn‚Äôt the typical school you think of when you hear ‚Äúalternative school‚Äù.  It was a small group of students (maybe 25) and teachers, some of which I already knew.  Anyway, I became pretty depressed after the realization that I wasn‚Äôt going to play baseball again.  My family started to notice and talked me into seeing a counselor.  It didn‚Äôt really work.  I was just passed around from clinic to clinic getting the same ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this was meant to work out, let me recommend someone I know..‚Äù bullshit.  Eventually I was diagnosed with Depression, Bipolar, and anxiety disorders.  Then the real problems started.  That was around 2014.  For the next 2&amp;1/2 years all I did was pop Xanax.  And I mean, it was bad, like 60 MGs a day bad.  I had given up on everything and figured, Xanax probably wasn‚Äôt going to kill me, and as long as I‚Äôm on Xanax, I don‚Äôt have to think.  Got arrested for the first time my senior year.  Sitting in a cell during my graduation, which they didn‚Äôt even recognize me at.  And that‚Äôs that.  Since graduating, I haven‚Äôt done shit.  I‚Äôm still at my parents.  I don‚Äôt have a job.  I‚Äôve gotten so big, that I don‚Äôt leave the house during the day in fear that someone I knew back in middle school might see me.  Or even worse, one of the girls I used to know.  I‚Äôm pretty much at the end here.  I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I‚Äôm so lonely, so bored with life, that I really just want to die.  I have no purpose.  I‚Äôm almost 24 and I haven‚Äôt done anything.   I read somewhere that when someone starts doing drugs the way I did before their brain is fully developed, that the person never really matures and is mentally stuck at the age in which they started doing the drugs.  I believe that may be the case with me.  I‚Äôm fully aware of what‚Äôs going on and how to change it, I just don‚Äôt want to.  I‚Äôm at the point I‚Äôd rather just die.  I banked too hard on baseball.  I never learned how to do anything else.  I can‚Äôt change the oil on my truck, but I can teach you how to shorten your swing and take a pitch to opposite field with 2 strikes, lol.  Pretty much useless information at this point..  
On the bright side, I‚Äôm about to reach 4 years of sobriety!   
I don‚Äôt know what the purpose of this post was.  I haven‚Äôt had anyone to talk to in a long ass time, and I just needed to get this out.  I‚Äôm just real fucking lonely.  I really appreciate it if you read this far, I know it was a long rambling mess.  
If anyone ever needs to talk, about anything, please feel free to message me.  I‚Äôm not good at much, but I think I‚Äôm pretty good at listening and making people feel better.  God bless.",lonely,Somethings gotta change,2020-07-22 18:28:44

I am very sad tonight. (F20) 


I am currently in university and am struggling a lot with self esteem, social anxiety and depression due to past trauma with friends in highschool. 



I moved into an apartment this year with people i considered ‚Äúbestfriends‚Äù but they were really loud, messy and inconsiderate people to live with (screaming at 3am when I have a morning exam etc) For these reasons on top of one of the girls just being super rude and mean to me, I made the tough decision to break my lease with them, efficiently turning them all against me. 




I had that group of friends, but I also had another group of friends which i loved and got along even better with. Their house was always full with tenants, but they actively encouraged that if a spot should open up in their house, that I should move in with them!!!! 



this idea excited me a lot! A new group of friends to live with and do things with! Except.... One of the girls who lives there, my Bestfriend since first year, told me today that one of the girls had moved out and they had already found a new girl to replace her! she said this as nonchalant news, not knowing it would hurt my feelings. but i‚Äôd been really excited and holding out for this opportunity so it really crushed me that i was A) either not even considered as a potential new roommate or B) forgotten entirely. I don‚Äôt know which one is worse 



life is very lonely and tiring. All i want is for my friends to see me and put in the same effort as I do in our friendships. I have nobody now 


i‚Äôm also in a groupchat with all of them on snapchat and the new girl has been sending pics of her ‚Äúcool new room‚Äù all day with her new decorations. i know i am wrong to be bitter because i wasn‚Äôt entitled to that room, but it still hurts my soul",lonely,always the forgotten friend,2020-07-22 12:21:08

1076,BOTAdam,1595355035,11,"I wrote a detailed post and accidentally closed the tab.

I'll rewrite a part of it:

\-   never kissed a girl, never had a friend. I would say I'm average   physically (ugly face but tall, muscular, and well-dressed). 0 social   skills.

\- lonely and depressed   24M, grew up in an Arab family: parents came to the US when they were my   age and they made it. They expect me to follow their path.

\-   work and religion = meaning of life. No phone, no social networks, no   computer (only allowed to play offline videogames or work), and no  going  out from 15 to 18 because they found out I started dating a girl.

\-   shitty college life. First half of it depressed and hiding in my dorm.   The second half getting good grades, working out, running, traveling,   going to museums... but alone.

\-   got a beautiful girl in my bed once thanks to alcohol (I only drank  twice in my life). But got afraid  when I saw her half-naked. I was  clueless. We spent the night talking, I  apologized for being so distant  physically. At 6 am, she hugged me and  left.

\-  today, I have a good job, I  still do stuff alone. Btw, eating at a  restaurant alone is something  that everyone should try once. Same for  hiking. But it hurts everytime  I'm surrounded by couples (young, old,  middle-aged, everyone has someone  except me) or by groups of friends.

I   feel like it's too late to meet people. I'm 24, people my age had fun   in college and now they are focusing on their career/family/SO.

I'm   afraid to spend my life alone. I'm faking it everyday. From the   outside, I look nice, always smiling, living the good life, taking care   of himself.

When I'm at home I  try  to do stuff to forget about my loneliness. But today I can't. I  would  love to say fuck it and go abroad for a year. I could. Actually I   couldn't with the fucking coronavirus. But what's the point? I would   still be alone.

I don't even know  what I believe, I don't know if working/studying this hard was worth it.  I feel like my whole education was based on two principles that in a  way helped me get where I am today but also destroyed the human part of  me.

I'm just a machine, I make  money, I don't even spend it. I work to kill time. I believe in God but I  don't pray. I would love to but I unconsciously associate religion with  loneliness and sadness. My whole system of beliefs is fucked, was my  education a big lie?

Even on this  sub, I feel alone. Anyone here with a similar education? How did you get  out of the loneliness? I know how to talk to people, I can fake it and  appear outgoing but how the fuck do I maintain a relationship? How do  you know when it is ok to make physical contact? How do you hug? How do  you kiss? How do you have sex?

What is the meaning of life for you?

Is it too late? Is it worth focusing my energy on my career? Are relationships more important than money?",lonely,What is the point of living alone?,2020-07-22 04:10:35

 I always thought that if you can't change something(in this case , loneliness), you should try to make it your advantage (more free time) . 

I don't have friend too and I feel sometimes that I need one but I guess I just believe that I will be happier because other people with their friends look more satisfied with live and I envy to them. But if you have lived like 20 or more years lonely ,doesn't that mean that it is better for you to be alone?

1098,ncus1993,1595339723,3,"Well, I never thought I would make a post here. I like to read through these to help me know other people are going through what I am. It makes it feel a little bit less lonely in this world. So I guess I'll just jump into it, for the past six years or so I've been worse off than I was in high school. I met an individual at work who I quickly became work friends with, well I guess I should give a little more detail before this. 

In high school, I never gave real thought to finding that ‚Äùperson.‚Äù I was more of the type to keep my head down and just make it through the day. I had a few ‚Äùassociates‚Äù not friends in school, especially of the female variety. Jumping forward from this info to the day we started becoming outside of work friends. I remember it like it was yesterday when she invited me to run with her one day. Me thinking it's a group thing with a couple of other people asked who else would be there with her saying it could just be us. Talk about frozen in time for me like wait I'm sorry you're a girl, female, woman, and you want to hang out with me? Hmmm, okay, let's go! Kicked off from there, we have been hanging out together every chance we got to do something. 

Due to plenty of reasoning like being scared (of everything including rejection) and thinking I'm not enough or ever will be kept me from ever making that move to ask or placing that foot forward for a relationship with her. Obviously, with that last sentence, I put myself into the ‚Äùfriendzone.‚Äù Now seeing her with her boyfriend is a killer. I don't know for sure why I'm so fixated on her in particular I'm just assuming that she is the first woman that's given me the light of day, and I read too far into it without at least trying. I'm just so angry at myself for being this scared guy of what would seem like a simple question or step. 

It's like a seed has been planted for what I wish could be. This is a weird feeling for me going from a guy who never truly gave it a thought about finding ‚Äùthe one‚Äù to a guy that wants the bf/gf thing, but with her. Ever since meeting this woman, I've just been swimming in depression and anxiety, feeling I'm not enough and just being scared about everything, including ruining the friendship we have, let alone taking that step of asking to move into a dating/boyfriend status. 

So here I sit with a depressed filled mind wanting to walk off a cliff holding on to a string of friendship that‚Äôs left getting excited every time I get a text or call from her since she's with her boyfriend most to every day. I honestly don't know why I'm posting this, but I do know it does feel good just to say this and get it off my chest. I'm also part of the people in society that doesn't like to talk to people one on one I prefer the bottle up method of handling things. 

Thanks for listening/reading y'all! üòï

I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have some friends in my life, but I find myself pushing them away. I‚Äôll eagerly message them seeking some sort of contact and then not respond because it irrationally seems like a lot of effort or because I‚Äôm anxious.

I feel irrational flare ups of jealousy or envy a lot, especially when others appear to be in a good place and I‚Äôm struggling. I think in some ways as a teenager I defined myself by my success. Maybe in some sense I‚Äôm feeling that my identity is threatened. I‚Äôm at least self aware enough to notice and correct myself most of the time. I make sure the feelings don‚Äôt surface openly, but it nevertheless pushes me away from people.

I tend to also put myself in a negative spiral. If I‚Äôm feeling poorly, I tend to chastise myself for not trying to improve my mental state.

1121,Jewish-Magic,1595314338,1,"So, I just had a kind of realization that makes me nervous for my future. To start, I am an 18 year old male who is about to go to college in the nearest big city. I went to high school in a place where academics are the most important thing hands down, so relationships are kind of tricky as you spend a lot of time studying and doing other things related to your classes. I never really bothered to try because of that. So when high school got easier at the beginning of junior year, instead of pursuing a relationship with a girl that I liked, I worked out, started training in MMA, and just kind of wasted time. People started to associate my person with those traits without actually knowing me. And worst of all, because I didn‚Äôt discuss my issues or feelings with others, people started thinking I was a loner too.

So this kind of accumulated into me being the edgy, badass, loner kid (which I am not any of those). It was kind of nice for a while. People respected me because they assumed I had a high work ethic (which is true). And people generally didn‚Äôt try and start drama with me about stupid high school stuff. I just didn‚Äôt know that my image had become distorted from who I was

So, this all kind of came crashing down on me this year. I found out that people were intimidated by me. During bad weather on a senior field trip, someone who didn‚Äôt know me commented on how on strong I was mentally because I wasn‚Äôt scared of a storm. COVID hit and I lost connections with my more distant friends pretty much instantly. Even in my really close circle of friends, I feel myself being gradually pushed to the outside. 

I‚Äôm not having trouble dealing with this as far as keeping a stable mental health or avoiding depression or anything like that, and that has been a thing that I‚Äôve always been good at. The last two years have been very hard for my family with my mom getting sick and close relatives dying, but I have managed to take it in stride. Those events still make me sad from time to time, but I am able to get past it. 

I‚Äôm worried that when I go to college with new people, I‚Äôll fall into the same routine. I‚Äôll find people like me, and they‚Äôll accept me partially. I‚Äôll be content with that, and I‚Äôll isolate myself from getting a girlfriend or friends that really care about me without even knowing I did it. 

To summarize: I‚Äôm more alone than I have ever been, and I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll stay that way because I don‚Äôt really know any better. It also scares me that I‚Äôve already kind of accepted it, and it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. Because I have the mental strength to deal with isolation and stress without support, my brain defaults to that. And, I don‚Äôt really know what to do about it.",lonely,I am almost expected to be alone.,2020-07-21 16:52:18

Then I know that this is the helicopter type parenting that is unhealthy to even experience. But luckily I didn't broke like a twig and carried on.

Fast-forward when the pandemic lockdowns was starting to take place, my Dad's company didn't let their employees go to work because of the virus, but luckily he could work from home. Same for my mom but my mom worked at a bistro/restaurant that wher suspending the business because of the virus. So my Parents and I ""spent"" time together at home. And I mean spend because they were there but they didn't attempt to interact with me in an emotional level.

At late nights we watch on netflix together or who was left awake. But one night when we were done watching, it was time to go to bed but while I think that I could get away by watching a bit of youtube on the tv, but my dad was still on the sofa so he told me to put ""Michael Jackson without autotune""(important) on the search bar. But instead of putting ""without"", I simply put ""no autotune"" because it was to hard to type with a simple smart tv remote to save time. But my Dad noticed that I put no instead of without, so he insisted to put without, but I said why so I told him why. But in a way, that somehow got him a feeling of disrespect so he started to boil behind me while I was typing so. So then I turned around and asked him ""what's going on?"" 

Dad: You better shut up or I'm gonna hit you
Me: What?
Dad: Shut up
Me What is it?
Dad:*Stands up and tried to slap me in the head 5 times across the living room ending up on the bathroom door which my mom was inside

I sucessfully blocked all 5 attempts my Dad did

At this moment, I was cornered, stunned, leaning in to the sink.

My mom opened the door to see us having a standoff. My mom asked calmly: ""What's going on?""

To which my Dad replied

""This little bitch disrespected me so I hit the little bastard. You try to get him on his side?... You won't.

Fast forward a couple of months after that incident. I stoppee showing emotions ever since. Trying not to bond in an emtional way to my parents. My Dad was so toxic that he could shout across the room bullshitting me. Finally my Mom got sick of it and finally asked what really happend.

Dad: I don't remember.
Mom:And what about you?

I forgot and was dumbfounded and went:

""I was explaining why netflix and youtube are different.""

So my Mom got a hell of a lecture to Dad and Me but Dad's part was pleasuring to watch because it finally made him realized on why he isn't always right and shut down he's ego.

And now, on Modified Community Quarantine on my area, my Dad went on work for weekdays and my mom started an online shop. My mom would show at me because I did something wrong again or simply because they thought it was normal to shout at me. But that shit... fucking pressures me everytime because they would lecture me like it was the end of the world. And I would cry silently in the shower mostly everytime (still now). I wish I didn't get this kind of parents. I have had numerous sucidal thoughts. But the only thing that was saving me is my dreams for my future. If they only knew what I was going through then they'll fucking watch theire mouth. I get lonely because I never got the feeling of having a sibling or having childhood friends because they all moved abroad, leaving me and my small branch of friends from school.

If you know how to deal with life with these parents, please let me know.

1133,fu11meta1_111,1595308126,3,"Hi All, this is my first time posting here so please be gentle.

Also this post is going to be super long.

I don't have anyone to share my feelings with so I thought I share it with you guys, i don't think what I feel is not as extreme as other here but I thought sharing with you might make me feel better.

I have always been introvert, maybe because from the time i was a child my parents used to travel to different cities so never got a chance to make any good friends. But when I was in first year of college (2012) I made friends with few and i thought i was close with them but I realized they don't feel same about me when I got to know what they speak when I'm not around, from then i never got myself to make any good friends (Maybe because I was not brave enough). Now it was second year of college and my parents had to move city again so I moved into collage hostel, I made few friends (Selected few who I used to play some games with but not close enough to me) and it was going good. During semester holidays I decided to spend time with my parents, there in that city I met a girl who was in first year of her college and was in same course as me, we exchanged numbers and started chatting on regular basis. I never really had any female friends leave alone girlfriend so I started feeling attached to her and by end of second year of my college we were spending most of the time chatting with each other. After the end of second year of college I decided to go to my parents again, I met her and first time ever I decided to feel brave and confessed that I love her (I‚Äôm not sure if that was really love but at that time I felt that was the right thing) to my surprise she accepted but on a condition that we don‚Äôt get intimate with each other until we decide to marry and get married because of her religious faith (I was Atheist, my parents were Hindus and she was Muslim) and remaining time in college flew by with no much change. Though I didn‚Äôt have any close friends in college, at least I had people to hangout with and play some games.

It was 2016 and I was out of college, I managed to land a job immediately after graduation but it was a 6 month contract job, to become a full time employee I need to prove myself to my manager. My family was not great financially so this job means a lot to me, I started working hard I didn‚Äôt care about how much I was taking hit on my health, I continued to work extended shifts and beyond my scope and by this time I was no longer in contact with anyone from college. By the end of 6months contract I was allowed to work on new project and I was converted to a full time employee and I thought it was about time I speak with my girlfriend about our future. So I decided to take couple of days off from work and went to her city, we met for lunch, I spoke about my work and her college some regular stuff. After lunch I asked her what is her plan for future and marriage, that when things turned upside-down, she was ready to marry me after her graduation but, I had to convert into Muslim for her to marry her, I was in disbelief because we had this discussion before when I was in college and agreed that she can continue to be a Muslim even after marriage and I will continue to have my own beliefs. When she asked me to convert I was not able to accept her request mainly because I have a different view on religion and I can‚Äôt go against my belief and pretend to be a Muslim. After a long argument she decided to breakup with me I went back to my place with anger, next day when I was holding my phone in my hand and realize I was no longer going to get any message from person I have been in relationship for 3 years. I was feeling devastated, I no longer had anyone to share how I feel, I was feeling void and I was not sure how to fill that void so I started spending my time on work again.

I was working on new project so I started spending lot on time on project to keep myself occupied. Weekday routine was waking up, going to office, come back home and go to sleep, on weekend wake up late, do my chores, do random stuff and sleep. I thought I was happy but all I was doing was keeping myself occupied to avoid confronting my feelings. During 2017 Christmas peak, my company decided to send me and couple of my colleagues to Europe headquarters (Luxembourg) to work for couple of months. It was my first time going abroad so it was something special for me, but as it was a new program we had to work mad hours (literally 12-15hrs a day) nonstop without any week offs for couple of months but I managed to make friends with guys who traveled with me. After we came back we got promoted to program managers, it was a huge change for me, as I will be a program manager I will have to speak with lot of stakeholders so I had to come out of my bubble and improve how I speak with others. I worked hard to improve myself and became comfortable with speaking to others. I thought I will be able to socialize with others and tried to go out party with office colleagues but all I managed to speak about was work and nothing else, I didn‚Äôt even know what to speak about and I was sitting silent almost all of my time when I go out with others. Nothing changed in my life, I continued to work like a robot and this year I got a promotion again. I thought I will be happy but I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm in a better position in my career and I worked hard for it but it is not making me happy anymore. When I look back in my life I have achieved absolutely nothing, I have no friends who are close to me and share my feelings with, I‚Äôm 25, have not done anything in my life except for working and I no longer know what to do. Sometimes I feel like to hug someone and cry to relieve myself, I‚Äôm feeling a fear inside me that I might not be able to do come out of this circle of loneliness.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a right choice but I have decided to move to Luxembourg to start a new life, I hope this will help me to change myself and become a better person.",lonely,Making a big move in my life,2020-07-21 15:08:46

Work stress breaking me down, stress in regards to feelings for a friend, and overall hatred for myself.

I'm on medication and have a therapist. The issue with my friend creates a situation that makes me realize how lonely I am.

Its always the same for me. Work, gym, hangout with friends (if available), home. I've always been pretty content with this but my realization and low self-esteem have been taking a toll on me.

Despite having friends and family, I'm lonely. I don't REALLY connect with any of them. I don't like to talk about my problems with them.

I know most people will say to get more hobbies or join group activities, or try online dating. I don't seem to have much interest in other hobbies and online dating is absolutely terrible.

I don't like bars or clubs and I'm not a drinker, they don't appeal to me. I'm mostly content with being home. This leaves me with lonliness and no clear path out. Also, I live in and around moderately sized towns, no big cities so I feel options are limited.

1156,grover997,1595296182,0,"In the past 12 months I have done all I can to find ways to rebuild a support network around me. So much has been written on loneliness and social isolation, and none of it is positive. It is an enormous, and growing, health problem. We have hugely increased risks of cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes. One study showed that the stress from prolonged social isolation is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and with the physical decline comes the mental decline. Without close connections humans don‚Äôt have the feedback necessary to maintain personality traits and thought processes needed to function well in society. This is why most people find someone who has been on their own a long time to be a little, well umm, odd.
I don‚Äôt want that to happen to me, and I don‚Äôt want my son exposed to it either. I have always been a strong, excited, motivated person but I have felt that slip away quite quickly.

1157,goodnight_to_you,1595294341,3,"Looking back, I was never close to anybody. It seemed like the friends I made would slowly fade away as my life depends on school. Without school there is no me. Nobody would know me because I am only me at school. But I wasn't popular or anything. School was just my only source to talk to someone. I was like a background character and only spoke to people that were in the same classes as me. There was no means for me to talk to anybody after school and because of that, I'm very nomadic with my friends. If we didn't have a class together next year then we probably won't speak ever again.

When I got social media 2 years ago, I was kinda happy. I imagined myself being apart of people's lives and stories. I imagined the fun we would have when someone would text me to hang out or we would just text and talk often. I felt like I finally had someone to talk to both in and out of school. 

It never really was like that. It seemed like everybody was busy and nobody responded to me until like 16 hours later. Responding really late seemed like the cool thing to do online. Or maybe it could have been that they weren't really comfortable with me and they just wanted to avoid texting me. How do you talk to a person you barely knew? In person is already weird enough. In text and phone would be even weirder. That's usually reserved for your close friends. I've became the homework guy that people would text whenever they wanted to copy something. Of course I would always send pictures of my work as that was my only interaction with people outside of the school. This was my relationship with everyone.  

There wasn't any difference in my life at all. I'm still the same do nothing all day guy. It's so weird because I have the power to stay in touch with others but it seems like nobody really wants to talk. It seems like I've been sitting in the sidelines for so long that nobody is interested in me. I wasn't around when people were becoming close friends and making their own group/squad to hangout with. I've always went straight home after school and I never really got invited to anything. I never had anything to invite people to either. As of right now it seems like it's too late for me to join any groups. We're not kids anymore and it seems like it becomes harder to make new friends the older you get.  

While having social media I started going outside more often. Without any sports to play or anything to do, I ended up walking around to random locations or sitting in the bench at the park. For hours I'd always talk to myself as if someone was there. To me that was great practice for when someone would actually be there. At school I would still freeze up and stutter sometimes. Things like ""hey what's up"" would become ""hewatsp"" and I would struggle to find a topic to talk about. I'd often rely on a third person to keep the conversation going. 

My Instagram and snap chat are just dead. I don't post anymore and I watch people's stories but never respond to anything they post. Why should I? It's either left on delivered or opened. Even though I try to be a ""quirky"" guy both online and in school, I could never shake off that feeling because that it isn't me. A lot of these personality traits that I would use were picked up from other people. I do it because I want to be more like those charismatic dudes who always seemed to make everyone happy. Everybody wants to be around them. I want to give off that kind of vibe too. But that isn't me.  I just don't want to be a guy with just a face. But that didn't work out for me and I'm still alone with nobody to talk to.

I feel like I am truly alone now because high school is now over and I'm going to a college with nobody I recognize. Also the lock down makes it so that I can't meet people face to face. Now I'm truly locked into a state of loneliness.  It really bugs me because I feel like I'm just a quiet kid that doesn't know how to be friends with anyone. 

So that's my story. I kinda suck at explaining things and writing about multiple things at once so if you want to know anything specific just let me know and I'll try my best.

I'm not terrible at attracting partners, although I do deal with pretty bad insecurity issues. I've had multiple relationships throughout my life, one of which lasted about five years. 

After my last relationship I've realized that I'm the problem most of the time. I have emotional issues that I need to deal with before I can have a healthy relationship with someone else. So since then I've kind of purposefully self sabotaged or avoided potential partners because I'm afraid it will end with me hurting them.

1213,cassie_to_heart,1595245791,5," I can't help in maintaining a stable relationship because deep down... I am unsure of where my life would take me. To pursue a stable, modest career in nursing or to have a relationship ultimately matter over career ambitions... in all honesty, I am just living through life day-by-day. Ever closer to finishing my degree yet knowing that I lack the drive... the motivation right now... and yet, I want to experience the lifestyle of being a housewife. I'd remain indecisive... and I'd find that I swing in one direction more times than I could count.

I inadvertently dismiss the most basic desires for my partner in terms of privacy, finding myself with the propensity to overshare... and I violated the boundaries of the person I love the most in my life because I loved the feeling in feeling prideful and happy for my partner... often feeling that I would want to show people who've hurt me that I have someone who was willing to look past, out of spite. After all, he was the bright glimmer in my life and I would let a relationship define me easily.

I'm gravely inexperienced, and immature in that I seem to be miles behind other people in terms of relationship experience and I feel like I'm seemingly incapable of learning and understanding the most basic tenets of having one.

I push people away whom I feel easily offended me...directly or indirectly. And I have no one... absolutely no one to rely on. They have their own friendship circles and I've burned some bridges with an ex-friend who told me: ""I was too f\*cked in the head"" causing me already to deepen my distrust with women.

I put too much focus on pleasing other people like my friends who I gave so much power to influence my relationships, and my desires for their support.

I feel like I inherited these traits from my narcissistic mother whom I resent very much because she's emotionally dependent and despite my oath that I'll never be like her... turns out the opposite actually.

And on that last note, I seem incapable of forming friendships because of my highly specific interests/hobbies which are law enforcement and military-oriented.... even though I consider myself a liberal and a very feminine woman. It got to the point where the only people I could connect with, due to my past experiences and my tendency to relate to men in specific backgrounds, are only first responders/LEOs/EMTs/firefighters/military (current or former). I can relate so little to people my age... in the civilian world.  

That being said, I honestly don't have anyone else to talk to, and nearly all my life, I feel invincible apart from the person who took a leap of faith to make the choice of loving me... and somehow, I feel I betrayed that. I feel undeserving of it. I don't feel like an intelligent woman...just some broad who couldn't keep her mouth shut because she doesn't have much trustworthy people to share things with.

It's come to a point where I really don't trust myself anymore. And it hurts in that my partner has made so much effort trying to build me up, in that I feel I'm letting him down even further. I let myself down and I don't see a way how I can be confident in myself.

I can love. I have the capacity to love, I want to be the nurturing, maternal figure in a man's life and yet I am a frakking screw up because I can't give enough. I can only give so much, especially in my circumstances in life, where I feel like I'm in the proverbial prison. 

And people tell me to love yourself... screw them. Screw you if you think that, giving false bs like snake oil salesmen. Because it took my partner to help me put the pieces together, and now they're close to falling apart. So frak you if you're them...

1214,Grouchy_Fauci,1595244419,7,"I connected with someone on a dating app recently and we actually clicked. She seems really cool and she actually said she wants to get to know me. I was really excited. We had a good back and forth on the dating app, then we exchanged numbers and talked on the phone. Great conversation, we both seemed to enjoy it and it flowed pretty well.

At the end of the call, I asked her on a date and she said yes. We were supposed to go out this past weekend, and exchanged texts about it on Friday after work. I was going to call her Saturday to chat for a while and work out the details for a date on Sunday. But then Saturday rolls around, and she ghosted me. She just stopped responding to my texts for god knows what reason. 

Just 12 hours earlier and she was expressing interest and looking forward to a date, and then nothing. Just disappears. I texted her a couple of times to check in, at first worried that something happened to her, but now it's clear she just ghosted me. 

Why?  What changed between Friday night and Saturday morning that she went from being into me and excited about a date to ignoring me and not even having the common courtesy to respond? Why not just let me know that she changed her mind or whatever the case may be? Why can't people be honest and straight with each other?

This kind of shit is cruel and unnecessary. She could have just texted and said that she's having second thoughts or she's just not feeling it anymore or whatever. But to just ghost people like that is fucked up. It leaves people wondering and it creates confusion and mistrust.

- 21 year old male
- In a good relationship
- Just finished university.

I'm not the best at explaining my feelings but since i was young i've really struggled to make friends and maintain relationships.
Unlike many stories i have read here, i don't personally struggle with women particularly (i'm not trying to sound like a douchebag), but i find that no matter what i have done in life, no matter how many women i've been with, conversations i've had etc i'm just chronically lonely and deeply, deeply depressed.
I feel like there is a pane of glass between me and the world, a filter almost.
I don't have a friendship circle, and i have always struggled to find my place im a group.

If any of you have watched the Sopranos before i have many similarities personality wise to Tony Soprano: 

Seemingly confident,
Ability to talk comfortably with almost anyone,
Assertive,
Leadership qualities.
Deeply flawed
Depressed
Feeling as though the people close to me arent there out of love.

I'm just at a point in life where i feel like the ""young"" stage where i can be dumb and make mistakes and go to parties etc is done, and i never did any of it.
It hurts do bad.

Anyway i'm probably rambling, just wondering if anybody can relate to my situation.

21 year old male
Doesn't struggle with women

I don't like the attention so I try as hard as I can to stay low key but now I have a gnawing feeling in my stomach and I don't know what it is. Anyways I feel like an asshole all the time since my parents are nothing but loving and I just get so frustrated when they try to talk to me. I don't get along with my brother because he could be doing so much better than he is and again, it frustrates me. I hate how I treat my family but I can't help it and before I get comments bashing me on how terrible of a person I am, I already know and I don't know why I do this.

I'm from a middle class family and I go to a decent college and don't have to worry about money and I'm genuinely so grateful. But honestly I  can't help but feel nothing inside me. I know what I'm saying is so privileged and I don't have the right to feel like this but I can't help it. I have maybe 2 good friends but I've gone through a lot of painful stuff in the past. I try to show such a positive and quite frankly, air-headed, demeanor and try to be fun because I like it when others have fun. Yet I've had people judge me negatively and I can tell in their eyes that they think I'm purely just another dumb girl. I'm more of the ""leftover"" friend who won't be missed when I leave, and unfortunately I know this from a really painful experience.

I met a girl at a party, she was drunk, I was too... We made out but the thing is that we stayed together for awhile until she went home. 

The day after, we were supposed to meet with a friend of her (she herself was meeting someone), like a double date or something I guess? Anyway, I was tired, and told her at the last minute I couldn't... I waited few hours, and texted her, to say I'm sorry, and try to have a conversation or something... Of course, there was blanks, and I ended up with ""let's talk another day if you want"", she answered suree but that was it.

The more time went by, the more I wanted to text her something, at least to know if I was overthinking it or something. But the more I waited, the more it became difficult to send a first text (I mean, shit happened already 2 weeks ago).

BUT DRUNK ME DECIDED SOMETHING ELSE, texted her at 2am, and we kept talking for like 3-4 days straight, I wasn't in town, and told her like ""let's hang out once I'm back or smthn"", she said yes, and yesterday we went to the beach together with two friends (her girl bestfriend, and my boy bestfriend, who knew each other, and were how we first met). There still was some blanks, but at some point things just started going smoothly, and I like how her bestfriend (whom I don't know btw, like I talked to her twice or thrice, but that was it.) asked me whenever she wasn't around ""So?

1278,HowDareYouBubbleSort,1595199664,10,"You've been eager to expand your social circle for a while. Finally, a new person from work or school invites you to hang out. You meet at a bar or restaurant and immediately hit it off. They share all your interests, love all your stories, and laugh at all your jokes. By the time you finish your meal, you've made a new best friend.

I've entertained this fantasy before, but as you probably know, acquaintances in real life don't always click right away. Sometimes I've felt disappointed when the conversation with new friends doesn't flow or they don't invite me to hang out again. Luckily, there's hope for those of us who feel discouraged in this way. It's called the [Mere-exposure Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect):

&gt;The **mere-exposure effect** is a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them...In studies of interpersonal attraction, the more often someone sees a person, the more pleasing and likable they find that person.

After stumbling upon this concept, I started seeing if I could apply the Mere-exposure Effect to my own social life. If I went to the first meeting of a social group (a Meetup, for example) and didn't hit it off with anyone, I would make a point of still going back a few more times. I started to find myself developing stronger relationships through sheer familiarity. (""Hey, it's Bill from last week who I sort of  talked to!"")

\--

**My suggestion**: If you feel like you don't fit into a new friend group, maybe experiment with going back anyway to make yourself familiar to them. Research suggests that familiarity will work in your favor.

With therapy, my depression got better and I learned that it was ok for me to cry. Recently my depression worsened again and I feel so lonely all the time that it physically hurts. I‚Äòve been crying pretty much every day for the past months...great new skill that I acquired.

Being lonely sucks, I feel like I opened the box of pandora with all those feelings and tears. I wish I could go back to the days I was numb...or even better, the days where I was happy. 

It now even affects my coping mechanisms...

I've talked to my therapist about it and she asked if I could find online penpals ? People who just want to talk about each other, nothing more. I really loved that idea but I know online app can be a bit... Random ?

It took me a good week to make up my mind and today I was in a good mood so I found a website that ONLY do penpals. It took me 30 minutes to write my profile about who I was and what I wanted to talk about and then... I started to look at other profiles.

People my age only had description like ""I'm bored just here to hook up"" and older people where like ""I'm looking for for a wife"". OK.

Whenever I see couples I always become extremely jealous and when anyone mentioned their SO I die a little inside. It has also made me become a rather hateful person towards couples as well (something I don't want!) This seems like an overreaction, I know, but I've always been alone and never had intimacy so there's probably some deep issues there.

I see a therapist who I get on really well with - I value her a lot and would be really lost without her. I've had this same issue for years now and it's just eating away at me, and we both agree I always go in circles and come back to this.

I feel a lot of pressure (from myself) due to my inexperience, and I feel really behind and immature due to it as well.

Problem is, I'm not sure if I want to be in a relationship. I've got a lot of issues and I find people very overwhelming at times (especially being an introvert). Also not to mentioned online dating is really soul destroying. There is a lot of stuff I wanna work towards too.

1328,crazydaisy8134,1595146858,3,"I (25F) was born to be lonely. Sometimes I'm fine with it, but other times it makes my chest hurt to think about it. I just need to vent about recent events somewhere because, being lonely, I have absolutely no one to talk to about this. It's ok if no one reads this, it just makes me feel better to pretend I have an audience.

Anyway, I had a hard time making friends ever since moving to a new neighborhood at the age of 11, and all through junior high and high school I barely had any friends, and the couple that I managed to have were terrible friends. My dad also left during my senior year of high school which made me even more isolated and lonely. Since graduating, the only boyfriend I have had was when I was 20 just for a few months, and ever since then I haven't dated anyone for longer than a couple months, and I only really have one friend who I haven't seen in months due to Covid anyway. 

Back in April, a coworker (Matt) and I decided to become friends with benefits. Both of us were lonely and wanted physical attention. This lasted until last week. We became really good friends, but he began to fall in love with me. Although I could tell that he was starting to like me more, I didn't realize the extent of it. We had agreed from the beginning to just remain friends, and that if either of us did get into a relationship with someone else then it would end.

Anyway, at the beginning of June a guy from high school who I haven't seen since graduation started messaging me. I told Matt about it because we had agreed to be transparent, but he told me he didn't want to hear about it because it made him sad. During the fourth of July weekend when I visited home, I hung out with high school boy (Trey) twice and we kissed and went skinny dipping and had a fun time. When I came home on Monday and hung out with Matt, I told him about Trey and said that we should take a step back from the benefits part since I had kissed Trey and didn't know if it would go anywhere but if it did I didn't want to be with two guys at once.

Matt didn't take it very well. He decided that he would rather we just didn't see each other anymore instead of only remaining friends. I didn't realize how deeply he had started to love me, and frankly I think I just didn't want to see it and was too stupid to end the friends with benefits situation a lot earlier. So we amicably (I thought) decided to end things, even though I didn't know if things with Trey would even go anywhere. Later Matt texted me to let me know I'd broken his heart and that he had thought someone finally loved him but he was wrong and I never cared. 

The more I messaged Trey the more I realized that he probably wasn't into me anymore. He finally confirmed earlier today that he is now messaging another girl. I was sad because I had liked this guy since junior high and I had really hoped that something might actually come out of this. This, coupled with the fact that I am no longer friends with Matt, puts me back to square one with having no friends anymore. I recently got a new job so I don't see Matt anymore.

I've spent all day thinking about how lonely I am. My dad has his new family, my youngest sibling lives with my mom and has all of her friends, and my other siblings each have their spouses. It's just me who's been on my own all these years.

I live with two other girls, and one of them is starting to scare me. Late at night I can hear her yelling in her room. Last night I heard a noise that spooked my cat so I went into the living room and could hear her in her room yelling, ""Crazy bitch! Crazy bitch!"" at 2am. My other roommate has expressed concerns as well. This is combined with other weird behavior she has been exhibiting, and so tonight I was laying in my room listening to my roommate laugh like a maniac and clap from her bedroom at 1am and feeling trapped in my room because I was too afraid to leave. I tried texting my parents and siblings but no one was awake, so as a last effort I texted Matt to tell him what's going on. He was nice and talked to me about it, but then after I told him I was feeling better he then went off about how me texting him when I didn't NEED him was hard on him and how I shouldn't be texting him.

Every time Matt texts me I just feel attacked and like everything's my fault. Maybe it is. So I just texted him that I'm sorry for bothering him. But then he sends another long text later saying he's sick of my communication. I feel like I'm in high school dealing with an over-emotional 16-year-old I broke up with instead of an adult I thought was my friend. 

Anyway, my relationship with Matt is over. My relationship with Trey was never going to turn into anything anyway. Ever since my dad left I have struggled to love, so I doubt that I'll ever be able to love someone anyway. The one good thing I thought I had ended in a disaster, and my one glimmer of hope with Trey ended before it could begin. I've come to terms multiple times in the past with being alone, but it sucks to have to start the process over of coming to terms with it. 

As an aside, if anyone at all read this, was it a bad idea to start the friends with benefits with Matt? I probably wouldn't have started it if I knew it would end like this, even though we had really great times together. It was never my intention to break his heart, but I thought we had been honest with each other about our expectations before this all began.",lonely,"Forever alone, and a friends with benefits relationship just reinforced that",2020-07-19 18:20:58

We got to ‚Äú2nd base‚Äù or whatever you want to call it before realising we weren‚Äôt gonna be THAT couple that gets caught fucking like rabbits in public so we just kept talking n holding eachother as we cruised the town. Eventually my mates are ready to head home so we offer her a ride which she accepts. We get to her house shes about to get out when she turns around and gives me another phat kiss right in front of all hers and my friends. Now for whatever reason I kissed her back, looked at her blankly and smiled. She stared back at me for a while smiling then just kinda awkwardly chuckled and jumped out the car shut the door and that was it. 

I. Fucked. Up.     I knew it, my friends knew it and no doubt she did too üò´

The message I get from her the next day made my heart skip a beat only to see it was plain and simple. ‚ÄúThanks for staying with me last night, really appreciate it ü§ó‚Äù I replied something along the lines of ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt mind at all, if anything you were making me look good, glad you got home ok‚Äù which was 100% the case ü§£ 


-Seen-

This sucks so bad, shes the kind of person who makes me feel better about myself, I honestly feel I would be a better person within myself if I had the pleasure of spending more time with her. 

Im not going to message her trying to start a convo as im sure she gets plenty of those messages already and I dont want to come across as another seedy guy in town and start harassing the poor girl.  if she was keen im sure she would send another msg. It just hurts having such an intimate experience with someone of her class (honestly boys Id like to give myself a 5-6/10 if im being generous. Im telling you there is no number I know of that can justify how beautiful she is both physically and in spirit. 

I know this feeling will pass, hopefully sooner rather than later. I just wish I played my cards differently. Regardless of how long I‚Äôve known her it felt right. I literally wanted to scoop her up jump in a taxi and give her the world. Im scared I blew it. Girls like her don‚Äôt come around everyday, not for guys like me anyway. I feel so broken even tho there was no real foundation for our connection to stand on other than booze and drugs üôÑ, sure I knew of her as she was a few years older than me back in college and what not but yeah, I find myself going back into her messages hoping to see her typing or maybe she sent me a message and it just didn‚Äôt pop up and even just scrolling down her IG in absolute awe that a person like her exists in the same world as me.  

I knew it was far to good to be true. Yet even now im still trying to think of all the best case scenarios on how it could still work out, all the while trying my best to delete her and the memories from my head. 

Probably not much advice to give, just needed to vent. If you took the time to read then cheers, have a good rest of ya dayü§òüèº",lonely,Im feeling lost and honestly I just want to be able to give someone the world.,2020-07-19 16:25:23

I should also add, my SO has noticed how quiet I am and has asked me to make more of an effort in getting to know his friends. He acknowledges my social anxiety and is understanding but understandably, wants me to work on this too.

Me and my girlfriend of 5 years have recently ended our relationship. She was the one that ended due to my lack of attention and relationship maintenance. She recently started a new job and was meeting new people that were providing her that attention, she is currently talking to some other guys. At the start I felt devastated, I still do. Sleepless nights, constant anxiety, and crying but as time passes by I have been learning to deal with my emotions through meditation and also are in the process of detaching myself by focusing my energy in myself. It is often the case that during this situations we feel some type of ownership , we are reliant on the attachment and one that is taken away from us, we just become desperate. I want to let you know that if you feel this type of way , you need to understand that the breakup happened for a reason and you need to detach yourself and break the energy of the relationship in order to gather yourself and start working on yourself, your goals and your well being. If you really truly loved that person, you need to let go. It is when you totally detach yourself and are a better person for your s/o when you can then clarify your intentions. If she comes back, then so be it, take that chance and make it a lifetime. If she doesn‚Äôt then you at least have you and what you have been working on.

I would choose a life of a tree who can't feel loneliness over my life, where I don't want to face another night again. I read a post on the subreddit, with the title, some people being born to be lonely. 

I'm sure everyone, even people outside this Reddit, must have felt it atleast once in their life. Some people can be fine without actually having no social circle. While some people can be in terrible pain every night despite having a decent social circle. 

I have a loving mother, a brother and a friend who cares. I shouldn't be feeling lonely, right? 
As a 20 year old all I need right now is someone to sleep with. Someone to share my pain with. I really just need someone to sleep with so I can not fight the curse of loneliness alone. Someone to cuddle or if I'm asking for too much, someone to share a room with.

I don't think I would hesitate for a second if I had a gun in my house. I don't hesitate at all when it comes to these things. I wouldn't hesitate to jump from a cliff. If I want to do it, I would do it. I am deeply scared. If someone outs me at a cliff at a time when I get these panic attacks and loneliness waves, I would end up taking my life.

For my age I haven't really experienced much, my friends from school drifted apart to the point where we may speak a couple of times throughout the year. At this point I don't really consider them friend's.. more like someone I used to know. It was hard sometimes listening to them talk about what they are doing now as well as what it was like in school because I was servery bullied (mentally) and by them just mentioning anything to do with my old school triggers flashbacks. That's why now I try to avoid any link ups with them because of the after effect as I don't wanna be the one to tell them not to mention anything to do with school if I'm their. I only have 1 friend who I actually speak to on a regular basis but I find myself in a constant state of depression because I rarely go out my house other than to work or go to the gym and I just find my life slipping away. My depression deepens in the summer like now because I can hear people outside my house having fun while I'm trapped indoors with nothing much to do. I've only made 1 real friend after secondary school and thats mainly because of the fact that I didn't go to a sixth form, I went to a college when I was 16 and was with people I could not relate to but don't get me wrong most of them where decent but much older than me. Then when I done a second course their was under 10 people in the class which made making friends even harder so I'm now a 22 graduate with only 1 real friend and I feel like I ain't gonna make anymore.",lonely,Feel like ending it all,2020-07-19 07:23:04

1406,Ill-Wishbone559,1595099708,6,"My mom died when I was 5 years old. My father remarried a psycho cunt less than a year later, he's very old school, would never live with a woman, had to be marriage. He rushed it, he was totally freaked out having 3 babies and a wife who just died. She had been abused in a previous marriage and was basically living off her parents at the time.  It was basically the Brady bunch from hell, my father had 3, she had 3 kids. We had 8 people living under one roof for at least the first 6 years. 

Like all these blended families, most of the time it does not work and it did not here. My siblings and I suffered years of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of my father's second wife. For context I will give you 1 example of her cruelty to give you an idea of what she's like. 

Around 8/9 years old, I was developing a lot of constipation from being anxious all the time at home, and when I couldn't hold it any longer I would have an accident in my pants. I was so nervous and depressed at this age I could't wipe or use the bathroom correctly. So after one accident, I tried to hide it in a pile of laundry. She found the soiled underwear, went to my room as I had already gone to bed for the night (school night), stuck the underwear in my face and pulled me out of bed and dragged me downstairs to go scrub the underwear in a slop sink.  

My siblings actually suffered more abuse than I did from her. We would tell my father, and his response was I have to go to work in the morning I can't be dealing with this shit. He was in denial a long time until he became the abuser.

Out of my siblings I was the oldest, and by far the one that hardest time adjusting to not only the death of my mom, but these 4 new people living in my house.

About a month after the wedding and move in, the woman I was now to call ""Mom"" put her hands on me for the first time. She really frightened me, I was 6 at the time, so I stopped talking to her. That was 1990, and we still don't talk. That day basically a month into living together, would define our relationship or lack thereof for decades to come. 

As the relationship between my father's wife and I got worse, so did the relationship between my father and I.  After my mom died, I really clung to my Dad as my only living parent. She resented that. I remember after a summer weekend her family would come to visit, with me sitting right there, she would tell a cousin of her's that I was up my father's butt the whole weekend. I was probably 7 around this time. But the angrier she got at having to raise my Dad's 3 kids, the angrier he became at me until it became physical. He had reached all he could handle in the stress of his marriage, he needed a punching bag. 

So we turned the corner, from being my surviving parent the man I wanted to be around most, to the man I was most terrified of. 

1 example of his rage. I struggled a lot with math as a kid, I was in special ed. Often, homework that I could not finish by bed the night before, would have to be done in place of breakfast. I remember it was school picture day and I was in a suit. I was at the kitchen table staring at long division I could not remember the steps for. As am staring at these math problems I can't figure out, I get struck from behind. My father hit me so hard against the side of my face I had his handprint on my face. He hit me so hard that I had lost hearing in 1 ear for about 3 hours. I went to school crying. I told my teacher what happened and begged her not to tell the principal, word never got back to him that I told the teacher what happen. 

The anxiety attacks of just being around her got worse and worse, I retreated to my bedroom for what has seemed like years where I would just try to cope with the fear and anxiety.  

By the time I was 13, I was thinking about suicide and or killing her daily. I knew I needed to get out of there. At 13 years old, I asked for high school that I be allowed to go away to boarding school, between the situation in the house and his ability to afford it, my Dad sent me.

Some how, even being away from home, the relationship between my father and I continued to deteriorate during the boarding school years. 

By the time I came home from boarding school and started college, I was no longer compelled so I stopped going to ""family"" events. Last family event I went to for her was her father's funeral like a month after 9/11.   After they got married, about 90% of all ""family"" events were her family, so with how awful the relationship with her and I was, I was never fully at ease or accepted by her family. Most of my Mom's and Dad's families have died off. My siblings are equally as jaded as I am about our father's wife, but they seemed to have needed my Dad more than I did so they were never able to fully separate from the toxicity, though now they spend the holidays with their significant others quite often.  

Just under 2 decades after running away from the toxicity of my family situation, it's hitting me like a ton of bricks that I've spent nearly the past 20 years completely alone. I start tearing up when I think about how this hermit like existence has gotten so much worse between 2010-2020. Ten years ago I started getting pets. Without my pups, I literally could go years without ever hugging or kissing another living being. My dogs are the only day to day family I have. It's been really hard trying to get close to anyone. 

I was closeted for most of undergrad, so I was already tied up in my head. Trying to cope with my orientation as well as my family situation, I totally missed out on that youthful experience.  Undergrad/Grad school was very much a commuter experience, so I did not pickup any life long friendships there. I very much regret this. 

Being gay is lonely.

I've picked up and moved around the USA several times for work.  But really 'home"" or on the other side of the country where I am working now, I'm alone. I've lived in my current town for 7 years and the only person I know is the check out lady at the local CVS where I shop because she loves when I bring my dog in. I don't have work friends I socialize with. The friends I grew up with are scattered around the country.  

For years, when I come home for the weekend, I know I'm alone again. The peace I desperately wanted as a kid at home, I have now, except that peace comes with haunting silence and loneliness. I'm at that point in my 30s where my friends have  moved on with their lives, quite often with marriage and children, so there's a good chance I won't be able to get a friend on the phone over the weekend.

I often think to myself this is what it must be like to be one of those old people who outlives everyone. I really identify with the old people who tell me they are ready to die, they've lived their life, they are lonely. In a lot of ways, it feels like I've already had my life and now it's just the waiting around for it to be over.  

Can anyone else relate to being nearly completely a lone at such a young age?",lonely,"In my 30's, I hear the silence......",2020-07-19 05:15:08

There is nothing called ""love life"" for me. Everytime I try to open up to someone with my feelings, it all comes crashing down from there on ahead. All I've ever faced is rejection. I've tried various ways to express myself.. my feelings, my care.. but when they know that it's not just a friendly thing, almost all of them run away. One of them actually still stayed and was my best friend. She has a boyfriend so I cannot express anything which kills me inside. Seeing her pretty face reminds me of my feelings, which I need to hide and that destroys my mental state. I've gone into depression and she knew it. So, seeing me hiding my feelings and acting weird like this.. she got upset. I told her every single thing but she still wouldn't understand my pain. She has her own issues and expected me to ask her what's going on and help her. But how can I help build someone when I myself am broken?
So she left.. has the same boyfriend and a new bestfriend.
Well, I'm still the same empty person. Although, I've realised that I can't fill this void alone and I've accepted it. I can live my life like this as I'm coming to terms with the status quo. I have no hope left for my ""romantic future"" and I'm ready to give up now.
Conclusion: If there are other empty worthless folks like me.. don't worry.. you're not alone in this.. we all struggle in a similar way and lay down here beaten and numbed by the rampaging emotions of this life.

I googled a podcast for loneliness and found this episode by the artofmanliness called "" **Podcast #618: Finding Connection in a Lonely World** "". I thought, sure I'll listen to it, I would do anything to find some social connection in the world right now.

*""We‚Äôve all been there: you‚Äôre sitting¬†at home some evening and you don‚Äôt have plans, you haven‚Äôt heard from family or friends for awhile, and you‚Äôve got things on your mind, but don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs anyone you can talk to about them.

I just had a dream in which I was back at school.
There were soooo many students who knew me, I talked to a lot of them and had fun with them. This felt soooo amazingly good.
And then there was this group of four... we spent so much time together and they were sooo thankful for everything i contributed to the group... we had such good talks, played really funny games and laughed the whole time...

Then I woke up as a 22 years-old, not having even one, just one friend or person that I would call something like a friend...
Now I feel soooo bad about it. I don't know if I'm the only one, but when something really hurts me and makes me really sad, I don't just cry as usually and get somehow over it, it literally hurts me... I feel some kind of physical pain in my stomach and heart-area... it's still there.

1428,LonelyOrwellianGirl,1595068113,1,"I was just so grateful so have someone that loved me and wanted to do things with me. Before this, I was in an abusive relationship with an addict who would treat me like shit, it felt otherworldly to finally meet someone who wanted to go out and enjoy life with me. That feeling has faded quickly though. 

I'm 19 and he is 25, yet I feel like the one with the most experience and emotional maturity in this relationship. We cant talk in depth about anything, he has no opinion on philosophy, limited opinions on psychology and almost 0 ability to discuss his emotions with me.

He's politically and economically uneducated which leads to a lot of arguments. He will talk about POC, homeless people and other minorities in a derogatory manner and make no effort to understand what it's really like to live as a minority, he just doesnt give a fuck about anything that doesnt effect him or those he is close to personally. He is privileged. I am too, but much less so and I feel so hurt and angered by his callous remarks and jokes at the expense of those who are less fortunate. 

He has a ferocious temper and even the slightest stress can set him off on a shouting rampage. Half the time I feel like I am dating a 15 year old boy (probably an insult to most 15 year olds out there). 

On the other hand, i have never had someone care for me this way, I know he loves me with all his heart and he has been through some horrible things in childhood. He also grew up having nobody he could relate to and I know it can twist a person badly when they arent given any emotional guidance, or any type of guidance in his case. 

I have nobody else in my life and if it wasnt for him I'd never leave the house except to walk my dog. I've finally started going out and doing things, its improved my mental health so much that I'm terrified of losing it. I feel completely torn in half. I just dont know what to do.

1436,Aquataris,1595060441,1,"My name is Michael. I‚Äôm turning 36 in less than a month and I lived my entire life in Oklahoma. I finally found my first and only girlfriend on April 4th of 2019. I waited for it to feel right. She has an autistic daughter from a previous marriage. Everything started out perfect and we fell in love quickly.

After four months, she brought up the fact that she wanted to leave Oklahoma. I mentioned that I always wanted to move to the PNW. She began researching the region and quickly decided that it would be the perfect place to move to. It‚Äôs beautiful and has great schools for autistic kids. We set a goal to get there with taxes since we were both disheartened by how horrible the school system in Oklahoma treated her daughter. We arrived in Washington on March 1st and began our new life together.

I know lie sleepless in bed beside her, not knowing if we have broken up. She told me from the beginning that she didn‚Äôt even want to playfully fight or be called names even in jest because her marriage was an abusive one.

Last month she told me she needed more and wanted us to have an open relationship. Now she is in a dom/sub relationship and I stay at home watching her child who sees me as a father while she has sex with another man. 

I told her that I would never be okay with it and she told me that I would never be enough because she needs what he gives her. I reminded her that When we met, I slowly talked less and less with all my friends, who happened to be female, because she feared she would be cheated on again; yet now I am supposed to be happy that she has someone who gives her what she needs. I remind her that she made it very obvious that exactly everything he gives her was outlined as forbidden from the start. She tells me that she never saw me as dominant and it could have never been me. I remind her that one night we experimented with my knowledge of knots, pressure points, and certain tricks most people don‚Äôt know and it was too much for her.

She got angry that I had a counter for every argument she made. I pointed out she never saw a dom in me because I made sure that I was what she claimed she wanted. I also pointed out that she sees that in him because she specifically sought him out for a specific type of relationship. The night did not end well. 

I went into debt to get us here and due to COVID, the money never came in to pay off my debts. Hell, I don‚Äôt even have a driver‚Äôs license because never in my life have I had a car so my license expired in Oklahoma and I just got an ID since Oklahoma requires you to drive a car you supply for the test and my family has never had a car that would pass inspection. We arrived just before the DMVs shut down and made it impossible to get a license or ID for the state of Washington. 

If we break up, which probably just happened, I will have no car, no job, two cats, an entire life‚Äôs worth of possessions I can‚Äôt move, and no money to move with anyway, and nobody in my life because everyone I know is in Oklahoma, a state I have no desire to ever go back to...

Basically I got mad at my friends for not helping me in a tough situation (which they where witness to).

Friend 1 and friend 2 had good apology we made up, friend 3 was defensive. I decided to ask friend 3 to hang out and talk about it.

Friend 3 tells me yes and that she‚Äôll text me after a task. She never texts me but instead makes plans with our extended group of friends hours after she told me she was going to hang out with me. I get mad and block her. She gets mad at me. We call and talk it out.

We hang out twice. Then all 3 of them go on a trip together with their boyfriends. I get upset because no one told me and it really hurt seeing them all away initially because I didn‚Äôt know it was just couples.

Friend 1 responds to me and apologized. She also checks in a couples days later asking how I‚Äôm doing, we hang out. We‚Äôre good. Friend 2 and friend 3 have put in zero effort .

Details:
The tough situation was someone throwing up in my car. They where in the car with me. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to use my car that day. Everyone left as soon as they could (didn‚Äôt help).

During the call friend 3 told me she thought I overreacted to initial situation (she is right I did). She said she didn‚Äôt text me because she was tired and didn‚Äôt want to deal with it (this angers me the most). When I initially blocked her she got mad at me and told me ‚Äúshe would not tolerate being treated this way‚Äù. I apologized to all friends for overreacting.

Friend 1 and friend 2 are best friends. Friend 2 and friend 3 have been hanging out a lot recently.

1447,Boopity_Snoopins,1595053008,1,"Hi, forewarning this is as much of a vent as it is a post about loneliness, I've just been up all night in a negative headspace and need to get it out.

So I'm a 24 year old guy who currently has very little of a social life. Much less so with current events, obviously. I'm generally a very introverted person and can thrive fine on my own but sometimes things get overwhelming.

My main concern is that I am unable to open up to people in a meaningful way, or express my emotions. When I was younger I had difficulty describing my emotions so would say stuff likec""ik fine"" or ""I dont know"" in response to people wanting to know what was up with me. This really got on the nerves of my teachers and my dad. My mum and dad were never together, and minus a four year period he buggered off between the ages of 4 and 8 hes been a part of my life - albeit minorly. 

Onyhoo, my little sister, an autistic who has a lot of difficulty with understanding peoples emotions, has really brought my lack of expression to light recently. When she said she loved me and I didn't respond in kind (something that had been frequent for a while) she asked me if I didn't love her. I had to struggle through a conversation with an eight year old, explaining I find it really hard to say things like that, bit I truly do love her.

She has also asked me why I never smile or look sad, and that I always look the same. That dug deep because its always unsettled people that dont know me, and I truly dobt know what I can do about it. I've tried to be more expressive but I have to put a conscious effort into it and it comes off as insincere. I know this because I alter my tone of voice and laugh at things that amuse me, without it being genuine.

It all sounds a bit melodramatic but it's just how it is, and it's a major source of discomfort for me. I cant come clean about my emotions or properly convey my mood, as I not facially expressive.

Add this to a soup of social anxiety and lack of self worth and you have an almost completely inaproachsbke person.

I have a few friends, but the last time I made scfrievx that wasnt through another friends efforts was way back in early high school - 10 years, give it take a year - and I have never had a romantic partner.

Making friends and finding a partner are both far beyond me as a person, and very few people barring my mum, sister  and slowly, my little sister, understand me in any meaningful way. My friends know me quite well, and I'm humbled by the things they do know, but there is so much they dont know. It terrifies me how soul-crushingly alone I feel seemingly at random sometimes.

She has made me feel inadequate in so many ways that I feel like nobody could ever want me. Every time we took a break from each other, she immediately had another guy to hang out with and spend all of her time with. I feel as if she has always had backup guys to be there for her in case we wouldn‚Äôt work out. Meanwhile, she was snooping through my phone, deleting friends off of my own social media without me knowing, and deleting contacts from my phone without me knowing. 

Trying to find a new romance in my life has been horrible since I‚Äôve met her. That is why I always ended up back with my ex. She always made me feel like she would be the only one to want me.

1470,youngdaggerdick45,1595044193,1,"XXXTENTACION once said that you can be surrounded by a million people and still feel alone. 

When I heard him say that it made me realize that being lonely really isn't about being surrounded by other people, it's about lacking connection with others.

I've found this sentiment to be particularly true in my own life. The loneliest I've felt, and the times I felt the most like a loser were not all the nights Ive spent (and still spend) by myself in basement self harming, wasting time on socail media, or imaging what it's be like to go on a date or going out and enjoying myself. But rather it's the nights (rare though they might be) that I do go out with a group of friends.

I remember one evening a bunch of friends who lived all across the country that I had met from an internship I did in high school all happened to be in the same city at once and decided to meet up. I imagined a glorious reunion full of fun and laughter, what I got instead was not that. We all went to dinner, and even though we were all sitting at the same table, I felt like I was miles removed and unable to participate in the connection that was thriving around me. I watched as everyone else at the table laughed and talked. I sat there, disconnected, and unable to participate in almost any conversation. I felt so alone, like I would never be able to truly connect or have genuine socail interaction with anyone, like I'll never know what it's like to have a friend that I can be open to, and that truly knows me. Like I'm more of just a lifeless being than a socaily capable creature.

I'm grateful for those in my life, I don't mean to be ungrateful or trivialize anybody else's experiences socaily. But I feel like and wanted to share with others my experience and feeling that it doesn't matter how many people I surround myself with, unless I learn to live life, not be socaily awkward, and truly connect with others I'm going to continue to feel like a lonely loser. Of course these things are easier said then done and honestly I don't know how to go about doing those things or if I am even capable of it.

1474,JakeChilli,1595039878,1,"About a month ago one of my ""friends"" started to plan a LAN party (for those who don‚Äòt know what this is: we all meet up at someones house with our computers and play videogames together through the whole night) as a birthday party. Because his birthday is in summer he suggested doing it during our summer break. It is pretty common for us to go on (separate) vacations during our hollidays. So he asked whether we are away during these six weeks to set a date. While the others already knew when they‚Äòd be free I was still unsure and didn‚Äôt answer right away (my family has a house in the countryside where we can go whenever we want which means we often make very spontaneous decisions). 
Today this friend texted us suggesting a date for tuesday. But I already knew that I would be away for the whole next week, so I replied to his text. It didn‚Äòt take long until my other friends (who where also invited (we are a group of 5 people who play video games together very often)) replied. We came to the conclusion that the party would only be possible on a weekend after the hollidays. Otherwise someone would always be unable to come. 
The 'birthday boy' didn‚Äôt take part in this conversation. Then a few minutes later he just replied with ""wanna do it on tuesday or wednesday?"". At this point I was really confused and thought he probably didn't read our previous text messages. Then my friends answered a bit confused asking which week he meant and told him that I wouldn‚Äòt be free next week. But he just confirmed that he really did mean next week and pressured them to decide. And so without any discussion they started planning the party without me. At this point I already left the group chat. Being stabbed in the back in such a way really made me question my friendships to them. 
The fact that none of my friends who I considered to be some of my closest friends didn‚Äôt really question his decision and didn‚Äòt even contact me really makes me feel like I am the third wheel that no one really wants to hang out with. We have been friends and playing video games together for about 5 years now and before, whenever someone couldn‚Äòt come to a party we would sometimes even move the date over months until we all had the time. I mean you could argue that I might have pissed him off by not telling him about my vacation right away. But being betrayed like this just makes me feel like im a nobody sitting alone at home all day without anybody really caring or even thinking about me. 
Now that I wrote it down it kinda feels like I am dramatizing too much about it but I just feel empty inside.

Basically the only people who care about me are the people who have to care about me (family). I have a best friend, which is good, but if we drift apart then I have literally no one and that is not an exaggeration. I feel completely emotionally barren. I know there is something I want (real emotional connections) but have no motivation to go and get it (nor do I know how to get it). There's not even a sexual aspect to it at all; I've lost almost all sex drive. More than that, I can't think of a single thing I actually *want* to do. If I could, I'd just hop into a time capsule and wait until someone actually wanted to speak to me - which is almost never anyway. Because of that, just being awake is painful and feels like a pretty tortuous wait until the next time I get a notification of any text or dm from a real human being.

On that point, I'm tired of never being the priority. As I already said, I am grateful for my best friend, but apart from him I cannot think of a single person who even considers me a third wheel. I'm just a distant afterthough for everyone. Anytime I make any kind of positive connection with anyone, and I think things are going well (a handful of times over the past few years anyway and I'm probably being generous), I pretty soon realise that I am a long, long way from being their priority in spite of the fact I obsess over when the next text will come or when I can next speak to them. These 'friendships' are always one-sided. I don't blame anyone at all, it's just the realisation that I am never wanted as much as I want them is painful.

1488,TinyTurtlesAreTiny,1595025198,1,"I read a few of the posts here and thought I could somehow contribute in my own tiny way.

So I wrote this post here. But I also pasted it below:

\~\~\~\~\~\~

It‚Äôs painful. But when we pay attention to it, we find that it is a peculiar kind of pain. It‚Äôs not overwhelming, but rather a nagging, chronic, kind of pain. The kind that makes you restless, one that you are almost embarrassed to feel.

Being lonely and admitting it is akin to admitting that you‚Äôre a failure as a human being. It feels like you have failed at the most basic task of being a person, which is connecting with others.

You feel faulty, and question what it is about *you* that makes other people not want to form a basic connection. It is not even about having a romantic connection, but rather a more fundamental connection. One where you feel understood. Where you‚Äôre not isolated from the world and others.

Sometimes the feeling of loneliness creeps up even when you‚Äôre physically around people. It can even get worse in that situation because the contrast between you and other people become so much clearer. You feel helpless because even when people are with you, internally you might as well be on another planet.

You feel a deep sadness that you are facing a void that no one can bring you back from. Your very existence on this planet seems to be pointless. You wake up and ask yourself why you should even bother.

It becomes particularly hard when the weekend comes around and you know that you have nothing to look forward to. Either you don‚Äôt have friends to hang out with, or if you do, you‚Äôll feel that they don‚Äôt have the faintest idea about what is going on inside of you.

I get it. I really, truly, honestly do get it. This is my way of saying that I feel the same, and I suspect a lot of people who you have never met, also feel the same. You might be the type that loves to read, that feels generally OK with solitude, but you urge for a genuine connection. You are thoughtful, kind and empathetic, but feel that all of your friends just don‚Äôt ‚Äúget it‚Äù.

Well, I do. If we met, you‚Äôd know I do. I just want to say that even though you have the urge to keep to yourself, to avoid others, or feel rejected by those you do reach out to, please don‚Äôt stop looking for connection.

When we meet, it‚Äôll be worth it, I promise you. Life‚Äôs a series of ephemeral moments, and there are people out there who are worth sharing those moments with.

Loneliness makes us view other people as stupid, or shallow. We separate ourselves from them because they seem to only care about things that are superficial. But that‚Äôs a story that we have created in our own minds. The same people we dismiss have an entire internal universe. One that we would be lucky to explore.

We can choose to view them with affection, kindness and compassion. And perhaps that would be a way to discover that they feel the same way as we do. To connect with others means that we have to be vulnerable, and that carries risk. We might be afraid of sharing our vulnerability because we‚Äôre worried that they will hurt us. Even worse, they might not even care.

Perhaps one way to break our chronic loneliness is to help others. By shifting our focus away from our own story where only we are a sad and misunderstood person to face the reality that ***everyone*** is a sad and misunderstood person, then perhaps we‚Äôd feel less lonely.

In this way, we‚Äôd ironically feel more connected to them, because we realise that on some level, they are experiencing the same pain that we are experiencing.

We may never be fully understood, we might never fully connect with other people, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not worth trying. To me at least, that is what being a human is all about.

Giving things a shot, trying it out, seeing what happens. After all, we‚Äôre not here forever, so we might as well enjoy it, even when the only person we can enjoy it with is ourselves.",lonely,To those that are lonely,2020-07-18 08:33:18

1510,iamd4g,1595015414,1,"A result of an adulterous relationship between a married church deacon and a divorced social worker. Found my mother dead at 5. Brought up by an elderly couple, mainly sheltered. Bullied, harassed, humiliated, and assaulted relentlessly at school. Used video games, cartoons, books, and my own imagination as a means for escapism. I still do. Grandma passed away alone and abandoned at 10. Ripped off. Dad passed away at 14. Ripped off again. Physically and mentally belittled and abused by my brothers. Ostracized and ignored by most of my most of my siblings on either side. Invisible to many, if not all. Low, if existent, self esteem and confidence. A social dounce. A consistently spurned, yet hopeless romantic. Never had more than 2 close friends at any point in life and now it's been almost 3 years since I have interacted new people and friends.

Before this current stint, I really felt that I tried to put myself out there. I tried by living with family and roommates but ultimately my kindness was taken for granted one too many times with family. Roommates, on the other hand, were phenomenal people. I just guess that I'm just too repulsive to live with or tolerate. My God-sent parents had their ways and I still find fault in some of their methods but I know that they loved me unconditionally and they did the best that they could knew and had. When it comes to my own love, I am coming to the realization that that just might not be in the cards for me and I am willing to accept Fate on that front only. I am blessed to have a son in my life, that he has a mother who loves him immensely, and that we can co-parent and provide support amicably, despite our rough past and relative distance.

Teaching has grown to become my sword and shield. I wanted to teach since I was 16 and I was able to accomplish that goal. For 11 years, what started as a spontaneous desire to make interactice projects in a classroom and not seeing it as work on a public transit bus became a full fledged, total commitment to education until I collapse. I was willing to sacrifice anything to that goal. Time with the elderly couple who raised me. Time with my son. What I did little I did allocate to myself when into erroneous means of acquiring friendship and companionship. At this point, I feel validated, yet empty, hollow, and alone. 

Due to some unbecoming exploits in the classroom this past year, I decided to go back to the drawing board and see a therapist. Despite teaching at a low socioeconomic area, I knew that a driving force behind those disturbances was my unresolved issues and impulsive decisions that stem from them. I have held festering, toxic hate and animosity for my original high school After a few sessions and with some outside insights, I was revealed to me that I hadn't properly mourn lost connections, dead or alive. So, I went back home thoroughly for the first time in 7 years, seeing family members they haven't seen in 18 years.

As a fledging historian by craft, I was always curious about my mom. I have a few fleeting memories from when I was young, white walking down the aisles of Walmart or looking up at her as she drove. The only clear explicit memory I have of her is telling my grandmother that she wouldn't wake up. As I reconnected with cousins and family friends, I discovered my mom was essentially self made. She was a proud, no nonsense straight shooter to the world but a soft, caring, and loving woman. I always had reservations about her and my dad, particularly regarding my conception. At times, I wish that I was aborted to avoid the drama circulating and putting me through this. But, her and my elderly couple's faith in me always manifested itself.

No matter, she was the aunt sneaking her little cousins drinks and take them out on the town. (we're from the 'Kountry' country, y'all) She had done some work for an established magizine, while working as a social worker, so she must have been sharp in some regard. She came a family who loved and served the community and I am coming to the understanding that she exuded that. My grandma provide a temporary home for foster kids from a well-known charitable organization and and I always remember her serving faithfully in the church. Her father and brother served in the church too, as deacon and pastor respectively. As I learn more about them, I feel more invigorated and whole, finding solidarity in my vision as a teacher and resolve to be an asset as a human being.

So, now I'm at a crossroads, facing the Rubicon. With education in my area, everything's evaluated in three year cycle and I'm nearing the end of my first cycle. I have been in this city for over 12 years and I have never live outside of my state, except a two year stint in a southern metropolitan area after my father died and deployment in Iraq. I loathe my state's and district's means and methods regarding education and learning and their intended/actual effects. I want to grow genuinely and happily as an educator and, while working for them over two and a half years at different schools, I firmly believe that I would not fade away as a teacher. If I go out, then I die, pushing maximum effort, with electrified passion for my classroom, and highest aspiration for my kids. I no longer need to feel my passion with hate or malice from the past and I have arrived at a place where I can let it all go, with the exception of a few special cases. I want to leave, have basically made up my mind, and laying out plans to do so. I'm done with this area and this state, come this time next year.

I know that it just gets harder with each day that drags along. Was this my fate? In my successes in being a guy that my folks could be proud of, will I always like I finish last, no matter the circumstances? Is there something wrong with me? Am I being conceited or self-absorbed? Am I being whiny or oversensitive? Am I being paranoid or does it seem like something is out to get me? To end me slowly? I know everyone have their quirks, especially, particularly, specifically me and gotta pay dues but... the f‚àö¬¢√ó?

1526,cassie_to_heart,1595001420,1,"Throughout my university years, I've always struggled in making friendships, let alone maintaining one. A big reason for that, is my interests/hobbies that are more oriented towards LE (law enforcement)/military. I've had a penpal *(who was ex-Navy, ex-CO/corrections, current LEO and is a post commander at his local American legion chapter in TX)* to platonically correspond before but seemingly to have lost touch since the pandemic happened. We infrequently communicated with each other but I valued that time nonetheless.

Now as a student RN (doing Nursing in my 2nd year in my 2 year Graduate entry course), I really have no one to talk to in terms of a support system and a valuable friendship I'd like to reflect fondly on. I'd always aim to have at least one decent friendship when a new semester started but all of that would always lead to little-to-no avail. However, I've met some good female co-workers during my shifts in my two-week nursing placements at an aged care home but that finished last week but I feel that they'd connect more with each other (2 of them were both mothers) when we hung out for coffee at the end of our last day of placement to celebrate than I could connect with them. I don't think I'd be doing them any favors...

Now I have no friends, some of which I had to cut my once high-school friends off (1 in particular) when I wanted their support in me having a partner and they weren't receptive to it, one calling me fracked in the head. It's been a rough couple of weeks, and quite tumultuous in terms of my mental health.

Somehow, it feels more isolating to feel I'm not deserving of friendships... amplifying my insecurity at the thought I'm probably incapable of forming healthy ones, and feeling like I've procured all these interests/hobbies and I'm letting it go to waste.

I'm just looking for male friends I can stroke a prospective friendship with hopefully of which are in specific backgrounds...  LEOs &amp; former/current military in particular *(yes that includes guys from the Coast Guard)*. Also open to other first responders in terms of prospective friendships. And if you are worried about another girl looking to steal your BAH/Tricare, no need to worry, I'm already partnered who is interestingly, a former marine *(MOS 0311, 2nd Infantry out of FOB Victory, postings out of 1288 Condor, 762 Shoestring)* but that part of his life was a long long time ago. Now that being said, please do not consider trying to get in my proverbial skirt with those sneaky nudes etc.

It would be a fantastic bonus if it's a guy who is very open to shoot the sh\*t with my partner in terms of shared stories/experiences/game with. If you're wondering why I mentioned Australia, it's where I'm living right now (in a current LDR with my partner) so that doesn't help with forming friendships with the people I feel I could connect and understand more easier.

Like I said, my post is geared towards LEOs/military, and I understand how alienating it can feel with such marked differences and attitudes in civilian life for such men out there... trust me when I say I feel more out-of-place being in the civilian world when everybody is too busy looking after themselves and not for each other.

As for my interests/hobbies:

**Interests:**

* Love learning yt new cooking recipes (especially vegan though I am not one)

* Watching archived news coverage (typically on US elections 1980-2012)
* Watching drive-bys videos of low-income inner city areas/local interviews (CharlieBo313)
* Watching yt videos on US fwy signage (FreewayJim, FreewayKyle)
* Listening to publicly broadcast police scanners (especially Chicago PD) ...and being entertained by the occasional reminder from dispatch telling officers to watch their keys.
* Aviation, and watching aviation flight trip reports on yt
* Anything US military related. Equipment, gear, guns,
* Military MREs food reviews (Nice hiss!)

1529,Rokubaba,1594995096,1,"Hi all,  


I have never actually talked openly about this so far and this makes me a bit nervous to do so as I don't really know how to explain it. But I feel like I need to.  


I have been feeling lonely for a good 10 years now. I am a person who works on himself, when I felt these feelings, I tried to connect it to my current situation and environment and thus my story.   


First I thought is having a relationship and that would fill the gap. I had a relationship for 4 years and it was fun and she was amazing but I eventually broke up with her. During this relationship I felt even more lonely. When your partner is fun and smart but you cannot connect on an emotional level, it doesn't work. I felt lost, I felt I was using her, I just felt that I was doing her wrong. I never cheated on her or anything but I just couldn't commit completely. So the best thing was to let her go.   


After that, nothing changed. I dated here and there. Had short relathionships but it lasted half a year or a year. I feel really bad and scared these last 2 year to try again. I cared for every girlfriend I had but left them all because I couldn't convince myself that it was the real thing. They all hate me for the fact I cannot commit. 3 years ago I realized I have never really loved anybody. How my friends describe love is something I have never ever felt. I have received it, but never been able to show it (hence the hate from my exes and I understand them and hope they will forgive me one day). They have moved on and I am genuinly happy for them. But envious as I haven't been able to move on fromt he same mindset I had when I was dating them.  


I have friends who I can call anytime of the day. I have loving family members. This was the reason I never thought that how I felt was an issue, because I believe I have it good. I feel blessed for my situation I am in but I cannot understand why I feel lonely.  


You can also not hurt me that easily. Insults I can take in like its nothing. I have a very sober mind for that and it works for me to stay calm and think rational. I always believed this was an advantage for me in live. But there was one thing my ex ones said to me in anger. She said ''you will never love anybody'' (calling me a cold person). This was 3 years ago and it is one of the few things that is hurting me till this day. I want to love somebody, really commit to her. But I really don't know how as I never saw someone and got the feeling ''yup thats it, she is the real deal''.   


I have connected me being lonely to love. I might be wrong but it is the thing I search for desperately when my lonely feelings get too much. I have done several things to try and fix my situation.  


\- I kept on dating to ''find the right one'' still felt lonely  
\- I learned new skills like playing the piano and just making music but didn't fill the gap  
\- I tried leaving my comfort zone by getting my skydive certificate while I am scared of doing it. Now I jump from planes and feel incredible (fear and adenaline really makes you feel alive) until I am in my bed the same night with my thoughts.  
\- I tried talking with my friends but they don't know it either  
\- I lived a year abroad (went alone) and made new friends new environment for myself. But this never helped either. Actually made me feel more lonely.  
\- Doing sports to build up convidence and try to love myself.

These feelings, I have put away for years. I always thought I am exagerating and in time it will be okay. But for the first time in my life, I really don't know what I should do. It keeps me awake at nights. Some friends tell me that I should be lucky that I don't feel that much as love hurts. But I would do anything to be blindly in love for once. Let my guard down and just go for it. Let my emotions take the wheel.   


I am not sure if I am making any sense with what I have written. I wouldn't make this post if I saw someone else with the same issue. But I see posts with problems that are worse than mine with people actually being alone as well, so I actually feel a bit ashamed posting this.   


If anybody has some insight on this or an opinion, I would love to hear it. Maybe something that have worked for you to find love. To learn to love yourself maybe? That is a whole another issue as well but my post got way too long to talk about self love.   


And if you think I shouldn't complain that much, let me know as well. I appreciate any perspective.

It feels heavy on the bones... and it doesn‚Äôt let you smile truthfully at all. 
It doesn‚Äôt let you sleep at night and sometimes not even eat. 

It makes you forget how to speak, how to think and how to dream. It wants your undivided attention.

It takes you away from everyone and keeps you all to itself, your new best friend, family and lover. 

Eventually It becomes you and you become it. 
And while you fail to recognize yourself it makes it known to everyone that IT IS YOU. 

The road has disappeared completely, no idea where you came from or where your going and your not even on the wheel anymore. 

Without your body and mind all your left with is the long tedious romance of death, because death is the only thing that is still truly yours. 

Ironically it can still cheer you up, it can make you feel accompanied, understood and it listens to all your problems.

It is a monster but it‚Äôs very much like a pet. It‚Äôs obsessed with you it can never leave your side. It doesn‚Äôt bite it‚Äôs actually very gentle. It loves to cuddle and its fur is the best. 

Your inseparable now.

So through my life I've only been in one (what i consider) serious relationship and it ended around a month or two ago.

It's not always finding someone (not recently, that has been really hard for me), but it's just staying with them. The reason I feel as though it's that kind of issue relates back to the other relationships where i couldn't handle them or I just would lose interest. I've always considered that I'm a decently nice person but every time I've tried with a girl it just ends up in failure and me just breaking her and i hate it so much. It's getting to the point where I feel so alone that i feel as though i need someone but I feel like if I get someone I'm just gonna hurt them too. In the past I've turned people down that i really liked just because the fact that I feel like i will ruin things and hurt them. I'm ruining my happiness and my life but the only way i can really think of that would help right now is one of the things that would make things worse later.

 I had a really bad anxiety problem this year and I had to leave some classes in collage bc of it ( I'm a med student), I still have the anxiety but I don't have the money to go to therapy also my family hates me and they treat me like shit every single day, my mom screams to me she doesn't think that my mental health issues ara a problem and she thinks that she is doing everything ok and I'm the only one that has a problem, my younger brother it's also very bad with me to the point in starting to think he is a sociopath ( obviously I don't know for sure).
I had a very bad problem this week and I'm feeling really down, I don't have anybody that just want to talk to me or send me a message just because. I'm alone every day in my room, I don't go out and play animal crossing all day long or I see YouTube videos. Sometimes I don't feel like eating or drinking or doing anything, I just want people to talk with, people who sends me memes and that kind of thing, that ask me about my day, but also wants to hear when I'm sad.

I had some college Friends but after my very overwhelming anxiety attacks they didn't talk to me anymore. 

Since lockdown I haven't received any message from people asking me about my anxiety attacks, about my health or even to say hi. I have tried to meet people online but I feel once they get to know me or we get to know each other they stop talking to me, I don't really know the reason. 

I feel empty, I feel like I'm drowning, I feel worthless.

I know that this post it's not like shocking and probably most of people in this reddit community feel the same way but I don't know what to do, I feel that everything that it have been happening in my life for the past 8 month has been awful not a single good thing.

1576,ChunkiestMuffin,1594950063,1,"Hi guys,

I am not writing this post because I'm seeking validation or even acceptance; I am writing this to see if people feel the same way I do, or who can relate.

I have found that Reddit is a really good tool to use as a coping mechanism, personally. It's a great way to express myself anonymously, whether I am just wanting to vent or to seek questions - Reddit is a brilliant tool (excluding the trolls).

So, *what am I here for? What's the purpose of my expression?* Well, I am the type of man that feels very deeply, emotionally. I would consider myself to be extremely compassionate and in turn, I am overly empathetic - I'm an empath. Being an empath can be hard because, we don't feel like most people, we often feel more; our perceptions are not limited to ourselves, we have the capacity to view the world from multiple perspectives. For example; if someone has told me that they lost their dog, I would feel the anguish and sorrow in their voice. Empaths have an innate ability to instinctively experience other people's situations emotionally - in an almost practical sense.

Compassionate people who are considered to be empaths are not limited to other peoples emotions, we also worry, constantly. If I am not worrying, then I'm worried that I'm not worried and then, I'll make myself worry for not worrying! The paradox is real! Haha!

I believe anxiety goes hand in hand with people who are compassionate - or maybe that's just me. However, I have been told by other empathetic people that they too feel the same. It's ironic isn't it; people who care so much for other people, never tend to worry for themselves - we worry that caring too much for ourselves is selfish.

One of my most favourite things to do is to listen to music, that triggers empathy. For example; I listen to Freya Ridings - Lost Without You. The lyrics to that song are so deep, it is sung with meaning and devotion. That song is not a song, it's an expression. She sings that song as though she is living in that moment. The song represents loss and sadness but in such a beautiful form, that we can all relate to. Another song that I love to is also sung by Freya Ridings - You Mean The World To Me. That song also represents a deep sorrow and regret.

I am lonely because I am living in a world that's solely based on materialism. We live in a world where acceptance is based on what you have, as opposed to who you are. If you own a nice car, expensive clothes, expensive home, etc. then you are accepted. Nothing about modern day acceptance has anything to do with moral qualities. For example; if a man or a woman has less than the average person but who is kind, they will be judged by what they don't have. However, if someone has 'status' materialism, they're automatically accepted based on the things they own, disregarding the individual as a person - whether good or bad, they're judged on what they have and not who they are - this is why I am lonely.

I am a solitary man by choice; I prefer to be alone. Being alone doesn't allow me to be in positions where I am judged for being me. Being 'different' is seen as 'weird'. I don't understand that concept - what is 'normal?'

Does anyone else feel that they are better off being alone? Do you ever feel meeting a person who will understand or appreciate, is none-existent?

Anyway, sorry for the long winded post; I just wanted to express myself.

Take care.",lonely,Are You Too Compassionate?,2020-07-17 11:41:03

1586,Snoo_36054,1594944960,1,"When I was around elementary school, I didn't have friends. I was just isolated - idk some sort of bullying tactic. I just got used to staying alone and didn‚Äôt even try anymore to make friends.

During middle school, I tried hard to make friends. I tried to be a funny person. I would make a lot of self-deprecating humor and would just try to be weird to stand out - naturally, I was the type of person who rarely smiled or showed emotion toward things. I did get a lot of friends, but I felt I could never connect with them. I didn't even like humor. At the time, I loved anime. But for some reason at my school, the people I knew weren‚Äôt interested in anime. I tried to introduce some of them into it, but they'd say stuff like it was childish. Many of them were passionate about certain book series or marvel tv shows. But I just was not interested in marvel and I think I was too late to keep up with those books.  By the end of 8th grade, I just isolated myself.

High school started. I felt I could start out fresh. I got interested in kpop and made friends who were interested in that as well. But soon I realized my interest in kpop was not as much as them. They would be watching variety shows and keeping up with latest announcements along with drama. They'd be fangirling over little things while I would just be watching MVs on my Youtube home page. I did have an interest for webtoons, but I didn't know people interested in that. I think I lost interest in anime/manga. I was reading mostly isekai manga instead of the popular stuff - most people were keeping up with stuff like aot, bnha, haikyuu.  I also had a few friends who liked doing tik tok dances or trying snap chat filters together and I just watched - never would like to participate in that sort of stuff.

I was noticing too how distant I was with my friends. In high school, I tried to be more like my real self instead of the funny person I was back in middle school. I'm not the type of person to feel comfortable getting excited over stuff. I really wanted to be treated like other people treat their friends - smiling and waving back at each other. I never felt comfortable with a friend hugging me or vice versa. I tried my best to give off a friendly presence - a forced smile and a wave back. But people found it weird and just had a stern face when looking at me. But then with others, they'd feel ecstatic. I also never got to meet my friends outside of school. I was hearing about how some of them facetime and go to the movies. I have texted my friends before at beginning of freshmen year, but we all were pretty busy - so honestly most of it were homework questions. I do admit I should have worked on establishing a relationship outside of school. It's just that school was so overwhelming. 

I have went to summer school a few times in high school. First time - everyone would just leave once class ended. Second time - this was a community college. I tried hard to reach out to people in class and make small talk. But it was just one-sided. I think everyone just went to the class and just didn't plan on making actual friends - no sort of conversation, only interactions were on work. I did meet someone in the cafeteria. She was pretty weird. She was interesting though. She liked anime, but we never got into real discussions. She apparently would meet guys on some sort of app and face time these strangers on her laptop (wasn't inappropriate) or go on a train to meet them for dates without telling her parents. She constantly played otome games on her phone. She would dance in the cafeteria to kpop songs - leaving the music out loud. She even had her phone wallpaper as sangwoo - goodlooking anime psychopathic killer who kidnapped and tortured people. I know this isn‚Äôt relevant. But I thought it would just be interesting to tell you guys. Also, I found that even though we had similar interests like kpop and anime, we could not connect. Third time - I head to a university for a summer school program. I meet my roomates. I just got snap chat recently bc I know it's a social norm. They would snap chat a lot - I hated this app bc it felt like a total waste of time sending pictures. We had a mentor who was in charge of other rooms. Guys and girls played card games at our room and made inappropriate jokes. I don‚Äôt like when people talk about inappropriate stuff and I really was wishing I could have real conversations  with people instead of these activities. I just shut myself in my room bc I just didn‚Äôt like being around them and it makes sense why they didn‚Äôt like me bc I was very different from them. I had a main class and other activity classes (art, touring certain places). I did find a few people fun to talk to in those other activity classes - my mistake was not getting their phone number, so I pretty much never saw them again. I was focusing too much on trying to be friends with my roomates that I didn‚Äôt focus on my main classmates. They apparently were going out to eat together. I tried eating with them a few times, but I found it overwhelming - eating and keeping up with their speed of conversation/getting done with their food. So, I mostly just ate by myself in the cafeteria. Many times, I would just not go there bc I'd kinda feel embarrassed that I was alone. I don‚Äôt know how people can actually get to know each other - have conversations instead of joking around at these programs.

Once lockdown happened, I started making online friendships (I pretty much isolated myself from my friends before lockdown) I found it much easier. We could have real discussions. But for some people, I was getting irritated that some people give short responses - more like a reaction to my text instead of actual insight. I also noticed that one of them would always go on tangents by making some joke which I'd anyways not get. I think I'm too picky. I do have some people I feel I can connect with, but I get frustrated with someone if they‚Äôre not similar to me. It's a problem. I need to be able to be a carefree, friendly, funny person, but I don‚Äôt know how to.

Anyways, I feel that most of my in-person interactions, I barely had real discussions with people. I wonder why that is. Do people just converse less irl or something? Or am I doing something wrong? Bc I feel I am doing a pretty decent job when it comes to online friendships.

\*\*I know that was a lot to read. I think I just wanted to vent out and also just make it known how much of a problem it is for me to connect with others.",lonely,It's hard connecting with people. (long read),2020-07-17 10:16:00

1588,FetchTheGuillotine,1594940656,1,"All my life i've struggled to fit in. I've never had a gf or even a close friend to rely on. The few friends i do have are nice people, but they only ever respond to my messages, and never initiate the conversation.
I've had weeks go by without hearing from them if i don't contact them.
I've also been getting very used to the thought that i'm going to go through life alone, without anyone to love or to love me. I really do not like myself and as I am well aware of all my many imperfections, so I don't blame people for not wanting to be with me.

Always having felt so lonely and redundant has on several occasions led my to seriously considering just ending it all. The closest I ever got was resting my chin on the tip of the barrel of a loaded 12 gauge, but weak as I am, I backed out.

I decided to start trying more things that I thought could be entertaining to do alone, as I wanted something fun I could pass the time with that didn't require the presense of friends, which was so rare. I tried stuff like kayaking, animating and brewing beer, but none of it really surpressed the feeling of the internal void.
But then I decided to use alot of money trying something I'd always wanted to try; motorcycling. I ended up paying around $13,000 to get my license, proper clothing, a bike, and touring accessories. It was the best decision I ever made. Whenever I ride, i forget that i'm alone. I do not care if noone miss me if I go quiet for weeks. I stop thinking of how I'm gonna die alone.

Whenever i ride, I'm actually happy.
Ofcorse, whenever i stop riding, the loneliness returns, but those hours i'm able to forget it all are honestly the reason i'm still around.

So that is my best advice. Not for you to go out and get a bike, but if you recognized yourself in what I wrote, I genuinly think you will be able to find some activity or hobby that makes you feel the way riding makes me feel.

Please do not give up to soon. I'm convinced there's something out there that will be able to bring any of us the happiness we long for.",lonely,The best advice i have for you,2020-07-17 09:04:16
1589,syne135z,1594940606,1,"Every couple of months I go on facebook and go on a sort of binge to check out the profiles of people from highschool. I always get this weird nostalgic but also sad feeling.

I always find it especially interesting to check out all the profiles of people that I was not really close with but still saw daily back then. 

People are having relationships, experiences, and all that stuff. I wish I had that kind of life.

Honestly from the outside it looks like im doing fine. I got a couple of friends here and there and I almost finished my bachelors degree. So I have that going for me which is nice.

But there is also a lot missing. Never had a relationship and I missed out on a lot of experiences.

Honestly, part of the reason why im miserable is because I got fucked by some shitty anxiety/ocd/depression combo. I now realise that these issues were always present but especially in the last three years I have been to some dark places.

Three years ago I got rejected by a girl I fell really hard for and its still not over somwhow even though i have not seen her for one year. Before I met her I did not care that I never had a relationship. But after I met her I felt and still feel, lonely anywhere I go. Even when I'm with friends I feel lonely.

The only time when I feel somewhat good is when I get fucked up on xanax and painkillers. But now I have a tolerance and I cant even get high anymore. Oh well so it goes.

Anyway Im not even sure where im going with this. But I just closed facebook and had to share with someone I guess.

I just got to 30 and have been feeling lonelier than I have ever been and can't cope anymore. I feel like I lost all meaningful connection to everyone I knew, lost my friends in the process and can't seem to make any new attachments because it all feels so temporary and meaningless.

I moved 9 times in the past 9 years, lost 2 long term relationships, one because of financial, mental and physical abuse and one because of cheating. We tried for another year but couln't make it work, something just broke in me and I just couldn't feel happy anymore. With the last one, as soon as I moved out, he replaced me with the first tinder date he got, took her out, went places with her and then tagged me in all their outings to show me he could learn from his past mistakes and do better. The one before took all my money and when I didn't have anything left for him to take, he threw me out with nothing.

This guy cost me my home (we bought together and I was the one to move out), my job and my colleagues which I loved (I had to relocate and  switch stores). 

I have been living alone now for a year, I don't even leave my apartment anymore (even before the whole situation we have now) and can't seem to find my footing at my new job. I still miss my old colleagues everyday, and can't move out again because of the costs.

I have one friend left now, but we talk less and less. To see him I have to take a 4h train ride, and if I'm not the one doing the traveling, I won't see him at all. I used to visit him monthly, but he never visits back. Somewhere along the way I picked up a fwb, but it will never amount to anything more. Everytime I see him I feel even more lonely afterwards.

I am just so tired of having to start over again and again, knowing it will probably all fall apart some way or another. All the motivation is just gone, I go to work, play a game, eat, sleep (if I can) and then repeat everything again. My hobbies have come to a halt, and I can't motivate myself to pick them up again. It all feels so useless and without meaning. I just feel stressed all the time to the point where I constantly feel ill, lost a lot of weight and am starting to lose my hair.

Sorry for this mess and the wall of text, but I just don't know how to go on anymore.

I wish someone would just come in to my life I want her to initiate the conversation I want her to try if they wanted me that much I would love them forever. There was one girl that messaged me she was younger that's why I stopped talking to her.

one time. that's the closest thing I have ever been to a relationship I'm 18 I'm really just gonna die alone I'm never gonna pay someone I'll die a Virgin I guess.
I'd love to just spend all my money on them.

1630,turok2,1594911790,1,"Ode to Joy is an old German poem that is best known as the text in the last movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.

It's all about peace, happiness, union and the brotherhood of man.

All very stirring, all very wholesome.

But then halfway through, the author makes a point of adding this verse (translated from German)

&gt; Whoever has created

&gt; An abiding friendship,

&gt; Or has won

&gt; A true and loving wife,

&gt; All who can call at least one soul theirs,

&gt; Join in our song of praise;

&gt; But any who cannot must creep tearfully

&gt; Away from our circle.

It makes it very hard to connect with the music. I want to love the music. I *used* to love the music before I knew all the words.

When this is joyfully sung and everyone feels happy and joyful, could it be that their joy is dependent on excluding the lonely from their union of happiness? It seems to be celebrating the fact that the lonely and unloved are absent.

What is going on with this verse? Am I misunderstanding it? I really, really want to like this music, but every time I hear it feels like it's taunting me. I can't remember where I was going with this post.",lonely,"What's with ""Ode to Joy""",2020-07-17 01:03:10

I‚Äôve never had a year where I wasn‚Äôt obsessed with a teacher. Always an English teacher (I really love literature). The latest one has been the most intense and has gone on four years. It has been totally all consuming. 

It‚Äôs not romantic or sexual in nature but it is intense and desperate and probably a little creepy. I act like a puppy dog. I‚Äôm just in awe of them. I have gone to extreme lengths to know more about these people, be around them, endear myself to them. I fantasize about being their friend, or child, or spouse. I never want their class to end. And I think about them fondly for years after the class is over. Most of all, I fret over how they perceive me. I try to get inside their head, figure out what they really think of me. I‚Äôm desperate to make an impression and it becomes my mission to gain their approval and affection. I almost always become somewhat close to them, and receive a lot of encouragement, which I cherish and replay in my head, and probably make out to be a bigger deal than it is.

The years passed, and I was busy with my study and mental illness so I didn‚Äôt really notice my loneliness and the fact that I had no friend and was isolating myself. Then the lockdown started, and same thing, I wasn‚Äôt noticing my loneliness because everyone was kinda depressed during quarantine.

But when the lockdown ended, it‚Äôs like something stroke me in the face, in my head. I suddenly noticed how lonely I was. It was heavy in my mind, and I started to think about that everyday. Since then, this thought has become more than overwhelming, and I almost spend my days thinking about how lonely I am, how no one worries about me, how I have no one to talk to, I hang out with, how I always ran after people and people never did anything or cared about me. And these thoughts is such a enormous weight on my shoulders and thoughts. Last night, I was overthinking again and I started feeling nauseous, like I wanted to puke. Does one of you ever had this feeling ?

We have a mutual agreement that we both suck at responding and she mentioned at one point that when she‚Äôs stressed she distances herself from people but it‚Äôs been 2 weeks since she last messaged me. The longest we‚Äôve gone without talking before this was 8 days because we ran out of things to talk about. This time though, she opened up again about something personal and ended the message by saying she felt she overshares way too much, more than anyone cares to. I reassured her that it‚Äôs fine in my next message and responded to what she said but she hasn‚Äôt replied.

I might be overreacting, she might message me anytime now but it‚Äôs fucking torture. I‚Äôm constantly thinking if I said something stupid to scare her off or maybe she‚Äôs going through something stressful right now, but she usually tells me if she is. Everyday I read over what I said and try to think about it from her point of view to the point that it‚Äôs driving me insane. Sucks too that I was helping her feel better about her friend ghosting her and now she‚Äôs possibly doing it to me. Sinking half a year talking to someone just for them to leave unannounced seems crazy to me. 

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship or a long term friendship like this before and I miss talking to her.

I have never known a person that I did not envy, and I have never truly felt happy for anyone else's achievements. Simply being around other people makes me feel invalid and pathetic. I am not proud of anything about myself. I have nothing; I don't even have a functioning body, let alone even a basic defining characteristic or achievement unrelated to my disabilities and my insufferable personality. No matter what people tell me, I can barely find it in myself to pity them, and it shows. 

People avoid me. They scamper away once they come to better understand my personality. They catch onto how much I resent their perceived good fortune. I know I'm not a good person. I get it. I never will be. I am a shallow, conniving infant without a shred of talent or ambition, but I can't change that. I can't actually become a good, likeable person, I can just pretend to be one, like I've been doing since my teenage years. I'm not very good at it. At the end of the day, my core philosophy remains ""I am suffering; so should you"".

Today, my mom asked me when I'm gonna start thinking about relationships and marriage. As it stands, I can't imagine a person that I could enter into a situation of mutual tolerance with, let alone mutual appreciation or affection. Regardless of gender, regardless of age, I genuinely can't think of any type of person that would ever want to be around me in any capacity for any length of time. I would hate them too much.

Anyways, a summary. 

I'm 19 years old, just finished my first year of college. I moved to the US at 16 and have a complex with my accent. For my accent and having different life experiences to people I've never resonated with anyone in the past years. I love physics and love hearing others talk about it with passion. I passed through high school thinking that it wasn't anybody's fault that I was lonely, to just hang on until college where I could find a more diverse set of people that would be more accepting of my differences. 
I felt liberated in college to be more who I am. Started using my unpronunciable middle name; wearing clothes I liked; talking about my life before the US; speaking with others without worrying about my accent; etc. And the promise was true, the environment in my university made me feel accepted and secured, but......
No matter how accepting people were, almost nobody actively tried to get to know me. I made a group of friends and all they wanted of me was to adapt to what they expect a college student to be. I just wanted people that can laugh at my jokes and listen to my worries, I didn't want to be a representative of the culture of my country or a smart foreign student to admire, I just wanted friends but didn't get them.
During quarantine just a few of them talked back to me.
I feel confident in my social skills, so I think I'll need to meet new people and keep trying when I get back to school.

But back to the subject. Some of the people I've barely seen interact with each other, sure it's reasonable to assume that they spoke more outside of school. Most relationships usually start with a friendship before the feelings start to develop. But then that leads to me begging the question of why it just for some reason couldn't or wouldn't work out for me. I've seen the people some of the girls at my old schools and even at college got with, and I for damn well know that my mind and heart are far better than theirs. I can put myself in plenty of people's shoes and empathize with their problems. Not all the time, but much more than some of the hicks I was in class with. That feeling of rejection and near abandonment is pretty much what led to me always wondering ""What's wrong with me? I'm positive I'm better then them."" I know you can't rush these things.

1701,bct488,1594854904,1,"I have a very unique situation and feel like no one can relate. 
I am a gay male but due to hormonal condition am often confused as female. 

I lived my teen years focusing solely on my education and had very little social life with zero love life and was quite somewhat content. I suppressed my emotions however by keeping busy... being a good son and student. 

I left home for college at 18 and spent the next 2 years making a small group of friends and partying occasionally etc... and was mentally in an ok-ish but suppressed place. 

However, just before turning 20 I realised that I had zero love life, no gay men showed interest in me when I appeared masculine... and so I made a change and began to dress slightly more femininely (still very androgynous). As soon as I did this... my life began to change and suddenly I got male attention. I look below average as male but very attractive when feminine. I didn‚Äôt know what I was missing. I then kind of went crazy and partied a lot and basically lived my best life... rebelled like I should have as a teen. However... then COVID happened. 

At first it wasn‚Äôt so bad. I spent March and April saving my grades after partying all semester and did very well in the end. After this I got a job as a pharmacy dispenser which I am still working in. 

However... I have recently felt trapped and extremely depressed. I moved away from college and my life is unbelievably dull. Any chance of love was again stripped from me. I can‚Äôt do online dating... it never works. I am removed from any college friends and so can‚Äôt meet anyone that way... I spend weekends with my home friends who are all quiet girls in relationships and I don‚Äôt feel I can relate with them anymore. 


I feel the only thing I lived for all my life has been education... and then partying. Now these two things have been taken from me and I‚Äôm trapped in a boring life alone with my thoughts. The only thing keeping me sane is work. I‚Äôve also lost a whole summer... the first summer I had planned to make really great. I am also confronted with the fact that my youth is running out and young free summers aren‚Äôt endless... and I have to face the reality of growing up. 

As I am a practical person. I am trying to come up with an action plan to get out of my depression or rut. 

One way is to accept my boring life... stay with my family until COVID ends.... present more masculine again and eventually get a job using my econ degree in finance. 

The second option is continue presenting femininely. As I won‚Äôt be able to be taken seriously this way in the workforce... I have amassed a small following (4K) on the internet over quarantine and am considering starting an only fans. Even this way... I still will likely be alone. But I at least I will look good as shallow as that is... it‚Äôs important to me for some reason. 

The third option is honestly to kill myself. As neither of these other options seem appealing. Literally all I want from life is to be young and have fun. I feel I have already burnt myself out from studying and pleasing others. I wasted my youth and now can‚Äôt face getting older. 

I‚Äôve also accepted the fact that I will never find someone who genuinely loves me... who meets my modest standards... and is not just there to treat me as a sexual experience. Which again makes the last option more appealing. 

I feel what makes me feel worse is I am surrounded by beautiful straight people and my life simply can‚Äôt compare. I can never be happy when constantly having to face what I can‚Äôt have when I see friends and family. 

I know I literally sound pathetic. But these feelings have been built up after 21 years of suppression. I am honestly a resilient person. This is just a time of weakness.

I try to make friends at school, but its always their studip crew hanging around. Even a random kid on street would care for me a lot more than any of my classmates. If I died, there would be no one else other than my dad and my mom. If I suddenly dissappeared someday, no one would've noticed.

At first, I was like ""its okay, I just need some distraction."". So I decided to get a Netflix account and start watching some series. Hoping it would fill the hole inside me. But it backfired. I know, this probably sounds silly and child-ish but when I see people care for each other in the series, I STILL FEEL SAD. Because I know, I remember that not a single human soul on earth cares for me. 

I even questioned myself, maybe I was the problem? My look maybe? Maybe how I talk or behave? I tried it all, believe me. I tried... It's like nobody wants me around. It feels like I'm fucking annoying to anyone who talks to me. 

I see people complaning about their so called friends messaging them only when they need help. I think thats something. No one ever messages me at all. NEVER. 

I just one someone to be there for me when I want to share my happiness, my sadness, my nervousness. I just want to be able to talk to someone. Am I asking for too much?

1709,JonColwell,1594848855,1,"Before I get into this, I wanna say that this is gonna be very lengthy. Also if someone out there suffers from Depression, a Depressive Disorder, or PTSD, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on all of this along with advice.

Back in 2013, A cousin of mine tried to date this girl that lived a town over from us. He met this girl through a friend of ours and traveled to the next town over to have a first date with her. They had the first date, he went back home and messaged her, she ghosted him for a solid week and then told him that she didn't want to date him. They remained friends and he told me that I should try to go after her because me and her were basically the same person, and that it would work out good. I added her on Facebook back then and thought that she was cute, but I never went after her until this year.

I found out back in May that she had a Nintendo Switch and that she also had Animal Crossing, and being a major fan of Animal Crossing and thinking she's cute, I tried my hand at seeing how it would go. I messaged her on May 31st talking about the game and how she was doing in it and everything was going wonderful. A day or two later, we were playing Animal Crossing together and the first time she came to my island, there was multiple shooting stars in the sky, and as nerdy and lame as it sounds, I took that as a good sign. We continued to get to know one another and things were looking good.

About four days into us getting to know one another, we both got horny and she ended up sending me a pic of her boobs. While I liked it of course, I had a similar experience with another girl in the past who did this, and I needed to have a talk with her about this. I explained how I didn't want the focus to be on sex or anything sexual, and that we shouldn't rush into anything and just take things slow, get to know one another, and see how that goes because I wanted to have a relationship with her soon. She agreed with me on everything and apologized for the way she acted, and that we could take things slow, but there would be times where she would act like herself because that's the way she is and I had no problem with that.

Things were going really good up until I found out that there was a guy that was texting her on snapchat late at night, and I asked her about it and she told me that she used to work with him at her old job and that they were really good friends. It mostly concerned me because she had confessed to me early when we were getting to know one another that she had sex with a guy she used to work with at her old job, and that she used to have sex with a couple of guys in the past, but that she wanted to be serious now.

I decided to talk to her about the guy that she had sex with at her old job, and she told me about how she didn't want to talk about it and that it wasn't important and didn't matter because that was in her past. She also explained in detail about how many guys she had sex with and it wasn't a whole lot, and that she was friends with some of the guys that she had sex with in the past, but that it never escalated to anything past friends, and that if they tried it she would cut them out of her life for good. She also explained about the guy that she worked with that she was talking to on Snapchat and that they were really close friends and that she talked to him about everything, including me, and that he was happy for her that she had found somebody and that she was happy now. I didn't worry to much about things after that and I believe her because everything she was saying was truthful.

Everything was going awesome. She would have deep conversations with me about things, confess things to me and I would do the same with her. I literally felt like she was the one for me. I had never met a girl that I could talk about anything with, was like myself, shared the same interests but was also different, and also be sexual and intimate with me. I truly felt like this was the one. My soulmate. She told her family and friends about me and she seemed really happy for the first time in a long time in her life, and I felt the same about my life too.

A few weeks back she told me about how she had no other choice but to give her cat up of 2-3 years to the local animal shelter. I asked if she could give her cat to a family member or friend and she told me that she messaged everybody she could think of and that nobody wanted her cat. She said that she didn't want her cat to be killed by some dogs that lived on her street. I told her that, even though it's horrible that she has to give her cat up to the shelter, it was for the best because her cat had a better chance of living than being killed by the dogs. She told me that she understood that, but that her cat got her through some very rough times in her life and that she hated it. She sent me a video on snapchat shortly after of her crying because she didn't wanna give her cat up. I comforted her and helped her get her mind off of everything going on and later on that night, she had told me that I make her super happy, and she thanked me for messaging her about Animal Crossing and that it changed her talking to me. I confessed that she was the best thing to ever happen to me, and that love can hit you out of nowhere and it's indescribable what it did for us. She told me about how she had never been this happy before and that it's weird for her but she loved it. She told me that I was her person and that she could feel it. I told her that I feel the same way and that originally I was adamant that I wasn't gonna believe in love anymore until she came into my life and how I felt the same way that she did, and that it's like we're made for one another. She agreed and said that we were so much alike yet so different at the same time and that it just works for us. She told me that I was so amazing and that she wanted to have me forever. That was on June 25th, and we were on cloud nine.

Also around the end of June, she kept trying to get me to ask her out, and at the time I wasn't fully comfortable with asking her that just yet because I wanted to wait a month. I'm just weird like that I guess. Then on July 2nd at Midnight, I was on the phone with her and I asked her to get on Animal Crossing. I bought her a crown and sent it in a letter to her that read ""You're the queen of my heart."" I told her to check her mail and when she seen it, I asked her if she wanted to be one with me in Body, Mind, and Soul. She said yes and we started dating. I made it official on Facebook and all my friends were so happy. She was my first relationship in nine years.

Things were going awesome and she was a girl I could confess anything to and have a conversation with about anything. I remember how on the Fourth of July we both confessed to one another about our mental health, and she had told me that she had Major Depressive Disorder along with PTSD and Anxiety because she had a bad past, and I told her about how I had ADHD along with Depression and Severe Anxiety. In this conversation, I confessed to her about how it might be too early to say this, but that I loved her. She told me about how she was here for me no matter what and that she thought she loved me, but it was hard for her to tell because she didn't know love in that kind of way because she couldn't show emotion like a normal person. She said that she loved her family, but that she didn't tell them that because she didn't know if it was really love because it was warped in her head. I told her about how it was understandable that she couldn't process feelings and love because of her past, and that I was here for her no matter what and that I cared for her, and that I hoped she cared for me in that way too. She told me that she did care for me so much and how it was gonna take time for her to process her feelings to express them more to me. She also told me that, out of all the people she cared deeply about, I was on that list. She told me the other people on that list was her family, and that I was on that list of people that she wanted in her life no matter what. I told her that I felt the same way about her and I took comfort in knowing that.

On July 6th, she was at Her Dad's, and she sent me a photo on Snapchat of her in a dress Her Grandma gave her. I told her that she looked cute in it and she posted a photo of herself on Facebook wearing the dress along with a status that said that I called her cute and that she loved it. This was the last day that she was herself. After that day, things started going downhill.

About a week ago, I was talking to her on the phone one night and she told me about how she dreaded the next day and I asked why? she told me that she didn't want to explain it and that she just didn't want to do what she was about to do the next day and that she will hate it for a long time. It didn't take me long after that to catch onto what she was meaning. She was giving her cat up to the shelter the next day. So the next morning, [I sent her this.](https://imgur.com/a/o17BetC) Not only to be sweet but to let her know I'm here.

 [An hour later this was the only thing she said to me.](https://imgur.com/a/IpQONDd)

 I kept supporting her and talking to her and she said to me that she felt bad, and that if you don't hear a lot from me today, that's why. I told her to take all the time that she needed. She talked to me here and there that day, but not a whole lot. Later on that night, I asked if I could call her. She said to me that she would think about it, but it was probably gonna be yes. She also told me about how she didn't want to talk about her cat and didn't want to talk about anything sad. I said okay that sounds good and things were going good on the phone. Now 99% of the time that we're on the phone, we facetime one another. She didn't want to do that during that night, which I could understand because of what had happened that day.

We fell asleep on the phone and the next morning, she seemed mean, as she usually does when she wakes up from sleep at all. She told me that she had to go babysit her cousins and that she would talk at me later. About two hours later, she sent me a video on snapchat saying that she had smoked some weed and that she was feeling better. She also had said that her cousin was at her house instead and she sent me another vid of her cousin. I didn't hear from her again until five hours later. She messaged me telling me that she had took a nap, and we called and talked on the phone again, but no facetime again. She immediately fell asleep about 30 minutes onto being on the phone with me.

The next morning was the same as the last, she was mean and then told me that she was gonna take a shower and message me back later. About two hours later, she sends me a video on snap saying that she had mexican food and some weed and that today is going to be a good day. So she smokes some weed and talks to me for a little bit, and eats the mexican. I don't hear from her again for five hours and she messages me telling me that she took a nap. After that she went back down to her cousins house to smoke some more weed. Then she told me about how she was going to bed because she had a headache and that she couldn't find her blood pressure medicine because she has high blood pressure. So we said goodnight to one another and she messaged me the next morning.

She woke up Saturday morning and told me that she still had a really bad headache, but that she had found her blood pressure medicine. I told her to just get some rest and see if it goes away to which she said that she planned on it. About an hour later, she messages me saying that she's in and out of sleep but that her headache is easing up to which I said that's awesome! A few hours later, she messages me saying yess and that apparently she was going fishing now, and if I don't hear anything from her, that's why. I said oh okay I hope you have some fun and she said I hope that I catch something. I also had asked her about who she was going with and she told me her cousins. She sent that message to me around 5 PM. At around 12 AM, I seen that she had previously been online on Facebook. I checked my messages on snap and seen that she read my message, but didn't reply back, which scared me. In the almost three months that we've deeply known each other, she had never left me on read and I instantly got flashbacks about being ghosted in the past by girls. So I decided to message her on Facebook messenger and [This is what she said to me.](https://imgur.com/a/47dJKLo) The audio message that I sent was me saying oh okay, I seen that you opened my snap message but didn't reply back and I got concerned.

I talked to her Sunday and she seemed miserable and was being mean here and there at times but also being sweet too. I asked how she was feeling and she said that she felt like she couldn't breathe and that her allergies were killing her so she decided to take some Benadryl. After that we talked for a little bit more and she fell asleep and messaged me back later.

I asked her that night if I could call her and she said once she got back from her cousins house smoking weed that I could call and so I did. While we were on the phone, she was playing Animal Crossing, and usually we have a good conversation while she's playing too. She barely said anything the entire time we were on the phone. I kept acting like my usual self and was being funny too like I usually do, and while she did laugh here and there, most of the time she was deadpan. Just silent and at one time, tried to argue. She was just so serious the whole time and I had never seen her that way. She told me about how she had to babysit her cousins in the morning and that she didn't wanna do it.

I asked her due to her not talking a lot if she still felt bad. She told me that she did and that she still felt tired. Then after 51 minutes of being on the phone with me, she told me that she was gonna walk down to her cousins and stay all night. She told me that she would message me when she got down there. We talked for a little bit, and then she fell asleep.

Monday, she didn't say anything to me and ended up changing her Facebook cover photo from me to something else and then around noon, [she sent this to me.](https://imgur.com/a/jh1CVz0) 

I said in response to her about how I'm shocked and hurt and that it kinda felt like in the beginning that we were friends when we were talking about Animal Crossing and playing Animal Crossing together and that we were friends and that we started crushing on one another. I also agreed that at times it did feel like we were going too fast with things like the nudes and dirty talk, but that we had a talk about this, and I reminded her about how I told her how I felt like we needed to lay low on the sexual stuff because I didn't want it to be a focus on that and how I didn't want it to feel like we were rushing into something and how I felt like we should take it slow and get to know one another a little bit better, and how it felt like that way and it felt like we were doing that. I also said to her that I didn't know that she felt like me as just a friend and not in that way because I felt that way about her. I also reminded her of how she said to me that you feel like I was the right one for you and you felt it, but after putting thought into it, that wasn't the feeling. I said to her that I couldn't understand why she couldn't come to me in the past and say ""Hey, we need to talk about this, I'm having this feeling."" and that we could have done something right then and there, and I told her that with the way that we talked to one another minus the nudes and dirty talk that I felt something really true and a true connection to her and that I felt that I really found the right person for me through her and that I wasn't trying to make her out to feel bad, that this was just coming from my heart, and that it just hurt me to know this. I told her that I cared for her and really liked her, and to hear that news really hurts me. I told her that she doesn't feel the same way that I do on this and that I just wished that we could have talked about all of this and tried to fix it, but that there ain't no use in that anymore I guess. I told her that it's cool if you wanna be friends and that's fine and that I'm okay with that. I told her again how I just wished that we could have talked about this more and how I wished that we could have talked about her feeling confused and stuff, but that it's okay and fine. I told her that she had better things to do with her life than to spend with me and I respect that. I wished her the best of luck in life wherever she may go, and that I would be here as her friend.

Shortly after that I had posted a sad tweet and I posted a photo of myself on Instagram. She unfollowed me on Twitter and Instagram shortly after. Yesterday, I had viewed her Snapchat Story and she had tweeted for the first time in a week 10 minutes after viewing her story a gif of a little girl rolling her eyes saying cry me a river and wrote ""constant mood"" over top of it. After that, she blocked me on snapchat and unfriended me on Facebook even though I hadn't said anything to her since she sent me the break up text on Monday.

I don't know if she's having an episode of PTSD/Depression, or if she truly hates me forever, or if she's taking a break from me. All I know is that it fucking sucks that all of this happened. Everything was going so good between the two of us and then after she gave the cat up, she didn't act like herself and things just fell apart. I read online that people with PTSD use Emotional Avoidance to cope, and that people with PTSD have trouble¬†experiencing positive feelings such as happiness or love. That could explain why she said the past few days she hasn't been happy with me because a few days ago is when she gave her cat up. I kinda believe that she could be experiencing an episode of Depression/PTSD where she gave the cat up and she truly cared for the cat and this is how she copes. All my friends tell me to give her some space and time and she will message me back eventually. I kinda believe that, but I'm not sure. I know she posted a photo on her Instagram today of her in the pool. I don't think I could date her again because if she lost it over something like this, I could only imagine what it would be like if we got into an argument or something big happened. I just hope that she doesn't hate my guts forever and that we can just be good friends.

TL;DR I met a girl through a cousin, started talking to her and playing Animal Crossing with her, we developed feelings for one another, we started dating, things were going awesome, she told me that she had Depression and PTSD and that she was giving her cat up to the animal shelter, she ended up giving up the cat to the shelter, she started not acting like herself shortly after, and then broke up with me and unfriended me off all social media.",lonely,My first relationship in nine years only lasted a week.,2020-07-16 07:34:15

1713,Tavok_V,1594847155,1,"(English is not my main language) 

I'll start explaining the ghosting meaning: ""Dissapear without saying anything. Ignore people, not answering, being a douche (?"" 

Probably you guys have heard that ""ghosting"" is a term used in relationships, not in friendships, but here's my problem. I was a person that used to have a few of friends, in chats, in videogames, in social media and irl. I was having a nice time with them, even if I had social anxiety, depression or suicidal tendencies, they helped me a lot.

Then the Covid-19 came and everything went downhill. As I said before, I suffer from social issues, I can't start a conversation or answer messages as fast as everyone does. This screwed everything up. 

I suddenly started to get bored of answering messages, interacting with people I love, and being such a boring guy. I started just to play games alone, sleeping a lot, being with myself only, never answering my friends that used to say ""Hi"" a lot, and more ""depressed sadboy stuff"", I even ignored a girl that wanted to start a relationship with me. 

That's how my ghosting started, I didn't want to do anything related to socializing, I just didn't feel the need to do it, that was maybe a depression-thing related. 

I talked with my nearest friends about this, but they never understood what I really felt. I ""broke up"" with that dream girl, because I was not paying attention to her and because I started to became colder. And you know the rest, people starting to leave and I was the only guilt one. 

People I used to talk a lot, have already forgotten me, or maybe they got annoyed and bored of talking to me, why? because of me. 

I was supposed to talk more in the cuarantine times, but I ruined the only friendships I had, no one cares about me anymore, if I send a ""Hi"" they won't answer anymore (I already tested it). 

I feel so lonely, but I can't do anything to change, not with my mental state right now. 

I would really love to know how to stop ghosting, I don't want to lose my future friends again. Thanks. 

This is my first post by the way. So I don't really know how this works.",lonely,"I do ghosting to my friends, and I'm alone now",2020-07-16 07:05:55

1726,icarus2a,1594839178,1,"Im 33, living in belgium. I feel like im losing grip of the last bit of control i had over myself.
My life always has been a mess. Since i was young i had ocd, anxiety. Then pure-o, harm-o.
I ran away from school. Always had panic attacks in school. Doubled my last year. Very isolated year.
Then i had to go to university but didnt know what to study. I felt like i missed my normal evolution of my life. I chose a subject. But in university the panic got worse. Ran away also. Was isolated. Dropped out after 2 years. Then i got sick. Something with my brain and eyes. I started working. Worked 5 years. Until i fell in depression of my desease. Im 8 years at home now. In therapy. I live with my parents still. I sought relief in gambling. Lost everything. Again and again. Lost 500k in btc. Im broke. And i have troubles controlling my impulses. Not only gambling, but everything. I installed tinder already 30 times, to delete 2 days later, because i feel i have nothing to offer. I have little friends. Im impulsive towards them 2. If they dont write me or if i feel ridiculous because of a gamblebinge i delete their numbers. I feel like an option. I had one girl of tinder wuth who i broke contact 5 times, but i then write back 1 day later. Untill she is fed up with it. I know she was not good for me. But the loneliness makes you grasp onto anything. I feel i have missed my whole life. And the thought of knowing you get older, makes me feel more deperate and pathetic. I cant believe this is my life. I dont want to be 40 or 60 and still feel like this  but i already feel 20 years like this. Whats the purpose of it all anyway. Getting older.

I've finally met someone who I can be 110% honest with; no masks, no fake smiles, no ""I'm okay"" when I feel not okay at all. 




I had surrounded myself with people that have an expectation that I should be okay and therefore ignore what's really going on for me inside. It's really not their fault, I've taught them how to treat me by allowing complacency. 




Seek out that one person that can see through those masks and understand that you all have experiences in life that may bring you down. That your feelings are acknowledged and valued, that you're heard and seen. 




We all need that one person who will see through the BS and walls that we build up. Someone who takes you as you are and makes you realise that it's perfectly okay to ""not be okay"". Someone that wants to see the real you. Someone that understands and doesn't run away as soon as you're not all smiles and laughter.

1754,Rusheddd,1594795354,1,"Sup. I‚Äôm 17 and had a load of friends growing up,  used to go out with friends and bike ride go to movies etc. Also had a lot of good friends online for many years. These people felt like brothers to me, sure I had a lot of friends where I lived but the guys I met online were something else. We met playing black ops 2 (good old days) we were a group of 4 growing up, we were all the same age pretty sure it was 13-14. Anyways ever since we met we never stopped playing games and began to forget my RL friends and moved away from them. I didn‚Äôt really care much because of how much fun I had with these guys. We all lived separated I was in Florida two guys in New York and the other was from Europe (never told me where). We played games online for a total of 4-3 years, moved from ps3 to ps4 and continued to play as the squad as we were back in black ops 2. We actually were saving up money to go see each other one day (17 now and actually have the money to go meet them). But it‚Äôs 2020 now and unfortunately shit changed. Everyone changed. One of my friends (Brandon) met this girl online that he really liked and before I go on Brandon was usually The spoiled one in the group, he would always get loads of Christmas money from his parents and birthday but he was a nice guy he even bought games for us like he bought me dlc maps for bo3 so we could all play and beat the Easter eggs in zombies. Anyways Back to the point, me and the boys knew this girl was not for him and it was obvious she was using him for money we told him countless times but he would not listen and began to fade away from us. Then one day we caught our boy Brandon in party chat with The girl he liked and we thought it would be a ‚Äúfunny‚Äù idea to all go in the party together earrape the fuck outta him and blast hoes mad. (Ngl this was childish but I was dying) so we did just that we knew we were going to get kicked out but he decided to block ever single one of us even our alt accounts. We all felt really bad  and tried calling him through our phones and rejected all our calls. We waited couple weeks and still nothing, we decided to move on saddened that we lost our best friend to a girl who used him for money. The group of 4 was now 3 and at this time we were around the age 15-16. Months after losing Brandon things went back to normal and then we moved to high school and lost another good friend . His name was Kevin really chill guy and was really smart. However he could no longer play games anymore and he decided to just focus in school (damn parents) we understood him and wanted the best for him. So in the last day together the 3 of us decided to go back to black ops 2 ps3 and beat every single Easter egg possible and we did just that and after it was all over we all cried, first time I actually heard my friends cry over the mic. I was gonna miss him a lot but I‚Äôm glad he told us what he decision was. Kevin then sold his ps3 and ps4 and gave us his PlayStation account so he knew it was in good hands. The group of 3 now went down to 2 it was just me and this guy named Daniel but we liked to call him after his psn ‚ÄúChip‚Äù. Just realized never told you what my name was and it‚Äôs Blade that‚Äôs what I was called among them but back to the point, Me and chip grew a strong relationship together and at this point we‚Äôre both the age that I am now 17. We had a good time together and met some new friends of course but it was mainly us two. And of course things had to change again. I‚Äôm not sure what happened to chip or if he had issues with his family he never told me, but he began to become a full on racist. Now I‚Äôm not black but my dad is and still get pissed off when he said the n word to anyone. So me being a dumbass I just decided to let it be and just ignore whenever he said it. But now he was saying the hard ‚Äúr‚Äù and he actually found it funny. I didn‚Äôt know what to say or think anymore, I told him about it and he would always say ‚Äúwhy are you offended your not even black‚Äù. It always pissed me the fuck off when he said it and I would argue of how stupid he was. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore as he never changed his dirty mouth and made the decision that felt was good for me. Leave him. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it was hard leaving him as he was my best friend and my buddy to play games with but i just had to. This happened earlier this year and now I‚Äôm all alone. The best friends that meant a lot to me are all gone, separated, and moved on. I tried calling,texting, nothing worked to get a reach of my old friends.

I'm a pretty solitary person. I like being able to do what I want in my free time. I have a few hobbies that I enjoy immensely. I love the quiet time that I can give myself when I need it, or loud music/movies/lectures.¬†


I got out of a toxic relationship last year, and I've been ready for dating or more. Not sure what to call it anymore it's been 5/6 years.¬†


I have been seeing someone for a while, but they didn't want to rush things. Then it was they don't want to commit until they're ready to give me %100, then it's another thing and another. I'm not going to push them, if they're not ready they just aren't, but I was getting a bit attached to this person.¬†No one is wanting to stick around, even with me being upfront about what I'm looking for. And I don't have anyone to completely speak openly about this. And I guess the folks who I have been trying to talk to about it aren't actively listening. But I'm very used to being only partially heard. 


I like to be able to use my time the way I want but I do also want to be able to spend time with a partner. I'm at the point where I have enough hours to myself now and I want to share space with someone else, in a non platonic way.

i wasn‚Äôt a confident kid in high school i still don‚Äôt think i am but i‚Äôm good at faking it in social situations. i‚Äôm good at putting on a mask when i‚Äôm out but she was the only one who could see through it. she knew the real me and valued me no matter what. i‚Äôm very oblivious to when girls like me i can see it for other people but never for myself. it all when to shit when one night we hooked up , it was amazing but i was confused. i started to find out she liked me but idk if i liked her and i didn‚Äôt want to be one foot in and one foot out. i cared a lot about her i didn‚Äôt wanna be a shitty bf. she had a lot of shitty bf‚Äôs i didn‚Äôt wanna be one. 

i thought she deserved someone who would love her wholeheartedly but i couldn‚Äôt. maybe i wasn‚Äôt comfortable with my self to be in a relationship. after we hu she tired to do it more and see me more but i kept finding bs excuses to not let it happen. i was an asshole to her i treated her like shit. i pushed her away because i didn‚Äôt know how i felt and i couldn‚Äôt communicate what i felt. i blamed it on wanting to focus on school as we were in grade 11 and my marks were shit but i needed to get into the habit of studying for uni. i‚Äôve finished my first year of uni and i still feel like i made a mistake with her. i don‚Äôt tend to regret things but i regret how i treated her.

 i‚Äôve tried to reach out several times but she blocked me on everything, as she should i was an absolute cunt. if i could i‚Äôd apologize to her today and explain everything properly without lying and be honest. i wouldn‚Äôt except her to even listen or care she put so much time into me and i blew her off like she was nothing. idk what to do i never really had a legit long term relationship after her i‚Äôve fucked around with other girls which feels good in the moment but not genuine. i don‚Äôt like to just fuck a girl and move on i want love. 

i feel like i expect too much from any girl i meet i can‚Äôt help it she genuinely cared about me. i feel lonely and that i‚Äôll never have that with another girl again. i feel like i don‚Äôt deserve it. idk what to do anymore. most things go my way in my life except my love life. i don‚Äôt believe in god and stuff like that but i feel like this is karma for treating a genuine person who cared and loved me like shit. maybe i deserve to be lonely and unloved. now she‚Äôs in a relationship and apparently happy she fully deserves it i don‚Äôt wanna invade and fuck shit up i‚Äôd rather her be happy and loved cause i couldn‚Äôt be that person for her. 

i‚Äôve tired being happy by myself but i can‚Äôt i need people around me and since covid i‚Äôve had a lot less people around me. i resorted to smoking a shit load of weed. i use it to numb my mind so i don‚Äôt think about my problems i just run away from them. but i‚Äôve stopped smoking for a week or so and everything is flooding back in. today was a low point im very tempted to get another dab pen and smoke my problems away but my lungs are fucked i don‚Äôt wanna hurt my body because i‚Äôm mentally weak. idk what to do anymore.

I soon realized why they were making fun of me..the worst thing happened that made me hate the opposite gender, it was a ""joke"" all along, they knew what i liked and they pretended to like it too, they played with my new type of feelings like a toy, i stopped interaction with the opposite gender completely unless it was a must (teacher calling etc) i stopped watching porn(i wasn't a coomer), i really hated the opposite gender.

1. Waking up to my puppy, a black lab, resting her head on my pillow now that she has plenty of room to stretch out
2. The scent of fresh coffee beans
3. The final footstep of a challenging run
4. Going on casual dates and hearing new people's stories
5. Laughing with friends over WhatsApp about stupid jokes &amp; video clips
6. Connecting with friends' friends to deliberately grow my social life
7. Paddling the inflatable raft that I spontaneously bought at 1am
8. Panoramic mountain views after a tough hike
9. Calling my family more often
10. Sleeping peacefully (never going to bed upset after a fight)

It's not easy. I still reflect on being with my ex sometimes, and no amount of keeping busy will distract me from missing certain things about the relationship.

1802,byesexualdisaster,1594765900,2,"I () have never had a problem with making friends, I tend to talk about anything and everything and people seem to like that I suppose? But my issue is that among the masses of surface level friends -acquaintances, the ones who I share memes with, and the ones I share my hobbies with- I can never find a best friend. 

I desperately crave the deep connection of someone I know cares for me just as much as I care for them. 

In the vast majority of all the friendships I had, the ones where I hoped that this person could become the one, it ended up that they never reciprocated the complete adoration I felt for them. To me, they seemed like the person I could vent to and who understood my humor. But to them, I was the acquaintance that they didn't hate but never really put too much effort into. 


All I want is a BEST friend. A friend who laughs at my jokes, and I can banter with. The kind of person who can tease me,and my (professionally diagnosed) anxiety doesn't flare up telling me bad things, and I know that they still love me. The person who I can hug without being afraid of rejection.

People look at me and assume I have friends but I don‚Äôt. Why do I have phone ? It‚Äôs just filled with men that only want to sleep with me or talk to me when they‚Äôre bored at night. No female friends at all. After, one used me for something she ghosted and the other ghosted when she got boyfriend . I haven‚Äôt had true friend since maybe since  high school? More I think about they weren‚Äôt true friends either. 
As 26 year old woman , i feel I‚Äôm at rock bottom. Last night , I cried for hours staring at the wall. I feel nobody cares about me or loves me in this world . I lost my job..I‚Äôm unemployed and broke. I don‚Äôt know how I will survive . I‚Äôm stuck in hopelessness and the loneliness makes it worse! I tried making friends online. I can‚Äôt find any female friends. It seems like women don‚Äôt want to be friends with other women. Well the men they have no interest in me besides s e x u a l  or listening to their problems. But when I need to talk they are never around.  For example, I was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with a man that was going through rough time and homelessness. I was too nice and dumb I gave him money and helped him. When his life got better..what did he do? Ghosted me. I never get the energy back I put into friendships just used.

My Snap is filled with men sending me unsolicited n u d e pictures of them or saying ‚Äúnice b00bs or what they want to do to me s e x u a l l y . I have entertained some of it just to have someone talk to.  I get tired of opening up app and only getting pics of a man‚Äôs private parts . But they always end up using me. It makes me feel absolutely worthless. That my value is only how I look. Sometimes I find out these men have wives or girlfriends and lie about their entire life . I know majority just want to prey on me and use me for their own selfish reasons. I completely regret ever talking to them.  I regret sending n u d e photos of myself just to have someone to talk to and to not feel lonely . Who knows what they do with pics and videos of me . I feel I can‚Äôt trust people . They disappear anyway. I feel abandoned by everyone in my life . My family , parents, and people I thought cared about me . I feel abandoned from relationships with men I was in. Part of it is my fault because I‚Äôm too nice and trust easily. When the truth is there are some people in this world with no conscience or simply evil. I feel so much regret for trusting people and opening up to be let down over and over again . The human in me gets attached to people that never cared about me in the first place. I‚Äôm writing this just as rant because I‚Äôm struggling . I missed my appointment with my therapist today on the phone because I was too depressed to get out of bed.

1812,justanormalhuman2016,1594760161,3,"This is a long post , idk if anyone will read it. It's quite badly written since I'm just getting things of my chest without order and details like I usually do.


It's summer break now. I can do what I like. I play video games, work out at home , watch YouTube and rarely code. However I can't escape it. When I'm building in Minecraft, doing my bicep curls, watching YouTube, the thought of loneliness is still here. I hate it. I hate this. It's hard to describe what I feel. I feel so miserable and lonely.... 8th grade is soon and it will be just like 7 the grade, I will have no friends, isolate myself in breaks and still be a skinny ugly dude.

Doesn't help my family is pretty toxic . My dad is an asshole, he probably would kill me if he knew who I truly am. (I'm agnostic athiest and my dad thinks people who leave Islam like me should be killed , he thinks isis are normal people) 

My dad abuses me , he haven't done physically in few months but mentally he does Evey few days. He makes fun of me for being lonely, same with my little sister. I'm always with her but she is still an asshole.

My parents and my little sister fight a lot, she isn't allowed to wear jeans with holes because they are forbidden in Islam and she hate them because she isn't allowed to express herself (she is in 4th grade).

Also forgot to mention they tell her not be friends with swedish people and try befriend Muslims only. If this isn't a cult idk what is. This is racism but they say they aren't racist and swedish are racist . However they know my sister ha many swedish friends. They say my sister is bieng brainwashed into bieng athiest and wearing ""revealing and bad"" clothes such as shorts and swiming clothes.

I always sympathize with my sister since she also secretly isn't a Muslim and knows how it's feel to live a lie. 

I love my mom but she is mentally unstable and I'm the one who calms her down. I love her but wish if she just sees a therapist but she won't since she can't talk about our fucked up family in front of a therapist since my dad would be in jail if anyone knows the abuse he does. My mom also physically abuses my little brother but when I stand up she goes inane and hits me . I can't stand this shit.

I hate arranged marriages. My mom and dad should have never been married. I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask to be here . I can't stand my dad's fucked up homophobic and toxic believes . I hate this cult called Islam. 

I can't stand the toxicity in this family. Just knowing my dad would kill me and my mom would probably disown me if they know Im not a cult member is scary and makes me cry before sleep.

At least at home I can do things to escape reality like playing video games or working out. At school it's hell times two.

I also have self confidence problems, I'm so socially awkward. Is it because of my fucked up family or because my bad self imagery. I'm very underweight and can't seem to gain weight. I work out hard but there is something wrong . In the past 4 months I haven't noticed that much change, I've gained just 1 pound of muscle. Just 1 fucking pound of biceps and traps. My ribcage is visible and I fucking hate it, I hate my thin wrist. I never wear a t shirt in school for that reason. 

I'm also not allowed in a real gym until 18 and my mom and teachers at school tell me I eat to little even tho I feel full all time, maybe it's lack of physicall activity, I never go outside cause I have nothing to do, no friends, nothing . Why should I go outside and walk by myself. People will think I'm a weirdo, I once walked in the night by myself because I needed physicall activity and a girl In my class said I'm a weirdo for it. I hate this.
 
I used to be fat, now I'm underweight. I never got a good health state. Im 5'6.7 (I measured 1.5 months ago) and 104 pounds (1.5 months ago, we have no way to measure at home) 
 I try to watch my diet however I can't measure, its impossible to measure how much I eat at home since my parents won't buy me a weight measure. I'm skinny but have moobs, whenever I try to do barbel bench press I'm just too scared to drop it and break my ribs. It also doesn't help lack of energy since I work out at 12 am since thats when my little brother is sleep and my dad isn't listening to Islamic propoganda.

Also my dad doesn't buy me that much healthy food, he buys crap fast food and snacks all time and spends 25% of our money on his cigarettes. 


When school starts, I will be back to isolating myself. No real friends. There are like 3 class mates who sometimes see me by myself and sitt with me, however that's rare and I don't know them on personal level, only surface.


I don't want more of this. I just want not have a toxic cult family. I wish I had parents who loves me unconditionally and not because they think I'm part of their cult . I wish I had friends I went outside with. I wish I didn't sit alone at school. 

Whenever someone tries to socialize with me, I ruin everything. In 7th grade, the  classmates I talked about earlier (2 girls, 1 guy). One of the girls asked me if I wanted to sit with them in the drawing lesson. I was so happy that day. However because of my awkwardness I ignored then like an asshole and never talked to them that day. I also remember when that girl again asked me if I wanted to sit with them in the lunch table (the guy wasn't there, it was all girls and I'm terrible at talking at girls so me bieng an asshole I overthinked and said maybe to that offer, I never say with them that day, I still feel bad 5 months later)

So yeah , 8th grade will be the same , isolation, someone tries to socialize with me but I push them away, more isolation, probably suicidal thoughts again (haven't had them in a few months but they may return) and more of bieng a ugly socially awkward skinny dude. 

I know this post is kinda random, I just have had this thoughts inside me for a long time and can't stand holding them in.

It's been a month and it's still as raw as that day. I cried a lil' on the train to my hometown in secret, I go to sleep and wake up everyday before work with a lump in my throat.

I decided to post on this account, which I used to write my first ever story anonymously in the middle of the night while she was asleep next to me, I showed her my goofy little story and she made me feel so proud of it and relentlessly tried to push me to write more, which is another thing I didn't stick to.

1828,soundsgr8,1594752634,3,"So, first post on reddit, not sure how things work around here,

I'm gonna present myself 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22, and have close to zero real friends.

I dropped college when I realized the few friends I managed to make through high school were no longer around, and how difficult it would be to make others. It soon became obvious that I would spend most of my two years alone, and two years is a ton of time so I quickly figured I wouldn't stand the situation for that long. So I quitted, sure it wasn't the right choice but what's done is done.

&amp;#x200B;

Spent the two following years doing nothing but sitting all day behind a computer screen, too lazy, scared and busy being a coward about my problems to go forward and face the the real world.

So I didn't even look for a job, I told my dad I was but he ended up figuring out I wasn't actually doing shit (1 year and a half without even a job interview, god I wonder how he guessed) so he helped me to find one.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's been almost a year since I have it. Sure, it's a low wage, but at least I have that going for me. It's a start.

&amp;#x200B;

But fucking hell that's about the only positive thing there is.

No friends since highschool (and I only see the ones I made back then about once a year more or less, they all have nice studies and a good social situation going for them, we clearly have close to nothing in common now)

No girlfriend, that goes without saying, I guess I'm what people would call an incel, even though I have zero hate towards women or anything

No passion or drive for anything, the thing I'm the best at is wasting my free time on some dumb video games which can, admittedly, be a relief and a good way to escape a little, but will end up being my grave if I spend my life on them

and a lot of regrets I carry, about my life and the past decisions I've made.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to whine about my life, and the reason why I just detailed some parts of it is because I'd like to see if any of you can relate, or if I'm the only so called loser around here.

We live in a paradoxical era, where we can use internet to communicate with people all around the world, yet so many people are desperately lonely and can't find their place anywhere.

I'm not saying I tried everything I could to get back on track. Of course I'm lazy and of course other things can be made to find a way. But I'm sick of procrastination and doing nothing with my life, I'm 22 ffs, I can't just let time fly and end up in the same situation when I'll be 30

Yet it's really hard, at least for me, to find motivation to do things when you're alone, and that's why I try to find people to build something with

Quite vague I know, because  I'm not sure myself yet. I don't know, we could try to create a videogame, write a story, learn together a new language, or encourage each others in our projects, whatever they are

1830,BO_GONSHA,1594751270,2,"I honestly feel like I loathe the idea of drawing attention to myself. I definitely work to keep myself out of others line of sight. I never really speak unless spoken to. I don't recall the last time I initiated a conversation. I also go through small intervals of deep isolation where I even shut out those closest to me.

But at the same time I find myself longing. Almost like I'm missing something. I know humans are social creatures and we need some interaction. I know I am the cause to this longing. I just don't get why. I don't get why I continue to push away from something I sometimes feel like I desperately crave. I don't get why I turn my back when the world presents me with opportunities to pacify my feelings of loneliness. Even now as I post this, I'll probably just hide away from anyone who replies.

I've been living in shared flats and believe me, it's not a great experience. This applies to everything. Food is much cheaper if you buy it on big amounts, but you can't do it if you're the only one eating. If you lose your job and you have an so, he/she will have your back until you find something else. You support each other, you have each other's back. If you lose your job and live on your own, well, good luck. Just think about the life we've been told we're supposed to have: owning a house, having a family, holidays and shit. I just don't concieve renting rooms for the rest of my life, or not having anyone to rely on temporarily if things don't go well financially.

I was playing Saints Row 2 with my dad. He told me about a guy who messaged him wanting to play with him, 

I looked up his profile and pretty soon he messaged me. At first I was creeped out because I thought he was a stalker because my dad kept making jokes about him being in my backyard. 

After some time I asked him ""Are you lonely?"" And he asked me if I meant in real life or on xbox. I then asked him if he was lonely in general. He didn't know what I meant so I asked him if he was lonely in real life or on xbox.

He said both. 

And at that moment it all made sense to me, why he kept messaging me and asked me ""u promise"" when I said I'd play with him.

But right now I feel like I need to be there for him, because he might have no else in his life. He could be suicidal and something might throw him over the edge.

I, in good consance, couldn't just ignore him.

I used to cry about being lonely which is sad to admit but I just felt so out of place in high school. Ever since I graduated, I kept myself preoccupied with college. I took classes during the summer to keep myself busy the whole year. This year, I decided to take time to ""relax"" and take a ""break"" instead of taking summer courses. Ironically, I haven't been ""relaxing"" or destressing. I feel the way I did in high school and I'm scared of letting it destroy my mental stability the way it did during that time. I've been doing the same things over and over again and I've been feeling so drained and extremely bored (similar to my summers during high school and if I'm following the same pattern,  it's going to cause my mental health to go down a slippery slope). I can't go outside or do anything (because of covid). I've been trying to text some friends but it's like talking to a wall.

Some of you guys post ages some of you don‚Äôt. Some of you are young, I think a lot of you are but let me tell you something you might not know.

The real world isn‚Äôt like high school or the stupid fuckin tv shows we watch. It‚Äôs not full of a million friends and busy stuff to do everyday. The sad thing is life is full of work and paying bills. If you get lucky you find a companion to drive you nuts and then you have kids together to drive you nuts. But really life is boring even then eventually because it‚Äôs consumed by taking your kids to all of their activities. Maybe you make friends with your kids‚Äô parents but even then that can suck. 

It‚Äôs not easy to be involved in someone else‚Äôs life because people are so dang busy with their own lives. I know I‚Äôve lived it long enough to see this. There are enough people posting the same things over and over. We need to get together and create a fucking group chat connected to our phones that constantly ding every time someone sends a message. 

All anyone wants is to be included in this life. We have the technology guys. And there are enough bored people here to make this shit happen. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have to be so damn lonely and on the verge of suicide. 

We are social creatures and it is too fucking easy to get stuck inside of our own heads.

1879,melncholy_watermelon,1594706289,1,"it hurts me that the only friend that I have to accompany me in my class has been ignoring me since the start of the year.
I have been friends with these 4 wonderful introverts (such as myself) since 2018. we were considered ""the loosers/the quiet ones"" in the class, so we got along well. we were in the same class until 2019 and we were so close with each other. Ive never called someone besties, and all 4 of them were the only best friends that I had that never talk behind each others backs.
in 10th grade (2020), we all have to choose what specific subject we want to take. different subjects, different classes. me and (lets call her S) S wanted to take Technical Drawing, the other two (which are the ones that im more close to) wanted to take Biology, and the other one took Accounting.
even though we were separated into three different classes, we still managed to keep close.
me and S got into this class that APPARENTLY had so many S's other friends. she is an introvert, but shes really friendly. I didnt know. slowly, as the months passes by, she ignores me. she would leave me on read, she would ignore me when I ask her a question in class, she would always immediately wanna be grouped with her other friends. I would always have to group with strangers and it makes me so uncomfortable.
the pandemic kindda help me a lil by forcing us to stay at home, thus letting me do my work on my own, and not needing to group up in class and discuss together (as how our teachers would always do).
the problem is, schools starting soon and my hearts beating fast. I need a friend in class to help me understand shit when the teachers going too fast or anything.
I was texting them in our group chat and I mentioned about being ignored and S having many other friends. 

I said ""S are always with her other friends that she ignores me""

S then replied with ""then, make friends!""

I said ""its not that easy"" 

S said ""OMG WHATS SO HARD ABOUT IT???""

my heart crushed. she doesnt understand me. she doesnt have social anxiety like I do. even after 2 years of being your friend, you still cant see that? you cant see that I cant make friends on command?
I miss my 3 other friends. I miss sitting next to them and being able to ask them anything. I miss making jokes with them. I miss sitting at the back and just eating crackers together while the teacher is babbling like a grandma. I miss missing work and knowing that they are there to back me up. I miss feeling so happy to see them in the class when I go to school. I miss having them there with me.

1880,Edsast,1594706227,1," here, I've recently started feeling lonely and I don't know what to do. Due to the lockdown schools are closed and the only 3 friends which I had in school don't see me anymore. I go to my grandpa's school and I don't know why people treat me a lot more differently than they would do to a normal student around them. The only 3 friends I have in school have a lot more different beliefs than me and different interests or ideas like they're basically quite conservative. 

 I left my old school 4 years ago in which I actually had a good friend whom I used to play with and have lunch with but those times have gone and at this point I don't have anybody to talk to apart from one more friend which I had in my old school whom I used to talk with everyday but we don't talk a lot these days and she basically stopped texting me it's just when we occasionally talk about some kind of a controversy on the internet or stuff like that. 

I attend my online classes everyday and my math tutor comes home and teaches me. It's just a boring cycle that never ends, it goes like this. Wake up at 8 AM or 7 AM and I don't even get enough sleep because of my exams (I have to study till midnight many a times and my parents don't give a fuck about the 9 hour sleep thing they just think 7 hours is enough), my online classes end at 12:30 PM and then I have to prepare for all the stuff my tutor's gonna take when he arrives at 2:30 PM, his class ends at 4:00 PM and then I have to do all the homework that he has given me which ends at 8:00 PM and I have to focus on studying again memorising chapters. I don't get a lot of time to do other things but I basically haven't got anything to do. I'm lonely and I don't have anybody else to talk to and share my common interests with them. I come from a wealthy family but you know it's like I have nothing to live for or I have no goals to achieve, it's like go to uni and then take over your father's business which makes me see life as something which is completely pointless at the moment. 

   Whenever I look at Chemistry I feel dizzy, physics is boring, biology is a bit interesting and Math makes me feel suicidal. I hate the majority of the subjects in school apart from History and Political Science.

1893,Nightlotus7,1594700902,1,"Usually I'd probably type this sort of thing on my second instagram account for close friends but it seems a little too edgy and plus I don't want sympathy connections where people only give you attention because you're explicitly asking for it. I really don't know how people do it. Make such strong relationships with people who will randomly call you and not worry that you're annoying them. I'm an incoming sophomore in college and I still haven't gotten this skill down. In middle school I was a dork who lived by the edgy as fuck mantra of ""I have no friends, just acquaintances"". High school was slightly better since I could definitely consider people friends but not to the extent where I'd be invited to things outside of school. Before college I kept repeating to myself ""Here's your chance to start over. No one knows you. There's literally thousands of people just waiting to meet you"". I went to Summer school and got through 1 and a 1/2 semesters of my Freshman Year and can confidently say that I'm basically the same person from high school. Just for clarification, I'm not socially awkward. I'd say I'm actually pretty good around people, relatively charismatic, and a solid 6.5 or 7/10 in terms of looks. The problem that I've heard from so many people is that I overthink things way too much. I literally never text people first because I'm afraid they'll think I'm annoying them. And I'm sure you can guess what this leads to...no one ever texts me. This problem has only been amplified by quarantine. In movies, they always make it seem like the oldest child always has everything figured out. It's so embarrassing coming home to your younger brother being valedictorian of his class and scoring all 5's while having 10x the amount of friends you do. Every day of quarantine he's either going to see his girlfriend or inviting his friends over. Quarantine has really shown me how poor of a job I did in high school of making friends because the only people who I've hung out with have already gone back to college a few states away. My college friend group isn't much better. The only thing that made my college social life good was my fellowship. And now with quarantine, I only get to see them once or twice a week for an hour on a screen. There's also a girl I like. We've hung out ever since the year began and we've become pretty close. I used to hang out in her room and we'd watch movies. We became best friends on snapchat during quarantine, even got the little heart that meant you were each others number one friends. But she went to visit her grandparents in New York and her texting has become a lot less frequent and today we finally lost our heart. I'm sure some of it is to do with her grandparents but the social anxiety and overthinking keeps taking over me and I'm scared that I've lost the only person I connected with on a deep level. I don't know if this is narcissistic to say but I think I'm a really good friend - or at least when people give me the chance to be one. There's a lot more I have bundled inside but this post is already edgy and cringey as fuck.

Also a relationship isn't of the table if things go well, also don't mind doing sexual favours for my friends if you don't leave. Prefer someone 30 or under who lives in the UK or Amsterdam pretty much the only places I can travel. 



 I'm 20 male, emo/gothic, British, bisexual, aspiring femboy, autistic also stuff with mental issues like ocd, anxiety disorders. My memory is none existent with sdam and aphantasia. Also suffering really bad depression that makes me sucideal sometimes.. So please be consideret if I don't have the energy sometimes or I struggle to make conversation, I always try my best but all my friends didn't think so and left sadly. I got some other physical health issues like tennitus but I don't really wanna go into them shouldn't be a problem for anyone.  I've been sat in my room for 70% of the last 4 years so my social skills are terrible lol just fyi. Just telling everyone this so they know I'm far from normal and I won't waste there time. I get really destroyed and heartbroken when people leave so if these are issues don't bother.

I'm interested in PC gaming, movies especially horror, music like lil peep and other emo rap, drawing I'm shit lol, outdoors things like hiking and bike riding, occasionally drug use, board games really wanna get into dnd. Like dressing up and feeling girly but got homophobic parents so I'm limited. Used to go to raves and festivals that was fun aswell. Really enjoy traveling and trying to new things aswell.

I would get these dreams where I wanted to be with a woman without understanding what that means, and in the entire dream I'm just crying, and I didn't know why. That's been happening since grade 1. It all made sense once I finally figured out that I was gay.

A bad break up last year left me with no friends, after 6 months I had to move to a big city for work. I was here for 4 months and had just started building my life, was seeing and girl and had a couple of new friends and then I caught coronavirus on a night out (March 3rd).

I went into self isolation and by the time I was well lockdown had been enforced. My few new friends disappeared to other parts of the country. 3 months I lived in a big city, alone, in lockdown in beautiful summer weather. Sitting in my room listening to other people breaking the rules drinking, barbecuing and socialising. I had nobody to call and nobody called me. Nobody to go for a drink in the park. Truly awful.

I couldn‚Äôt bear it so I moved back in with my parents. I have a couple of friends here but my parents are considered vulnerable and thus socialising is too risky. Everyone else is out drinking and posting on Instagram and I‚Äôm here going on like 5 months with no social contact.

And now my work has asked me to move somewhere else where I also have no friends. I see no end in sight to this misery as opportunities to make new friends basically don‚Äôt exist at this time. The only person to really check on me was my ex girlfriend but it is too awful seeing her social media pop up out socialising and having fun, so I stopped talking to her.

1923,herry720,1594685892,1,"A few of my friends are meeting up without me now restrictions have eased. Before the lockdown, we spent the year hanging out, drinking, going to the pub and clubbing etc. Usually there would be about 8 of us. However, 4 of the girls I wasn‚Äôt really that close too ended up ditching us completely. The reason for that is because they didn‚Äôt like that their friend( in the original 8) was spending all the time with this boy(also in the 8). 

I understand their perspective, considering she barely contacted them anymore and slept every night with the boy for about 2 months straight in our house, even though they aren‚Äôt in a relationship(friends with benefits). Either way, there were many times before they split that it would just be the 4 of us(3 guys including me and one girl- the girl sleeping with my friend). 

The reason I know they‚Äôre meeting up without me is that she literally took a picture of my door where I live. My door has a funny sign on it shall I say. And I asked her why she was there, and she told me she was with the others. I didn‚Äôt even want to give her a reaction. I‚Äôm more upset at the fact that I was sent a picture of my door( in a house she doesn‚Äôt live in) rubbing it in that I wasn‚Äôt invited. And it probably wasn‚Äôt intended that way, but it shows that a lot of people don‚Äôt think before they do. By the way, I haven‚Äôt fallen out with anyone. 

Sure you can argue people can meet up with whoever they want. But I think it‚Äôs messed up you exclude someone who hangs out in the main 4 a lot, and then send a picture showing that you‚Äôre meeting without them. I have other friends I‚Äôm meeting soon. However, the reason I wouldn‚Äôt invite the other 3 is because they‚Äôre not friends with them. They don‚Äôt get along that well, and so it would just be a bit awkward and pointless. They didn‚Äôt hang out with them all of last year. I was mostly hanging out with the other 3 but sometimes with my other friends. 

I think that problem is that I‚Äôm expecting too much from people. Butter  I do think a lot of people are horrible at times and don‚Äôt think about other people‚Äôs feelings. I live with one of the people whose excluding me and I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs the one organising the meetings. We‚Äôve been friends for 2 years, and I introduced him to people when he had no friends at all, at the start of college.I could of never gave him the chance. I also introduced the girl who sent me the photo to the guy she‚Äôs sleeping with( the guy I live with). So it‚Äôs kind of more messed up. 

I‚Äôve introduced a lot of people to my friends who didn‚Äôt really know anyone. And they even said themselves they felt much better since finding friends they got on with properly. Never get any sort of praise for it though. If someone took a chance on me when I had no friends, and introduced me to people who I clicked with, I‚Äôd never forget what they did. And I‚Äôd definitely owe them one but that‚Äôs just me. Having friends at college can make things a lot easier and I had no obligation to help anyone when I already had people I knew and hung out with. 

My question is how should I respond and cope with all of this. Is there any reason to point this out as I don‚Äôt want to give them a reaction. Do I just cut them out completely? I think the guy organising it is the guy who‚Äôs deliberately excluding me, even though I live with me. I suspect the other guy probably suggested me tbh, we got really close last year. The other thing to mention is that I was introduced to him, by the person I live with. I wish all of this didn‚Äôt affect me the way it does.",lonely,"My friends are meeting up without me.

I‚Äôve been a lonely kid my whole life (I‚Äôm 18). I‚Äôm assuming this is because of my shyness and lack of interest in talking to other people. When I was younger, I used to lock myself in my head. I was a really quiet kid and I always blushed when someone talked to me (and I kinda still do that). Kids always made fun of me when I blushed. That made me feel so sad but now I don‚Äôt care about it. I‚Äôm not revengeful at all. 

I got along with the whole class because I didn‚Äôt really talk that much and I think am really kind (especially back then). If someone asked for help, I would be there 100%. When we started the first year of secondary school, I made some friends from this class and we‚Äôre good friends nowadays.

Even though I had friends, I was feeling kinda lonely yet. I was really happy around them but sometimes I felt like we were losing some complicity. I had this feeling of disconnection so I felt lonely. They had other groups of friends and I wasn‚Äôt mad about that. 

I was really tired of feeling lonely, so one day I downloaded a bunch of social apps for getting to know people all over the world. It went really good. Because I didn‚Äôt have to confront people face to face. I made some friends but eventually every friendship just stopped having meaning or whatever and we stopped talking. I feel like that‚Äôs been a constant during my life. That made me think that maybe I am the problem.

Things got colder with my school friends when we chose different subjects. We weren‚Äôt in the same class so we only saw each other and talked at break. We used to go out weekly, but the group started to fell apart. I didn‚Äôt lose any of them, I know they‚Äôre still there but things are not the same anymore. 

I downloaded some apps for making friends again and it didn‚Äôt go well, just like the last time. I guess I‚Äôm not a good talker.

So that brings me here, today. I have a group of 4 friends but we don‚Äôt talk that often. I thought it was because of finals exams and so but it‚Äôs already summer and nothing‚Äôs changed. Maybe I have to accept that I‚Äôm not a social person. Maybe I am the problem. Sometimes I think I will be a lonely person my entire life.

1957,Able2c,1594661234,2,"I'm 48 and I've noticed all through my life that lonely people are thought of as weird, scary and as if it's contagious.

Most of this experience has come from trying to date through the years. When I tell a date that I have no family their interest usually quickly fades. Also many dating profiles ask for a ""family man"" or a ""social"" person. It seems to me that the older daters are looking more and more for the ideal match and won't quickly take a chance on anyone anymore.

As the years go by you start to lose friends and making new ones becomes more difficult. You stop feeling like a social person when you fail or get rejected a lot trying to date. In the end you have maybe one far flung friend left and the circle of loneliness becomes harder and harder to break.

Are there solutions? Yes, I imagine so. One of them would be to visit every social gathering possible. Become a sports fanatic or an avid hobbyist. Just keep at it like that and you may make friends.

Another would be if people could be bothered to care and look after each other. Visit and ring the doorbell everyone in a while. I never get visitors other than maintenance no-one ever enters my house.

A third option is a pet to care for. Isn't it strange how many of us care greatly about a lonely animal? A pet doesn't care who you are as long as you give them food, love and shelter you are the world to them.

1960,frcfulshde,1594658209,1,"sometimes when im about to sleep, this dark mood always came across my mind. it usually went away in the morning but these past few weeks it become more often.

i tried to distract it by talking to people. i have friends, but only few i can really trust but I don't know... i don't feel like talking to them. they seemed like to have their own problem. so i tried to talk to people online. there's this discord server i usually talk, it's a good place for me for a while but it became really quiet now. well i guess people have their own things. so then i tried talking to stranger like on discord, or joining random server but haven't really found anybody that i feel comfortable to talk to. 

oh and here's the thing about omegle. people really do have their own idea of people who they want to talk to. i mean i would be lying if i say i don't, but at least i didn't disconnect just because of their gender. maybe that's just because I'm desperate, that I don't care about anybody's gender.

thinking back, i did hurt some people in the past. I didn't really have any major problem before either. maybe, this is all karma. because i hurt some people in the past. because I'm an asshole. so therefore, I don't deserve no one. I will always feel lonely.

it's not like I haven't tried socializing these past few years. gosh i fucking tried. both in real life and online. but i feel like the more i socialize to people, the more they see about me. and often times I feel like they didn't like what they see so they step back a bit. i always figuring if what's up with me, why I don't have anyone, why can't i be comfortable to anybody why there's no one but I can't figure it out. at this point im pretty sure its all me. 

I don't know. I feel like distracting by watching movies and reading books aren't really working on me anymore. I'm also tired of trying to find friends. I'm tired of disappointing anyone. I read when you feel bad, hugging people really help. but i don't exactly have anyone to hug either. lol what a fucking desperate and miserable guy.

I'm not good at showing my thought and feeling so sometimes I wrote post like this on somewhere but no matter how much I wrote it's just still not enough. There's still a hell of thoughts in my mind that I just couldn't put it in words. 

maybe i just need to keep distracting myself. maybe i should just keep doing that.

1962,Lonelyannon1574,1594655834,1,"Special days in general are very difficult for me. I will be most likely spending the day alone as I don't have any friends in person, and my family doesn't really care either. Through my many years of putting myself out there and trying to find friends in my physical life through events and activities that resonated with me in many different ways, I did have a small group of friends for a very short time who I did get to spend certain days with a few times. The last time they payed me any attention before they just left without a word was the day before my birthday last year. As much as it's all in the past and I've moved on, it does hurt knowing that it's been a year since it all just ended out of nowhere and I was flung back in this pit of loneliness.

I do have friends who live out of state. I love them dearly and wouldn't wish the kind of missery this  issue brings on them for a second, but it is hard to know that they are fortunate to have families, friends, and significant others always there to spend and celebrate those days with. They also don't really relate to this kind of thing, so they admit it's hard for them to imagine a life where there's no option at hand to just invite someone who cares about you to spend time together. They do pressure me to just ""treat myself"" and such, but again it's something I already have to do every other day and it honestly just feels like what are supposed to be eventful happy days like christmas or my birthday just turn into any other normal day no matter how much I try to hold it together.

 and my life has been sad. I lost my father at a young age. I have no family where I live and all live thousands of miles away. This quarantine has destroyed me and diminished my mental health to a state of daily depression. I have been so desperate for a girlfriend recently. I really have, I want someone to make happy, talk to, have fun with, and overall, LOVE. Which is absent in my life. I see all my friends around me getting their girlfriends, meanwhile, I have none. I am overweight and I was actually fit for a bit prior to quarantine after a few months of hard work. I am trying to lose the weight now. My point is this depression is not like any other in my life. I feel nihilistic or in other words, absolutely worthless. I feel as though there is legitimately no point in life, no objective, nothing. I have tried finding a hobby, it‚Äôs all smudged with the ‚Äúthere is no point, you will die one day and everything will one be in a landfill and burned‚Äù

I am genuinely depressed, lonely, and I feel like shit. I just need some light, I need to fucking leave. I almost just want to run away and not come back for 3 years. I took up summer school but I finished the work so fast, it didn‚Äôt do anything. Plus, it‚Äôs easy af. I am just depressed af and I cannot afford anything. Ik, a counselor, no thank you, can not afford it, plus, my trust has been completely ruined by them.

**Here is the layout of my mental health during quarantine:**

*First month: Happy, excited, not depressed, thrilled.*

*Second month: Depression starts coming in, I start questioning my faith, and I start feeling lonely.*

*Third month: I get into a crazy theory and become suicidal, super depressed, and had super anxiety. My life was legit hell and I can‚Äôt believe I survived.*

*Fourth month: Feel a bit better, nihilistic, depressed af, lonely af, and a bit of anxiety regarding my faith.*

I stop speaking to people, at all.  


The think the hardest thing about being lonely is you lose touch with yourself. How do you know you're funny when you have nobody to share a joke with? How can you be kind with nobody around? That's real loneliness. When the only thing you have to interact with is yourself, you come to one conclusion. You're nothing without people around you. I lost a couple years of my life to it. I honestly still haven't recovered from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently going through a very profound change. I don't really know why yet. But that'll be apart of my journey. For 6 months now I've been working towards one goal. Rehabilitation and in a week, I'll be there. It's such a surreal feeling watching one of your goals come to fruition. Even tho I'm scared shitless and haven't slept for a week. I really look forward for the experiences it'll hold for me. To find myself again. To love again.   


I wanted to share this because if I was to tell a younger me anything. It'd be, be careful of what you wish for. I fulfilled my prophecy of loneliness and all because I never thought I was good enough for anybody. I'm tired of being sorry. I'm going to be better and I hope in 6 months when I'm released.

I went through an entire pregnancy without any knowing until I posted my child on social media after he reached 6 months old (only because my auntie was going to post a picture of us after we visited). After all that happened I had so many ""friends"" reach out to me like why didn't you tell me when I hadn't spoken to them in over a year or more. I was just confused by their attitude as the friendship was not maintained. 

No one calls and checks on me or tries to maintain a friendship with me unless they need something from me. I had a ""best friend"" from 9th grade into a few years of college. She was not really my best friend because we just fell off and she wanted to become friends when she needed help with her school work (ie. wanted me to do her damn work for her). SMH, it's sad all around.

I have never had a job, and I dropped out of my college the first day because I was physically and mentally terrified.

I have never been in a relationship and as the time passes I fear I never will.

I find myself kept awake at night by thoughts of suicide and imagine what life could have been if I wasn‚Äôt me.

It hasn‚Äôt all been bad though, friend #5 has been a close friend who I talk to nearly everyday.

However he recently left the country a month and a half ago to ‚Äúvisit his girlfriend‚Äù and in this time we have barely talked i have seen just how truly pathetic my life is.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any coming back from where I am, and I fear that the only thing left is the great escape.",lonely,4 years of loneliness,2020-07-13 10:00:04

2052,antmusicforsexpeople,1594593998,1,"Hey guys, I'm a 17 year old girl and have just discovered this subreddit and thought it might be an appropriate space to let some things out/get some input. 

I recently (around 3/4 weeks ago) was broken up with by my boyfriend for reasons that I still don't entirely understand, but that's a long story and I won't bore you with the details.

I've struggled with fluctuating self-esteem and confidence since puberty, mostly owing to having had rather insensitive (ex) friends, experiencing sexual abuse at 13, and developing moderate cystic acne at about 15. Some days I'm fine, self-accepting even, but others I feel like I don't want to live as myself anymore.

This has made it hard for me to put myself out there in terms of dating. I'm bisexual (leaning more towards men than women, granted) but that doesn't really seem to broaden my options. My first boyfriend dumped me because I didn't want to have sex with him, my second because he met someone he liked better, and as I said I'm still trying to completely understand what went wrong with my most recent boyfriend. I've never dated another girl. I don't seem to be able to keep anyone interested in me for more than about 4 months. I don't know what's wrong with me or how to fix it.

I know that I'm still young and that my dating experience so far isn't necessarily representative of the real world, but it's still pretty disheartening nonetheless, especially in a world like this where the media seems to expect teenagers to grow up a lot faster than we perhaps should. It's always been my unspoken place among my peers at school (which is tiny - my entire year group is sub 30 people) that I am the smart but plain one that the popular girls allow within the group to make them look better. It's a bit upsetting being surrounded by my friends at school with people drooling over them when all I get is ignored, rejected, and abandoned.

When I ask her for advice, my mum (who was apparently considered a bit of a catch when she was younger) just tells me to be myself and my natural ""wit"" and ""charm"" will attract the right person, whatever that means. I'm starting to think that being myself is the whole problem",lonely,I feel like everyone abandons me,2020-07-13 08:46:38

She would also ask for more money every time she was broke and would flip out if I didn‚Äôt have enough.

I still remember the one time we were in the movies and I told her (and nicely btw) to not use your phone because it was rude during the movie.

2070,Void_escape,1594586833,1,"The most important lesson you can learn in life is that no one cares about who you are intrinsically, but only about what you can provide for them. This lesson applies to your interactions with other men, with society, and with women especially. As the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said, quoted in full because the entire passage is excellent:

&gt;Human beings of nobler sort believe in their youth that the essential and decisive relations and resulting connections between people are the ideal ones, i.e. those that are based on similarity of attitude, way of thinking, taste, mental powers, and so on; but they later realize that it is the real ones, i.e. those resting upon some material interest. These are at the basis of almost all connections; in fact, the majority of humans have no notion of different relations. Therefore, everybody is treated according to his office, or business, or nation, or family, hence in general according to the position and role assigned to him by convention; as a consequence, he is sorted and treated like a manufactured good. In contrast, what he is in and for himself, as a human being, comes up only by chance and hence only by way of exception, and is set aside and ignored by everybody as soon as it is convenient, which is most of the time.

With the possible exception of your parents (if you‚Äôre lucky), nobody in the world gives a shit about you as a person, and the sooner you realize it, the easier a time you will have navigating this wasteland of the soul. People come to you when you have value to provide, otherwise they ignore you. No woman will ever spread her legs for you out of charity, but because you have some advantage to give her. It could be housing, or drugs, or opportunities for career advancement, or simply the fact that you have a big dick and she's into that sort of thing. Harvey Weinstein is not the exception, but the rule. The dirty secret is that sex is transactional, and women know it more than anybody. Your moral virtue, kindhearted nature, and good character are the last thing on anybody‚Äôs mind when they interact with you. 

The world is a cold and dark place, not at all what the media would have you believe. The lot of men in life is a difficult one - we either create value for others or we're discarded and abandoned. If we end up hurt, or traumatized, or dead in the process, no one will shed a tear for us. There are plenty of men willing to take our place and throw themselves into the mouth of the dragon. We are disposable. 

There are two paths forward for men: either we withdraw from the world in disgust, or we throw ourselves into the melee with the others. The middle way, that of drifting along hoping that something will change, is a dead end that leads only to despair, to wandering through life as a hungry ghost posting tales of woe on the internet every night. Come to terms with loneliness and become a saintly hermit walking the spiritual path, or devote yourself fully to the will to power. *The path to interpersonal success as a man is through power*. Put yourself in a position where your decisions affect the lives of others, and you will be astonished at how their attitude towards you changes. Where you previously got the cold shoulder, you now have nothing but smiles. Suddenly, social interaction will feel less like an uphill battle and more like a downhill stroll. All of your neurotic self-obsessions and inadequacies will vanish in a moment as you realize that no one cared about them in the first place, but only about what you could give them. Seemingly impossible obstacles will melt away as people bend over backwards (sometimes literally) to accommodate you. Such is the nature of the world, and it will never change.",lonely,The lessons of loneliness ‚Äì a message to men,2020-07-13 06:47:13

I avoid talking with my relatives, usually they will treat me horribly because I am a 37 years old woman, constantly dumped, lost her job for panico attacks, no savings, no kids, kind of ugly and fat. 
After my ex partner and best friend managed to maintain the small circle of friends I had, I stopped answering to all the texts and calls. I don‚Äôt engage in social media and so on. 
In one year I never made a joke, laughed or just enjoyed some exchange. It‚Äôs work-home and avoiding my family. 
Now that I have insomnia, I pass my time looking them on social media. Ex is expecting a child with my best friend. Another friend had a surprise party before Covid for her 35th birthday. Another one moved in a new house with her partner.

I have 2 requirments in a friend, be 17 or older and be either apart of the lgbt+ community or be an ally

And the only people that message me are either 17+ and not an ally or apart of the community 
Or are under 17 and an ally or apart of the community

Or worse they arent both, i cant tell you how many 15 year olds i have in my dms ""oh wait ew your gay nvm""

Usually me being lonely is my fault, this time it isnt, is it really that weird for a 17 year old lesbian to want friends her age or up and people that support her sexuality? 

I did find a friend a while ago, she and i did flirt and i did fall and then she got a girlfriend and then abused me and manipulated me and then blamed it on me and then when i told her about my feelings and said ""you will probably find this toxic and manipulative"" because thats what all the people who abused or manipulated me told me because they are afraid to own up to it, ill admit in the past i was kinda manipulative towards the man i call my dad because well he left me so i did throw some manipulation at him because i hated him

Since then i have kinda felt everything is my fault, but then also not

Like im not gonna just throw out my only requirments

I mean they arent even crazy, im not gonna reply if you say ""im 16 hope thats okay"" like no, i asked 17+ not ""17+ haha but 16 is also good!!"" Like no i just dont feel comfy having a younger friend

Like it isnt as if im saying ""heh must be a virgin and never have spoken to a guy or a girl and must never have been held!!""

Like its legit an age limit and a basic human thing, acceptance of the lgbt+ community

Im just a bit upset i guess, my requirments arent crazy and they should be respected

Im sorry that i dont wanna talk to a 16 year old homophobe? 

And then fricking straight 30 year olds message me ""heh your hot chat with me""

First im a minor second im a lesbian third im a MINOR

Like is it so crazy i wanna talk to a supportive person thats 17-22? 

I mean i legit see guys posting weird requirments and thats all respected, i see girls posting crazy requirments and thats all respected

But when i say ""17 or up and an ally or apart of the lgbt+ community only please, also here are some of my interests"" its too crazy and it gets disrespected by 15 year old straight boys who want my snap to 'have fun'

2142,srkdpu,1594517752,1,"I went to a meetup today and was terrified. And I was right to... 

I'm a foreigner in Germany and I still don't speak the language.

Although the meetup was to be in English (description was in English, it clearly said in the descriptions it was about expats in germany), but everyone spoke german, so for a long while I was feeling like an outsider.

So the place of the meetup is a cafe. I ordered a coffee and a cake. I ate the cake i ordered, because I had to do something, anything. Then I drank my coffee. Then I played with the cup. I avoided eye contact since I was feeling scared. At some point I picked up a few words from what they were talking about and I asked a question.

They did answer me in English, but then switched back to german. I was hurt and furious. This was an English language meetup, wtf? So, I still kept listening and when I would get enough info I would chime in. They were not offensive in any way, they were just switching to german all the time.

Understandably, I was terrified. I just wanted to get up and run. This is all my fears, right in my face, people just casually rejecting me. Passively aggressively excluding me. Worst of all, I had no idea why. I was feeling the pain and I just started to lose it. I mean I was playing with the coffee cup, but i was getting stuck in the loop of horror, you know? I was leaking nervousness all over the table.

Anyways, I have it as a rule for me that I should never bail. I am already in this right? I can either bail out or fight the feelings and stick it out to the end. So I stayed in my little puddle of panic.

Well, at some point the girl that was sitting next to me, starts a conversation with me in English (blessed be my savior) and that conversation slowly spread to the others. Soon I realized why they were switching to german. One of the guys knew broken German, but didn't know any English. Go figure why there was an English meetup with non English speakers, but hey, at least I had the missing piece now.

I started feeling more welcomed. I talked, relaxed, talked more and at some point it hit me. That guy was not taking part any more. Everyone had switched to English now, so he was the one left out. So then someone had to explain something to him and clumsily I said that it's time we switch to german again, and that it will be a good practice for me.

Well, we did that, then it was mixed English and German, and finally it leaked to English only again. Then the guy said he had to leave. I'd like to believe that he really had to leave, but I think he got to that tipping point where you feel excluded. My condolences to my fallen friend!

When I had to leave, people genuenly asked me if I will join them next time, so even though my nervousness was all over the place, they didn't have a problem to be around me again.

So, moral of the story, don't give up.

Also moral of the story, people are also worried and people are generally nice. But they can be clumsy like you. Trust people a bit more. Because they were worried, they didn't tell me the guy didn't speak English. They were not out to get me or hurt me in any way.",lonely,Meeting people is terrifying.

Mmm, If you do, let a friend find you

If one day, love's well runs dry
Your heart does break, you start to cry
Feel so low, nowhere to go

Yea, if you do, another love find you
Mmm, if you do, let the love find you

If someday I start to play
No one there, no words to say
And I think, might be the end
Something else then does begin

Mmm, when you do, I will play for you
Mmm, If it do, I've got to let it through

So when life do, You've got to
Let love through
When life do what it do
We've got to let love through

And those I talk to, I dont really enjoy talking to like I used to. It's just the same 'ol drill. A greeting, asking how they are doing, them asking you. How was your day? What are you up to? Then when they reply you say something like 'bet' or 'cool' then the convo ends because nothing is driving it to continue. 

I cant work because I injured my rotator cuff and need surgery to fix that, but the insurance doesnt want to pay for it. So I'm kind of stuck there. I would go outside, but there is nothing to do out there. Yeah, I could just take a ten minute walk to the lake. But where is the fun in that if you dont have anyone to do it with?

I haven't had a hug since January. Even that one was brief and wasnt meaningful. I have bipolar depression, so it just sneaks up on you. I'm not on any medication because I cant get an appointment set up to do so. I have separation issues and that's a huge trigger for the depression. If I dont have physical contact with someone I go into a depressive spiral and that's how it has been for the past six or seven months. With brief breaks in between when it just dips out. Sadly those breaks dont last long lol

2149,Nyanferreras,1594515484,1,"This happened 3 months ago approximately, at the start of quarentine, but I'm so stupid this has started to melt me in a depressive-lonely loop (if you are wondering quarentine in my country is very strict and I have to have special care with covid-19 because of personal problems, so I haven't seen a soul since it started).
There is a friend I appreciate much and I have known him since 2016, so 4 years. I figured that friend may be feeling bored or wanted company so I proposed myself to send messages to replace the time we spent together with chat time, as I felt lonely too and I don't have many people to talk to. 
First chats were alright, he replied ok, he was ok.
One night I said to him that I admire him and that he was going to achieve whatever he proposed himself (this wasn't out of context, we were talking about goals, and he always struggled reaching them, because life) and that conversation ended good.
The next conversation I start telling him some funny cultural tales I thought he was going to like (it was about 1 am and quarentine and a weekend) he was online and just marking seen as I sent the parts of the tales, and I did it with time gaps between because I was working in a project while texting him those tales, so I ended like at 2 am and he had stopped marking seen and just completely ignoring the chat tho he was online. Hadn't replied anything.
I made a correction at three am cause something I forgot and he was VERY online and hadn't seen any of my texts not even a ""I can't read you  right now"" or ""I'm not in the mood/I'm occupied"". But I let that text sit there, maybe he would read it, or reply later when he feels like it.
TWO DAYS PASSED I enter the chat though he hadn't replied anything to check if at least it marked as read BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT DIDN'T. TWO DAYS AND YOU CANT EVEN BOTHER TO OPEN A CHAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T READ THE MESSAGES.
More or less 3 months have past and he never replied anything, not even a ""sorry"" not even something about what I wrote.
This has made my quarentine a hell I'm constantly having sad-lonely crisis and questioning all my relationships apart from the one I had with him.

2150,GarbagePailKid1980s,1594514467,1,"&amp;#x200B;

*I've been thinking today about loneliness, solitude, and why we have any need for relationships, etc - some scattershot thoughts.*

*I'm going to cross post this on FA30, where it and I belong.*

*This is more of a ""thoughts"" post with lots of tangents - As it happens I have felt prone to feeling loneliness my entire life long, though I won't write much about that for now.*

One thing which I think is interesting to ponder is that those who identify as ""not often lonely"" report spending about eighty percent of their free time in the company of others, but so do those who identify as lonely. The vast, vast majority of lonely people it is fair to say are not in any way socially isolated. Another factoid: Those who have seen another person in the last day are more likely to consider themselves to be lonely than those who haven't.

This seems completely counter intuitive, but it points toward something that is so obvious about loneliness that it actually prompts another question why it is routinely overlooked.

Aloneness is often related to but is never synonymous with loneliness. Our need to form relationships with others, and the expectations held for any such relationships will always vary by our personal disposition. Some people have no one in their life and feel no loneliness (though that absence of affect might, of course, have evolved as a survival mechanism in a trap of isolation, a situation not unusual for older FAs). Others people have many, many connections with others and yet still feel loneliness. There is a saying that ""if you feel lonely, you are lonely"". It does sound trite, but it is perfectly true: loneliness has no other referent than itself. Loneliness describes an inner feeling, and not an external situation. It is perfectly possible to be surrounded by people and to feel deeply alone.

Because, of course, beneath the surface of things, beyond the people and purpose we clutter our lives with, we are all deeply alone in this life. There is always going to be a bridge between the self and others that can never be crossed. Eg: If I stub my toe on the corner of this desk, someone can certainly empathise, maybe because they too have stubbed their toe, but the experience of it is mine alone. And that expands to every moment of my life, from birth to death, from the trivial upwards. Even with the most loving companion, there is a part of me that will remain forever sealed off, a part of me that cannot be shared, that is effectively stuck in a state of persistent aloneness in this world.

The awareness - whether it is repressed or not - of being thrown into existence, with no real purpose or point, and with only finite time until the end, is always lurking. Always part of the background of life. Loneliness is probably not about what is lacked in life, but about *who one is*: a social being who is unable to find fulfillment of social needs, who moves through life carrying unmet needs. The urge for intimacy is a desire to do away with as much of that gulf between people as possible, though the closer two people become the more that impenetrable barrier reveals itself.

This is what is meant by Yeats when he writes: ""The tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul"". Sexual congress is almost always trivialised nowadays by its hedonistic focus, though when not for reproduction sexual congress isn't truly about a search for pleasure - It is humans twisted together in to a shared state of longing and yearning for something *more*. Something out of reach. Something beyond ourselves. Souls desperate to touch each other, but forever beyond one another's reach. That is why the most passionate sex always involves biting, clawing, etc. - as if we are trying to get what is there under the skin.

[https://imgur.com/CGf5kls](https://imgur.com/CGf5kls)

Loneliness then is a temperament, not a situation. It is one which says that my need to connect to others, to be understood by others, to be heard and seen - *for it to be recognised that I even exist* \- surpasses what the external world is currently offering (or maybe even ever able to). It is a temperament more common among women, or at least reported to be - that isn't a dig. Studies continually show that women are more prone to feeling lonely though isolation is a *much more significant factor* in male suicide. Loneliness effects women more regularly and persistently, but it tends to effect men more fatally.

Though to some degree, loneliness is a sort of drawn out tantrum about our lives: to expect others to ever truly ""get"" us, to ever be truly ""understood"", is in some ways asking of the world what is impossible. We are alone, and it can never be otherwise. Loneliness expresses a partial desire to return to our childhood -where every need will be met, every whim and thought heard and respected. But that is a paradise that was burnt up in adolescence.

It is not immediately obvious why we need ""connection"" with other people at all, but it is clear that high levels of loneliness are statistically associated with *substantially lowe*r levels of satisfaction about life. Loneliness is also associated with cognitive decline in later life, with elevated levels of depression, and with sexual promiscuity (an escape route more accessible to females), etc. It is said to shorten life as much as 7 cigarettes a day would, though it is hard to quantify how and why that is so.

I think it's worthwhile to tease out the related terms that tend to be used interchangeably:

**Aloneness** \- Being alone is simply a descriptive state of circumstances. A few people are resigned and content to living life alone, even if they might have wished circumstances were different. One can be alone and *not at all lonely*.

**Loneliness** \- Isn't really an emotion in itself, it's an admixture of longing, yearning, craving for social connection, of having unmet social needs, or a sense of discontentment about the unsatisfying relationship one is caught up in, etc.

**Isolation** \- I would say that isolation is life lived on the other side of chronic loneliness. It is the state of loneliness when one has moved beyond any remaining hope of salvation. Loneliness is, in an odd way, fueled by a sense that life could be otherwise - but one can't keep yearning for connection that is never coming. Isolation is the realisation that one is likely abandoned in this world, and that feelings of loneliness have become, ultimately, fruitless. I think isolation is to loneliness what FA is to being single.

**Solitude** \- Solitude is best thought of as a positive, of being present with yourself, rather than being absent of others. Solitude is a deeply undervalued state, and our society wrongly militates against it. There should be more acceptance of and encouragement for solitude. There is huge value in being by oneself, and away from others.

\*\*

So what is it that we are even gaining - or would hope to gain - from our ""connections"" with others? We could, after all, live perfectly efficient though entirely isolated lives. Especially in our modern age, there is no necessary reason for any meaningful connection with others in our private lives. We could live out our lives and die in perfect safety, and comfort, without needing to speak to another person at all. Yet most of us would, obviously, consider that to have been an entirely impoverished life, a wasted life in fact.

I think there are a few reasons why people yearn for relationships, and these are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

""Why all this noise and fuss? Why all this urgency, uproar, anguish and exertion? Why should such a trifling thing (as love) play such an important role in our lives?"" (Schopenhauer)

A. To Keep up with the neighbours. ""There are some people who would have never fallen in love if they hadn't read about other people doing it"" writes Rochefoucauld. I think there is some truth to that. There are so many people in relationships, or not but seeking them, for much the same reason that they are climbing the career ladder, etc. There is a social script in their hands, and they wish to stick to it. We are taught from birth that relationships are the ultimate end in life and that we should all dedicate a huge part of our energy to finding and maintaining one (this actually isn't untrue). I suspect that many people's prime motivation, esp. young people's, for being in a relationship is to conform to this social expectation

B. Sex. What better way is there to get ready access to sex? Monogamy is often impugned, as ""unnatural"" for men, which makes little sense as there is obviously no better way for an average man to gain access to regular sex

C. Distraction. Relationships with others are probably the best distraction life offers. In a kernel in space and time two individuals can come together to create for each other years and years of drama, of adventure, of shared experience, etc - and all literally from nothing but that initial flirtation. One might say that two people in a monogamous, loving relationship are two people lovingly *wasting the others persons time*, in a unspoken pact against the universe. This has to be set against the background of everyday life, of society and beyond, which is *totally indifferent* to every aspect of our lives. A relationship is almost a sort of conspiracy people enter into together: ""You will matter to me, and I will matter to you. And will you matter to me because I will matter to you. and this will mask the reality that neither of our lives in the long run really matter at all""

D. Relationships provide the best ground for balancing our desire to be independent and our desire to connect. This is Jasper's theory. Every human probably has those two drives: to stand apart and to belong to something outside of or greater than themselves. Someone who is lonely has moved too far in the direction of being apart from the world. Relationships enable us to connect to something, to someone, outside of ourselves - and often in the most intense and intimate way. Yet we still maintain our sense of being self sufficient, of being independent, etc.

Love is the most efficient way of bridging the gap and bringing together two separated souls.

E. Recognition. Does the self even exist, in isolation? A big part of who we are is how others see us, how others respond to us, and how others relate to us. If we live in isolation, we never really become who we might have been, because the more developed part of human personality is probably formed in our relations to others. Love doesn't make us blind, it lets us see things we couldn't have seen before - parts of ourselves that were hitherto latent, hitherto unrealised. We probably crave relationships because there is a side of us that can only be accessed that way. When we do not nourish that part of ourselves there is always a lingering sense of our *missing something*, of a part of ourselves wilting and withering away - That we are somehow incomplete, or only half human.

Rounded humans are humans who can tolerate or thrive during moments of solitude, but who can also form and forge meaningful connection with others when the moment is right. Either of those extremes is not healthy. Aloneness is probably necessary to find out who we really are, but relationships are often required *to become or to practise the reality of* who we are. You can be the most loving person in the world, but if there is no one to love...you can't be. You can be the most affectionate person by temperament, but if there is no one to hold and to snuggle with... you aren't. That part of yourself is a dead end. Many FAS (introverted people in general) are probably much more attuned to their underlying feelings, their wants, needs, etc, but much less capable of forming the relationships actually required to express or bring to life those things.

I'm just thinking aloud here.

The problem for older FAs I think is as follows: how do we obtain the benefits of relationships without having any realistic opportunity to enter relationships? The benefits would include - feeling that we have worth as people, that others ""recognise"" us, that we are ""seen"" and ""heard"", etc. That we have some sort of closeness and connection to the external world, or others in it, rather than feeling ourselves slipping toward a sense of isolation, or abandonment, etc? There are obviously ways to obtain traces of these things - friendship, volunteering, etc. - but I don't see how the heights of human intimacy can ever be obtained outside of a loving, intimate, relationship. That side of life is probably not reachable by any other road. There is a reason that people do not settle for friends, because friends do not fulfill the diversity and depth of need that people have to bond and belong. The life of the FA is probably a life forever on the margins.

**""I want to be lonely no longer, to learn again to be a human being. Here I have everything still to learn""**

Nietzsche

**‚Äú Man is alone because he is man! In some way every creature is alone. In majestic isolation every star travels through the darkness of endless space. Each tree grows according to its own law, fulfilling its unique possibilities. Animals live, fight and die for themselves alone, confined to the limitations of their bodies. Certainly, they also appear as male and female, in families and in flocks. Some of them are gregarious. But all of them are alone! Being alive means being in a body ‚Äî a body separated from all other bodies. And being separated means being alone.**

**This is true of every creature, and it is more true of man than of any other creature. He is not only alone; he also knows that he is alone. Aware of what he is, he asks the question of his aloneness. He asks why he is alone, and how he can triumph over his being alone. For this aloneness he cannot endure. Neither can he escape it. It is his destiny to be alone and to be aware of it. Not even God can take this destiny away from him....** **This is the greatness and this is the burden of man.""**

I feel like I'm missing out on so so so much and that I won't have this many opportunities once uni starts and later on, I get a job (hopefully). I'm constantly in a state of losing time and seeing others happy just adds insult to injury... I don't wanna sound like I'm jealous of people's happiness but thoughts like ""why can't this be me"" and ""how does this stuff seem so easy"" always cross my mind... Never, ever have I had anyone text me themselves and I always end up being the one trying to start a convo and with my social anxiety, it's hard to keep up and it almots always doesn't go well...

many people tell me they would do just fine without a family, and being alone, while still living in a very loving family and has never been alone before. feeling lonely on christmas, thanksgiving, new years, independence day, or just all the time. i don‚Äôt pity myself at all, i spend every holiday with friends and their family, but it would just be really nice to spend it with my own family. yes, when my family was whole we celebrate holidays together all the time. it felt so warm and cozy, it doesn‚Äôt feel the same with a friends family, because they are still strangers to me. many people take having a good family for granted, it makes me angry to see how they treat their very loving parents sometimes.

(story) one time one of my best friends dad broke his ankle and he was on crutches, she still asked him to make dinner without any help. she brings the food out and just eats without him, he had always been an amazing person to me, so it hurt me a little to see he doesn‚Äôt get treated well enough. i don‚Äôt know. maybe i‚Äôm being overly emotional? i just would never let my dad eat alone, it hurts to see so many parents do so much for their kids but their kids don‚Äôt do half as much for them. they work so hard to give out food on the table and give you a place to live, but you can‚Äôt even do any small things for them? pathetic. 

(when my family was whole) my mind was once very very strong, i had high self esteem, i felt like i was too good for anyone. my father loves me so much, and i felt sooooo worthy. i loved myself more than anything else in the world. i used to feel living was normal and happiness was a given.

now i feel so low, i feel unworthy of anything/anyone. days get really hard sometimes, it feels very lonely most of the times. now when anyone is nice to me i feel so fucking thankful it‚Äôs pathetic sometimes. i think good families always build good mental health, leading to a great successful future!

2184,ETerribleT,1594480060,1,"Before you think of me as a privileged ingrate, just know that I'm very grateful for what I have. 

I have many friends irl and I cherish them, but I've never connected to most of them deeply. Not to say we're not close, but that they're close to me since I'm a decent storyteller irl and kinda funny and because I've known them a very long time, not necessarily because we are on the same wavelength. From this description they sound bad but I promise they're great friends.

I come from a country where extended families are very close. I'm close to my cousins and even some of my second cousins. But since I'm the only male in my generation they're all sibling-like connections and not ""bros."" I always envy people with male cousins of similar age.

I spent much of my childhood scrolling through Facebook and actively avoiding hanging out with my neighbours for playing and whatnot. The constant buzz that the internet puts you on convinced me that I was an introvert and didn't need a social life. Turns out I'm now an extrovert with meh social skills.

I'm awkward/reserved around girls. I find it extremely easy to make friends with males and I'm even friends now with a guy I got in a literal fistfight with, but when it comes to talking to girls I instantly put them on a pedestal in my mind and as a result freak out and back away or avoid them altogether.

I entered highschool with zero social skills; the quintessential ""class weirdo."" I'm now out of highschool and I'm doing way better but I fear it's already too late. The ""highschool lovebirds"" possibility has already set sail, and I've missed out on a truckload of experience.

I'm intimidated by the possibility that I will leave college loveless, then wageslave for a couple of decades until my body no longer cooperates, and my life savings will pay for a permanent residence at a nursing home. One uneventful day I'll kick the bucket and the only people grieving will be my geriatric acquaintances. A week from then, I will practically never have existed.

I am a good person with a bulletproof moral compass. I'm compassionate and forgiving, and if I said so myself quite mature for my age. It's not that I have any personality issues holding me back from intimacy. 

At the moment, my only solace is knowing that once I have earned a good amount of money, I will move into a house with a big garage, set up a workshop, spend my free time learning woodworking, and start building my own coffin around the age of sixty. I hear it's a very enlightening experience. At least I get to go out in style, eh?

2200,softspaken,1594451919,1,"So until recently, the last few months have been hell. I was severely depressed for different reasons, including loneliness. I really tore myself down with what I feel like is an identity crisis. I feel like I'm starting to come out of that, but unless I can turn this into actual change, I'm afraid it'll be for not. 

What I learned over the past few months is that my values have changed. I used to be ok with being a loner that just got by, playing video games or whatever. But now I realize that's not for me anymore. What I'm really missing are meaningful relationships and a meaningful use of my time. 

I'm 23, a senior in a university, but transferred from a community college last year. I've really struggled with making new friends since high school, and any friendships from then are basically nonexistent now. The one friend I've had along with me since, my best friend, seems to be growing distant. And he's the only one I've confided in about the stuff I've been going through.

So I definitely get the feeling that I've probably scared him off. I even feel like I maybe made our friendship out to be more than it is. And now I feel like the one meaningful relationship I do have is quickly slipping away. I love him and always will, but I'm starting to feel like it might be time to move on, as much as it might hurt.

It's not sex i miss it's intimacy, physical and emotional intimacy, the feeling that another person could lay your soul bare with one hand and heal you with the other, being so angry and a single look from them calmes you to the point of not even remembering the anger, being so inconsolable that its overwhelming and to be held in there arms not to feel the sadness go but to feel safe enough to fell it and know that if you fall into that sadness they will be there to catch you.

I‚Äôve been trying to find the right sub reddit to post this in but after sifting through multiple subreddits it seems that everyone‚Äôs having bigger and worse problems than I am. But I‚Äôve given up trying to find one so I‚Äôm just posting it here. The issue is I‚Äôve (M 18) always been a relatively popular person throughout my life. I‚Äôve always got on with most people and I‚Äôve got friends from every single type of friend group possible. But I always feel so alone. I‚Äôm always so negative about myself but I act confident so no one can see it. I‚Äôve honestly been doing this act for so long that I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore. I always have doubts in the back of my mind that people will aren‚Äôt as close to me as they seem. I never know if the people I regard as my best friends would even consider me in their top 50 and I always think that people don‚Äôt like me as much as they seem too. I‚Äôm occasionally invited out with my friends and whenever I do go out everyone always seems to enjoy my presence yet a week later that group will go out again and I‚Äôll be excluded. I‚Äôve struggled to form relationships as whenever someone finds me attractive I simply put it down to them confusing me for someone else or not having got a good enough look at me. I look much better in photos than in real life so anyone who messages me who‚Äôs never met me in real life I swiftly reject as I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm good enough for them. I‚Äôve never felt depressed to the point of suicide however some days I‚Äôve left the house and thought that I wouldn‚Äôt mind if a bus hit me today or something similar. I don‚Äôt know what I wanted to achieve from posting this. If someone‚Äôs got this far please somehow help me even if it‚Äôs just words of advice or a private message. I just need something.

2232,Void_escape,1594430748,1,"Let this be a PSA to all the lonely guys out there. I'm certainly one of you. If you're anything like me, then the notion of meeting a woman online makes a lot of intuitive sense to you. After all, why couldn't you post a personal ad or make a dating profile, find a compatible woman, exchange contact information, and escalate it into a relationship, as if you were applying for a job? Online dating sites and forums cater to this sort of mentality, and unfortunately, despite its popularity with men, it's one of the least successful strategies for finding a girlfriend. I've learned that there are several factors working against you:

* **The numbers game is unfavorable.** Online spaces, especially dating sites, are heavily skewed towards men. On any given site, there could be 10 legitimate male profiles for every legitimate female profile. The women are flooded with options and as a result, standards are incredibly high. It becomes very difficult to distinguish yourself from the hundreds of other male profiles. This applies on reddit as anywhere else. If you want to see for yourself, do the following experiment: make a 21F account and post an ad for F4M on any subreddit that caters to that sort of thing. Then repeat with a 21M account. Compare the two inboxes. 

* **Women don't like the anonymity of online interaction**. Men like online interaction because it's low risk and rejections are relatively painless. In my experience, women would rather meet men IRL through mutual social connections, where they can vet them 'in the wild'. Women like to know what they're dealing with, and getting a message from an anonymous reddit user doesn't communicate as much information as seeing a man in a real-life social context, how he carries himself, seeing his body language, how others react to him, etc. 

* **There's no reason for a woman to take the initiative online**. They will not message you first. Why would they take the risk, when they get bombarded with messages anyway? Again, most women get a lot of offline attention too, and the internet is at best a supplement or distraction for them. You will have to do all the work, and that means standing out from all the other guys trying to do the same thing. Again, the numbers game is against you, and you're starting on the back foot. 

* **Women's path to relationships is largely not through the internet**. They get a lot of offline attention and have better social networks in general. They have no problem meeting guys in the real world through friends-of-friends and mutual connections. This is anecdotal, but I personally don't know a single male friend or acquaintance that met their SO online. I get the feeling that it's possible under certain conditions, but the odds are stacked against you as a man. You're better off pursuing a strategy with a better return on your time and investment, and less harmful to your self-esteem. 

* **Where are they?** You might have asked yourself at some point, if the gender ratios in the population are more or less 50/50, why every dating site, every online forum, every meetup group, etc. seems to be dominated by men, with a minority of women that receives a huge amount of attention. The answer is that you are looking in the wrong places. Most women have extensive real-life social networks (extensive compared to most men, anyway), and you need to embed yourself in these networks to have a chance. High school and college are the best opportunities, due to the sheer number of young people with similar backgrounds and experiences that are stuck in the same environment. After high school and college, it becomes exponentially more difficult. There's a reason most people meet their partners at this time in their life. If you graduate without a social network, you're deeply in the shit.",lonely,Forget about finding a girlfriend online,2020-07-11 11:25:48

I am not really outgoing, I am committed to my teaching job in Japan, I write and make films on the side, and keep in touch with family and friends. One of the other teachers asked if he wanted to drink over at my place. I was like sure. He was telling me some things he did with other teachers like going out to drink, vacation, etc. I couldn't help but think ""why the hell did you not invite me?"". Sure I am busy but I can put forth the time to hang out just not out of spontaneity.  Spontaneity gives me anxiety since I plan every week on what I plan to do. He did however tell some things that you are not supposed to do in Japan so I am very glad that I didn't tag along, but still, would it have hurt to just ask? I know this sounds petty but people just piss me off sometimes. I realized he came over because he was bored, not because we haven't seen each other in little while due to our committed jobs. I like what I have right now. My art is preventing me to kill myself and I feel like I am moving forward with my life. Giving my life more meaning and color, but being lonely is not always great. I don't plan on hanging out with him and his friends in the future, because luckily, I don't really mix well with these people. I will probably a third wheel anyway. It always happens.

He's always been too good at making friends. Can't go to the store for some quick shopping, without him literally talking to everyone. Whenever we're watching netflix (""date night""), its usually cancelled or cut short, because his friends bombard him repeatedly with xbox invites. He makes out that he needs my permission to game with them. But truth is if I don't say yes, he'll lose interest in what we're watching, keep asking if we're done spending time together, keep checking their profiles, or get on his phone to chat with them. So, I just say yes and go to a different room. 

He's invited me (out of pity) to their xbox party lots of times but I don't belong. They're not bad people just not my type of crowd. It's ""someone bringing their little sibling to hangout and all has to be polite"" levels of awkward. I'm not funny, I stutter, and I'm just weird. I'm not a big gamer either so, whenever they're talking about games, mechanics, and whatnot, I don't get it so I can't chime in even if I want to. I'm a soft speaker, so whenever I do make rare jokes nobody hears me and then my husband repeats me and they laugh. He talks over me and cuts me off. So I shut up after awhile. Even surrounded by others I feel alone.

2269,wolf298,1594411897,1,"So I‚Äôve been feeling pretty lonely for a long time 9+ months, I spoke to this friend about it and we were talking and it helped, somewhat. Now I‚Äôve known them two years and at first everything was amazing like they‚Äôd ask me to do stuff, I‚Äôd ask to like a proper two way relationship. After I told I was feeling lonely I felt he was contacting me more just to see how I‚Äôm doing, as I often do. 

Fast forward to now and we‚Äôve hardly spoke and haven‚Äôt hung out since Christmas, we were meant to go for drinks on my birthday which they cancelled on me last minute and said we‚Äôd go a week later as they was tired from work (not the first time btw). That killed me so much, my best friend who live over in the US couldn‚Äôt make it but I was like at least this other friends gonna be there. Anyway none of it happened and then lockdown began. 

Since lockdown started I was messaging like once every couple weeks checking all was good, never bothered in return but whatever. Decided I‚Äôd done with the friend as to me this isn‚Äôt friendship and went two months without saying anything just to see and they never contacted me at all. In the end I was really stugvling with my depression and drug addictions and needed a friend. I stupidly turned to this person who after I told my problems (best friend got real sick with corona, my depression and emptiness), all they said was sorry to hear that and didn‚Äôt bother about it afterwards. 

Lockdown gets lifted and we can finally go for that drink so I message like when you want to go out and all they respond is ‚Äúidk‚Äù and that was it. No I‚Äôm free this day or anything like that so I‚Äôm not asking that again, it‚Äôs the fifth time in a row I‚Äôve been told busy or some lame excuses like it. 

I get a message out of the blue the other day from them and literally no how are you or anything just literally ‚Äúhow do you do this?‚Äù. What the hell you come to me for help but don‚Äôt want anything to do with me otherwise. I‚Äôm sick of you making me feel this way and I want to let you go but then you come back and I forgive like a idiot, I know you don‚Äôt like me much and don‚Äôt think of me a a friend but why treat someone like this? I told and said if you don‚Äôt want to hang out anymore we don‚Äôt have to I‚Äôd prefer you just say, but apparently everything‚Äôs cool but it‚Äôs not cuz I feel lonely to hell and you don‚Äôt care so no it ain‚Äôt cool.",lonely,When you realise that a close friend just doesn‚Äôt want you anymore.,2020-07-11 06:11:37

I cried so hard when I realised I was going to be alone again today. I took myself on a drive to a pretty little village, it was bustling with people (made me anxious and more alone). It kinda just emphasized my loneliness.

I really struggle to make friends tbh, and now lockdown and social distancing has made me feel like I've no hope for breaking out of my bubble of isolation.

I'm 29 and never had a real romantic relationship, a combo of the way I look and the social anxiety thing. I couldn't even make friends before this covid thing because I could never will myself to go to a meetup. Every time I thought about doing one, a voice in my head would say stuff like 'it'll be awkward' or 'you'll have nothing in common with them'. I am actually terrified that I will go to an event and it will be full of hyper confident 'work hard play hard' types.  

On paper I should be socially successful. I have an education, a good job,  I'm clever, I have good comedic timing and I make people laugh when I'm comfortable with them. But I can't seem to find friends outside the same people I know from college, who are always busy with their SOs now. I just want to find a friend like me, good sense of irony, likes games and internet stuff, smart, also maybe as pathetic and insecure as I am. Would be nice to find another secret loser, someone essentially starting their social life at 30. Someone funny who I can relate to. Someone who understands what it's like to wake up and rather be dead than alone anymore. Anyhow, if you're my age or close, and this made sense to you, let me know! I'm a good friend. :).

I'm not the type of person to write a paragraph for her when she wakes up, or to take her on a fancy date. My love language is gifts, but she appreciates words more. I was going to write something nice for her, and buy us this bracelet, called a Bond Touch. She isn't far away, but we're a lesbian couple and her mom is homophobic, so she isn't really allowed to hang out with me outside of school. 

I had the essay prepared, and then today comes. I'm usually pretty uncomfortable with saying things that are sentimental and genuine, but I decided that I would push that aside for her.  I go to send it to her, and I see this message. ""Are we still dating?"" Oh. I could feel the confidence that she would love the essay I prepared drain out of me. 

She's not even sure if we're dating. Did I do something wrong? Am I taking this relationship too seriously? Well now I can't send my essay, I feel like it'll be over the top.

After quitting football (one good friend remained) I hit the gym for a few months and then wanted to start playing Handball (I am from Germany) because I got lonely again and it was an attempt to make knew friends and I really liked it and there were a lot of people about my age and I gained some confidence and had a positive feeling  about my choice. After 4 months without getting to know anybody really well (because I had to go train with seniors for learning how to play) I got problems to run. Took me a few months and a lot of doctors to realize I probably have a chronical illness which doesn't allow me to do al ot of sports (still have no right medication to treat my condition). It teared me apart. I just have a few friends, they know how important doing sports to me is but they don't really understand how much worse it is being alone. I tried talkimg to them about it but they don't really understand me. 
I also never had a girlfriend, three of my friends tried to hook me up with someone but they really were not the right to be with.
So I joined a swimming club but there only are eldery people apparently swimming is not the sport for young people. So I joined the coast guard where a lot of fun people are but I still haven't really connected with them and due to a operation I had I couldn't join three main events where I may have had the chance to get to know them better and then there was the lockdown. 
Now everything is getting back to normal and people start meeting up except me being alone at home and knowing people having a nice time together really hits me bad.
All in all I find it difficult to connect to some people and need more social interaction in life and get more out of my room.",lonely,My chronical illness made me lonely,2020-07-11 00:06:21

First of all, big shout-out to all my people who are getting through this pandemic shit alone. They are NEVER gonna understand what that shit's like, will they? Assuming we all make it through, that is. And yeah, single people, people who have been dumped, broken up with - okay, yeah, y'all can get down too. But I meant my people who are ALONE - like, no friends or family anywhere near you, no real support system to speak of, haven't had a hug in like 7 months, much less any other form of physical contact, kind of ALONE. Keep your head, as best you can, however you can, and fuck who might judge you for it. They DO NOT get it, they never will.

The worst part of this whole shit? Not the quarantine and that, the general anxiety, the looming disaster. Nah, the shit between us. It's hard to say, I guess it depends on when you ask me. But right now, and I keep coming back to this - it's that I've been through so much WORSE. We weren't together all that long, and it was a fucking shit-show damn near the entire time. And yes, I feel like a fool, and I should. You got busy showing me exactly who you were very quickly, I just thought I knew someone else, REALLY knew them, and I didn't want to believe you. I had multiple chances to stop the bleeding. And near the end, I did. Well, for a time. But whatever. I've been through SO much more significant pain. The trauma that you chose to light back up for me, after promising otherwise, for one. Losing all that, and the time it took to do so? SO much bigger than our shit. The relationship before that! Lasted 6 times as long! The pain there was a two-way street, at least there when I was crying at the end, I deserved what I got! Three ruined relationships, three financial disasters. You'd think I'd learn...if your cowardly ghosting no-contact ass would speak to me, you'd know that I actually blame you for FAR LESS than you think. And really ain't even mad about 75% of everything, at all. You did what comes naturally to you. I made myself an easy mark. Yeah, it was fucked up, yeah, shouldn't have happened, and doesn't invalidate any of the things I've said or that you did, you are a complete fraud and all - but hey. I've been around several blocks several hundred times. Shit happens, all too often. shrug

Here's the kicker. THIS is the worst part. It's that even though I should just brush my shoulders off, make peace with no closure, take the time I need to process it all and not take that out on someone else...then plaster a smile on, wade out into the dating pool, and chisel away at the new brick wall up around my heart as fast as I can? I fucking CAN'T. I should be over your weak shit. I WOULD be over your weak shit. But before, even when the pain was at its' worst...things were much different. Even if the support group wasn't there, like last time...I had MONEY. I had the means to move far, far away. I could go out, see new places, meet new faces, eat and drink my way through a new city. Travel some, see the sights, LIVE. And I can't fucking do that now. I could DATE. First off, see last point - $. You wouldn't know this, as you never really pay for anything, but dating is fucking expensive - she's an independent woman who does it all on her own though - just ask her! And hey, whatever, that's how I was raised, that was fine with me, as long as fucking ""Single Ladies"" didn't start playing on a loop in the back of your mind and you weren't pontificating about how hard you've had it, and ""THE STRUGGLE."" Also, the trauma triggered, the panic attacks now even if I did have the money - not to mention the whole pandemic, social distancing thing. But yeah, I could DATE. Most of all - top of the mountain - in the times before, I had HOPE. I had hope, and it was mostly realistic - things were gonna get better! I was gonna chase my dream, hence moving where I did! I was gonna stop killing myself at my corporate gig I hated, and to a large degree, make my own way, be my own boss! My own man! Back to the old goal! I was gonna have a better relationship, with someone worth my love and my effort, who reciprocated it - who let hard times bring us together instead of tearing us apart! And...and...yeah. And now what the fuck have I got? And now what the fuck can I realistically hope for? And who? Even fucking, friends, for Christs' sake? And I'm not saying ALL of that is your fault! Some of it is most definitely not - but some damn sure is! My life is FUCKED, and unless some miracle, and I'm not talking about hard work and time here, no no no. I'm too old and have worked too hard, and have lost too much, to believe that crock of shit. I'm talking about a bona fide MIRACLE, Moses parting the Red Sea, Red Sox reversing the curse, Ray J wanting to document the size of that ass on camera in Kim Kardashian's story level miracle - for shit to get anywhere really past me just grinding it out and barely keeping my head above water, if I'm lucky enough not to get really sick or hurt and - you see where I'm going with this?

Big shout-out to all my people who have lost everything right before, during, or because of this pandemic shit. They are NEVER gonna understand what that shit's like, will they? Oh, and yeah, you know, people who lost your relationship, lost ""everything"" right, and maybe you miss your fucking dog, I don't know, yeah, sure y'all can get down too. Even people who lost your job, fucking sucks right, struggling to figure it all out - yeah, y'all can get down too. But I'm talking to my people who lost EVERYTHING - love, maybe your family, your house or place, not only your job but most likely your career, your IDENTITY! And extra special shout-out, we see y'all, stay shining, to all my people who are going through that shit AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME!!!

Final thought - I'm no Jerry, but I don't exploit people - that's more your lookout. I've thought a lot about closure, and about an apology, and about blah blah blah some other Aesop's Fable shit that ain't gonna happen. And I realized - why, self? Why? Because you KNOW, even though it's gonna sorta SOUND like an apology - it's gonna be more of the same bullshit! It's gonna sound like ""Words can't even describe how sorry some more lame half-ass attempt at cliche apology sounds, I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE MYSELF, AND I WAS GOING THROUGH A LOT, AND MY TRAUMA, AND MY PAIN, AND I COULDN'T BLAH, AND SO I DIDN'T BLAH, AND I DID BLAH, BUT I LEARNED BLAH, AND I'VE GROWN BLAH, AND I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO BEAR THE BRUNT BUT I HAD TO BLAH BLAH AND NOW I BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. RIGHT PERSON, WRONG TIME CLICHE BLAH. NEVER MEANT TO BE CLICHE BLAH. MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE OR ALTERNATE UNIVERSE CLICHE BLAH. WE NEVER WOULD HAVE WORKED OUT ANYWAY WHICH TOTALLY CONTRADICTS WHAT I SAID AT THE TIME AND IF IS TRUE IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I LITERALLY WILLED THAT INTO EXISTENCE WITH MY SHITTY THOUGHTS, DUPLICITOUS SPEECH, AND CHILDISH WHORE ACTIONS BLAH. YOU WERE BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME ANYWAY CLICHE BLAH I DID YOU A FAVOR CLICHE BLAH AND NOW I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ALL THE HARD TIMES I HAD TO GO THROUGH IN MY LITTLE HEAD AND HEART WHILE YOU LITERALLY LOST YOUR ASS AND ARE AT ZERO WHILE I ACTUALLY LEFT IN A BETTER POSITION THAN I CAME IN.

And seeing the amount of people on this sub, the amount of love/upvotes/comments, made me immediately feel a little bit of relief from these other shitty feelings I‚Äôve been having.

Onto that. I have lived with my best friend of 8 years and her boyfriend of four years. Without getting into too much detail or background, I adore them both. However, I myself was in a relationship for 1 1/2 years that was the most serious relationship I‚Äôve ever had. We broke up almost two years ago, and I haven‚Äôt been the same since. I still miss him (almost) every day. And since the end of it, I have become kind of reclusive, a little bitter and angry, and significantly more depressed and down on myself than I used to be. I loved him so much, and he made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt enough for him. And that feeling,too, has carried over into the rest of my relationships. It haunts me every day, that I and everything I do for the ones I love, will never be enough. I have always been there for my best friend. I have never hurt her. We have never gotten into in argument or not spoken for more than a day. And unfortunately it has never been just us in a home, like we had planned. The entire time we have lived together, her boyfriend has also been with us. Again, I adore them both. But after being in a relationship (which was amazing and full of love, although ended not well), I miss everyday the feeling of someone wanting me. Of loving me completely, and being willing to do, or wanting to do, things for me just to make me happy. I don‚Äôt mean just buying me stuff, but ya know, massages and notes and snuggling up in bed, stuff like that. Living with a couple that is happy is extremely tiring. I‚Äôm very happy for them, and that they are happy together and have worked through whatever issues they‚Äôve had. But at the same time, I wish so badly that I had that for myself again. I feel at this point like I‚Äôm going to be alone forever, and no one will ever love me like that again. I have had so many bad experiences dating, I just don‚Äôt want to put in the effort anymore. And if one more person tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll happen when it‚Äôs time‚Äù I might actually put out a cigarette on my tongue. 

My thoughts most of the time when I feel excluded or unimportant are, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to be alone, then I‚Äôm going to fucking be alone.‚Äù. And I will go to my room and not speak to anyone for as long as I can, because why the hell would you care? No one gives a single shit about how I actually feel, and even when I do express it, nothing comes of it. I don‚Äôt even feel better afterwards. I just feel more guilty for having put that on someone‚Äôs shoulders. I don‚Äôt want to feel guilty in addition to depressed, lonely, worthless to the world, and unloveable. 

My best friends boyfriend told me today that they try not to show affection towards each other in front of me, and it made me feel horrible and want to cry. I don‚Äôt want them to hide from me. But I don‚Äôt want to feel like utter shit when I see it either. 

If anyone made it this far, I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate it. I don‚Äôt know what I was looking to gain from this, other than to just tell someone that maybe might actually care.

I'm just so angry that my sister can go to middle school when the last time she went to school was in third grade and have so many friends. She's never been bullied, she's always had a lot of friends, and she's had like three boyfriends (they lasted about two weeks, but still) when the only people that talk to me just want a better alternative to their fist.

Today has been like any other day. I wake up, go to work for 2 hours. Come back, stay at home for 13 and fall asleep.


This has been my life(sorta, on the weekends I‚Äôd go to work for 8 hours+) for the last 4-6 months. 


My life was looking for the better prequarintine. I had a fwb (which I caught feelings for and she didn‚Äôt not feel the same, quickly got over it), the fun I had with my fwb was also the first time I experienced sex. It was amazing. 


I was left wanting a lot more than what I had experienced.


I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I am starting to get desperate. I have resorted to reddit in order to find a sexual partner and be able to experience more but it has not worked not for me.




The only hobby I have is the gym and the most you can do that for a day is  2 hours. After those 2 hours I have absolutely nothing to do, no one to talk to.


Just me, myself and my thoughts. 


I would love a sexual partner to experience more and find out what I like and also help the partner. But that should honestly be the least of my worries

So I moved away from the only friend I've ever had last October, and I still don't have friends where I live now because of how weird life has been lately :/
We were really close friends for like 10 years (i'm 19), and he's the only person I've ever been around outside of our school.

Anyway, I went to visit him recently and when I did I wanted to get a cute little plush at a tiny Japanese shop. His girlfriend recently got kicked out of her house and lost all her things, so before we left I asked him if we should get her something because she used to live in Japan and loves little plushes. He's really nice so he made a big deal about me paying for it (like $40) but it was cool and we ended up just telling her he got it for her. Then later I took them out for dinner and stuff

But we were talking later on that night, and he asked me about paying for everything, and I just said ""dude idc, i don't have a girlfriend to buy stuff for and i never go out so it doesn't matter"". But then after a few seconds I couldn't help but just start crying after thinking about what I said without even hesitating. Idk it's just so hard seeing everyone around you have a way better life :( 
It's like I literally have no life experience, the closest I've gotten to a date or a first kiss is hugging a girl after she got into a car accident right in front of me, and I'm 19 and I still have 1 friend (who lives in another state)

and here's the thing - while online friends are nice, they don't at all feel the same as irl friends to me. They're a good way of not going full-on Tom Hanks, but they don't quite feel as real?

and even though I recognize that 'wow, I'm feeling really lonely' I never actually fucking go out and actually contact people - out of bucket-fulls of procrastination, forgetfulness and good old fashioned worries about it being awkward.

I‚Äôve broke up with my my girlfriend (25f) of 2 years.  

The relationship was never a straightforward. 
I know I might sound like a mug but I did all her university work for her, I pay for holiday and treat her like a queen. It was always one way and she would admit that. But I was okay with it 

However, she was always honest from the start about her PMDD.  For those not aware it‚Äôs a very rare condition which effect 1% of woman and is like PMS on steroids with the most extreme mood swings and the horrific anger. But I‚Äôve always put up with it every month because i loved her. 

However the last 10 months have been the hardest of my life.  Since August 2019 she went off the rails. 

She would literally break up with me every week over the smallest of things and regualy make me choice between my friends and her. Due to this I have lost many friends. She‚Äôs had a go at me for everything from being selfish for not being able to afford a music festival (both where jobless, and I paid for a holiday) and the grade she got in her work, which I did because she struggled with. She‚Äôs mocked my family because my dad wasn‚Äôt able to give her a job.  Called me a embarrassment because I went to a protest ralley). Always brings up my ex and said they where lucky with out me. Says she wishes she could of punched me in the faces. Everything I‚Äôve done for her like buy her presents and plan stuff always get thrown back in back my face. 

I‚Äôve been called everything from cancer,  disgusting, evil, spinless and a waste of a person. But it‚Äôs stuff like being called half a man that really hurts me, I‚Äôve felt emasculated and crushed by the digs on everything from my appearance to my friends and it has really got me down

She knows she has a problem. She says she takes her unhappiness out on me. But it never stopped.  I‚Äôve tried so hard to fix her and help her but I‚Äôm killing myself. 

It got to the stage  I started to break and said stop this verbal and mental abuse.  She then accused of me fucking with her. I know how I feel. But I feel so guilty for saying he‚Äôs abuse.

2385,nopointinlife1234,1594326578,2,"My friends pity me so I can't bring myself to interact with them anymore. It's been forever since I've seen them. I'm a struggling alcoholic who continually relapses to self-medicate depression and suicidal thoughts. My friends are all binge drinkers who enable me, and at my absolute worst in the past, let me drive home black out drunk.

I can't bring myself to clean my horribly messy room, that at this point it has built up to an impossible task.

I just got rejected by graduate school, which I now need to re-due the application process three more times for January. 

In the now, I live at home with my widowed retired father, who basically subsidies my life. The reason I'm going to graduate school now is that I wasted my early 20's with no direction in junior college, and I feel guilty living with my father that entire time. And let me be clear, I love my father. And he obviously loves me to not throw me out. The only time I've gotten close to full time work while in school, I almost killed myself from utter depression and hating my menial job. Wallmart doing 35 hours while going to school full time. I ended up quitting and living off savings for awhile, and can't get hired anywhere else. I'm afraid that going back to full time at somewhere I hate will push me over the edge. But, as a result of all this, I can't afford therapy. It's something I could never ask my father to pay for, because he's had a bad experience with a therapist once and now doesn't believe in them. If I asked him to do so, he'd roll his eyes. Not that I would. I feel guilty enough living with him the past decade of my useless existence. 

Over the last year, when my drinking was under control, I lost 45lb and started dating.

I'm a useless loser who's now (because of Coronavirus) stuck inside. I'm so depressed that I had a relapse, and I gained back 15-20lb inside of 2 months of being stuck inside before I got my drinking under control again. This time is *has* to be for good. Now, in the last month, I've at least stabilized and I'm not gaining anymore weight. Though I look disgusting compared to before. But, it isn't like I could date. So, who cares I guess?

Part of it is the fact my father, who once again subsidizes my life, buys alcohol for me despite me asking him not to. His response is, ""Well, don't you have the willpower to not drink it all at once, for Christ sake?"" He refuses to believe I'm an alcoholic, despite me telling him repeatedly. And we fight all the time, which I try to express to him is caused by a lack of healthy communication, but he rolls his eyes and tells me I'm being dramatic. My mother, who died of a heart attack when I was 18, was diagnosed bi-polar. So, as far as I know, this could all be one giant manic episode from me. 

I'm just a loser. A loser who's afraid to work. A loser who's afraid to clean up himself and his life. A loser who hates and loathes his very existence.

2386,Hannibal_Lecter6,1594326177,1,"I'm a freshman at college, 20 years old. Family has never been a place where I have someone to talk to, my parents were never there when I really needed them ever since childhood. I don't have friends, not a one; not because i'm an introvert or something, I just don't fit in with them. I don't enjoy being fake which most of my so called ""friends"" are. Having a good friend would be great but I do fine being alone (ofc with access to internet,games,etc. or else i'd go insane) 

Around when I was 17 years old, I used to get really moody; thought it was nothing but over time I realized I was depressed. Never told anyone about it just did what I did daily. Never go out much unless I've got to. I have a problem, whenever I try to change my daily habit I do great for a week or so but after that I get really depressed , anxiety kicks in and i'm back to zero; everything I learned or changed goes back to zero after my depression kicks in and i'm right where I started. It's been years since this is happening, one week I am fine and doing things to improve my life and the next i'm depressed with no will to get out of bed or eat properly and this happens every-time i try to learn or do something new. I used to be able to learn extremely quickly when i was in middle school. Without even going to school on a regular basis or even studying i would easily get to top 3 of my class. But now every time I learn something new it takes longer than it should and eventually forget it after I go into depression. I tried making friends also but nope not one was there with whom I wanted to be friends with or with whom I could even share a bit. Every time I make friends, after a while i'm alienated from the group because I don't brag or try to be fake which I guess nowadays is common to seem trendy. Also I never gossip and will never share anyone's secret which were some of the reasons I get alienated sometimes. 

All this was fine with me, I wasn't happy but it wasn't even sad. I just felt like it is what it is and never let it bother me. I do hangout sometimes with some guys from my class but I don't get too friendly with them. I go out on walks sometimes just to get air. All this was fine until this pandemic struck. 100+ days inside the house, only sometimes I go out to get groceries or other stuffs. No one to talk to as I said family is never there. I don't receive or text or call anyone.

Standing in the kitchen eating, I imagine that I have a gf standing beside me with her head on my shoulder or when I‚Äôm lying down to go to sleep, I imagine that she‚Äôs right there beside me, cuddled up close and with her head on my chest.

2392,Scarface_0492,1594321831,2,"I'm a 26 year old male dealing with mental health issues.  
To be honest, I'm not really sure what to write here, my mind is a jumbled mess lately, and I can't hold any thoughts for longer than a few seconds.  
I'm new to Reddit, only ever used it once for games I used to play but I figured I should try writing here now.   
Throughout most of my life I have struggled with depression caused by various events, people and traumas, and I am struggling with it now. It feels worse than it has ever been before, and I don't know what to do anymore. Lately I have been feeling like I should write a long letter to everyone who currently plays a role in my life and some of the people that have in the past and then end it all after that. I don't want to do that, but I'm tired. I hate this world, I hate the place I'm in, and I hate how powerless I am and how my mind is constantly working against me.  


There are a lot of reasons for me to feel the way I do, and I could write down my entire life story here, but I would be busy for a while, and I don't really feel like doing that. I believe the driving factor behind my depression right now though, is how lonely I am feeling. I am so disconnected from everyone, and I fail to establish any new connections with anyone.  
I've been trying to meet new people through online communities, games and apps. Most people don't respond or conversations are very one-sided. When people do seem interested however, I either fail to hold up a conversation because I either have so little to talk about or can't think of anything to talk about. After a short while, we stop talking too. I don't blame them for it though, I know it's hard to be friends with the person that I am now. What makes me feel the worst though, is when we have been talking for a while but if I don't initiate a conversation I will never get a text back. It makes me feel so unwanted. Eventually I'll stop texting these people first and then we just never talk against because they never bother to send the first message. When that happens, I feel like I'm a burden, that they were simply talking to me out of pity or that they were just trying to be nice.  


The people I currently have around me tell me to go out. They tell me to go the gym or to go to bars and clubs or maybe do volunteer work and strike up a conversation with random people. Thing is, none of this comes easy to me. Almost all of my experiences with people have been negative ones. I can't just walk up to someone and introduce myself. To me, this seems weird and completely unnatural. It took well over two years to get comfortable at work with my coworkers and being able to have small talk and banter to some extent. So how am I supposed to befriend a stranger?

Honestly, I don't even know where I'm even going with this anymore. So I'm going to leave it at that. I'm unable to make friends and form any deep and meaningful connections. There are a lot of things I am currently dealing with but I feel like loneliness is the most serious one. I also hated writing this, I can't keep a clear mind and focus on what I need to write down, and it already took longer than expected.

2395,nothingtrulymatters,1594317756,3,"This post is supposed to vent my feelings.

I'll be 22 this October. I don't have ""friends"". Well, I have a lot of friends whom I regularly chat with, all are my classmates or used to be. But none of them know me at a personal level.

When I was little, I had this thought or vision that I'll be a great person by the time I'm 25. But now  I'm nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in an indifferent universe.

I wanna exercise regularly but most days I just procrastinate. 

According to internet surveys, I'm an INTP-T person, an introvert. I have hard time smiling at my 

neighbours or starting a small talk with someone at social gatherings. 

In my class I'm very talkative and sarcastic and humorous and they like me, still I'm a total nerd and most time they talk about things I don't even know or not interested in. Even in my college I don't have friends outside my class or among any juniors, although I used to have some friends in a previous college, whom were not in my class but we lived in the same hostel.

I never went to movies with my friends at previous college, never drank beer with'em but we used to have a good time but they don't know me as a person. Still, when I left them, when I leave to my home from my class in the present college, I feel a sense of emptiness, like ....I can't explain it. It's like I wear a mask when I'm around them, I change into someone else, who is still me but not my 

permanent self. I don't hang out with them on holidays, or go travel with them. When the call me I make silly excuses. Once I had to try so hard to skip my bench-mate's sister's wedding.

This is mostly because of the way I was parented. I was grown up not to have friends let alone female friends. But my friends group do include female friends whom I'm comfortable talking to and flirt. But I din't even start talking casually to girls until I was 18, mostly because I did not know how to start a conversation and I thought I was un-interesting.

Also I don't trust people. In my view anyone can change into your nemesis.

I'm good looking and healthy and I have pretty good self esteem. 

And obviously, I don't have a gf and i'm a virgin. I come from a very conservative society in India where there is a huge stigma associated with sex before marriage and dating is frowned upon, also most women are not open to dating. I'm not really sad about it because there are more important things in life.

And I watch hell of a lot of porn to compensate that, but now it has become boring as hell too.

I like to play music, compose and draw but I don't show case it. 

I'm a nerd who read a lot of science materials mostly engineering and physics, watch mostly Discovery, NGC and TV channels like that. Also TV/web series es. Owing to that, I have more technical knowledge than my peers, only making me more nerdy among them.

And I'm an electronics tinkerer and have kleptomaniac tendency to steal any and all technical stuff. 

Besides all this people who know me, they like me. But that's not ""me"". 

I'm an atheistic-nihilist, and I really wish there if there was more to life than living it. I often contemplate on life only to feel a deep despair on realising how life will come to an end and how the universe is most likely to end up in heat death.

I don't know what my future will be, I don't even my next step after graduating with an engineering degree. 

I have a messed up unhappy family due to a mother with bipolar-ish disorder, narcissistic disorder and APD.

I haven't learned to drive yet so I have to depend on my dad for transportation, its pathetic.

I don't think there is a female in this world with my same tastes and potential to be my partner. I often think about clone myself into another person except changing the gender so I can date and marry myself, to the female version of me!

The only social interaction that fills my heart with pure joy is playing with little kids and babies.

Every night I lie on my bed imagining myself living my life as I wished when I was a kid. Happiness, travelling, having a partner, money, a work I love to do.

I really wanna live a content life but most likely I'm gonna die as a lonely f'ed up soul.

I feel that I'm the reason they are like that. There's been times where I question if that person wants to be with me when I notice they are distant. Often times, I am told that I mayter and that they arent going to go anywhere, but I end up getting dumped or cheated on.

But I blew it. I got scared that because I'm so awkward and weird that she'd stop liking me, and my light would disappear.

I'm a 28M and I just lost my relationship of 7 years. I loved this girl with all of my being and I wanted to marry her, but she left me suddenly for someone else. At the end, she treated me as if I never meant anything to her. She wanted to keep me as a friend, but that felt cruel to me and so I told her I never wanted to hear from her again. It seemed that she didn't mind either way.   


I built my life around her and now that she's gone I've realized that I don't have anyone to turn to. The pandemic doesn't help either for wanting to go out, but even so I don't have anyone to go out with. I don't have anyone at all because for the longest time she was all that I needed.   


Once she took her things and left my place, I felt so much heartbreak that I sincerely wanted to kill myself. The only thing that made me hold back is the thought of me leaving behind something dark for my younger siblings. I don't want them to carry an emotional burden because their big brother killed himself. So, I resisted, although I came very close to convincing myself to do it.   


I'm in college right now, I have debt, and I need to work. It makes me feel that I'm being crushed under the weight of everything that I don't even have time to cope with what I feel. Now, I feel so lonely but it's so hard for me to connect with anyone. I don't tend to like or enjoy the same things others do and that makes it hard to even get a conversation going.

And since then I haven't been sad like I used to. I used to cry like every night or every other night but its been about 3 weeks since I've cried. I would still get kinda sad but never cried. But today for some reason I just cried a lot. I've never been depressed or would consider my self depressed at all. But for some reason I've recently been thinking about how I kind of just want to go to sleep forever. I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna be awake sometimes. Wherever we go when we sleep where we're unconscious and don't have to worry about anything, I wish I could just stay there. I wish I could just stay asleep and not deal with anything.

Anytime I have talked to people for advice or told them that I hate being single everyone always says that ""You don't need a girlfriend to be happy."" When it sure as hell seems like it. Im not depressed but im not happy either, im like in the middle. I don't do anything. I just stay in my room all day and just watch YouTube videos or play video games. Anytime I do leave my house I think about how much happier id be if I had a girlfriend.

2418,s1nc0st4n,1594287830,1,"To anyone who reads, which will probably be no one with no point to me doing this, I hope that maybe it gives a bit more detail for what it is like to become hollow.

The night sky is a beautiful sight. Hundreds of stars are out there, twinkling in the vast darkness of space. The stars are like my hopes and dreams to me; and perhaps that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a night owl. I like working in the dark. It‚Äôs peaceful and quiet, and it‚Äôs the only place that my imagination can wander. I have a phobia for it though, especially when I‚Äôm alone. It‚Äôs interesting to me that I both love the dark and fear it, kind of like my cat. But laying on the grass and looking up into the night sky at the lights that contain my passions, it is peaceful. 
The problem arises when other light sources such as light bulbs come into play and dwindle out the stars. The hopes and dreams are gone, forgotten, and not to be seen again until the time comes. The light bulbs, at least to me, are an allegory as to why I dislike things that once I liked. They‚Äôre events, people, and circumstances that have led me to this moment, typing up my feelings, through a different path than what could have been expected. Those events dwindle out the stars, and simply leave me back to myself, laying on the grass, in the present.
You see, when your hopes and dreams for the future are dwindled out by the unfortunate present, you don‚Äôt know how to go about yourself. You‚Äôre confused and become frustrated that the world has molded you into a being that you never wanted to be. You want to see those twinkling stars again, but the light bulbs just won‚Äôt let you. You start to feel uncontrollable, as if you are a puppet being controlled by the puppet master. Depending on who you are, and how you react to the situation, you may either be able to control these feelings, or you fall to the hate. I fell.
One of the worst things about falling is that it takes less than a day, but yet it can take years to get back up. Friends that are there to support you can help lift you back up to your normal self faster and much safer, but you might not have any. You push people away from yourself because of how angry and sad you are, yet you want to just talk to someone. You get angrier and sadder, but the worst feeling that occurs‚Ä¶
Is being hollow.
You‚Äôre not sad, you‚Äôre not angry, but you aren‚Äôt happy or grateful either. You‚Äôre like a tube. People say stuff to you, you see some stuff, you do schoolwork, you talk to parents, and all of those feelings, experiences, and thoughts are just pushed out the other end. You‚Äôre a hollow vessel. You don‚Äôt like to talk because you have nothing to talk about. You don‚Äôt like to get up in the morning and have to live another day. You don‚Äôt like anything anymore. All of the passions that you once had are now gone, overshadowed by the dark remnants of the present.
It‚Äôs impossible to explain just how much being completely empty messes with your mind. It sticks; lingers with you for the rest of your life as a dark memory that you want to forget, but can‚Äôt. If you want to help yourself, find good friends that listen. Even a counsellor is good, but people your age might be better, even if they don‚Äôt have a PhD. Don‚Äôt be worried about putting a weight on their shoulders, they will always be there to help you when you need it. Just please, try to get people to help you instead of pushing them away.

I‚Äôve drifted apart from all my friends. Because keeping friends when you are depressed is too much work. You have to be fun and make jokes you don‚Äôt think are funny.

I am from Kentucky but I live in Michigan near the city of Jackson now

I am a PC Gamer and an Computer IT Nerd. I play MMOFPS, Sandbox, FPS, Arena Shooters, and sometimes Strategy games. I usually use Steam to play all my games.

I would like to make friends in person but thats been a struggle for me for the longest time. People judge me because I have a tendency to like to touch peoples long hair. I know im odd ok we all are. Ive tried making friends without the hair thing and still no one liked me. I agree I like hair more than others its a stimulant thing that makes me calm and happy. I don't want to make people feel like im using them I want friends who love their hair touched and hang out with me. My Ultamate goal is to find someone with really long hair who is very nice, loyal, helpful, kind, and over 18. Is that too hard to ask of people?

2444,DumbledorkzGoneWild,1594263635,1,"During the year of 2019, I wanted to make some friends and have a sense of community so I joined several college clubs in the hopes that I would meet people, make some friends, and maybe finally find a girlfriend.   


And what I learned from joining several clubs is that it's important to find a place where you get along with the people there. For instance, when I joined a college church group, people were really nice and friendly towards me. Every time I went, people said hi to me, and I even had several guys invite me out to eat and even play soccer with them on Monday night. And trust me, the type of people in the club can make a difference whether or not you keep coming back.   


On the other hand, there was another sports club that I joined during the fall and I didn't feel like I got along with the majority of people there, and now i'm a little hesitant to come back this fall. For one thing, nobody ever said hi to me or attempted to start a conversation so as a result, I never got to know anybody there. Secondly, i'm not sure how much I have in common with the people there. Many of them are your typical college kids who's idea of fun is drinking, partying, going to bars, and doing drugs. I'm not that kind of person; I don't like to go out and drink and you'll never see me using drugs. I rarely drink beer and when I do, I don't see the appeal of getting drunk. Thirdly, I get the feeling that some members of the club dislike me and actively try to exclude me from events. Just the other day, I asked in our chat group if anybody wanted to get together and throw a Frisbee around. One of the guys, now the co-captain, called me an idiot and told me that I was the reason why we can't have quidditch in the fall. I took that very personally.  Which now I understand because of coronavirus going on but there's still a better way of communicating that than just calling someone an idiot and blaming me.

  


All in all, there's certain groups of people you're going to mesh with better than others. Ideally, you want to find a group of people who are kind of like you and that you're able to get along with them. With my sports group, I was never able to establish a connection with any of them.",lonely,Joining A College Club And Not Fitting In With Anybody There.,2020-07-09 13:00:35

All attempts to express any bit of kindness and friendliness to my work colleagues and acquaintances is coldly brushed off or ignored. All attempts to have deep discussions with my friends and roommates, seem to fall on deaf ears as they will only broach the surface of the topic. I often feel that people don't like me and quietly judge me without saying anything. I'm a 23 F average weight and height, relatively attractive woman that gets catcalled and flirted with all the time and yet this doesnt seem to help the feelings that no one really likes me; I'm a telemarketer at my job and regularly clients mention that my voice is attractive and ""sexy"". And yet I still get this vibe that people that actually know me and spend day after day with me, cant stand me. Sometimes I feel I am being laughed at and mocked or that the people I am even just casually friendly to (""I hope you had a good day!"" ""How was your weekend?"" Etc) think I'm a weirdo. I feel like I care a lot more about everyone else than they care for me. 

I often feel the only reason anyone gets to know me is for their sexual attraction to me and when they realize I'm a mushy sweetheart with a lot of feelings, they immediately lose interest; even if they want a romantic relationship with me, it's often selfish and about their own benefits from dating a sweet and attractive person, not ever seemingly about getting to know me on a deeper level. A guy stopped seeing me after 2 dates when he found out I wanted to hold off on physical affection until we'd gotten to know each other.

Most of my family is dead, which contributes to why I am the way I am, the only family I have left has their own lives and honestly I feel like all I am to them is a reminder of all we've lost. They have their own lives and families of their own now, while the only family I have is dead and gone. So I try to not bother them. I want them to be happy because they deserve it after what we've been through, they don't need me as a reminder, coming solo to every holiday they have and feeling awkward and staying silent before leaving because I don't have a place anymore. I feel like a burden to the few friends I do have, which causes me not to tell them what's really going on with me because, again, I just want them to be happy without me bringing them down. My love life is a mess, I give so much of myself and the love I have to give, Communicate my feelings and thoughts appropriately, and I treat any potential partner with the upmost respect and care, always trying to be a better man than I was the day before. But all I do is get hurt or let down when I finally start to lower my walls, I'm given a reason to throw them right back up. I have so much pain and hurt inside that no one knows because I hide it so well and love everyone around me so much. I do it because I don't want anyone to hurt like I do. But I can never find someone who would do the same for me; and it hurts so bad, when all I want is someone to be genuine and to care.

When I say *kept you going* I mean in regards to morale and being able to not feel overwhelmed by the sense of loneliness. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

I find it difficult to keep my morale up. The lock down protocols at my university might extend to next spring, giving me one more year to physically make friends there. I know I'm young and I have my whole life ahead of me, but I was young and had my whole life ahead of me two years ago and I still don't have a friend. The fear that I won't make one can be very overwhelming and cause me to cycle towards distractions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Post:**

Out of the past 5 years I've spent 3.5 of them in isolation. I'm a college student and in the spring I felt like I was actually progress for once. I had a routine and I was starting to feel more comfortable socially. I was confident that I'd make one friend before the end of the quarter, but that wasn't the case due to the lock down. 

For me it's been difficult to not look for distractions and escapes from my loneliness. I always feel alone and that's something that's sort of okay for me. What's become overwhelming is the thought that I'm going to be for a long time. I might not have physical classes until the fall of next year and that's something that really scares me. It would be my last year on campus and I don't if I'll be able to make friends before I finish my degree. I feel the uncertainty after graduating would make my friendship and relationship opportunities nearly impossible.

That finally thought always brings me down. I've reach the point where I ""love myself."" I work out, have creative hobbies like art, writing and music (albeit, they're new and I'm a novice at all of them), I care about learning and pursuing my degree and I'm trying to become a better person. But, then I think what for? If I won't have anyone to share this with then I don't want to do it. That's when I reach for distraction in video games, depressing television or physical chores that stop me from thinking. 

I've done some thing to make me feel better like meditation and continue my healthy routines when I can, but I always myself cycling back into distractions.  I don't feel comfortable with online friendships or meeting people through bumble or tinder so that's something I've never pursued. 

I was wondering if anyone had any similar experience and was willing to share. Sharing unsuccessful attempts like my own are appreciated too. To me everything is a learning experience and I think anything helps.",lonely,"What has kept you going, especially during this lock down period?",2020-07-09 07:03:54

I want to use the first hour as a hang-out to have a conversation and get to know each other, and then the second hour for sex. I know that it's fake, I know that it's pathetic, but as a 27-year old man with no romantic or sexual success to speak of, I'm getting really desperate. All I want is the experience of hanging out with a woman and having sex with her afterwards. This one thing would change my life and yet it's not happening for some reason. I want to feel attractive for once in my life, even if it's just the illusion of attractiveness. I want my brain to believe that it can do it. Nothing has worked for me and it's fucking depressing, so I'm willing to throw around some money to get a simulation of what I want. I guess I'm lucky in that I have a decent job and can actually afford it. I want to experience the transition between ""interacting with someone in a real life setting"" and ""having sex.""

Another friend of mine told me he quit drinking months ago only to find out he hadn't and had been lying to me. The issue with that was Everytime he drank he became an asshole and would pick fights and project his own problems. I realized as much as I struggle with loneliness I NEED to be alone and away from these toxic people. I need to learn how to be alone and content. I screenshotted a note on Instagram telling them they let me down and how for months I've been struggling with depression and posting cries for help and not a single one of them ever messaged asking if I was okay but I'd be the first one to be by their side. No one messaged me with an apology after. Nobody cared. But for some reason I found alot of peace in that. My therapist supports my decision and thinks it's healthy and I've always feared feeling alone but now that I am alone I feel free. I'm not clinging desperately to friendships that don't serve me.

I made her a Halloween bucket with her favorite candies and treats with a note to ask her out. She told me yes, and sudden waves of pure happiness and joy had hit me. I was so happy I thought my heart was gonna come out of my chest. After our friends left it was just me and her in her room, we‚Äôre watching Netflix hanging out cuddling all that cute s**t... and we made love. Normally I‚Äôm not the type to wanna sleep with a girl I‚Äôve only known for a bit let alone someone who just agreed to be in a relationship not even a full 24 hours!!! And yeah I‚Äôm a guy you might say that us men are quick to jump and bang out any girl that gives us that chance. Not me. But with her, it just felt so right.... room is dark with candle lit and Netflix in the back while it‚Äôs raining outside. Beautiful just beautiful I tell you. So now we‚Äôre together and we‚Äôre hanging out almost every single day. I would go over after I finished work and sometimes stay the night and leave for work the next day. I‚Äôm getting to know her family, she stays with her father, step mother, two younger brothers and a younger sister. Her biological mother is still around, however, she‚Äôs out living in her car on the streets and hooked on crystal meth. Now for her father, well...... he‚Äôs a drug dealer apparently. Let me clarify that I never fully got know what her father really did. I did find out and was told by him and my girlfriend that he had grow houses for marijuana, while selling guns and also dealing other drugs such as cocaine. Also, I guess he was under investigation with the cops and DEA, possibly even FBI. My girlfriend would tell me about the nice big house they had before, and how they always went on nice vacations and went on family trips together. Until the house had gotten raided and drugs and weapons were found So then they moved.....
I will always remember a conversation I had with her father. I was always respectful to this man considering the fact that he is the father of the girl I have fallen in love with. We were talking about my job and he was really proud of the fact that I was working 12+ hour days and going to community college at the time. He would say that it was good and what I want to do in my life and how it was always important to become a responsible man and take care of my family. He would then go on to tell me a little bit about his business and work. He told me he had grow houses that would pull in about $60,000 a month. EVERY SINGLE MONTH. Sometimes he would be getting 80-100k a month. He would be able to buy nice things and take his family on yacht trips for vacations and it all sounded really really nice and intriguing to me.... I wanted something like that. Growing up I never knew what I wanted to do in my life and I wasn‚Äôt the best in school, and I was only going to community college for my basics. I used to sell edibles and pre rolled joints in high school on a small scale. But after that conversation with her father, I believe is when I had decided to get into the same thing and start selling myself to be able to make that kind of money. I started small, little here little there sold to my close friends and I always had something to smoke with my girlfriend so it was nice. I never got my product from my girlfriends father. I went and got it on my own I never knew or wanted to ask him I just thought it wouldn‚Äôt give off the right image. 
Few months go by and my girlfriend tells me that their house got raided by the FBI. Her father comes back after a few days and he‚Äôs now on house arrest with one of those ankle monitors. He‚Äôs on it for a few weeks and then has court. He gets a sentence of about 13 years in a federal penitentiary. So they give him about 2-3 weeks before he is sentenced and so he moves out the house with his family over to his mothers house. A few days before he goes in they have a family barbecue and I went but I also did have to clock into work in about 2 hours. So I‚Äôm talking with him and he asks me if I‚Äôm gonna help look after his daughter and family. I tell him how much I love his daughter and would gladly look after them all and help them out as much as I could. Things got really rough once he got sentenced.... I wish he never went away because then the family would stay together and I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today. Hating life everyday as it goes. I constantly live in regret... 

After a while of her father going to federal prison, I had left my job and was selling weed full time. The money was alright. My girlfriend didn‚Äôt like it she hated the idea of it. I met this dealer who started hooking up with product that was cheaper. And he always intrigued me by the money and nice things he had, I would continue to do business with him and had asked him if he ever needed me to do anything that I was his man. He eventually asked me to do something for him, watch over one of his shops. I won‚Äôt get into exactly what it was, but the extra money helped and when my girlfriend found out she didn‚Äôt like it and made me choose between her or that so I naturally chose her. I continued to sell weed and I ended up taking some losses. Getting robbed and ripped off and owing for product. I was in a weird place at the time I had slept with another girl and my girlfriend found out. We broke up and got back together but then I found out she had hooked up with someone else. It lead us to a lot of trust issues and other problems. We were arguing while I was driving and she got out of my car at a stop light and I had parked my car and got out to follow her and get her back in the car but she didn‚Äôt want to. I tripped and fell and she‚Äôs laughing at me and she pulls out her phone and in my head I‚Äôm thinking she‚Äôs about to record me and make me look like a fool. So I grabbed her phone and she starts crying yelling for her phone back. I tell her not until she gets in the car and then she starts knocking at peoples houses asking for help. I‚Äôm not no creep or woman abuser, and I sure as hell am not about to go to jail over something I absolutely didn‚Äôt do. I put her phone on the ground and I jumped over a few walls of this apartment building to my car. I‚Äôm a mess at this point, I‚Äôm crying my eyes out and losing it and I remember that 2 of my friends had actually drove by and seen me lol I laugh about it because I‚Äôm so embarrassed I didn‚Äôt want to be seen like this!!

Two months go by and I had started doing some transport work. I wanted to get myself some good money stacked up before I tried to get my ex girlfriend back. I reached out to her on her birthday by sending her flowers, her favorite chocolate covered strawberries and a note expressing how much I had missed her. She gets back to me the next day and we meet up and start catching up. We started hanging out again like before and I had her over at my moms house and we started kissing one thing lead to another etc.... and while we‚Äôre doing our thing her phone kept ringing and it was some guy calling her. I remember getting upset and saying ‚Äúwho the hell is that? Why does he keep calling you? You‚Äôre with me right now and you‚Äôre mine tell him to f*** off before I do something about it‚Äù eventually she tells me that it‚Äôs someone she had been going on a few dates with. She tells me how nice he is to her and buys her stuff and how different he is and how he doesn‚Äôt smoke and worms at a hospital while going to nursing school. It broke my heart hearing the way she was taking about him........ it was like listening to one of your friends describe how they met someone and are falling for them. 
Do any of you know what that‚Äôs like? To have to hear the woman you love, sit there and tell you how she‚Äôs falling for someone else? It makes me feel like I was nothing. Like none of the love and affection I had given in the last 2 almost 3 years of our relationship had mattered. So here I am trying to make her fall in love with me again. And she eventually tells me that she wants to be with this new guy and how she really likes him and wants to experience someone else. I flipped out. I told her off about how she didn‚Äôt even graduate high school and how her mother was a crack whore.... I was just so.... filled with rage... and feeling like I was nothing.... worthless... meaningless....

I continued on with my life as best I could. Dealing, and constantly missing her..... I started talking to her step mother and she caught wind of it and reached out to me. We met up and she was telling me how she got kicked out her grandmothers house and was living with her new boyfriend. She told me how much she didn‚Äôt like living with him and that he was an a**hole and always just left her at home to watch his kid. She told me she missed me. But we couldn‚Äôt get back together, because she had no where to stay and was basically living off this guy. And I was living with my mother at the time we had no room with all my siblings at the house, hell there was barely room for myself I didn‚Äôt even have my own bed. I was worthless.. couldn‚Äôt provide for my woman and give her what she needs. We would hangout as much as we could and we could only talk at night because during the day her man was home and worked at night so during the day she would block my number and at night unblock me and text me. I had arranged a date at my house with her. My family was leaving for a vacation trip and I would have the house to just me and her. I was gonna make her favorite steak and mashed potatoes that she absolutely loved and always liked the way I made it. When the day came, I told her to message me when she wanted me to send the Uber and I started to cook dinner. Hours go by and I get no reply. I finish making dinner it‚Äôs ready, still no reply.... the whole entire day I never got one reply from her. Not even a ‚Äúhey sorry I‚Äôm not gonna be able to make it‚Äù

I was furious.... heartbroken..... woke up the next day to no message from her. I let the day go by and still nothing. I ended up texting her that I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with her and how she didn‚Äôt mean nothing to me anymore. I told her how I had a new girlfriend and didn‚Äôt need her. None of that was ever true. I didn‚Äôt have another girlfriend, and she meant the whole universe to me.. I was just mad..... and sad..... and feeling worthless.... empty. Forgotten.... like I didn‚Äôt matter... and after that I blocked her number and had changed my phone number. 

About a year goes by, I moved to Texas I‚Äôm my own apartment and got me a new car. Things were starting to become good for me everything was good except, there was just something missing that would make my life perfect at that time. It was her.... I had missed her like crazy. I worked hard to get me a home to live in it with her and she wasn‚Äôt there. Eventually I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I reached out to her. Told her how I now had my own place and that I missed her and wanted her to come live with me just like we always wanted to.......
She replied by telling me that she‚Äôs now engaged. That she was happy for me but that she‚Äôs engaged and that her fianc√© doesn‚Äôt want her talking to me.... and that was it... I wished her the best and said goodbye. Nothing more nothing less. I didn‚Äôt flip out on her. Just said goodbye.

That was last year when I last spoke to her. I have not spoken to her since. And everyday since we got into that argument and broke up, I had missed her. I still miss her to this day. She was my happiness. My joy. My bright and beautiful sunny day. I think about the times when we would cuddle. Sneak out to go smoke together, laugh about dumb videos like that guy that would say ‚Äúdeez nuts‚Äù. Or even the times we would go to the movies or have dinner at Outback Steakhouse. Not a day goes by that I don‚Äôt miss those memories. They mean everything to me. She meant everything to me. But I lost her. And now I spend my life in regret and misery. Wishing I could go back in time and stop myself from getting into dealing. Because it was obvious from the start, she didn‚Äôt want me doing that. She already experienced that type of life growing up and watching her father go to prison for it. She needed something different. A legit life, not one in crimes and drug dealing. And I failed. I ended up losing the best thing in my life. I miss you.......... and I can‚Äôt bare life anymore without you. I have no friends. No family, they all see me as a lost cause and I even left the house because I was fighting with my step father. I sleep in my car and work dealing everyday. Everywhere I go reminds me of you. I have even run into her sister recently who graduated high school. She told me she doesn‚Äôt believe her sister is engaged, and that her sister misses me and really loved me. She says I was way better and cooler than her new boyfriend lol. But she doesn‚Äôt talk to her sister no more they got into their fights and dislike each other. Hey what do expect right? Siblings...... 


I‚Äôm sorry this was so long and if any of you took the time to read my story, thank you and I appreciate you. I now spend my days living in my car in the streets alone, constantly living in regret of the choices I have made. I‚Äôm just glad I haven‚Äôt been in any serious trouble yet. I‚Äôve calmed down a lot I don‚Äôt do anything that will get me in serious trouble no more. I miss having friends and family. Real friends that care about my well being. But most importantly I miss my ex girlfriend. She was my best friend. My shoulder to cry on. My partner in crime. She was always down with me. And I had failed her.....


If by any chance you get to see this yourself, which I doubt you will, I just want you to know that....... I MISS YOU ALYSSA. I‚Äôm sorry for all that I put you through.... I‚Äôm sorry I had failed in being the one you would look up to. I remember the time we went to church together and how we prayed together. I remember the time you told me that you prayed to god to send someone to help you and to be able to depend on and trust that person, and you had believed that god had put me into your life to fill in that position. When you told me that I had never felt such love in my life and had felt like I actually mattered to someone.... I ended up being the complete opposite of that I live in regret EVERY SINGLE DAY.....
Alyssa.
My love. 
My love bug. 
My true and only happiness.
Remember me for what I once was and not for what I am now. Remember me as the man who would come to your house after work and fall asleep into your arms. Remember me as the person you had once believed that god put into your life to give you love. Remember me as that person. Most importantly, just don‚Äôt forget me..... Everyday is a nightmare during the day until the night comes. When night comes I rejoice with you in dream land. But when I awake the next day the harsh reality once again sets in.... that you are no longer there with me..... I love you. Forever and always.....
My love.

Am I the only guy with this problem? I just feel like every girl I meet has the same Intentions. They just want me around as a booty call, they just use me for sex and leave me out to dry. I feel like there's no such thing as love anymore, at least anything that is genuine. Don't get me wrong I've been without a gf for a while but it doesn't mean that I don't get lonely or crave companionship. 

I just wish one day I can meet someone who understands me and would reciprocate the same Intentions instead of hurting me and leaving me to rot.

I know a lot of people on here are depressed and hate themselves, so they don't enjoy their old hobbies, but sometimes if you force yourself to do it anyway it helps.  For example, I love video games because they are a great way to sink hours of time and stay busy. Play a game on easy and you feel like a pro! I like RPGs with companions to talk to when I'm feeling lonely.

Still, I'm the ""rapist"", although it was obviously consensual

 After 2 years, I thought I had gotten another best friend, someone I finally trusted and who could tell him everything I think, how I really felt about the relationship, and how I didn't know what to do. After returning from vacation (almost a month later) I discovered for themselves that they were dating

 After that, everything was like a roller coaster. She told me it was nothing, I believed her, she said that we could not continue to be boyfriends, I believed her, she told me like shit and shit.

 nights that ruined me and still loved her. I used to spend days when I didn't get out of bed because of the shit that was going on and you know? I don't think I'll find someone who loves me as much as she does. Now at 2:52 in the morning, I hate her and I just want to forget her, but surely I will wake up and say to myself ""hey, it's your fault, you were a fucking person and you deserve all the shit that happens to you, I hope to die because this is the only way it won't bother anyone else. ""

 I don't think I was made for this, I just ruin everyone around me and, little by little, I believe more in the destiny of each person. I don't think I can find anyone else, I don't want to be alone

I work out a lot, and I don‚Äôt seem unattractive in most pictures. But, I am still constantly alone. Looking back on life, I‚Äôve always been a pretty lonely kid, and not by choice. All my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù hated me growing up, because I was annoying and desperate to please everyone. High school has been no different, though I‚Äôm more introverted I still try extremely hard to get attention and appreciation. There are a few people who I talk to, but most of them are only associating with me to be nice. I cut most of these kids out of my life before quarantine, but a lot of guys were only nice to me so they could use me, to mess with teachers and laugh at me and such. Currently, I have just been getting so depressed from seeing all these other people that I know going out on road trips, hikes, parties, etc. and now it just feels like I‚Äôll never get to experience anything like that now. Some kids allowed me to hang out with them, and both times were spent in almost complete silence on my part, from a desire not to annoy them. My romantic life has fared even worse, somehow. The few times I summoned up the courage to ask a girl out, it ended in me pondering suicide and the like. I ended up somehow getting my ass on a date with this girl, and it went great. She flirted with me heavily, and even put her leg on my thigh, which caused me to get uncomfortable, in a good way. I really liked her, and she kind of liked me. Well, I ruined it like I ruin everything. I was convinced that she was the one for me, and I ended up constantly texting her until she cut me loose, and ended up blocking me on all accounts. I used my old meme page(it got banned) to text her and she told me off, called me a freak and a fucking weirdo for liking her a lot and after she texted me that I tried to kill myself. I drank bleach and threw it all up, and I realized that I‚Äôm too much of a pussy to end it all. That was around January, and for the past few months I‚Äôve still been lonely, even after taking the ham fisted advice of my dad to ‚Äúbe more social.‚Äù No one really desires to associate with me. I have, however been talking to a few girls online, but they all eventually fizzle away. I matched with this one beautiful girl on tinder, but she unmatched with me for some reason. I think it was because I said I liked Pearl Jam or something along those lines. Idk, summers in general are terrible for me. I don‚Äôt really get any social interaction besides the gym, which are all closed because of covid, and school. I can‚Äôt stand being alone, I‚Äôm tired of it. I don‚Äôt want to continue living if this is all life will grant me. Sad lonely days and depressing lonely nights. I‚Äôve been thinking about suicide more and more, almost as much as I did during the school year, and I‚Äôve had trouble thinking of reasons to live. The only reasons I can really think of are my parents, dogs, and books if I‚Äôm being honest, and I‚Äôll eventually run out of books to read. I usually spend most nights berating myself in my head, mentally abusing myself. I can‚Äôt take it anymore, and I‚Äôve found myself wishing and hoping for school to reopen in September. At least I won‚Äôt be as lonely there, even if I am an outcast again. This just wasn‚Äôt how my life was supposed to go.

I‚Äôm still looking for the reasons why. Before it was just bad timing, the virus, things slowing down... but maybe it‚Äôs just because I wasn‚Äôt good enough, still had too many problems left unresolved. I was looking for jobs with no responses, and then the listings dried up and nothing is coming back.

It's worth noting that YMMV on the app parts, I live in a rural area and most people live 45m-1h45m away so you see a lot of the same 20 or 30 women on every app.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Tracy. Coworkers spread rumors to try and get us together. We were both really shy. Once I quit Job #1 I tried texting her a little but nothing came of it.  Whatever it was about this one though, it's what triggered my brain to want to try and find someone. I guess my coworkers thinking I could get with someone who was cute like her gave me confidence (big mistake!).
2. Patty. Coworker at Job #1 (that is part time) and also at Job #2 that I changed to, where she worked full time. I crushed on her really hard. I asked her to go with me to some Oktoberfest thing and she seemed excited when I asked her in person, then she ghosted me for three days on the ""I'll let you know"" part. I just kind of pretend it didn't happen and didn't want to think about what her behavior meant. I asked her to do something outside of work two more times. It never went anywhere.
3. Fran. Was in my orientation for Job #2. I was extremely attracted to her instantly. She was easy to talk to, we talked at lunch sometimes. I got her number because I was trying to buy her car too. She got pointed out for no call no show and I kept texting her once in a while. One time she was like ""Oh I miss you too! I was just thinking about you! I got a new job, we should get drinks when my checks are rolling in!"" I thought hell yeah dude. I waited a week or two but when I came to collect I got ""my boyfriend""ed. Pretty cruel, I don't know what her deal was.
4. App woman #1. I regret how this one went. It was semi-long distance and we never met in person. We hit it off though, lots of chemistry, same taste in music, we got drunk/high and played Apex Legends together. But she was trans and I finally had to be fair to her and myself and admit that I'm too weak to be open about that with my family. She said she understood but it made her extremely depressed.
5. App woman #2. Around the same time. Not long distance. Got up to the point of having a scheduled date and she unmatched me. I wasn't that attracted to her and she mostly talked about herself in longform stories about what she did that day. I don't think we would have hit it off really.
6. Breanna. At job #2, another department. We didn't talk much the whole time until a week before I quit. I thought she really liked me. I shooted my shot and got the ""I'm not looking right now."" but we stayed friends, though eventually she talked to me less and less until nothing. Turns out she met the guy she wasn't looking for. She suggested we all play Xbox together, and I (I think fairly) told her I'm not exactly excited to play video games with her boyfriend. She called me an asshole and told me to go fuck myself.
7. App woman #3. I can't even remember her name. Again, we talked up until scheduling a date and she unmatched me.
8. Jamie. Coworker at what is now Job #3. For the first and as of now only time, she barked up MY tree pretty hard during quarantine. But I'm not attracted to her at all, she's older than I'd like, we have nothing in common, and she comes off as so needy and desperate that if I got together with her I'd be suspicious the entire time that she doesn't really like me for me, I'm just the one she thought she could catch. In a way it was like dealing with my old self from a year ago.
9. Jessi. Coworker at job #3, this time a direct one though. We only said a few words before quaratine. Once we closed I added a bunch of people from work and just randomly decided to message her one day. We ended up talking for hours a day literally every single day of the quarantine, for three months. A month in I realized I had feelings, and it took another month for me to tell her. She told me she knew, and she half heartedly tried to tell me she's not looking for anyone because everything is so complicated (she just had a baby, her ex is crazy and won't back off, dating a direct coworker is a bad idea, etc.) and I talked her out of it a few times. Eventually once we got back to work it was pretty weird and she was also dealing with a severe postpartum depression, so she thought it best to just cut me loose. After 3 weeks or something we've made amends and we're back where we were at in the beginning, just friends who like to talk a lot. She was the furthest I ever got with a woman and I told her I'll always be thankful for the confidence she gave me.
10. ""S"". It ended today. A coworker knew I had a crush on her and wingmanned me into her number. We talked for about two weeks. I started to feel that feeling again, that this is really one sided, she doesn't text first, she doesn't ask me a lot of questions, etc. so rather than torture myself I decided to just ask her. Whether it's true or not, she claims that she told my coworker to give me her number so that she could tell me herself that she's not looking. She says she's very insecure and has a very tall wall up around her that no one is going to get through in terms of dating. We are very similar in a lot of ways. She's still open to doing stuff outside of work as friends, and while I'm kind of worried I'm going to hurt myself more in the future, I'm going to give it a try because I'm also trying to not be forever alone in the friends department and actually do stuff besides watch YouTube in bed when I'm not working.

&amp;#x200B;

So after all these women and all this effort, here's things I've still not experienced:

* Sex
* Kiss
* Touching a woman in any way; hand holding, cuddling, fingers through the hair. Nothing.
* Go on a date
* I've never gotten to the nudes, flirting, genuine interest in me at an equal level, etc. stage except for the transwoman. Which makes me feel even worse about it in hindsight.
* Really do a single thing with any of these women but talk.

What I've got out of my experience:

* A little bit of confidence, in spite of all the rejection
* Two female friends
* The ability to mask my neediness and neuroticism and to appear to be playing it cool
* A slight understanding of what are and aren't good signs, but all women are different
* A simultaneous feeling that I will die alone but also a vague feeling of hope based on me getting a little further each time",lonely,"Here's a what a year of trying looks like, or a catalogue of my failures",2020-07-08 14:23:47
2540,babyblue924,1594182145,1,"I stayed in my apartment for over a week by myself. I went out just to get nearby fast food b/c my best friend would go grocery shopping with me. I have very bad anxiety to be in public places alone, so I wasted money on fast food for that entire time instead of getting proper groceries. I felt like I was weak and starving every day I woke up because I would only buy a meal each day from the local fast food. 

I really wanted to distract myself from being ghosted by painting or learning something new, but i'm too scared to go buy paint supplies. 

I don't have any friends. Like, I seriously do not talk to anyone but my best friend. Well, before they ghosted me. My ex best friend knew this, they knew me better than anyone. We would switch seats in the car so I didn't have to talk to the drive through people. They would offer to go into stores for me so I didn't have to deal with strangers. 

They also knew how my family was. It was so crazy to hear about my best friend's family and how they never hid secrets from each other, never held grudges, never was rude or cursed at each other, and truly loved each other. My family members act like they are strangers to each other and don't even care about me. 

I guess I was also really sad when my best friend would tell me about their graduation party, their family get togethers, birthday parties, christmas. My family never did any of that. What hurts most for some reason is graduation. I graduated in the top 5% of my class which I am stupidly proud of myself for because I never had any help. I just feel stupid because I think I deserved a celebration, but my family didn't give one crap about the only thing i am kind of passionate about (school).

Idk. i'm definitely deleting this shitty rant later.

Basically, I'm just so sad because I am alone. I can't even vent my feelings because my best friend would do it for me because they literally knew me so well and even would finish my sentences all the time, and describe exactly how I felt. Now they basically told me they didn't value me like I valued them and never talked to me again...

2552,hoowquaint,1594172320,1,"I () think the last time I'd say I was really happy was the summer of 2019. I had just started dating my best friend (who had graduated) and I just can't even describe how happy I was then. Then I started school and it all went downhill *hard*. 

I know it's become worse since covid, but I'm just so unhappy. The only time I'd ever consider being happy is when I'm with my boyfriend. Sounds really cliche, but he's basically my only friend. I really like being around his parents and siblings too. I guess part of my unhappiness is partly from jealousy of my boyfriend. His parents are so fun and treat me so well, and I think his siblings are great. I don't have super great parents and I'm an only child. I wish I had siblings so much.

Recently as I was coming back home from being with him and his family I broke and started crying in front of them because I hate being home so much (though it was dark so only my bf knew). I'm so alone and bored when I'm home. I used to love being alone, too.

I know I could obviously talk to friends- and I do have an internet friend that I talk to frequently, but frankly I don't want to bother with friends anymore? I've been screwed so many times I just don't feel like wasting my time.

My boyfriend recently got a job and now he can't even text me. He gets home around 6 or 7PM and he's so tired that he can't stay up past 10:30. I don't blame him for this of course, but it's just that I'm even more alone now. I can't at the least text him anymore. It's embarrassing now when he tells me about his day at work and all I can say about my day was that I've done nothing. He'll always say that it ""sounds relaxing"", but that's so humiliating to me.

If I ever get to see him now it's only on the weekends, and that's still only a maybe because he still lives with his parents.

I've tried getting a job myself with no success, and I'm still not technically allowed to drive anywhere besides home and school. I just sit at home every day and I feel so incredibly lazy. I don't have much motivation to do things I like anymore.

I don't know it's just like I literally have no reason to be happy or even just ""okay."" I'm so alone and feel so unhappy. There's really nothing I can do about any of this either, which makes it worse.",lonely,I don't feel like I have anything to be happy about,2020-07-08 11:38:40

Hey everyone,
I have been feeling so lonely last week. 7 days ago I had my anniversary with my girlfriend, we have had a relationship for half a year. The next day, she broke up with me. Because she did not have the same feelings as she used to. 

From that point on life has just been lonely and boring. I talk to my friend every day on the phone, but when i hang up, i immediately feel empty af.

And i am just sad all the time. I know that it‚Äôs because i got my heart broken, but it feels like there is more that is causing this. But at the same time the girl of my dreams just broke up with me, she was perfect. Super funny to be around and the most beautiful girl i have ever met, just perfect. But it‚Äôs all over now. Fuck. It sucks so much if I think about it. 

As i am writing this, i am crying, crying like every fucking night for the past 6 days. I just feel so empty and i just want to skip this part of my life so bad.

I just don't go on Twitch that often. But he really seemed to be a genuinely good person. And  it's honestly scary how much I can relate to him.

The talks with Dr. K really hit home. When he told him he would send his ""friends"" these walls of text that end up making him seem too clingy and needy, how this pushes them away from him, how he gets stuck in this ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" as he describes it, of being afraid of getting abandoned, and his fears coming true. He would go out of his way to get people to be his friends and stay with him.

And they reach a conclusion that this is, generally, unsolvable. Every time you get abandoned, you get that much more deprived of love and attention. So you get even more clingy and needy to the next friend that you get, which pushes them away even worse. This further grows your fear of abandonment and further confirms your thoughts that you really are that unlovable. It's a cycle that can only end if you get the love that you need and deserve to get. You can't really do anything yourself to end this cycle.

Well, there's one thing that I can do to end this cycle I guess. I just don't know how much longer I can handle this.",lonely,The worst feeling is realizing that your problem is really unsolvable.,2020-07-08 09:32:40
2566,cheatermannion,1594163892,1,"Just before lockdown started, I (20M) found out my now ex girlfriend had slept with another guy. This was the second time she cheated, and it broke me completely, as I was already in a bad place. I blocked her the day I found out, and somehow managed to not speak to her since. I felt like I had no choice but to end it, especially given how she tried to justify herself rather than be sorry. Needless to say, it was a messy breakup, for me at least. 

I‚Äôve always had awful luck with girls, I‚Äôve never been close with another girl, not even as friends. I got extremely lucky with meeting my ex, punching far above my weight, with a great 2 year relationship (aside from the cheating). I even was close to all of her friends. But now all that‚Äôs over for good, there isn‚Äôt a single girl I can talk to. I went to an all boys school, all of my friends are at university, while I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve lost touch with most of them and it‚Äôs very difficult to reconnect, hence my loneliness. Seeing some of my friends in relationships online just makes me feel loads worse.

The sad thing is, I‚Äôm not a shy person at all, I‚Äôm confident and outgoing usually, yet every other advance I‚Äôve made towards a girl has been brutally unsuccessful. I haven‚Äôt even made any meaningful friendships with any girls, every time I message someone online, the chat lasts a week until I get left on read for no reason. Im not sure if this is because of my looks or poor chat, but I never send anything weird, I just have normal conversations and get ignored. I‚Äôve always felt really insecure with me and girls - especially with my looks. I know it‚Äôs stupid for me to generalise all girls in the same bracket, but I‚Äôm just so lonely now, with no close friends, no one to talk to, no one to hang out with and no real family life. I would love to start dating again and rebound, but it seems literally impossible. I would even love just to find some friends at this point.

Hey y‚Äôall I‚Äôm looking to meet someone I can grow closer with over time. I find it hard to meet new people in person as I don‚Äôt leave the house much due to having pretty overwhelming amounts of anxiety.

I‚Äôm very introverted, I like spending time with myself. I love to read, binge Netflix and listen to music at a volume that‚Äôd normally blow someone‚Äôs ear drums out, i‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôve lost a significant amount of hearing because of it lmao.

I want affection, attention, to be loved and to love.

I‚Äôm an 18 year old straight guy, just trying to get by mentally by distracting myself. I‚Äôm currently developing my own Minecraft server, playing games I recently got like SUPERHOT and Stardew Valley to pass the time. Occasionally I stream, or make YouTube videos. It just doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough to fill that void, however.

Maybe I‚Äôm lonely because I‚Äôm focusing on it too much? Maybe I don‚Äôt have a relationship because my interests are too niche? (Worldbuilding, Actual deep conservations like the origin of consciousness, etc.) Maybe it‚Äôs because of my social anxiety, and that I can only ever deal with online situations. However even then it doesn‚Äôt always work out. I have no idea what the cause may be, I‚Äôm just exhausted with the concept, to be honest.

If you want to talk with me, maybe we can connect or share some ideas. I‚Äôm fine with making friends, and I‚Äôd definitely appreciate affirmation and advice, but I don‚Äôt know how much that‚Äôs going to help my active search for a relationship.

2596,Latter-Comfortable-4,1594144679,1,"Hey, so as the title suggests I've found over the years that in some of the groups I've hung out with I'll end up being the butt of occasional jokes about having no personality. These jokes sort of have the premise that while my presence socially isn't a negative, it really isn't a positive for anyone other than me.

I pretty self-aware that I have big personality flaws, I'm not a very charismatic guy, I'm pretty awful one-on-one in all but very niche conversations, and I think that my childhood or something has just conditioned me to give off a vibe that makes people uncomfortable, or that I'm not enjoying the company of others when I really am.

I'm usually alright with give-and-take banter or whatever, but I feel like the one area I would never go after is to say that someone has no personality. Like you can take someone saying your appearance is rough, or your temper is short for example, but to joke that someone has no personality is effectively invalidating their entire existence as a person.

My gut feeling is that any 'friend' who would make even occasional jokes with that as the premise isn't really my friend at all, and that it's better to go it alone than to try to be a part of a group like that.

But she keeps promising me that if I go to sleep early enough (I struggle with insomnia and very vivid night terrors), she‚Äôll make time to call me when I wake up very early in my time zone, which would be the time she‚Äôs just winding down for the night and has free time on her hands. Well I‚Äôve followed her suggestions, but here I am awake before the sun and I have no notifications on my phone, and she‚Äôs not responding to any of my messages. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, and it‚Äôs honestly happening more and more consistently than when we met. It‚Äôs one of the worst feelings I‚Äôve ever felt, and I feel so empty and lonely. 

For context, she lives on the other side of the world. We‚Äôve never met in person, but I still considered her my best friend. I completely understand that she may be busy or tired, so I try not to feel so hurt. But honestly, I‚Äôm beginning to feel like she wants me to go to sleep so early in my local time zone so I leave her alone for more of the day (this would give her almost any extra 8-9 hours of daytime where she doesn‚Äôt have to speak to me at all!!!). I truly do feel like an inconsiderate jerk for jumping to conclusions, but she‚Äôs talking to me less and less throughout the day too.

Having other people around is not the cure for loneliness.  It takes a genuine connection and closeness or intimacy, without which, being around other people can make the loneliness worse. 

I‚Äôm quarantining with my best friend and I developed really strong feelings for her.  She doesn‚Äôt feel the same way about me. I crave a closeness and a connection/intimacy with her that she doesn‚Äôt want any part of, and that makes me feel extremely lonely even though I do enjoy our friendship and she‚Äôs living with me.

As hard as it is to be lonely, it becomes unbearable when I have to watch someone I have feelings for form that connection and give that closeness/intimacy to someone else. It‚Äôs hers to give to whom she pleases, but it makes me feel so small and unwanted when she chooses to give it so freely to people she just met.",lonely,Loneliness is not necessarily about being alone‚Äîit‚Äôs about not feeling a connection or closeness that we crave,2020-07-07 20:07:34

2668,IREALLYDONTWANTAUSE,1594091672,1,"I moved around a lot as a child and never really got an opportunity to settle down and make long-term friends. Whenever I would start getting close to someone or felt part of a community our family would pack up and leave. Then we moved to New York. My lack of meaningful social interaction meant I was definitely awkward and the kids I met were very different than those who I had interacted with before. I felt completely out of place and they could sense that weakness. I was consistently bullied and fell into a depression through highschool which manifested itself through losing any sense of self. 

I didn't take care or myself, was extremely socially inept and very unattractive. Any attempt to make friends was shut down; people knew me. I was the ultimate outcast in my class, the butt of the joke and someone you'd be ashamed to interact with. When I entered college my drive in life changed: I had a fresh start. I lost weight (a lot), took care of my appearances, brought my GPA from a 2 something in highschool to a 4.0, got a job and began exercising which manifested itself into a powerlifting dedication(RIP GYMS). 

People finally wanted to interact with me, talk to me, befriend me. Girls were paying attention to me that I had never received (didn't even know what to do with it and still don't). The problem is that I subconciously avoid people as much as possible. I don't even understand how, it just happens. If anyone shows an interest in me I drift away from them as fast as I can. I want to have friends and I like flirting but something deep inside pushes me away. I think I'm afraid of rejection and I think this has been engrained in my pysche from years of social neglect. 

This problem extends everywhere...I even avoid online interaction for the same reason. I mean I really avoid it, I am so afraid that the person I start talking to will reject me or ghost me or something like that. I know people say to not take it personally but I can't help it. In person it might be a bit better, but at work I fully avoid interacting with people even those who are friendly or like talking to me (I will actively avoid eye contact or say nothing to them unless I feel like they notice it), and just a few weeks ago there was a girl I had  thought looked pretty cool for a while and wanted to talk to who reached out multiple times to talk to me and I really liked talking to her but then I kicked back into my avoidance and I think she noticed. 

Does anyone else deal with this? I really want to make more friends or at least stop fearing rejection so deeply and taking loss so personally. This doesn't affect me with professional or academic contacts, just those I wish to interact with at a social level.

I miss the concept of friends. I used to be so good at it. Talking to people, at least. The whole... chit-chat thing. I could talk for hours about anything. I did, too! Then...as I got older, I kinda just... stopped. The people I knew drifted away. From me at least, they were all busy like, having meaningful relationships and everything. God, what that must be like!   


Nowadays, that thought seems so foreign. I miss it. Sometimes I forget the sound of my own voice. I so rarely speak it seems. I don't remember the last time somebody invited me out, or wanted to see me. If I had a fish it'd probably flush itself down the drain just to get away.    


I've made peace with the fact I'm going to die alone. I'm never going to have any sort of romantic relationship, and that's fine. It's whatever, I'm just not made for that. But jeez, I sure would like somebody who invites me out every now and then. Well, out in like... Red Dead, I guess. Can't go outside at the moment. The whole... everything. Goddammit, America.   


I realized something the other day. I haven't been happy in years, if ever. I guess I could say I was happy around 2012? My favorite musician just debuted, I finally fell in love (unrequited, because of course,) and I could turn on the t.v. without hearing about how our president is skull-fucking our reputation, but even then, that was swift. Fleeting, gone in an instant, like a half-remembered dream in the morning, or a crack rock at my family reunion. It's a weird feeling when you don't remember what it's like to smile, or laugh, or to just... be happy.  


I've been on auto pilot for years, and I don't even know why. I just wake up, work, pretend to care about whatever sports or music or whatever people at work are talking about (I don't care about local sports team!). Is that even living? Is there even a reason why I still wake up? What the hell do I even have to think about? To look forward to? Ooh, big choice today, Mcdonald's or Burger King, living the effing dream here, guys. It's the same thing, the same music, the same food, the same... life, for years. And nothing seems to break the cycle.  


 I enjoy making others happy though. That's really all that I live for at this moment, and will probably only live for that for the rest of my life. I can't do much, and I don't really have anything to offer, but I usually try hard if there's something I can do. If I can make somebody, even for just a second, not feel the way I feel, then I guess that means I made the tiniest difference. So, I'm not really posting this expecting any sort of response. I just want to say, I hope you all get better. I hope you all figure out the secret code to happiness.

I don‚Äôt know where to start. Maybe the fact that I‚Äôm a loner, a loser. I‚Äôm lonely simply because I‚Äôm weird and just simply different. I‚Äôm always lonely in school. Everyone talks to each other meanwhile I pretend that I am studying. I sometime pretend I‚Äôm sleeping just to pass time. It‚Äôs like I feel nothing. And that‚Äôs the worst thing ever. I had friends in 7th grade until one of the people in my friends group turned on me and they practically just kicked me out. I just wanna feel truly happy, rather than just pretending that I‚Äôm happy. The worst part of this is pretending that you don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre lonely. Or that you like being left alone. But I want to make friends real bad. I want to talk to people but no one accepts me into society. Everyone keeps calling me a specific word and labeling me as a bad person for one silly mistake that I did and for some jokes that I did. The notes app is my only friend and therapist. Sometimes i sit there for hours just typing long paragraphs in notes. I consider notes a person that I‚Äôm talking to and I‚Äôm telling them all my secrets, all my problems. It just feels therapeutic to talk to something. I always get made fun off. Either irl or online. All I do is scroll through social media wishing that someone would talk to me. I always see people complaining about them not talking to anyone for one day. But no one talks to me for everyday in my life. Whenever I see someone defend me. Or take my side in an argument, I tear up a bit because I‚Äôm never used to anyone defending me or taking time of their day to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù me. I have no irl close friends.

2718,roadwarriorjix,1594057658,1,"Just came back to Reddit because I miss being a part of a community. For the last three years I was living in a really fun neighborhood with a cool roommate while I got my life together. Now that I have and moved out and started a new life, I feel alone all the time.

Honestly, I grew up kind of privileged and didn't know anything about responsibility or money and just got wasted all the time. I thought I was a rebel. Really, I was just burning bridges. Before my last place, I never lived anywhere longer than six months, getting kicked out for throwing wild parties and all that.

Even after I got so low I tried to kill myself, it didn't take long for me to go back to that life. Even after I totaled my car and spent a night in jail, but somehow didn't get a DUI, I kept doing the same dumb shit. Fortunately, no one got hurt but me.

It took me meeting my last roommate and hearing his struggles and us renting a room to a super entitled dude who took no personal responsibility for anything to realize I needed to change. I started working out, working multiple jobs, like I was trying to make up for all the years I spent being a slacker.

The neighborhood we lived in had a great community. We would all hang out and have beers and just celebrate each other. Even after years of craziness, my mom never gave up on me some how. Her and the motorcycles I started working on saved my life.

So when she started buying up property, she asked me to be her property manager. I quit my jobs, got my own place, and I couldn't be happier about it, but I miss the connections I had in that neighborhood. None of them call or text. I always have to initiate.

I think back on my life at night, and I think about all the relationships I ruined, the amazing women who loved me for some reason and I just threw away. I now realize how truly awful I was.

I don't use social media, could never really get into it, but I wouldn't blame the people I used to know for wanting nothing to do with me. Despite quarantine, I've been on dating apps and go out and meet women. It always seems so superficial, like there's no connection beyond the fact that we're drunk and both like a shitty song that came on. Even the dudes I meet and pal around with for a night, none of the connections feel real.

The only time I really feel part of something is when I'm on the bike and see another motorcycle or someone in a cool car pulls up and wants to race or something, which I've been getting a little reckless with as well. I don't drink and ride though, or drive. I think the accident scared me away from that.

I guess I just want to feel part of something. I want people who text and call me the way I want to text and call them. I want to meet a chick who drunk dials me for a change. I don't want to feel that I'm pushing myself on people. I want to feel wanted.",lonely,I have no idea what I'm doing.,2020-07-07 03:47:38

2725,throwaway2931032,1594053060,2," **INTRODUCTION:** So I recently have caught feelings for a coworker. I haven't interacted personally with her all too much because whenever we do communicate its always about work-related things. I'm having issues starting a dialogue with her along with many other personal issues that all relate to me liking this girl.

**BACKSTORY:** My background with women is not good at all. I'm 18 and I've never been in a relationship before. While I'm not necessarily shy, I am not the type of person who puts themselves out there for the world to see. I keep to myself most of the time but I like to be around my friends and socialize with them. The issues start to arise when it comes to the opposite sex. It should also be noted that I consider myself highly psychologically sensitive. In the past, I have tried to talk to girls and I have even asked girls out in the past. Unfortunately, I was rejected by every single one of them. I also remember when I was a young child I had a cringy ""relationship"" with a girl and I was constantly teased and made fun of by my family because of it. This same thing happened when I told my parents that I liked a girl when I was in Middle School. Both being constantly rejected and that experience as a young child has made a major psychological impact on me. I grew up under the impression that dating was wrong and that it is something that you should tease people about. This impression still shapes the way that I feel about dating today. Me bring constantly rejected in the past has enhanced my fear of women and relationships to astronomical levels. Some nervousness is normal, however, my nerves take it to a whole new level. I will get into more detail on these nerves further down in the post.

**FEARS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE:** One thing that I fear most about me being in a relationship with someone is how will others think about me and her as a couple? Especially with this girl what will everyone at work think? Will I be subject to teasing about it? How will everyone at work treat me? If we break up, will work become a hostile environment for me to be at? It should be noted that I work in a good work environment. Everyone gets along and we all like to joke around with each other. Most of these questions also apply to my family as well. Since the teased me in the past, will they tease me again? How will my relationship with my parents and my sister change because of my relationship with this girl?

**FEARS ABOUT COMMUNICATING WITH HER:** This and the fear about other people are tied when it comes to my biggest fear when it comes to a potential relationship with this girl. I am deathly afraid of the repercussions of following her on Instagram and adding her on Snapchat let alone speaking to her. These repercussions I speak of are tied to my fears about other people, especially my coworkers. Who knows if she suspects something and starts telling people at work about her suspicions? But I know that if I don't follow her on social media then I won't find out any more information about her such as if she has a boyfriend already or any information about her interests. I overcame a little bit of this fear by requesting to follow her on Instagram but I don't think she has notifications on because she hasn't accepted my follow request and her number of followers haven't increased in a while.

**CONFIDENCE:** I also have some serious confidence issues. I don't think I'm attractive on the outside but I have strong confidence about my inside. I'm the type of person that needs someone to enable me to have confidence and sadly I haven't had anyone to give me such confidence. In fact, I feel like I'm being judged about my looks wherever I go. Whether that be about my minor but noticeable space between my two front teeth, my minor acne, or my stocky build.

**DEPRESSION:** As of right now, I am suffering from severe depression both from this issue regarding the girl I like and my past. I am fearful that if I do pursue this girl, history will repeat itself and I will get rejected once again. I am starting to lose all hope in myself regarding this subject.

**CONCLUSION:** I sincerely thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story and offering any help that you can give to me. I don't have anyone else in my life who I can go to about these things due to my fears that I mentioned above.

Once again, thank you all so much for reading, and please if you have any ideas comment below.

Also, please note that I have sought out professional help with these issues over the years but the therapy has been unsuccessful. I'm open to any other ideas you may have though.

UPDATE: I requested to follow her on Instagram but she denied it. I'm skeptical about this because I'm not sure about the exact reason. One possibility is that she doesn't know me all to well and she just denied it. The other possibility is that she just doesn't like me or something. Which doesn't make sense because I haven't worked in the same department as her since last year and we don't talk very much as it is. I'm just wondering if I should just give up at this point or keep trying. Does her rejecting my follow request mean that there is no hope with this girl or do I just need to talk with her more? I'm so confused.",lonely,Help,2020-07-07 02:31:00

2735,transitosoto,1594042471,1,"So I posted something yesterday, but got too embarrassed about it and deleted it.

Basically, I want someone to connect with on a deep level that I feel at ease with. I think I end up screwing things up for myself when these opportunities potentially arise bc I'm either awkward or just oblivious to the interest someone may have in me. 

I still talk with my ex bc they live in the same town as me, but I feel like this makes me pathetic. He tends to sexualize me but claims that he doesn't. I know it's stupid I still talk with him and it's not like I miss the relationship (quite the opposite).

I try to talk about these things with other friends, but all of my close friends are already in relationships. They mention how that can be hard as it is, which I agree it is. But they say how I can find empowerment in this moment and I really try to yet it seems impossible. I'm not sure if it's bc I just lack the confidence or how much I genuinely hate myself. 

I wish I could be more open to the possibility of new friendships just to find some sort of intimacy that I feel like has been lacking in my life. I don't expect anyone to fix me and I dont necessarily want a relationship. Just a close friend that I get along with really well that also wants to be intimate.",lonely,Looking for intimacy,2020-07-06 23:34:31

The thing is, leading this lifestyle for so long, I don't know how to proceed, how to find people with similar interests, how to make friends, how to find a matching love interest. More like, I have an idea of how to do so, but parts of it are quite daunting.

2746,fuelforthatfire,1594030889,1,"**For the TL;DR check the highlighted section at the bottom of the post.**

I have been slowly building my way out of a long period of physical and mental adverse state and among the areas of my life that I feel the need to address and improve is my sex life. It is non-existent now just as it was non-existent before and my goal is for this to not continue being the case for very much longer. Or to the very least to try and figure out what I want out of this aspect of life.

Without going into much detail about my past, what I think is the most relevant here is the fact that I have spent all of my teenagehood and early adulthood (25 currently) in a state of moderate to severe depression and moderately severe physical health issues coupled with various inadequacies and insecurities. These contributed to me living in an uncommonly reclusive fashion for someone my age. With the above in mind, I hope you will have a larger context for understanding and easier time relating to what will follow.

Trying to grow more socially aware and see how people spend their time and interact with each other and find out about their life experiences in general, I started browsing a much larger array of subreddits including the sex and relationship related ones and I underestimated how much some of the stories detailing sexual encounters and random acts of sex with strangers or relative strangers would impact me.

Some of them felt like a true punch to the gut, they evoked strong feelings of envy, resentment, and regret in me. If felt controllable (to some degree) how much I permitted these feelings to last and grow in intensity but I think that suppressing them (as I have been doing the whole past decade) will keep me frozen in the same state boredom and low-level depression that I have been living under all this time and as far as that goes I am glad I can still have the ability to experience these strong feelings even though they are of the painful sort.

**Now, I am 25 and I feel that I have truly missed out (a phrase that always sounded cringe to me and never imagined saying it myself) and that I am past the point of trying to fulfill certain sexual experiences that might not be thought of as particularly inappropriate for teenagers and college-aged people but which would be seen as impermissible for 25+ year-olds which are generally expected to act in more mature and considerate ways. What am I supposed to do? To re-enroll at some university (which I was considering to because I would like trying going into a more ambitious professional direction than my current occupation) and try to live that university experience in a manner in which I did not when I was 19,20? Does not the fact that I am even thinking this make me a creep or imply that I am disturbed in some fashion? Imagine going to parties, clubs and similar settings, which I have zero experience of, alongside people with an average age maybe even 6 to 7 years younger than myself and trying to hook up, I think I would feel like a loser creep and that what I am being transparent to everyone. And would not that actually be an accurate view?**

**Most people of my generation I know personally are either entering long term relationships or have been in one for some time, they had their fun in their teenage and young adult years. On the other side, I feel like I missed that train and that most people I know would want me to forget it and try to get into a serious committed relationship and this feels like the least exciting and infuriating decisions that I could take at the moment. Concluding this, I let you know that I do not know how to sort all of this out.**

I'm 29 and on the verge of hitting 30 in the next 5 months. Growing up i never realized how lonely and alone I was when I was a kid, i think it was because has kids we all had those blinders of ""ignorance is bless."" I was an only child believe it not the only ONLY child in my entire family (everyone else has had 2+ more kids). So I've always felt and been like the black sheep of my family. I came from a strict household family from old school European values, not that it was bad because its how i learned to be respectful and the decent person I am today. But, I was definitely a sheltered child. Never really hung out with friends or had a sleepover or been to one or gone to camp or experience anything friend related i think until 14 maybe even 15. I've always kept to myself and just stuck to my hobbies and just overall enjoyed being by myself. Learned a lot about morals and values through my favorite 90s TV shows and some good books I've read. Fast forward through my adult life and I've been through a lot as well! I've been married, gotten divorced, lost touch with a lot of people (mainly because of found relationships or paths going different ways), experience deaths in my family. You know all the things people can relate to! I think the biggest thing to happen to me so far is my failed marriage and relationship that happened about 5 years ago. You never realize how alone you really are until its literally just you again! As a gamer I always said ""I hit the reset button on my life"" and it was literally just that because i had no idea what was going to happen or where to even begin with anything and everything. Again fast forward today, I never realized how much ive actually been alone as a kid and how much ive actually been use to it that its something that shouldn't bother me because I was raised like that. I've always had more pressure or treated differently by my parents because well i was their only child and they just expected a lot from their own child. I love my parents, they're great individuals and im not sure where I'd be without them today. You know it definitely is the little things in life that makes you realize being lonely or alone isn't bad when you break everything down in a list. When i made my list I actually found that my pros heavily out weighted my cons completely. But, because I went through that adult phase, that experience of being in love and being with someone you spent most of your adulthood from 18-25 and then it just be gone like that i think thats what got me the most. Its alright to be alone, its OK to feel lonely as well, im human and I know once in a blue moon all those feelings will come back and hit me like a ton of bricks but I'm grateful for what I have, for who I am as a person, and for what I can do. The only real thing missing in my life really is a relationship, a partner crime, my missing puzzle piece! But I realize if I do end up alone or by myself for the remainder of my life, that would be alright to because my life has meaning in a lot of my branches in my tree of life and I shouldn't let one little dead branch corrupt all the ones that keep growing and bloom each year around!

2760,eenkeotx,1594016473,2,"I'm a 26M and have pretty much been single my entire life. Every night when I go to bed, I naturally feel sad and lonely. I consider myself lucky on the nights my chest doesn't get heavy, but today I felt it again and today I wanted to share my experience after finding this sub reddit.

During high school, I felt this strongly and was very depressed to the point where I had very unhealthy thoughts. But I went through it with will power and I am so fucking glad I did that because I have had so many experiences I would never have thought about having at the time. So please, the first step is to not give up. 

Things become difficult at night when I am vulnerable. I am a hopeless romantic and crave physical affection. Just a hug from a friend means so much to me. I don't get that from my family due to cultural reasons. But damn, could you imagine being beside someone you love and them loving you just as much. To exist beside them and feel love. I've been wanting this for such a long time.

Where I am now with my life - Remember what I said about not giving up? At one point I dropped out of university and it was very hard for a financially disadvantaged family to see. But with hard work I graduated at a different post-secondary institute, travelled, and work for a great company now. This is why you don't give up. I decided that my lowest point was back then and that means anything going forward will be better. Reflect on yourself, plan your next steps, leave room for alternative plans in case things don't work out, and develop yourself.

Where I am now with dating - Non-existent. I strongly desire companionship, but I also hesitate to date because I believe I shouldn't be dating just to fill the empty void in my heart. I should date someone I'm actually interested in because I want it to be long-term and serious (and fun of course). It would be dishonest to date someone I'm not interested in. Have I asked women out before? Yup, and everytime was a rejection. I honestly don't think I'm a bad person and am just on the wrong side of fate. Or... maybe I shouldn't of ignored those ""forward this email to 14 people or you will die single"" emails back when I was 12. Because of this, it's been extremely hard finding someone and I have gotten to the point where I don't even feel interested in women I meet anymore. I've lost the ability to have a crush on someone and am stuck in this state of misery.

I have found ways to keep myself as productive and busy as possible, to help keep my mind focused. Now I want to focus on my loneliness and be in a loving relationship.

I used to be associated with a group of auto mechanics, but I have been forced to cut ties with them due to their rather rash behavior.

Last time I checked, friends are supposed to be there for you when in need, having your back, being able to vibe and connect with each other, and everything else in between. Nope, more recently, and this is out of nowhere, they have constantly called me a crybaby, a bitch, an attention-seeking whore, and an entitled twat.

No one to love me in this empty world. The people pass me by and swipe left as they see fit. Anything I posted would be met by a choir of crickets.

The older I get, the more I realize how I have made an intricate, wonderous art of loneliness and distraction... as well as the observation of how little I realize.  The clock is ticking, the world moves right along even with a pandemic racing the inevitable ""hold-my-beer"" time of the year here in the U.S.

The very worst part of this circumstance is that I realize that I am not even remotely unique in my longing or this incredible despondency.  To tell you the truth, lovely one, I know my isolation isn't virus specific... it is the result of pushing some away and vice versa.  This virus subsequently feeds the eloquently silent illusion that it is necessary... social distance = zero interaction?

Honestly, it is my own doing.  I yearn for companionship with every single day that comes and eventually goes into the dusk.  And I know, dear reader, that among you out there drifting through these very same emotions that maybe... just maybe there might be a friend waiting.  This is probably the very worst conduit to let this flow into the ether but I am at a loss.  

I don't belong to anything... meaning no organization, religious affiliation, country club, gaming group, facebook hobby group or what have you.  At this point in my life, I am unsure of any desire to belong anywhere or belonging to a relationship or what I want...  I know more of what I don't want than the former.  What I do know, dearest, is that I am coming out of my skin.  I'm not certain if it is a shedding of the old or if it is desperation.  I know I hold my hand out in the darkness and the murky, thick sludge of lonely reaches back.  Its grip has a tenacious hold of me but I want to let go.

Is it really simply learning to love oneself?  Really?  Or are we really programmed to need one another?  Speaking as a lifelong introvert, I can't answer any of those questions.  I have a handful of friends and acquaintances but that nasty grip takes me under every time... and as I succumb to it those people fade in the distance.

Things have been going pretty well. Im in a good headspace for right now but im still kinda nervous about the future.  I know me and my siblings are gonna have to look after my younger brother after my parents pass away. He's a developmentally disabled individual.  He may legally be 20 years old but he displays the attributes and traits of someone who's in their teenage years. It breaks my heart and terrifies me wondering what would happen if I cant take care of him.  I mean i trust my siblings as well (in the oldest of 4) but as the eldest I feel so much pressure.  Definitely hits my mental more on some days.. 

Streams have been awesome.  Im just happy doing what I want to. Helping out as many people as I can, making new friendships,  forming new collaborations. Things are getting better.  

Happy to be back posting on here. Again, sorry that I dropped off randomly. I like to post here for myself as well. It's like a routine for me to be able to spill my thoughts out somewhere. Almost like therapy. Just putting them out there.

The thing that hurts the most is when I see all my friends hanging out together on social media without me, knowing I never even got invited, I wasn't even a thought to them.

I've been in a few relationships, all of them online and largely superficial. They don't seem to last long because the only thing we've ever seemed to have in common is feeling lonely. For the moment I live with my parents and brother. They're ""technically"" ""supportive"" but also incredibly emotionally abusive. Once I realized I've been gaslight'd (gaslite?) my whole life I feel into a pretty bad depression. I've socially isolated for so long it's hard to know how I'm supposed to interact with people.

I hate this. Recently, things have been getting worse. The closer I get to 30 (turn 30 on the 10th), the more lonely I feel. My friends have been abandoning me lately. It is a fight to even get in touch with them. I am ignored, blown off, given false hopes, etc. I wanted to go camping for my 30th, but apparently I am not important enough to one particular friend who i have seen as a brother for over 10 years. I can't get him to figure things out on his end so we can go camping. He recently got a new job and has a 9 day vacation before he starts the new job. Promised me he would spend a majority of the time with me since we haven't been able to see eachother much, and it will be harder for him to come see me. He starts his new job in 2 days. I feel like shit because not only has he made no effort to come see me, he has promised he would come see me last thursday, bailed on me, said he would call me today, but I doubt he will as the day is almost over. Whatever. Alcohol is more important to him I guess.

My friend that I play ps4 with has been working late for the last few weeks and I barely get to talk with her anymore. She hasn't responded to any of my messages lately, even though she doesn't work on weekends and said we would be able to play together yesterday, no response after I messaged her yesterday, no response today either. 

Messaged a couple more friends. One said he was hanging out with family today, no biggie. The other one has yet to respond. 

I feel like I am meant to be alone forever..I am so tired of this..I woke up and got out of bed 4 hours ago. Tried to play some ps4, but no motivation as I do not want to play alone. Ended up back in bed 30 minutes ago and now I just feel like shit. I am tired of always being alone. I am tired of always being brushed off..

I recently got my learners permit to drive (yeah, I know I am late on that, long story). My mom just keeps saying how much happier I will be..how will driving make me happier if I have nowhere to really go? Sure, I can go fishing whenever I want. But that will only get old fast as I like to go fishing with other people. My mom is more excited about me driving than I am..I don't want to tell her the truth about me not really being excited..I dont want her to know how lonely I am in life because I don't want her to stress about me or blame herself.

...And uh... I guess I feel guilty for exposing normal people to me? Like I never have anything interesting I'm doing. I'm pretty much a housepet with opposable thumbs. When I'm not being emo as heck I'll play a vidya game or something but holy crap am I boring.

I know full well there's no point in trying to form a relationship at this time in my life, or ever for the most part. 

Even if it wasn't a matter of my personality, my profession or even my race, there's still the understanding that it probably just isn't in the cards for me this time around. It's failure after failure, and if not from my own mistakes which are understandable enough, then mere circumstance, or things out of my control. 

My whole life has been plauged with this yearning, which has brought me nothing but pain and misery, and I nearly drove myself insane trying to get rid of it, obviously that didn't work, so here I am staring at a crossroads. 

Do I continue with my attempts and let myself burn with this inane activity, or do I just stop and live with the numbness, and hope one day an answer will come and I can be releived of this idiocy?

I envy the ones who are smart enough to just focus on what actually important to them, and not ever hope for fulfillent in another.

Hello peoples. Basically im really struggling through some stuff right now. I‚Äôve had to physically prevent my best friend from killing himself multiple times, being there for him for support and everything, all the while sometimes conteplating it myself. Its just really hard. Recently there was this girl who I thought was perfect in everyway. We only knew eachother for a week but I really fell for her. For the last few days we finally acted and it was really amazing. She then had to go back home because she was only in town for that week, but she doesnt live to far away. I texted and asked how she felt about me, but pretty much just got ahut down, saying she just wanted a one time thing. I dont know why it hurt so much, i shoukd have expected it. I guess im just feeling really lonely and dont know what to do or who to talk to. Sorry for making this so dark.

I recently picked up a gig driving for DoorDash in my local area which is a relatively busy area close to the interstate with a lot of businesses along the main road. I mostly enjoy it because I am now making money by myself and I want to save up some of the money for college and use some of it to get motorcycle gear and take a beginner MSF course to get a motorcycle endorsement on my license so that when I move to my own place in a couple of years (hopefully), I can have a cool hobby and meet new people, plus I have had an interest in motorcycles for a long time and I feel like it would have a positive impact on my mental frame.

In the scope of the DoorDash experience, it is rewarding financially as I can work for as long or as short as I want and on really good nights I can average$20+/hr which motivates me to leave the house a lot. It also adds a bit of structure to my life, waking up earlier, taking showers every morning, getting a fresh start each day, which I something I have been missing from my planned 2020 summer; my summer plans were initially to work at a golf course as landscaping grounds crew which I looked forward to as I could spend time outside with chill guys and make decent money. I planned on doing a summer calculus II class in person at my local community college. The last part of the summer plan was to reignite my regular gym schedule which was interrupted by my freshman year of college. Because of the pandemic, the golf course changed their crews to a fraction of their initial plan which led to me not visiting another time after my interview. The gyms in my area have been closed (and were going to reopen, but the closing was extended due to the resurgence of the pandemic). My calculus II class has been moved to full online instruction so that limited my weekly social interactions a lot as well. DoorDash provides a great fix to one pillar of that summer plan and helps me a lot.

Some experiences have been bad during the DoorDash arc (104-lifetime deliveries so far). While a lot of the deliveries to customers are great and easy, some of them don't go as planned. I can have a difficult time finding the customer's address and get stressed out in the heat about being late or disturbing the customer by texting or calling them. Some waits at restaurants are very long (sometimes up to 20 minutes on exceptionally busy afternoons) and I just hope so much that the customer will understand the food may be later than the app tells them. Sometimes the kitchen forgets an item and I'm not allowed to check a sealed bag so the customer calls angry and all I can tell them is to contact DoorDash for a refund. But I really like walking into restaurants and actually talking to people even if it's just to tell them someone's name I'm picking up for. some conversations go for longer and can really make my day.

A couple of days ago I was waiting for a customer's food inside Qdoba and there were three young couples (i assumed) sitting down at the distanced tables spending time with each other and I went home feeling jealous that even during the social distancing and face masks, etc. there are still young couples spending time with each other. I had one relationship with a girl during my freshman year living on campus but it was more of a close friendship and it never got physical (lasted about two months) but I really enjoyed her company and that kind of reminded me of when I would go on dates with that girl or even just eating together in the dining hall.

Most of the meaningful social interaction I get is talking with voice chat via Xbox Live party with my younger cousin and my real-life friends that I meet up with occasionally (less often now). I really enjoy talking with these people as well as strangers online but a lot is missing. When the pandemic hit the summer I felt sad pretty quickly (as I'm sure many other people can empathize with). The video games got stale, the people got tired of each other, the boredom set in. So DoorDash helps a lot with keeping me going this summer so far. I am excited for Cyberpunk 2077 to come out in November and going back to campus in the fall, even though it won't be the same as last year. Sometimes I get into bad pits of depression and sulking on bad days. I've tried online dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge) and have had mild success, one night I requested my data from Tinder be emailed to me and made one of those Sankey diagrams that people post on r/dataisbeautiful. That really made me feel unwanted, even though I know tinder is probably unfair to even for ""average guys"" and I am shallow as well, and its how I met the girl I dated mentioned earlier.

The gyms being closed have really impacted my ego. I have only been doing beginner calisthenics in my mom's basement irregularly and trying to increase my maximum pushups every day, I feel like I've missed out a lot. I am considering using some DoorDash money to get some dumbbells used from craigslist. I also was biking around my neighborhood for a couple of weeks before I started driving for DoorDash. I feel like I'm a generally slightly above average looking guy but I have some self-esteem/body positivity issues that I think are fueled by social media and comparing myself to others. I try really hard to get rid of my facial acne but I still hate seeing it on my face every day when I see so many normal people with clear faces I wonder what I'm doing wrong. I know none of my physical appearances matter if I am an ugly person inside my head, sometimes when I try to talk to my friends about deep topics I feel like they don't care what I say or they think I'm crazy, or I think I sound crazy. I'm afraid of speaking with a therapist or counselor because I feel like I have a hard time connecting emotionally with people I don't know well, and I remember talking with professionals in the past as a kid and just lying to them so they/my parents would think there is nothing wrong with me. The dilemma is that I feel bad dropping my emotion-filled ramblings to my friends because I feel like one day they will get bored and stop caring about what I say completely, I fear this when I think that I have talked too much or too serious about something that they don't care about or don't want to engage in. I couldn't imagine what I would feel if I lost all of my friends because they didn't like me anymore.

I didn't keep a lot of my friends in high school, I haven't talked to any of my friends in a long time. most of my friends are because of a link to one of my best friends from elementary school, who he went to high school with because I moved school districts and about an hour across the state for middle school and high school. I didn't have a super close group of friends in high school and just kind of just floated between cliques. Looking back, I didn't have many friends at all, more just close acquaintances that I interacted with only inside the school. I participated in a couple of clubs, but I played lacrosse for 4 years which I really liked. I never got very good at it and didn't have a lot of field time in games. My school was quite competitive with other local schools for most seasons but there were some real wonder kids on the team who everyone liked that got to play for a majority of the game for every game because they were very skilled. I feel like my teammates didn't have problems with me but I never got respect from them. The really skilled/liked guys could skip all the practices they wanted and still get all the perks, but people who do show up to practice work harder because others skipped and didn't get recognition (coaches win together lose together mentality I guess). I didn't form any really good bonds with these people and ended up skipping the end of season banquet senior year which I don't really regret because I don't think I missed out on much as I felt like I really had no friends on the team by the end of senior year season. Even at my graduation ceremony, I wasn't really proud of myself or my grades. I was just happy that I could start college and continue improving myself.

Highschool was probably my peak loneliness and depression as I didn't give myself enough sleep and I would procrastinate my busy work/homework until after I got home from practice. I think I have definitely improved but I still wish I had a S.O., yet I feel like there must be something wrong with me or what I'm doing that I haven't met someone yet. Online dating is pretty depressing and I am too shallow to lower my standards for who I ""swipe right"" on. I don't know how to meet people organically in real life during the current situation. I want to use this quarantine to further improve myself and make myself a better option for a woman somewhere out there. but sometimes it just feels really bad looking myself in the mirror getting inside my head and storm of thoughts getting existential. I wish everyone out there luck during these times, if you read all of this then please take time to share your personal experiences as I am interested in what other people are feeling right now.

I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with depression and have never had a therapist. For most of my life I‚Äôve had a feeling that I was the only one in my life I could trust. My father left while I was young which nowadays seems too cliche. But since then I think I‚Äôve always had a fear of being alone and having no one be by my side. Guess I‚Äôm starting to realize it‚Äôs been how I‚Äôve been living. I have a very nice and loving family and a girlfriend. 

But I still feel alone

I wake up in my bed and as always I lay there for hours before I get up because I find it hard to get myself excited for each day as I already know I‚Äôll spend the day sitting on my couch watching YouTube waiting for someone to text me or say anything to me. My mom usually stays in her room for most of the day so I sit in the living Room alone most days. My girlfriend isn‚Äôt a good texter so I wait patiently for her to text me once every two hours. I have friends but none of them text me. I feel more connected to you tubers who I grew up watching then people in my life. 

It seems like every other night I cry to myself either before I sleep or at night when I know my mom is asleep. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear from here and be put on my own island because to me it‚Äôs better to be alone physically then to have people and feel alone emotionally. Not to place blame on anyone but sometimes I wish my girlfriend could realize how I feel and make an effort to make me feel like I have someone. I have always told her how nice and pretty she looks and how much I love her but she has never made a true effort to give the same back to me. I‚Äôve told her how she is the only one I talk to regularly and yet it always seems like she forgets which sucks because I know she has dealt with her own mental illness and I wish she could help me. Then again it‚Äôs my fault I don‚Äôt say anything. 

About a couple weeks ago I had a whole week open where I didn‚Äôt have any shifts for work and I thought I could hang with my gf. But she hung with her friends the entire week and she went to the beach like literally everyday. I had asked why didn‚Äôt we hang or go to the beach. She then told me it was because she had friends. Being honest it hurt and even typing it now makes me sad. All my life I just wanted friends and people to make me feel wanted to make me feel not alone. I thought she was my friend. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong it‚Äôs just that whenever these situations happens between(happens kinda often) it feels like I‚Äôm the wrong one like I‚Äôm controlling but all I want is someone to distract me from how I feel.

Idk if I‚Äôll ever tell anyone I feel. Part of me wants to say something but the other part tells me it‚Äôs better to just keep it to myself. I always lean towards keeping it to myself and just seeing where it goes. I don‚Äôt plan on doing any self harm or suicide. I just want to feel better. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the rambling. These are just things I wish I could tell someone so at least I can put it out there.",lonely,I‚Äôm cliche but I feel alone and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever not feel this way,2020-07-05 15:28:51

I used to feel like I had no friends because I was a piece of shit person, but now I know that‚Äôs not the case because I have matured so much.

So, I'm an average person, honestly. I work, love my family and love my friends. I would consider myself to be somewhat ambitious, I like to strive to be better, in more than one avenue - training my mind, keeping fit, try not inhaling kilos of crisps, biscuits and sugary drinks! (Unbelievably difficult by the way! Haha!)

The reason for my post is to see if I can relate to people here, regarding my personality. So, I am lonely and, I do like the idea of having a partner but, I also enjoy being alone. I have always found myself unhappy when in a relationship; I begin to feel claustrophobic, or feeling like I am trapped - although I can be content in a relationship, too. I am a man with very deep emotions and I fear I will get hurt. I'm very polite (maybe even too polite), a seemingly extroverted person (although I am most definitely an introvert), and I'm generally a person who really appreciates being alone.

Does anyone here fear being alone for the rest of their life, but is also scared of being in a relationship - either because of fear of being hurt, or the fear of feeling trapped? Not wanting to hurt my previous partners, I've often stayed unhappy and continued being in a relationship, until I am unable to be in that relationship any more. Not due to being mistreated, but because it is hard coexisting in a relationship with someone, and not having enough 'me time' or 'alone time'. I hate being like that, I just can't cope not having enough time on my own. However, I do like the idea of being in a relationship whereby we are together but, we live apart - that would be absolutely perfect for me, although it may be unrealistic. Personally, I would be a lot happier if I could find a woman who enjoys being alone, too, and maybe seeing each other two or three times a week.

I like being alone due to previous trauma in my life: I was jumped many years ago and I found it incredibly difficult to leave my home. I hated being bored, but I ended up really enjoying my own company after years of being isolated from the world - I never went on any lads holidays, I was too scared to go to the shops after a certain time, never trusted anyone - all because I was jumped at an early age. I personally believe I suffered from PTSD but, at that time, mental health wasn't as prominent or socially aware as it is now. I dealt with it the best way that I could. Eventually though, I was able to break the cycle, as I had commitments and they become a priority.

I live in a paradox where I love the idea of being in a relationship, but I also hate the idea, too! I almost feel trapped in my own mind, as no matter the direction I want to take, I'll end up being unhappy - I am typically a 'happy go lucky' type of person, I just want to find someone I can be happy with, but without feeling trapped, nor do I want to be indefinitely alone and feeling totally isolated.

Anyway, I thought I would share my situation, and I'd really like to read your feedback, if you're willing to respond.",lonely,Do You Feel The Same Way Too?,2020-07-05 12:59:57

She used to really fulfill me, because we enjoyed each other's company, we would talk on the phone for hours at a time, I knew I could reach out to her any time of day or night and she would always be there for me. Now, all I have left is an empty void. I do not live alone, but the people I live with are no consolation at all. I have good days and bad days, but I am having trouble coping. Some days I feel okay and normal, and then some times I feel like I am going crazy. 

I feel myself slipping into a depression. Sometimes I just lay on the floor.

It went on for so long; I‚Äôd think I was done and try to walk upstairs or go make food and instead I would start crying again so hard I could barely walk. 

It was such an intense moment of feeling, and it motivated me to leave the house so I could escape the cycle. 

I went on a 4 mile hike by myself, and found a cute spot near the end of the gorge to picnic. I ate thawed fruit, and smoked weed. I started sketching new watercolor painting, and read a chapter of my book. I briefly did some yoga. I just existed, positively, by myself for hours. On the hike back I hiked up the gorge faster than I ever had before. 

I just felt like I needed to share this. I encourage others to try and adventure by yourself sometime. Get to know you a little better.

2932,lonelymilllionaire,1593892583,3,"Here's a brief of where I am now-

Day 0, been on Nofap for almost 2 years, couldn't go beyond average 4 days (max streak - 24 days)

Been edging almost daily. I don't have a porn problem. Mine is much bigger. I have a fantasizing problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Saw a hot girl at the counter? Go home, fantasize about fucking her to bliss and fap.

Hot colleague? Go home and fap. Saw something revealing while on a public transport? Go home and fap.

&amp;#x200B;

My mind is constantly in the fantasy land. What's worse, I don't masturbate using the usual way (by hand) I do prone masturbation (stroking my dick against the bed while laying flat on the belly)

This way it has always been sooooooo easy  and I've never been caught. If parents pass by while I lay on bed, I act like I'm reading something on my phone. Now this very same easy thing has become the hardest to get out of.

Consequence - I've been edging daily. I have a bent dick and that my undies are always dirty.

But all of this needs to end.

It's not that I have been into this by choice. I discovered prone masturbation as early as I can remember; much before when I could even ejaculate.

The pleasure felt so good. Initially it was for fun. As I grew older, this became my escape route - feeling stressed? Fap. Depressed? In a difficult situation? Crippling anxiety? Fap.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27 now and I was talking to this girl who was my junior at college and how she loved men with hot bodies and good looks (though ends up calling them fuckbois)

It's then I realized my lost time, lost opportunities.

All of the women in my life that I had a chance to build a bond, and maybe even have sex with. Like sands blown up in the wind. All that remains is regret.

&amp;#x200B;

I wake up everyday feeling blue these days. Chronic fatigue. Anxiety about the future, about having settling down and having a family of my own. My severe acne and years of social isolation and awkwardness makes it difficult to create a social media account (FB/IG) and with this lockdown due to pandemic, I'm all alone. Crippling anxiety and loneliness have become my daily diet. I've considered suicide for a good number of times since last month. Somehow didn't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing I have rn and I'm grateful for is my parents, an okayish job (where I get bullied) and working senses/limbs (yes, it is a privilege!)

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that I haven't tried. I did. But it's definitely not easy to beat something you've been doing for like 23 years. I survive on pills every single day. I'm not sure where this will lead.

Self-rejection, depression and self-loathing sticking around every single minute. I wish I had a real bond. A real human connection with whom I could share this. I don't know how to make friends during this lockdown. I have none. 3 months, not a single person called me. The only ones I talked to were the ones where I dialled first.

I'm just seeking some solace here. It's tough. You see, if you know the 'cause' then the 'effect' makes sense. What can the ""cause"" be for a 4-year old discovering self-pleasure eventually turning out to be nothing but a wreck in life? WHY? Why me or why anyone? It's a curse I wish upon no man.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm glad I have you guys here.

I just want you guys to know that things can get WORSE if not corrected. Wherever you are, whichever stage, please consider giving up sabotaging yourself through unnatural means. If this isn't the worst, I don't know what else is.

I am really feeling low today and not sure where to post this or who to talk to.

I've got a great partner and she is really supportive of everything I do and always there for me, but I have been lacking in the friends department for a long time now.

I moved to another country (UK) to be with her when I was young and for almost a decade I barely had any friends as I find if difficult to talk to people due to some anxiety issues and just generally being a bit awkward. I've had some friends from a previous job ages ago but things kind of fizzled out.

I really need some guy friends but have no idea how to go about making them. I just want to ""shoot the shit"" with some dudes my age (25-35)

I feel like life is passing me by and I want/need to have more experiences and a support network, right now I feel like I am just existing. I've got a good job and I am also studying for professional exams so I haven't had much time for friends, but I really need them. I am actually feeling kind of suicidal right now as I feel that life is passing me by and before I know it will be over and I have not lived...

2938,yeehawyeet17,1593885052,2,"Hello, I just need a place to vent and hopefully find out that I'm not alone in this. 

I've always felt like I was disposable. I'm an only child so school would be the only place I could talk to people. I have always shown nothing but kindness to people and have gone out of my way to make them laugh and be a genuinely positive person. Unfortunately, none of my friendships have ever gone past being surface level (I don't even think most of them would consider me their friend). No matter how much I show them that I have the qualities of being a good friend, no one ever seems to want to be close to me. They all either have their own best friend or they are close with their siblings so they don't have much need to socialize with others outside of school. I'm now 20 and have felt lonelier than ever. Most of the people I associated with in high school ghosted me and the only two friends I have usually don't talk to me (aside from sending me an occasional meme) and rarely hang out. I've also started to try and get closer with my younger cousins that live in the same city as me but it seems as though they've already bonded with one another. No matter how much I would make it known that I'm always here to talk, they still don't talk to me outside of family get-togethers. This has started to make me wonder if people just don't like me. I'm extremely insecure about the way I look and I've started to think that people don't like me because I'm repulsive. I am starting my third year of college and I feel stuck. I thought I would be living it up, making great memories, and actually get into relationships for the first time but nothing. I'm scared that this is all that life has to offer me.

Doing the same shit I've been doing for the past 8 years. Trying desperately to make friends. Trying desperately to get a relationship. I've been at this for 8 years.

I want to give up but loneliness is so painful. It's  a pain that doesn't go away. So I can't stop trying unless I'm dead. My worst fear is making friends some day and dying soon after because loneliness does kill you faster..

The world is telling me to kill myself but human instinct goes against it. I'm afraid of dying but living is absolute torture.

Fear.. borne of desperation and loneliness, creeping throughout my mind; panicking at the very idea of the solitude that I know is to follow, it fills me up from within. A darkness eats at me, threatening to swallow up my sanity in its entirety. It is an utter void of emptiness, tearing at the cheap facade of bravado used to shield myself from all things and people. I close my heart to you, to them.. to everyone. In my fear of being alone, I became my reason to be so... and I cannot seem to escape this prison of my own making.

By R.D.S.

These are very difficult emotions to convey through words. I never feel like they're enough. The words, I mean. But I understand how it feels. I know that sometimes it feels like you've stepped off the edge of a cliff and you're plummeting into more darkness.. more seclusion and loneliness. It's hard to deal with, and because I know what it's like, I'm always open to people messaging me to talk if they need someone to listen to and be there for them. Funny thing is, I don't know how to talk to others about how I feel myself. I'm constantly falling off that cliff and I don't know how to stop. But maybe one day, I will.

2975,kloneuno,1593846926,1,"TL:DR my best and only friend died a while back, I feel partially at fault and it haunts me to the point that I have trouble making any connections with new people.

To start a little backstory, I had not the greatest childhood but not everyone does, I got through and even though my mental health wasn‚Äôt great for a long time, I went with it. From age 16-26 I was heavily in the drug scene and had a lot of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù people who I liked enough to give drugs to and they‚Äôd stick around. My one constant was my best friend Mike. Mike and I were best friends since 1st grade and even though he moved away for a few years we kept in touch until he finally moved back around the time I was 18. He wasn‚Äôt much of a drug user but I got him to start smoking weed every once in a while and then as I got more out of hand he was always there by my side, we did some real crazy shit. 
I‚Äôd had a problem with pain pills since I was young but it was always an on/off sort of thing of whenever I had them, but then I started selling oxy and everything changed. We went from being a crew to being heroin junkies and everything went down really quick. For most of this time I was in an extremely toxic relationship, although my partner wasn‚Äôt using and didn‚Äôt know how bad my addiction was, had no idea I was getting high until I had been using heroin for about 2 years. 
Anyways Mike and I always looked out for each other. I knew my limits but I would often have to step in and tell Mike to chill out unless he was trying to die. This was not something we weren‚Äôt opposed to discussing. Not in a literal sense but we both knew where our lives were heading and to be close enough to know that a little more could kill you, the thought was never far off in either of our minds. 
I was so caught up with my mental hell with my ex that I never took the time to take the things he said as seriously as I should have. There were times where he admitted nearly running his car off the road and I didn‚Äôt even know how to approach it  because we both were just so unhappy. I truly wish I would have been a better friend and taken more time to find out what was causing him so much unhappiness. 
So one night we score some Xanax and some fentanyl and I give him a couple bars that he‚Äôs supposed to sell to another one of his friend he‚Äôs having over later that night. I go back to my place and get high, I hit him up the next morning, no response, not crazy. I didn‚Äôt get a text from him the whole rest of the day so I get worried and text him asking if he‚Äôs alive. The next call I got was his girlfriend telling me she found him dead on the couch. He had just been getting trashed in the jacuzzi on fentanyl and Xanax all night with these people and I don‚Äôt know what else happened which is one of the parts that bothers me the most. The other part is that I know that I wouldn‚Äôt have let him get that fucked up. Maybe that was his goal? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm left with a lot of unanswered questions and on top of it all I now live a mostly clean lifestyle that I dedicate to him and it‚Äôs hard to make friends who share the same values I do now. I‚Äôve turned my life around for the most part and gotten out of my toxic relationship. The thing that just lingers is that I have no friends. I just expected him to be in my life forever. All the people I have memories of Mike with I no longer talk to which makes me sad. My current girlfriend never got to meet him. 
Which I guess brings me here today. I‚Äôm lonely, I have nobody to ask for advice or just to shoot the shit throughout the day. I love my girlfriend to death and at this point she is my best friend. I just know it isn‚Äôt healthy. Sometimes there‚Äôs things about our relationship that I want opinions on and I wish I had someone to share obscure memes with just wish I had my best friend back. If you got this far thanks for reading, it feels to good to get it off my chest.

I've always enjoyed playing host, I've always enjoyed preparing food and making stuff for the people I know I love a good get together with games and stuff like that.

5 people came... fuck the rest.

This was 6 years ago, fine, whatever, I got over it, I just stopped doing stuff like that, elaborate preparations, food, whatever, only for my close family.

Yesterday I asked a woman I had flirted with and had my eye on that whenever she wanted we could share a beer.

She immediately told me ""tomorrow"".

So I went to buy some snacks and stuff to prepare for her (pate, cheese, stuff that would go good with a lager).

I haven't done anything for anyone outside family since that birthday...

She stood me up...

But I'm OK, I didn't even mind since it was just for 2 people I enjoyed my self watching a movie and having a beer, eating my snacks it's just that it made me remember that time when I was stuck inside a kitchen for 4 hours to make enough food for everyone I invited to the party.

2982,Sick_6ix,1593845156,1,"Due to the nature of my job a lot of my friends are from the south and unintentionally have a lot in common. I‚Äôm from a pretty large city in the north so I feel there‚Äôs already a larger gap for me to cross. 

We are all stuck in a small town with not much to do locally besides a few bars. None of us are interested in outdoor activities because of how often our work forces us outside. Leaving us with two options when we hang out playing video games and/or drinking. In the past year or so the amount I drink has taken a sharp decline and I‚Äôm not interested in the same games they are. 

I‚Äôve realized that my friends only ask me if I want to hang out is when they wanna party. I know this is my own fault but I always say yes due to my own FOMO. While we always have a good time, I do feel in the back of my mind like the odd one out no matter what combination of friends. I do not expect them to do whatever I want. This does leave me at a crossroads between being myself and toning down certain interests in order to fit in. 

My friends planned a trip to the nearest city and did not invite me, one of them did apologize, but it did not seem sincere. I gave it some thought and realized that there have been many times when I have caught them hanging out, going out to eat, or making plans without me. I never said anything because I didn‚Äôt want to seem needy or that I didn‚Äôt have other friends. 

While I do get alone with everyone pretty well, I really do not have many friends besides them. It is clear that I was more invested in our friendship than they were. I do want to hang out with them because they are all nice guys, but at the same time I do not want to hang out with people that only see me as a  drinking buddy and not a human being with interests and hobbies.

I can think back as far as 11 to that becoming a normal occurrence. Every best friend I‚Äôve ever made has moved away stopped talking to me and are now living fulfilling lives with s/o and their passions. I‚Äôve always been someone who‚Äôs cried for attention I was the kid who would do stupid things so people would laugh and stay close to me. Being kicked in the balls, eating something gross, taking the blame you name it. Yet the moment is so fleeting. Always been the one vented to and the guy who gave advise. Relationship or anything else I was there to give my input. A simple thanks, you‚Äôre an amazing person and they disappear.

2993,Foxcoreen,1593839782,1,"I just feel really lonely. I live with my ex boyfriend who doesn‚Äôt care about me or my feelings and is a self proclaimed asshole. Just came to terms with the fact that I had the whole relationship twisted in my head and viewed it better than it was. Sucks cause I viewed the first month of it as the happiest time in my life considering it was the first time I‚Äôve ever felt wanted by someone.

Even though I do live with him, he hates talking to me and calls me annoying for trying to have a conversation because ‚ÄúI talk about nothing‚Äù. If I don‚Äôt have work and stay home I usually have to end up watching him have a blast talking to his friends on discord while playing games. This makes me feel worse than if I was by myself.

I‚Äôve tried to get him to play games with me and talk about the games he likes but it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. I‚Äôm annoying regardless of what comes out of my mouth. 

The other day I tried to playfully bring up that it‚Äôd be nice to be invited to come hang out with him and his friends just so I experience some sort of social interaction. But of course, as he‚Äôs picking me up to go somewhere with his friends, he announces loudly I‚Äôm only coming because ‚Äúif he didn‚Äôt take me I‚Äôd bitch about it later‚Äù 

This isn‚Äôt anything new though. From the time when we started living together he clearly got bored of me and would prioritize his friends and literally anyone else over me. He told me we couldn‚Äôt go on dates because of financial reasons (I‚Äôm not high maintenance whatsoever, i even offered to pay for my share or even have stay in movie dates for free but whenever we would watch a movie he‚Äôd be on his phone playing a game or talking to other people like I don‚Äôt count that as a date considering you are now sharing the moment with them and not me). But anyway he‚Äôd say that but then go out to eat with this other girl alone. (Come to find out later he‚Äôs been simping over her ass for years)

But that made me feel extra cruddy. I had no one else and yet instead of trying to be a halfway decent boyfriend he basically said fuck you, I‚Äôm doing what I want, you deal with your childhood trauma and the stress of loosing everything you‚Äôve known on your own because I‚Äôm a selfish asshole who prioritizes my own wants and I will call you crazy and controlling when you keep asking to go out alone together and not hang out with my friends for the 40th time this week.

All I wanted was to feel special. Like I meant something to him. I‚Äôm nothing more than a disposable soggy paper plate at this point. I tried to be the best girlfriend I could be. I helped him as best as I could. I stayed faithful. But who is he currently still in love with? Another taken female who makes leading other guys in her day job and like flirting was her college major. All she does is use him as a shoulder to cry on when she can‚Äôt cry to her boyfriend and he will literally sit there for hours and listen to it. 

If I dare cry about, idk, say how everything in my life is shit rn and how pointless everything feels sometimes, and how I feel like I‚Äôll never find someone to love me or be able to afford a house, he‚Äôll tell me to shut up, stop crying about the same five things that it doesn‚Äôt matter that I can‚Äôt control my depressive episodes and I probably purposely choose to cry at the worst times and that I‚Äôm not doing anything to help myself. (Which isn‚Äôt true at all).

But if she calls him up after a 12 hour shift at a wearhouse job to pick her up to cry and complain about her well paying hospital job at 9oclock at night (during quarantine may I add) because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo stressful‚Äù (like she didn‚Äôt know what she was signing up for) he will go out of his way to pick her up and let her unselfaware ass cry about it for hours and waste how much gas in the progress.

She has friends, a boyfriend, and a nondisfunctional family. I have nobody. And yet when I dare suggest to his friends that she‚Äôs privileged and has it way better than me I‚Äôm told ‚Äúeveryone has stuff their going through‚Äù like okay and? That stuff people go through is a lot easier to cope with when you have friends and a support system. 

(And it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like her cause she‚Äôs privileged, I don‚Äôt like her because of how she acts. I think it‚Äôs wrong to be that flirty with guys who aren‚Äôt your boyfriend. )

And it doesn‚Äôt end there. The amount of double standards between how they‚Äôve treated me vs her. My ex boyfriend at one point started calling me a nasty alcoholic because I asked him to buy me vodka on occasion. Well come to find out, that girl actually IS an alcoholic and yet they have no problem with her going to the bar every weekend and will go with her sometimes. 

I think I‚Äôve gone on this tangent for long enough. It just pisses me off that he basically worships her for doing literally nothing while I was there helping him. Who stayed with him through the night when his house reeked of shit because his methhead aunt took a shat on the carpet. Me, not her. Yet he calls her his ‚Äúwife‚Äù. Which one of us was doing his laundry? Cleaning his room? Running errands for him? Letting in borrow a car for almost a month to drive to work because his broke down? I‚Äôll let you take a guess on that. I did everything I could to help that boy and what did I get in return? I got sarcastic replies and a pisspoor attitude while she got a simp for life by doing nothing. How does that work.

How can I ever expect to be enough for anyone when I‚Äôve literally gave it all I had and that still wasn‚Äôt good enough. This is why I‚Äôm lonely and depressed.",lonely,Hi everyone,2020-07-04 15:16:22

I wake up daily, turn on my computer and play games for 18+ hours, and then repeat, daily. No one to talk to, just alone with my thoughts, really. All the time spent thinking has made me constantly question things and I ended up forming very extreme/unpopular opinions about things, which doesn‚Äôt really sit well with people. Sometimes I feel the emptiness of having no one to share my time with, sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm better off alone and that maybe friends aren‚Äôt worth having after all, sometimes I‚Äôm extremely angry about it. I really have no idea what I truly feel about it. I am always on edge, no matter what. I don‚Äôt really know who I am, my true self. I have been wearing a mask for so long that I have no clue who I really am, how I truly feel about anything. I don‚Äôt even feel like I trust my thoughts anymore, they always end up contradicting each other and running me in circles. The only time I really feel at ease is when I drown out my thoughts in drink and drugs and I can forget about everything and slowly kill my body. I like to believe that when you die, you just begin a new life as a child, and repeat until you die again. I always think of how many different lives, better lives I could get, but I‚Äôm too scared, too weak. I‚Äôm in a limbo of thinking everything is meaningless, but at the same time, I fear death more than anything, I want to live. I want to live a fulfilling life, but I think I already missed my chance, my mental is too ruined from being alone and thinking for this long to feel fulfilment or anything from anything anymore. I get bursts of motivation, here and there, but they fade away after a few days. I really don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôll probably just continue the same mindless routine until I drive myself insane.

3001,Bagelslol,1593833660,1,"shoot. your. motherfucking. shot.

 seriously, I see so many people say how they wish they  had someone to be with and love them. the best advice I can give is to just confess to ur special someone. the worst case scenario is that they don't like you back, and even then there are plenty of other people in this world that definitely like you.

look at me: I thought no one liked me. I was friend zoned 5 times by different girls. I was depressed and suicidal. I was gonna kill myself. I had a crush and we were already friends but we texted every night and she helped me through my tough times. honestly she cared about me and I'm super thankful for that. I doubt I would be here without her. anyways I eventually built up the courage and finally told her my feelings and guess fuckin what? she likes me back! I was 99% sure I was gonna get rejected so I was really shocked. I honestly really love her lol.

to wrap things up I have some advice for  y'all:

1. build a strong connection first. if you guys both aren't friends then there would be no point for them to like you.

2. don't rush into it. I already knew this girl for like 3 years (but only crushed on her since the beginning of this year lol) but you obviously don't have to wait that long. I'd say that if you are both friends then a good solid few months are good.

3. don't be mad if they don't like you. I see too many people get mad at their crush because they didn't like them back. I used to be like this too. my dumbass was like ""uGh wHaT a bItCh sHe oNlY lIkEs bAd gUyS."" I got more humble about this a couple years ago luckily. if they dont like you, then just move on and forget about it. do NOT get mad at them.

4. if you sense a toxic personality, don't even bother. even if there are really good looking but are genuinely a shitty person then ignore them.

5. I really thought i wouldn't have to say this, but don't be an asshole. if you like someone then don't try to force them to do anything and don't peer pressure them into it. also just simply be nice and a good person. just like my crush and how she helped me through depression.

in the end if you are feeling lonely and like someone, go ahead and shoot ur shot.

3007,thecocowholived,1593830659,1,"I(20s male) thought I had made a few friends this past year. I grew very close to these 2 girls that we had hired at my work. This might end up being a rant, but whatever...

The first was Aug-Dec. I ended up asking her out in Dec, to which she excitedly said yes. And later told me she had been waiting for me to do so for a few weeks(she had been texting me every day for weeks). After the first date though, she had second thoughts and didn‚Äôt want me to lose my job since I was above her and dating above or below is not allowed. She was gonna quit on the spot but I convinced her to stay. It was weird for a few days but our interactions went back to normal after that. She ended up leaving a few weeks after since her work permit expired. I texted her occasionally the first month she was gone, and asked her out again. She said she can‚Äôt, but she would love to be friends. 

It seemed normal for the first 3 months or so. We would text all day a few days on and off every week. However, I was the only one ever initiating any conversation. After talking about how my birthday plans we ruined due to COVID, she seemed to feel bad for me. We had been texting for like 5 days straight, the day before my b-day, she randomly didn‚Äôt respond. She sent a happy birthday text the next day, but couldn‚Äôt be bothered to try and make a conversation. One day, she finally did text first. I was incredibly happy that after 3 months, she had finally done it first. After my reply, she just says ‚ÄúI was gonna ask if you(the store we worked in) had face masks in stock. That fucking hurt.

Then since May, every time I texted her, she would take longer and longer to respond. Half the time she wouldn‚Äôt respond at all. When she did, it was 5-6-7 hours later then would reply 2-3 times and then stop. So I started texting less like once every 1-2 weeks. Recently, I had told her I was moving out of my parents house. I asked if she wanted to go to IKEA with me, and she said ‚Äúno‚Äù, and I asked why and she just said ‚Äúidk‚Äù, so i respond with ‚Äúwell I‚Äôd like to hang out at some point soon(nearly 7 months since she left). She just ignored that, so I sent a text a few days later clarifying I wasn‚Äôt asking her out, just to hang out. And she finally responded with ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay‚Äù and nothing else. She finally got her work permit(parents don‚Äôt allow her to leave without them except for work), so she finally has an excuse to hang out with friends and lie to her parents about working long, so I figured I would ask to hang out. That was clearly a mistake. 

I told her that i was moving out. In the context of our convo, she asked how my mom took it(we had talked about it before), to which I said I told her a week prior. Idk, maybe she wasn‚Äôt happy I didn‚Äôt tell her right away or something, but it‚Äôs not like she tells me anything unless I specifically ask about it. This convo ended in with the ikea stuff above. Her jobs are and app delivery and something she does from home, so she still has the same free time most of the day.

I know I should just give up on one of my last friends, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it. She used to respond within 5-10 mins, now I‚Äôm lucky to get a handful of replies. I feel I‚Äôve pulled all the weight keeping this together. I kind of want to ask why she never tried to initiate, but i figure she‚Äôll just ignore that text. Idk, I‚Äôve dealt with depression and anxiety so it‚Äôs been extremely hard and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about every single interaction we‚Äôve had. Some times she blames her phone not working as to why she doesn‚Äôt reply, but honestly not sure I believe it. I mean I genuinely enjoy talking to her, but now if it‚Äôs a few hours and she doesn‚Äôt reply, I get so much anxiety about what I screwed up.

The other girl, was just 3 months ago. We hired her, and we hit it off immediately. Talking all day at work. Had a lot of similar interests and played the same video games. She had some personal stuff that came up so she left. I worked on her last night there, so i asked her out. She had a boyfriend, but asked if i would like to be friends since we had a lot in common. I said of course. She left a month and a half ago, and I‚Äôve asked a few times if she wanted to play some online video games or hang out. Every time I did, it‚Äôs either been ignored or some excuse not to. I understand she got a new full time job so she works most of the day. She helped me get the apartment, mentioned in the above paragraph, in her complex(gave me information). Hers is about 50ft from mine so I pass her car nearly every day, so my mind just wonders why she never asks to hang out. Originally, i had told her to hit me up if you wanna hang out or play video games.

I know this sounds really pathetic and it went on way too long, but what should I do? I know i dragged the first friend too long, and should‚Äôve probably stopped when it first started bothering me that she would never try to reach out first. Should i just stop contacting them? Or at least ask why they never contact me? It‚Äôs just depressing to think I finally had made some great connections with people, and for it to end like this. I feel like i almost resent them for it, even though it‚Äôs my fault, i guess. I just feel like shit most of the time so i hold on to anything...

3008,Diplomarmus,1593828932,1,"The amount of crushing depression and loneliness lately is eating away at my core. More than ever lately.

I have a house. I have money. But I feel like death is around the corner just waiting for me. I feel like I'm on borrowed time. I've lived through shit that SHOULD have made me kill myself, but I refuse to give up. Too much pride and God complex for that.

I hate feeling like this because I know loneliness and depression actually do harm your body. I don't want it.

And the sheer stupidity of the human race is off-putting and depressing to watch. The culmination of over two-thousand years and It's puzzling to see how we got this far. Maybe apparently more so in America. Just feels hopeless amid the Covid-19 ignorance.

It's like I need someone to vent to and understand. In the same way that I've always been able to provide that. But I can't I'm all alone.

3014,Abaiota,1593826359,2,"Around Christmas time last year I hit a mental funk and it's been something that has stuck with me ever since and as of the past few weeks has only gotten worse. 

This mental health shit started this all off was me coming to the realization that in the 10 or so years I've been on the dating scene I have nothing good to show for it. Tried both connecting with women in my everyday life (which has led to nothing but hurt for me) and online dating, which I've come to the realization is literally the worst method in trying to find romance. 

Then the pandemic hit and school went to all online and now I've graduated and something else has made my mental state so much worse. I realized that in all my time at university I didn't make one single friend. It never occurred to me because I did get some interaction with people during school, but now that I have gone literally months without talking to a single person outside of my parents its become noticeable. I've never felt more isolated and alone in my entire life and it hurts. 

I don't know what to do anymore, outside of earning my degree (which in and of itself presented me more than its fair share of problems), I feel like the past 8 or so years of my life has been an utter waste. No friends, no romantic partner, no job (it's great getting ghosted by an employer after 4 interviews) and for the immediate future I see no way to rectify this. Due to both being in a pandemic and me living in the middle of fucking nowhere.

I‚Äôm studying the LSAT atm and I don‚Äôt know a soul in this small farming town of like 2000 ppl. Dad went back to CLE for the holiday with his wife and I‚Äôm here by myself.

Tomorrow, I take a practice test, exercise, and then start researching which Law School I want to apply to. It‚Äôs all new to me, and frankly, I‚Äôve never been so out of touch alone on this holiday (4th of July is usually my favorite) but COVID has forced me away from everything and everyone I know. 

I‚Äôve dealt with loneliness a lot in life. I‚Äôm a social creature, but my Borderline Personality Disorder has left me in my late 20s with not a whole lot of friends (and I couldn‚Äôt blame them for keeping their distance or dropping out entirely. It‚Äôs hard to be around me when I get an episode).

So here‚Äôs to a 4th of July I‚Äôll never forget but I hope is one that will be meaningful.

My one prayer is that in 365 days I have somewhere to belong to, cause I feel like the virus took that away from me. Not asking for help, or advice, just felt like sharing. Hope you all have an interesting or dare I say fun 4th.

3019,ShowtimevonParty,1593824579,12,"The other day I was bored in class and I stumbled upon this sub, I made a post encouraging whoever was down to have a chat to hmu or reply below. Some people replied, others went to PMs, but I had a nice talk with all of them, except for one.

I won't say names, I wouldn't wanna start a witch hunt in a place like this. He sent me a message with his discord tag and mentioned some things games he was interesting in, one of which I was also very fond of, so it immediately grabbed my attention. I hit him up in discord and we start chatting. Pretty simple right? It only took 10 minutes until things took a turn for the worst.

He started asking me for my name, age, and country, all of which I replied with a lie (can't be too careless...). My first thought was ""well that's a bit too fast"" but I didn't wanna say anything. Maybe the guy was socially awkward and he really didn't know how to approach someone, which wouldn't surprise me coming from here, no offense to anyone.

Furthermore I kept talking about said game we have in common and he threw some odd remarks at me. I said the game was awesome and he replied with ""you are awesome"". ""YOU are amazing!"" Out of place comments like that. Again, I didn't pay much attention to it, figured he was just friendly.

Then not even 30 minutes after we started talking, he asks ""So how much longer until I become your favorite person?üòÅ"" That's when it hit me. It doesn't take a genius to connect 2 and 2 together and realize what was going on. It was clear this guy had another intention in mind aside from chatting. I tried shrugging it off and simply said ""dunno"". I really just wanted to talk about the damn game.

Afterwards he said ""So you aren't denying the possibility, interesting..."" and that's when I decided it was enough for me, I blocked the guy and told him that I wasn't planning on contacting him again when he PMd me on reddit later. I never made any kind of provocative or sensual remark towards him. I just wanted to chat.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To those who may find themselves in this person: I understand if some of you are craving that kind of romantic interaction, but please, know that others have boundaries. Don't get too comfortable too fast, it can come off as weird and, depending on how some people perceive it, creepy. If someone takes the time out of their day to talk with you don't take the convo in the wrong direction, more so if it's someone you JUST met. It is so goddamn annoying and can definitely turn people off from the convo. Take the hint and stop pushing it.

&amp;#x200B;

And to those who might ever find themselves being the one groomed, or if you just wanna avoid something like this: Be careful. Don't give out your real info to someone you just met. Creepy people are out there and I'm sure some of them are using this subreddit to take advantage of those who aren't in the right place to form a coherent decision. Report to the mods if you feel it's necessary. (In my case I won't) Don't be fooled and don't let the situation get out of your hands. Don't be naive, you can assume the other person is friendly or socially awkward, but don't let it cloud your judgement. Sometimes that's exactly what they want you to think.

&amp;#x200B;

Made this post because I've seen that posts of people looking for a chat are very common and it's extremely dangerous. Some weirdos have ill intentions. Don't be careless.

3067,Sorpaijen,1593785457,1,"I'm sure there are people out there who could enjoy sitting with someone in total silence, just enjoying their presence without feeling a need to fill the silence with inane chatter or pointless 'conversation'.  Unfortunately, that kind of interaction isn't exactly one that draws people in, it seems.  It may even be that someone would be okay with comfortable silences when they were \~already\~ in a relationship for a while... but initially, more ""flash"" seems to be expected.

Having been alone most of my life (50M), I've been reluctant to invite someone in, and I fear that if I DID, I'd regret it because it would be exhausting to be 'forced' to 'entertain' her all the time (or risk losing her).  I am more a low-key wry-humor kind of guy, pithy comments made all the more amusing because I don't make them all the time, so they strike out of the blue.

The whole idea of \~attracting\~ someone to join me in my life feels foreign to me.  Like, I feel I have to put on a top hat and tuxedo tails and wave a cane about like a carnival barker trying to lure someone in.... but that's not ME.  It just irks me to no end that I am expected to ""lie"" to get into a relationship.  

That's part of the appeal of dating sites, to me:  I can present myself as I am, (proverbial) warts and all and then just wait to see if anyone IS interested in the 'real deal'.  Of course, so far, no, they haven't been.  If/When Coronavirus gets tamed and it's even \~possible\~ to go out to public places again, that won't help me much because I don't \~like\~ public places... 

If I go to a public place or join a group of strangers for some hobby, sure, I am more likely to meet people... but I don't want PEOPLE, I want \~PERSON\~.  ONE.   If I meet that person while I'm stressing out about being in a group setting, even if I hide it, and maybe we connect... that's a lie, because I would not BE in such a situation except that I am ""on the prowl"", hunting for a mate like some prehistoric caveman.

3068,splifficated2019,1593783824,1,"We live in a world full of different people with different ideologies, beliefs, traits, personalities but one thing we all share in common in this world is that no matter the circumstances we all end up alone one way or the other.

Ten year old me would never have imagined myself to end up so lonely and desolate in my twenties but here I am all alone in a hotel room, with no one I can express my emotions and feelings to, and then I realized I am my own company and when the going gets rough I have no one but me to get me through it, life is a contradictory mess, despite our differences in race, colour, culture, beliefs, ideologies if it's one thing I'm sure of that each of us have in common is that were all lonely in a world so full of life, fimiliar faces everywhere yet everyone feels so very distant and cold.

Solitude is a Bliss I know, but we as humans beings require love, affection and care, it's one thing I believe that all human beings are entitled to have.

People are assholes and loyalty means little to nothing for most people, promises are nothing but temporary lies, loyalty exists until the next better thing arrives, humans are very selfish creatures that put their own needs above others.

Now more then ever people should be connected with the rise in social media, internet, instant messaging but the truth is that people are now more distant than ever, everyone puts on a fake persona, everyone feels so distant, people act like robots, caring about nothing but looking good for other people no matter the cost.
I guess it's one of the many reasons people are so very lonely in our current society.

I never considered myself to turn out  to be a lonely person haunted by his past, dead on the inside with nothing to lose, I've experienced infatuations which I believed to be love and never have i been more disappointed, love doesn't exist, neither does companionship or togetherness, the harsh reality is that most of the time we only got ourselves, the only truthful company you'll ever get is yourself, the question is can you be truthful to yourself? Do you enjoy your company?
I read a quote that said if you're lonely when you're alone, then you're in bad company or something along those lines and it really reasonated with me, are u lonely right now? Do you cry yourself to sleep some nights? Do you wish you had a companion some nights? The truth is loneliness is a state of mind and never have I been more lonely then when when I was together with someone in a relationship, people are selfish and when they show you that you don't matter much in their lives anymore that's where true loneliness comes from, from being discarded, from feelings like you don't matter, you are the best company you'll ever get trust me and maybe once you accept the fact that you're happy being a friend to yourself then you might realize that you're not so lonely but the people around you make you feel that way.

I'm by no means the happiest person around and I do get very very sad and lonely from time to time but I have also come to the realization that loneliness is a state of mind, it's a very dark place you don't want to end up in, it's very desolate and grim, and I know exactly what goes through the minds of lonely people and I can reasonate with all the thought process that goes through the mind of a lonely person putting on a tough persona on the outside only to be haunted by a dark void on the inside, feel free to comment whatever thoughts are going through your mind and I hope that we can all get through the darkness by feeling lonely together.

My mother shows fsvouritsm to my other siblings and always provokes me. She will talk to them lovingly and checks on them constantly. It's like, I'm physically there too but she just ignores my entire presence and only talks to my other siblings. She'll ask them to eat but doesn't do that to me. And when I'm eating, she will always make sure to tell me to leave some for others. But when it comes to them, ""just finish them it's ok"". Also, when it comes to me, whatever I do always gets on her nerve. Even when I tried to not to speak to her, to avoid arguing, she keeps provoking me still. I study well, I don't get into bad situations unlike my other siblings, but I'm still considered the bad apple..I'm the youngest and have always felt that they look down on me or thinks that I don't have feelings. Because I'm always a child to them, sort of? She's been always annoyed with me ever since I'm a kid.. and I'm an adult now.

My friends of 8-9 years ditched me and stopped asking me out. They always plan outings among themselves and I always couldn't make it. Because it's the date they're mutually free, but I'm not. They made it seem like I neglected them but they stopped including me in a lot of stuff like planning outings together. When I stopped checking on them, because I felt like they don't do the same, our friendship just ended like that. So I realised my worth to them now. My life revolved around them and they were a huge part of my life, since I don't have a great relationship with my family.. so I fell into depression but didn't tell anyone. I was crying almost every night, and it's been 2-3 years and I still feel sad about how our friendship ended. I lost a lot of weight due to this and people were complimenting it.. 

My partner constantly feels irritated with me, even when I ask genuine questions to learn more about him like ""oh why aren't you eating that, you don't like it?"" He will get annoyed because to him, I assumed he doesn't like it. Or, when he wants to treat me certain stuff but I feel embarrassed or like I don't deserve it so I'll say it's alright or we can get them at this place instead, as it's cheaper. And he's also annoyed because I always to scrimp and save.. He's only nicer after we've had sex or I've given him a BJ, but it doesnt last.. and he's back to being easily irritated by me :(

I feel like ditching everyone and just disappear and rent a place. The fact that I know no one will care and my partner will be worried but he'll be back to always being angry and annoyed with me, is just upsetting. Everyone just keeps getting annoyed with me even when I meant well, care for them greatly or even when I try my best to avoid arguments.

I work as a ESL and Japanese teacher, and have always been very charismatic. I'm the one who's always smiling and was always able to make new friends very easily, but I only kept one or two around, and for that I always told myself I just preferred a few good friends I could focus on over a lot of friends I weren't so close to. 

Lately (during the quarantine and before it) I've been realizing I just don't consider anyone to be my friend. I have my students and plenty of people I care about and I know they care about me, but I just don't feel close to them at all. This has been getting worse and worse until it got to the point I don't really want to talk to anyone anymore. I'm starting to feel like it's easy to make friends, but I just can't keep them.  I do meet a lot of new people and spend hours talking to them on discord channels and the internet in general, but that initial conversation is as far as it goes for me, no matter how much I like that new person.

I'm a very practical person and I've always like only doing things that have a very clear purpose to me and being as objective as possible with my actions, but I think this has been contaminating my social skills. I never start conversations because I have nothing important to say, I never ask people how they are because I don't really care (as in I know they're probably alive and well or I'd have heard about it and if they needed my help they'd just ask, as pretty much everyone I know knows I'll come to their aid no matter what), I never ask anyone to play games with me because I feel like it would just be too much work (although I don't really understand how playing a game for 30 mins could be ""too much work"").

 It got to the point where I only talk to my students and that's for classes and whenever anyone tries to reach out I answer with ""yes"", ""no"", ""ooh wow"", ""that sucks"", ""really?"" Or ""Ok"". I can't keep the conversation going because that also feels without purpose and kind of useless.

My question is: is that a thing???

I am shit at relationships. I always have one friend at any moment of time, and when I have a significant other, I have no other friends. School/uni/work were where all my other relationships came from, because the built in social circle and obligation to be around the same people constantly made casual friendships easy, but I've never had friends that followed me into other stages of my life. It's as if I channel all my attention only in one person at a time.
Well, it all comes to bite me in the ass right now, at 4 pl am, when there is not one person online from the meager amount of people that still talk to me. I am at my lowest point and I don't even have anyone to share my hurt with. Nowhere to let it out to make it even a little bit better. God the only thing I wish is that I was home right now, and not in this hell. It's going to be dawn soon and  I've been crying so hard for the last hour I don't even think I will be able to sleep at all. What's the point, if I can be woken up at any moment?
 I work 24 hour shifts and tonight I was able to sleep a whole 2.5 hours. Im an administrator at a hostel, which is to say I am a receptionist who is also cleaning. I usually can get a little rest at night, but the only place where I can sleep is this little couch in the lobby  you know, the one everyone puts their shitty bags all over. I am getting paid a whopping 0.77 usd an hour for the privilege of working with people all day, hiding behind my best fucking customer service smile and voice,  cleaning after their shit and cleaning the shitty bathroom, too. then be woken up every hour at night by absolute scum who think they're so special that the rule that we don't  free entry and exit at night doesn't apply to them. Go the fuck to sleep. Who the fuck are you that you see a person sleeping on a fucking couch in the lobby, that you saw spent the previous 18 hours behind the reception chair or dealingwith your trash, then have the gall to wake them up because they absolutely must have a smoke at 3.30 am. Then at 4 am. The last asshole I let out and he fucked off for an hour didn't even bother trying to fall asleep as I knew he will wake me up anyway. Had people checking in up to 2am, hoped to try and get at least something approaching 6 hours of sleep and then this. Fuck you.
The only day where I hoped I would be able to get a little rest, because I need it so much. Tomorrow (well, today, at this point) instead of resting after this shit job I must go to my other shit gob, but after I was hoping to go out for once. I haven't seen my boyfriend in a month and I need any kind of contact like hell. But I already know I'll be so exhausted that all my plans will go to shit. Yeah, with this kind of schedule maybe you too can see how hard it is to support any friendships or have any life at all.
And like, if you still think that minimal wage workers are lazy, fuck you. But worst thing is, I'm so ashamed that I even ended up like this. I have a college degree. I had my life ahead of me and I squandered it away and it's all my fault I Used to make 400 usd at an ok office job and even if it was gruelling customer service for even more entitled clients, I would kill for that 9 to 5 right now.  Last month I made a grand total of 100 bucks working here ang another hundred in the other job. Yes I'm not in the US but trust me, this is nothing. I'm working up to 80 hours a week right now. I'm not even trying hard enough to get another job. I freeze up whenever I think about it. On my days off instead of writing cover letters and shit I want to curl up and die, or shut my brain completely off and stare into a screen until it's time to go to bed. I am only 25 and I'm nothing.
Well, it's officially 5am now. Sunrise.  I have maybe 1.5 hours until the shitshow starts all over. I'll just try to close my eyes and not think of anything.  Thanks for bearing with me. wishing you a restful night, wherever you are.

3124,NoSayJ,1593736581,1,"I'm not really sure where to start with this post, I think I just need a place to vent a little. I have been alive on this earth for 18.75 years, and most of that time I have spent alone. I have an older brother who I live with now as my mother once again chose infidelity over having a stable home and relationship with her kids, but other than My brother (and his roommates who are fine people) and my Aunt, I don't speak with almost anyone, I had a total of 4 friends throughout 2-10th grade, until I transfered schools to graduate early and we all lost contact overtime. I have A major depressive disorder and extremely bad anxiety which I used to treat with pills, but lately I simply don't have the funds to get medicine or the mental stability to go see the doctor as stupid as that sounds. I'm rambling a bit here but I'm basically just trying to get at that I have a really hard time making friends, I can never seem to hold a conversation and I feel like I'm extremely boring to be around, I don't do much and I never feel like i want to do anything, I have almost no drive in life, and it's getting harder and harder to even care about getting up each day.

This is another thing that has been on my mind for a while and I've had no place to share or no one that really cares to listen but, I have never dated anyone in my life, I've never held hands with anyone, or hugged anyone or anything really. I'll get it out of the way and mention that I am Transgender and also Bi. I live in a very conservative area, which just stacks on top of my anxiety whenever I think about trying to put myself out there, and I feel so worthless when it comes to dating. I am extremely lonely, everyone in this house I'm in is in a relationship, and I just feel tiny and pathetic. One of the big things lately is that there was actually one guy that I was really interested in and I had started speaking to him fairly regularly. It also important to note that my brother is also bi and has been married once and has dated multiple women throughout his years. So as I was speaking to this guy I found out he had a girlfriend so I did what I thought was respectful and kind and backed off and stopped trying to advance on him to see if he was interested. Shortly after, my brother asked me if I was still going after him, I mentioned he had a girlfriend and said that I wasn't comfortable going after someone who was dating, and he didn't say much other than he thought he was a good guy, as did I.

But then literally 2 days after that My brother comes home with him and apparently has gotten him to break up with his girlfriend and now they are together and everything is perfect with the world. I have seen my brother date 1 other guy in his entire life and I really just didn't know how to feel about it, it felt like a kick in the teeth. And honestly here we are now, it's been like a month after that now and It feels like I've checked out for that whole time, I still don't talk to anyone, my relationship with my mom is bad and my dad is nowhere to be heard of, and the worst part is I've still never held hands with somebody.",lonely,It's getting more painful..,2020-07-03 10:36:21

3130,Chesapeake_Gentleman,1593727824,1,"24 today, and I hate my birthday. I've hated it for a while. It's always just miserable. I don't enjoy my birthday. Most of today I've just sat around in my room and cried intermittently. It's not anything new, my birthday has always just sort of left me feeling empty. And I don't know what to do.

I got tested a couple of days ago, and am waiting on results. By the time I get them everyone will probably have flown back to where they live.

I've never had a birthday party past the age of like 9 or whatever. Nobody throws surprise parties for me, and nobody seems to go out of their way to talk to me. I had two people outside of my family wish me a happy birthday, even though I made plans with a bunch people to do something. They never reached out, and I wouldn't have been able to do anything because I'm quarentined. But still, it's like they didn't even remember. I was in a relationship with someone for 3 years and she only remembered it was my birthday 2 weeks later. That's okay.

My family always goes on vacation during my birthday. Not for my birthday. During it. And so I was never able to celebrate it woth my friends or on my own terms, but everyone always acted like I was going on vacation for my birthday. Great. 

I bought myself a nice burger for lunch and had a whisky coke with that mexican coke with the real cane sugar. I added a couple splashes of triple sec to try and give it a more citrusy flavor. It wasn't bad. I took a nap. It didn't make me feel anything. I tried so hard to make the best of it and it didn't work. 

I am just as isolated and alone as any other day of the year, with no one who reaches out and talks to me of their own accord except a couple of people who talk to everyone. But no other day of the year do I FEEL this lonely. This worthless. This unwanted. 

Writing this out makes me feel like a melodramatic edgy sadsack. Oh well, I'm not happy. I was happier yesterday, and I'll be happier tomorrow.

Fellas, it really IS about what's in their field of view and what is not, and being lonely consists of being tired of altering their sight so that they don't look away. Sometimes, it's better to let them look away, because they were bound to anyway.

I just decided to give up on my social life.

Life's been telling me that all people I meet are goddamn fake. Restless hypocrites and selfish bastards using me as a stopgap when there's nobody else to play with. I realized it hurt me more to be in that situation than to be alone. For I am *alone*, but not always *lonely*. There is a difference and I thought I'd share it, even though some of you already know, I'm sure.

My 2-3 friends also dropped out. They seem to live it better without me. That's it, it's not just me that feels better with no social life, it's social life that is fresher without me!

I used to have lots of friends during the times I spent on online games when I was younger but it's been about two years since I had that.

i obviously stopped talking to them; well, honesty, i tried talking to them even after;

but, it was my fault tbh

i was horrible

it never really happened in a direct way tho, like, we are still good now, pretend like it didn't happen;

well, fuck them; its not even about them; 

im over them; i remember constantly checking the time they were last active, like jealous GF or some shit; trying to figure out they would be;

but obviously, i havent spoken to them ever since;

that summer was fucked;

the most fucked up one ever;

im so used to it tho;

i know that it might be unrelated too, but its hard to explain;

ive never been a huge fan;

but it affected me when xxx get shot;

and now, in the weirdest way possible, listening to the same songs, i used to jam that time, is throwing me back there;

the heat; the smell of air; walking thru the streets alone hoping to bump into someone; summer;

its hard to explain how music works, but i think everyone can relate;

it brings me back, every vibe i felt at that time, im feeling it now; everything i went thru mentally

being at home 24/7; 

The worst FOMO ever...

i did workout and shit, went to gym at least;

even that hits me hard; its fucking crazy how i feel nostalgia over things i found totally irrelevant and unimportant at that time;

&amp;#x200B;

finals are coming; its my first year here;

the first month was very good; fun; parties; everything;

i feel nostalgia over that shit already;

i dunno what it is about me, but i lose enthusiasm; not in a depressing way tho;

but i just, dont even know; get bored of people? maybe?

basically , i dont talk to anyone even here anymore; when it was the total opposite in the begging; 

yea

now im stressing for finals; im supposed to be studying even now;

but thanks to  corona and other shit; it will be easy to cheat;

ight

finals are done

and whats next?

FUCK

&amp;#x200B;

the same summer shit

its 3rd one already i cant do this

&amp;#x200B;

oh, and another thing

today, certain lecturers that we only had for this year, 1st year, said final goodbyes to us;

and it hit me;

im experiencing certain shit for the last time; i mean, its not even about the lecturers; but im just realizing that im being the 1st year student for the last time; that im 18 for the last time in my life;

even this moment; every moment im going thru right now will be gone forever;

&amp;#x200B;

i dont even know;

i did miss certain chances and shit;

i feel nostalgic over shit that hasn't even happened;

the things ive fantasized about; well, fortunately, in my case i can achieve about everything i think of, well, like... dating a girl or whatever

but i havent even done that for some stupid reasons; even tho i had millions of choises;

well, honestly, fuck that; its not even that important;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

im just so fucking tired of being this;

its just simply boring;

i dont know how shits gonna go for me in the future; same boring shit;

or will i achieve shit i want?",lonely,it feels like summer; i feel like summer;,2020-07-03 01:32:09
3158,yaggar,1593703431,1,"Couple of days before there was a conversation between my colleagues from work.  
They were talking about when to meet, get something to drink and have some fun at the evening.  
The thing that hit me is that even if I was sitting in the same room, talking with them for the most of the days about other subjects, they didn't even bother to include me to the conversation about hanging out. It kinda felt that i'm the only one who's not going to be invited anywhere.

It is not my ultimate goal anyway and i've realized much much earlier that most of the team from work  hangout every weekend. They ofted talk about what fun they got or what they did during last days, but this is the first time where someone was just inviting another person, talking almost straight in my face without even slightest will to ask.  


To answer some quetsions which would be asked here - I respond to almost all invitations i got. I go for all work meetings, christmas dinners, hangout trips and try to socialize with them, but still not met anyone, except my ex-gf who tried to include me to their inner circle.

3165,meow_wallflower,1593698125,1,"(First of all: I know that I‚Äôm not completely alone because I have a boyfriend but having close friends would make some things easier in life.)    I don‚Äôt really have close friends, I have a group of friends but I don‚Äôt have always contact with them (only at school. they‚Äôre actually just friends because we see each other 5 times a week).
Whenever my boyfriend tells me that he‚Äôll soon game with his friends I know that after they gamed they‚Äôll talk about their problems and about life. Then I always get jealous and I feel loenly while he games cause I don‚Äôt have the same thing like he has. I always imagine how I‚Äôd game with a group of girls and while we game we‚Äòll talk about life and about our day. Also I get jealous and feel lonely when I see on Snapchat how my friends are chilling with their close friends and having fun together while I‚Äôm just sitting at home. I just wish I‚Äôd have the same thing but I don‚Äôt cause I don‚Äôt have close friends I could hang out with daily. Especially now that I have summer break and have almost nothing to do during the day and my boyfriend has to work, I feel alone. I also had this feeling in quarantine because I never really had social contact through the day. Only the loneliness lived with me back then (qurantine ended in my country since the beginning of June). Today, for example, is a day where I‚Äòm just sitting at home, doing nothing, feeling lonely and finding ways to make new friends. The problem is that I‚Äôm pretty shy and introverted and I‚Äôm socially akward so it‚Äôs difficult for me making new friends. One problem is also that it‚Äôs difficult to find like-minded people cause I could click better and faster with them (I need a long time getting comfortable around someone). I just hate the feeling of being lonely and being jealous on my friends cause they have cool close friends around them and having fun outside.

- He/she fucked up

-He/she says ""I'm so sorry. I really want to be with you, give me another chance""

-I give her/him another chance

-In the beginning he/she is really nice

-Then , he or she does nothing for the relationship and makes many stupid and not credible excuses (they tell me the truth when I confront them).

-I send them to hell and cut all communication

-He/she begs me for another opportunity and swears that he/she really is interested in me to have a friendship and that he/she ""loves me"".

3170,DahSkullknight,1593686323,1,"Ok this might be a bit long and nobody will probably bother reading this, but i just can't take this anymore.
I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for months (or even years), and the fact that i have fucking ADHD doesn't fucking help.
I had some decent friends and probably even a close friend (kinda) in middle school.
Everything was okay, but then, i started to act pretty dickish and doing some really stupid decitions that i would later regret, like betray the closest thing to a real friend that i ever had, insulting other people for no reason, and trying to beat the crap out of other people (and mostly fail).
Eventually most of my friends ended up either betraying or abandoning me.
It doesn't help that i'm pretty bad at socialyzing, let alone starting a conversation.
Eventually, i went into another school, and this time i would try to be a better person, but since i was really affraid of doing the same mistakes, i was mostly isolated.
I was alone in most of the time, and most of the people where pretty dickish, didn't really cared for or just didn't had anything in common with me.
That doesn't mean i didn't had friends, but i don't really know if i should consider them friends.
At this time i was also making some friends online, but that didn't last too long, because i thought it was pointless, since they were just people that i didn't even knew in real life.
Then high school came and it didn't chage much.
I made some friends but those didn't last too long because i realized they where assholes.
My dad once told me that i should man up and make some friends, and i even promised that i would do it (i obviously ended up not doing it).
I also had a group of friends, but that also didn't last too long because most of them where dicks and i think most of them hated me.
Eventually, i stopped to caring about trying to socialyze.
The only reason i would talk to other people in my school was because i was bored and had nothing to do.
Then the this COVID shit comes and it just got worse.
I REALLY hated doing online classes in Zoom, YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.
It was pretty hard to pay attention to the classes.
I couldn't understand shit in Geometry and physics, and i had to do a lot of fucking homework.
What it pisses me off the most is since i'm pretty fucking lazy, i ended up doing other stupid shit instead of working or studying.
I ended up cheating in most of the exams to be honest.
Those days where probabily one of my lowest points in my life.
I was thinking about suiciding a couple of times (and still do) and i was mostly alone in my room.
Another thing that was really making me nervous (and still does) was the fact that i still didn't really know what to study in university, i really feel like i'm good at fucking nothing.
I was thinking about programming or software engineering, but i'm pretty bad at math, and i don't know anything about programming, even though i'm kinda interested.
Nowadays i'm 16 years old and i mostly just play videogames in my room or just explore on the internet and do a bit of excersice
Sometimes i try to cope with smiling and trying to be funny (even though i'm just hurting on the inside), other times i'm just so fucking depressed and/or pissed or sometimes i just don't care anymore.
I also have some real problems with sleeping, mostly because i can't stop having anxiety or having negative thoughts while i'm trying to sleep.
I was even considering about making some online friends again, but i don't know.
The only things that keep me somewhat sane are my big brother and my parents (i really love them &lt;3).
And well, here i am, writing this shit at FUCKING 3 AM instead of sleeping.

3171,Garcia512,1593684742,1,"Now I'm sorry but this can be a long one. I have grown up an extremely introverted person. I was 4 when my sister was born. Predictable enough, all the spotlight went to her. Everyone and more importantly my mom focused on her, sided with her. She'd get away with all the stuff which could've gotten me under strict and hard circumstances if I did. Things got extremely dark for me when I joined college and my roommate happened to be my second cousin. She did treat me so bad and spread nonsensical rumours about me, so much that the fellow students and staff of the college started going against me. The classmates wouldn't answer me if i tried to talk to them - downright ignored my voice like i wasn't even there. Then a classmate of mine who was somehow a lil concerned, called my mom to tell her what's been going on with me. My mom went on to tell me to settle things on my own because she had good relations with my roommate's family and she didn't wanna spoil those. I started skipping meals, stopped stepping out of my room completely. Then i shifted from the hostel to a nearby location thinking it would do me good. But things had gotten so bad by then it would give me severe anxiety to even think about my college. Then I had this guy staking me and attempting every way he could get to ke and was even successful. I wouldn't eat for days on the go. My parents had no idea I was even considering suicide. I skipped my college completely, skipped exams. I had gotten so skinny but somehow my parents never noticed that when i got home on weekends. Then ultimately one day i told my parents about college and exams. My mom got so angry, she wouldn't even look my way. She even wished i was dead. My dad however took me to see the psychiatrist. Things got a lil normal after then. I rejoined college and cleared my name of the rumours. I'll be in my final year of dentistry this December. I thought i had a couple friends all along but I realise more everyday that maybe I was wrong. I still feel in my family that I'm not of that much importance and maybe that will never change. I've developed trust and temper issues in the past few years. I started to cut off a lot of attachments. I think I've almost lost my best friends - if only they were. I don't know what i wanted to hear from them apart from ""it'll be ok"" and ""move on"". I mean i know everyone has some or the other stuff going on in life. No one owes me anything but somewhere inside me that kind of doesn't define 'friendship'. I would go a 100 extra miles for a 'friend' and I have too. Now the past few months have had me realising that we're just not supposed to belive in any kinds of relationships and friendships and I've started to hate the idea of associating with anyone at all emotionally.

Im 21, I got laid off 2 weeks ago from work. It was seasonal so it was expected. Had a interview the other day, went well. I think I got it, have yet to get a call though. It was after that day I started feeling really somber. 

I don't really have friends, not realistically I guess ill say. I play a lot of Xbox so I have friends ive had on there for a few years. I can't really talk to them about how I feel because theres been some history and then theres been some issues with some of them. 

I live with my mom, I don't want to talk to her about my emotions and such. Shes a fanatic about conspiracies, she guilt trips, and fear mongers me. I extreme anxiety whenever she brings it up. 

I can't move out on my own or to another place of family, because I can't leave my mom to pay for all the finances. My brothers left, they don't visit, they don't call. So they don't help, other family won't help. The last couple of years where ive been working I barely see any of my money. It all goes to rent, bills, food or my moms conspiracy shit. 

I feel like im in a void. I feel like im alone and no one cares. I crave for affection or attention, not in a selfish or negative way. I don't want to seek the wrong crowd. I use to self harm, I think its been 2 years clean. Ive been trying since to get myself better and out of depression on my own. I try to draw, I write out my depression in a story, or I go for walks.

So about a year ago, I met this amazing girl. I fell head over heels in love, and it seemed that she liked me too. Having someone to hang out with all the time, be intimate with, and someone you trust enough to spill all my secrets felt amazing. We were there for each other and had each others back, something I never could have hoped before I met her. Fast forward a year, we were discussing the future of our relationship. She told me something that really hurt, I apparently wasn‚Äôt anything more than just a friend to her and she never had any feelings for me.  I couldn‚Äôt believe it, every intimate moment came from the deepest place in my heart but for her it wasn‚Äôt anything more than satisfying her physical needs. I felt used, sad and more alone than ever.

Years passed by so quickly. I BARELY HAVE ANY FUCKING MEMORIES. I used to think it was good this way, that I was okay being alone. But apparently consuming entertainment online does not have that much of an impact on your life.

I feel like I'm suddenly an adult. Yesterday I was a child and now I'm an adult. I'm too distracted to reflect on my childhood and deal with it. I haven't talked to my father in 6 years.

Too many years of lack of sleep fucked up my biologic clock. I'm lucky to stay employed. I take too many days off because of fatigue and finish deadlines while having terrifying heart arrhythmia if I stay up late now while boss think I'm (capable but) lazy.

Sit around and argue on Reddit all day? I understand if you have a partner or a family a home can be an enjoyable place to be, but clearly that's not the case for me. I live in an ugly car, it's super reliable, fun to drive, and not terribly uncomfortable to sleep in. I run a business that requires constant travel and I have a huge passion for the outdoors. My setup works for me, I know I could upgrade to a van or an RV but I doubt that would help that much with my loneliness, and I'm happy with what I have right now.

I don't really care for friends, I just want a girlfriend. I'm already lackluster socially and adding my weird living situation into the mix makes it so much harder. I feel like a sleeper sometimes. (Like a modified car that is way faster than it looks.) I'm of average height and weight and look kind of boyish, so I'm not really grabbing anyone's attention and getting asked out, I've been working out religiously for ten years though and am pretty muscular with a shirt off, not that it's ever off, and with a shirt on I just look kind of thin. I suppose I could gain size, but I don't want to. As I've mentioned, I live in a really ugly car, but through a combination of hard work on my business and obvious frugality I'm super financially fit. Nobody would ever know though, and I don't know how to use that to my advantage without changing my lifestyle or attracting a bad person. I don't even need an advantage, I just want to be viewed as normal financially, like a typical 20-something with a modern car and an apartment.

I really do give it 100%. I eat nothing but healthy food, I never drink or do drugs, I workout for hours every day, I never watch TV or play video games, I'm always working, I spend zero money...I know people say ""enjoy life,"" but I like my life just fine except for the loneliness. I'll ""enjoy life"" when I'm dead. I think the way I do things is cool, I just wish I could find someone that thought as highly of myself as I do. 

I actually did find someone, but we broke up six months ago. I knew she wasn't right for me, but I didn't want to break up because I knew what would happen. Devastating loneliness.

This morning I got an email informing me that all of my classes will be online. Not only that, but there will be no campus events or clubs being held there either. That completely crushed my dreams.

We had to go in her little sister room because she had the tv and while we watched that show we talked about really stupkd stuff and we started to get closer untill our lips started to touch but even then we didn‚Äôt stop talking soon we started to kiss and my heart started beat so fast because i was in love but i didn‚Äôt think she fell the same so i was scared that i would loose her but i didn‚Äôt. 

        She used to say, I love you to the moon and back. We Always thought that we would make a movie about our lovestory because it was super special and yall don‚Äôt even know it.
We would have named the movie to the moon and back. 

          She broke up with me because of my depression that came suddenly time to time and she said she felt unhappy and didn‚Äôt feel the same anymore. 

I love you bby. 
Thank you beliving in me before anyone else.
Thank you for teaching me about love.
Thank you for being here for me.
Thank you for loving me.

3219,AusraliaIsLit,1593649534,1,"Hi all. I just wanted to communicate with others. I am just tired of rejection. I am 24 years old and never been in a relationship. I understand as a man I have to approach women first but I'm just bored and feel over it. It hasn't worked. I see so many other young couples happy together and it just makes me feel lonely, isolated, unwanted. 

I've tried being polite and going to bars, parks, gym, etc. At this point im not even looking for sexual attraction from a woman. I just want to gain from positive friendly experiences with women to help me grow. I can tell when I talk to women as empathetic creatures they can sense my hopelessness even when I'm trying to just be polite. They always just say I'm sweet or I'm sorry I'm with a friend, I have a boyfriend. In reality at this point I'm just screaming inside please be my friend. I'm not making any progress with women on my own so I wish I had some women as friends to grow close with or help me attract other women. 

This isn't something men can admit to others. I am so fucking tired of this.

I'm struggling to make any progress. Right now I'm tired of my anxieties. 

I'm not someone who feels comfortable being abit of an asshole like women want. 

I also understand that my anxieties with people come from school. I'm not going to tell you more about myself. But I was bullied for an aspect of myself I'm still extremely self concious about. And it wasn't the physical toll of being bullied by boys. Boys I could fight back, although loose. But girls talked so much shit that mentally made me feel fatigued from like 12 years old till i was 18. And now every single time I talk to any woman I can't help but remember those girls saying eww, gross, he looks like a girl, he's short, he must be gay. Until I started to believe it. And still confused why I apologised about it when people said shit to me. Like it made me ashamed to be me and I had to apologise. And still do abit. 

I've been to a therapist and asked if I would like to try anti depressants. So I'm gonna start trying those.

I did just have my first muay thai class which went great. I'd like to stick with that and have in the back of my mind the reminder not to be scared of anyone. I'm hoping that will help me be physically confident.

It was only a one year program, so between losing my friends from undergrad and it being a short program, I didn't have many good friends left. There was a girl I met this year though and I thought we became really good friends. Long story short, she had a long-distance boyfriend for the year that she broke up with a couple weeks ago and I made the dumb decision to ask her on a date today. I didn't even realize that I was interested in her until a couple days ago, but even before that she made it pretty clear she wasn't interested in me at all. So she ended up saying that she doesn't think we should talk for awhile and that we can never go back to the way we were.

3221,topaz_roses,1593645901,1,"First off I just wanna say that my heart goes out to the people in this sub, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve gone through as much as most other people on this sub but I want to share my experiences and what‚Äôs helped me so that maybe it could help other people too

I think for the longest I‚Äôve been basing my sense of happiness, love, validation, and self-worth on other people. I was desperate for any form of human contact. I savored every conversation I was able to have and I was so touch-starved that even a high-five would stay in my mind all day because of how meaningful it was to me. I was desperate to be friends with almost anyone I met.

To this day I still have friends that leave me on read and don‚Äôt really give me much of their time and attention. Almost always I‚Äôve been the one to text first and lots of friendships have felt one-sided for me because I would bend over backwards so that they could like me and talk to me. I was the type of person that wanted to be everyone‚Äôs best friend even though to most people in my life I was just a regular friend. I was jealous of friends that seemed to have so much more than me. Good looks. A boyfriend. Huge friend group. 

I was desperate for the love, time, and attention I never received from my abusive mom. The absence of a good mom left holes in my heart that I didn‚Äôt know how to heal from, so as you can guess I did everything I could to fill the holes in my heart with everything from my outside world.

I‚Äôm still learning to deal with all this and here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been working for me:

‚ÄîWorking on the relationship I have with myself: 
In my opinion the most important relationship you have is with yourself. I think that‚Äôs where it all starts. Heal the inside and the outside will start to heal too. Instead of hating myself I would try to be nice to myself and flip all the negative thoughts I had running around in my head to positive ones. This is way easier said than done but with practice it‚Äôs become more natural. I definitely struggled at lot at the beginning though as I had trouble believing the positive messages I was trying to tell myself

‚ÄîI became my own best friend (cheesy, I know)
I cannot stress enough that it‚Äôs so important to have a strong and loving relationship with yourself. This is just my opinion and you‚Äôre all free to disagree but I feel like the people in our lives should be ADDING to the love and happiness you already have within you. I‚Äôve depended on a lot of people to make me feel happy and loved but I find it so much more satisfying to be my own best friend and to feel the people in my life add to a version of me that feels content with my own company as well as the company of others

As easy as this is for me to say, try to fill yourself up with love and happiness. I know this is not an easy thing to do especially with depression and anxiety and everything else going on. But maybe the following can give you some ideas:

Write positive messages for yourself and put them in a jar so you can pull up some positivity whenever you need it. You may not believe them at first but I truly believe that positive thinking is a habit so keep on trying and give yourself a break whenever you need it. You don‚Äôt have to think positive 24/7 and it can be really good to allow yourself to think and feel whatever you need to think and feel. Do things you enjoy. Or enjoy just lying down in bed. Listen to music. Draw. Watch your favorite movies and shows. Write down things you are thankful for. Build a pillow fort. Meditate. Do yoga. Work out. Sing. Dance. Wrap yourself in a cozy blanket and eat your favorite snacks. Try having fun enjoying your own company even if it feels lonely at times

‚ÄîGo easy on yourself

‚ÄîBelieving that every face is a masterpiece that cannot be compared to others
I‚Äôve struggled a lot with comparing myself to other girls and wishing I was as pretty as them. It‚Äôs honestly something I‚Äôm still struggling with but something that‚Äôs really helped me is seeing every face as a work of art that is beautiful in its own unique way. 

Different things work for different people but I hope that this could be of some help, wishing you all peace and happiness",lonely,My experience with loneliness and what I‚Äôve learned,2020-07-02 09:25:01
3222,YouPetroleumJelly,1593645021,1,"So growing up, pretty much 99% of my friends, I made because they befriended me. I‚Äôd like to say I‚Äôm a funny person with a kind heart, good conversationalist  in the right circumstances... but I overthink too much. 

The only friends I really have now are a coworker of mine and a friend I used to skateboard with. I don‚Äôt have a tight close knit group of friends like I used to in high school, and it‚Äôs really driving me crazy. 

I‚Äôve pretty much spent all of my past few birthdays alone. I mean I‚Äôll spend time with family, but being in my mid 20s, it‚Äôd be nice to have more friends and experience a more fulfilling social life. 

All I really do is go to work, skateboard, or go to the gym. 

I‚Äôve never had anyone throw me a surprise party or anything like that. Shit I‚Äôd probably cry if someone did that for me because I‚Äôd be so touched. My 21st birthday I spent with my brother, his now wife, his friend, and one of my friends who I don‚Äôt talk to anymore.

Even just being able to socialize would make me feel better but this damn pandemic is ruining everything for everyone. I used to go to concerts a lot and would sometimes meet people there, or festivals, or to the bar. But now? I don‚Äôt know what to do.

3225,Lanespane9,1593643871,1,"I don‚Äôt know what im doing here, I don‚Äôt use reddit and I probably wont even login again to check comments, but I still want to convey some of my feelings to another human being, which is very difficult for me to do in real life.
This last month has been very hard for me - emotionally, psychologically and all. A couple of relatives have died, both from covid and other reasons and one of my cousin is in quarantine cause of covid19. I wasn‚Äôt close with all of them but this is still tragic news to hear at times when my heart already aches cause of other reasons. 
Since childhood, ive been scolded by my dad for meaningless things, and recently I heard that he wish he‚Äôd rather not have a son, than it being like me. The reason - I lost a marksheet, which isnt even a big problem, 1 application and I would get another in a week, but he just conveys his feelings more everyday.
To make matters worse, i feel socially closed for a long time now, and im the person in the group whom people only contacted when they had problems, but the negative thing is, once I stopped listening to them, I became distant to almost everyone, even friends since 8-10 years. To make matters worse I don‚Äôt enjoy playing video games anymore, which was my only escape for a long time. My dad also broke my pc about a month ago, and I cant get new parts cause of lockdown, so I cant play any AAA or similar big games on my laptop. Which didn‚Äôt matter much cause I mainly played league of legends which runs good enough on my laptop, but now I don‚Äôt feel like even opening the game , I tried to play a few games between 3-4 day intervals but everytime I just quit halfway through without any particular reason.
Currently I just blast music in my ears and roam mindlessly in skyblock, I don‚Äôt even understand how it works but I just try to distract my mind from myself. I have a friend who plays it too, so sometimes I just try to put on a smile on my face and ask her to play, which really calms me down, but I don‚Äôt have the energy to do that everyday. And sometimes she even asks me to join playing with her friends, which I am afraid to do. I cant explain it properly but I don‚Äôt get along with most people, mostly cause I get angry easily and also cause I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have friends growing up, the only person whom my parents let me be friends with was a guy in my class, and I was allowed because he lives just 1 street behind mine, we went to same tutions and he helped me out in math, that‚Äôs my parents reason to let me be friends with him. I had never visited anyone‚Äôs birthday party as a child, the first time I celebrated it with my friends, I was in first year of college, 2 years ago.
To distract myself, I even tried to watch movies, tv shows, webseries but I have never really been a binge watcher, so I just feel bored after 2 episodes at max. And also cause I havent had more than 2-3 hrs of sleep per day for almost 2 weeks, so my eyes are a bit tired to look at my phone screen for long. I arranged some new novels to read, which I usually love but don‚Äôt have the piece of mind to read them right now. Long walks helps me calm down too so I just walk up and down the floors in morning when I cant do anything else, this works to some extent.
I just dont wanna feel this way anymore, getting scolded everyday for no reason, feeling abandoned from everyone around me, having lost interest in things i loved to do. These arent even new emotions for me, but idk why i suddenly started feeling these as a heavy pain on my chest. And i know that no one around me cares, my dad saw me crying once and he just grunted and went to the other room, dont i even deserve to be asked about it as being a child? Fk this shit im a good son, im good in academics, ive never had any complaints from either school or college, i dont do drugs or cigarettes even when i could easily access them,i treat people to the best of my capability, im honest and all that. but nah, i have to be treated like garbage by everyone.
This really makes me overthink a lot about every small thing. 3 years ago i even tried to kill myself once, i was hospitalized cause i had a TB patch in my lung and during that time i  heard some stuff that i wish to god that no other person should hear from his/her parents. When i got home, i tried to hang myself, but my body was very weak to even lift myself up, much less tie a strong knot, so i ended up with just an injury between my jaw and neck, and a permanent scar as a memory. Nobody even knows about this cause frankly who cares, everyone has their problems right? Just some people think that they are depressed over not eating pizza for a long time meanwhile i feel like my whole world being snatched away from my slowly and painfully. 
I dont have suicidal thoughts now, have negative - a lot but not the once that can make me hurt myself. Either im too afraid or i still have hope that someday things would be a little better, just a pinch if happiness over all this misery.

So, yeah, I'd think about her and whether she thought about me. I'd construct scenerios in my head where we became friends. I'd plan out a way to see her more, like bringing up quitting sessions and maybe hanging out sometime. It was creepy and stupid and not at all possible and would never happen and deep down I knew that.

I knew at the end of the day she didn't give a single fuck about me. She was literally being paid $200 a session just to sit in a room with me and listen to me whine. I was pathetic.

I was the victim of a crime a number of years ago that left me mentally and emotionally shattered. I suffer from ptsd and severe anxiety.

I struggle to sleep and I have had counselling and medications and nothing worked. 

It‚Äôs always been difficult but lately I am distraught. I had become so overweight stuck in the house and so scared to open up to the world. It‚Äôs been 15 years since my last relationship or even a date. I feel completely worthless and unloved . 

I have kids and while they are good kids they are basically grown and I don‚Äôt feel like I am of any worth to them. I have completely lost all my confidence and self esteem and can‚Äôt catch a break. 

Yesterday I was preparing to end my suffering when my son came home early and plans had to change. I feel alone in the world and nothing I do works.

I‚Äôm social and have lots of friends outside by core group of what I‚Äôd call my best friends. I have a good job and built a successful side business doing something I‚Äôm passionate about that also has introduced me to tons of likeminded people. That said I‚Äôve been dealing with a crippling loneliness and depression that I haven‚Äôt been able to talk about with anyone and it‚Äôs taken such a huge toll on my life &amp; happiness.

I‚Äôve been single for about 10 years now. After a messy break up with my first girlfriend I tried desperately to find love again. Since then, I‚Äôve been looking for the right person with the most horrible luck. I‚Äôm one of those people who gets along with almost anyone but only very rarely do I meet someone that I really ‚Äòclick‚Äô with (both in friendships and dating). In the rare case I do find someone I‚Äôm interested in, its never reciprocated which is fine and neither one of our faults. After all these years of trying to find someone without any luck, I sort of gave up. I‚Äôve exhausted dating apps, I‚Äôve probably swiped on tens of thousands of people and out of the few people that I‚Äôve ever matched with, only a few led to first dates (and never a 2nd). I can‚Äôt help but think somethings wrong with me that makes me undesirable or unlovable. I know how melodramatic this sounds but honestly I‚Äôve given it my all and I‚Äôm tired of looking for the ‚Äúplenty of fish in the sea.‚Äù What makes things worse is that all my friends have no issues starting relationships and I‚Äôm sure they wonder why I never bring anyone around.

All of this has caused a tremendous amount of pain in my life. I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many nights I‚Äôve cried in bed, praying that my ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù finds her way into my life soon or begging the universe for any sort of sign of where to go from here. Maybe I‚Äôm a helpless romantic, maybe this pain comes from within and is self inflicted. I guess I‚Äôm writing this in the hopes that by putting this out into the universe it will help manifest whatever it is I‚Äôm looking for. This has been something I‚Äôve kept so close to my heart, I‚Äôm too ashamed to bring this up with even my most loved friends and family.

3295,inca16,1593579397,1,"The line between sanity and insanity is very fine and one of the gateways to insanity is losing connection to your true self. Take Sadguru for example, he is so intelligent and he has such enlightening things to say but he muddies it up by artificially imitating an american accent and that makes him seem nutty. He has lost connection to his true self because he has done that for so long that, that eccentric way of being has become his natural way of being. Your true self can only come naturally so if you try to change him and make him conscious about his eccentricity, you will worsen the problem.

Many people seem normal when they talk in their language but they seem eccentric when they talk in English. If you asked them why they are artificially imitating the natives, they would say that they aren‚Äôt imitating and that it‚Äôs their natural way of talking. If you make them conscious about it then they might artificially try to stop talking artificially. They have been imitating for so long that they are not trying to do that on purpose anymore and that eccentric way of being has become their natural way of being.

It‚Äôs easy to grow distant from your true self. You will naturally gravitate back to your true self if you haven‚Äôt strayed too far from it but the farther you go from it, the more complicated it becomes to make it back. You can‚Äôt artificially find your true self because your true self comes when you don‚Äôt seek it.

Artificially imitating the persona and way of talking of the native speakers is silly and can even be mocking because nobody talks the way they do artificially. Everybody talks naturally so if you talk artificially, you are talking wrong. It‚Äôs important to remember that people everywhere are pretty much the same but if you focus on the differences, you‚Äôll loose sight of the commonality.¬†Your accent changes naturally when you don‚Äôt think about it.

**There are also other ways to lose connection to your true self and most of these ways involve changing yourself for others in some way.¬†Changing yourself for others is a disease that has taken over the world.**

Losing connection to your true self is a contagious insanity so associating with those who‚Äôve lost connection to their true selves would also make you loose connection to your true self.

The root cause of this insanity is confusing words, signs, symbols and ideas with reality. Reality can‚Äôt be defined through words because it‚Äôs not words. It‚Äôs not material, that‚Äôs just an idea. It‚Äôs not spiritual, that‚Äôs also an idea, it‚Äôs a symbol. Reality is \*GONG SOUND\*

Secluding yourself, taking a vow of silence for a few days and spending the time by doing things that don‚Äôt involve the observation of other people like reading and meditating will reconnect you with the silence behind everything and ground you in reality.

It is a contagious insanity because it‚Äôs so easy to confuse words, signs, symbols and ideas with reality and get lost in a world of illusion.

People who have lost connection to their true selves seem dislikable because they are living in a world of illusion but they are not bad people. A slight shift in perspective will break them out of the illusions and ground them in reality.",lonely,Losing connection to your true self,2020-07-01 14:56:37

To share our deeper thoughts, our true feelings, and our past experiences with others, would be to step outside of that mould; which we worry would put us in a negative light in the eyes of our peers. Yet only when we indulge in those things, can a true connection between yourself and another person form. 

We seem to forget, that what we collectively view as 'normal', isn't really normal at all. Society's normal ignores what it means to be human in a sense. It ignores that everyone is an individual, with their own interesting thoughts, real feelings, and history.

And now shes gone, its been 2 years but sometimes it feels like yesterday. I started smoking to help cope instead of for fun, started drinking, everyday. I tried to keep up with people but I started seeing them walk away from me. Nobody wants to be around me. The ones that do, just take advantage. I see them so happy and they talk like they have been lonely but then when it matters most nobody is there. I used to cut in school but quit for a long time. Now I have moments, times when it‚Äôs just too much but I am too afraid to end it. I still smoke but I do it in secret, while it can be bad I see nothing wrong with it given the circumstances. But my entire family is against it. Nobody will listen to me, not unless theres something in it for them. I recently came out of a really bad friendship from working in the plants. It was horrible, the start of the end was when I was called the fall guy and everyone there laughed at me. But they were serious, I was less to them. When I started speaking up for myself they would act like they were sorry then do something spiteful. I lost my job and so I felt no need to be in that town anymore, when I left they spread awful rumors and my no longer best friends took the girl that I adored. She thought they were the right ones, little does she know how much they talked shit about her but since she played into their hands I will let her find out on her own. I have had some bad relationships in the past, every single one I was too kind and trusting and ended up being cheated on. Also one of those being someone I called a best friend at the time. Jokes on him though he ended up getting an std from her (after) our break up. So she slept around a lot its a miracle I didnt get any. I had a girl I even considered marriage with but she too, cheated. She came forward though so it wasn‚Äôt as traumatic how I found out.

I'm fifteen and already through five relationships, almost none except for one lasted only several or a few months and I'm feeling lonelier than ever.
 I'm scared to talk to my parents about it because they'll probably just say that I'm too young to worry about that again.
 I've been trying to distract myself with everything I could but nothing is helping. My only temporary comfort is TF2 X Reader wattpad fanfics now and I just feel like an emotional, dependent, delusional idiot. 
Had the urge to search for dating apps for minors.
I feel like no matter what, I'll never be good enough for anyone because of how slow, weird and disgusting I can get and can be.

My friends have been hooking up with really cool people lately ever since my last boyfriend and I broke up and it's like they can't stop bringing up the fact that they actually have someone in their life that they can show endless affection to right in front of me

I can't take this
I'm seriously so fed up with myself
I keep wanting to give random guys kisses on the cheek what the fuck that's harassment
My parents can't afford a therapist and I'm pretty sure this will be left forgotten or die in new if that's what you guys say all the time

    I‚Äôm 15 now and I had my freshman year of highschool this last 2019-2020 year and I‚Äôm in my schools marching band (not too brag but I‚Äôm good) and I hadn‚Äôt dated in awhile tbh I mean my last ex wasn‚Äôt rlly a true love and she cheated on me so I didn‚Äôt rlly care about her but after band camp which is a two week period to help us learn the show I went to my friends I see sister bday party and I uh I met the most amazing girl ever we talked all night at that party and I attracted her with my stupid humor by saying ‚ÄúEddie are you okay‚Äù instead of ‚Äúannie are you okay‚Äù while floating like a drunk dad in the pool and that apparently made her fall head over heals for me I later found out lol. But we talked all night and of course I went and got her number by saying I bet I can spell her name with my eyes closed and uh yeah I didn‚Äôt it was horrible but it turned out to be her nickname for me until we started dating and I got her number and the next day at exactly 8am we FaceTimed and at 9pm the same day we hung up we literally talked all day and I met her parents over the phone etc her dad took the phone and asked my intentions all the good stuff and the next day we FaceTimed for 10 hours and while we were in the call her dad said he could obviously tell we like each other and that the girl (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm calling her) had talked about me all night and said for me to tell her that we were dating and to deal with it and I did and I later asked if she did actually liked me and she said yeah and she did wanna date me so yeah we started dating on August 5th and I didn‚Äôt tell my parents until August 17 the same day my little sister was born and i did that Bc I was legit scared they‚Äôd be like ‚Äúno‚Äù they were happy for me since it‚Äôs been awhile since I dated etc but yeah for the next 4 months I had the best relationship I‚Äôve had in my life so far and she was my first serious relationship and my first love and no we didn‚Äôt say we loved each other for like a month. But it was amazing she was my first kiss and first other things (let your imagination roam free on that) and whenever I got my phone taken away Bc I was grounded she‚Äôd give me good morning letter at school and they always smelled like her now we did have our fights but she said she never wanted to go to bed mad at me and I said the same so whenever we fought we tried to resolve it by the night. 

     Now about the fourth month of the relationship my mom was getting married to my step dad and the girl cake Bc my mom loved her and wanted her to come now the girl is very socially shy she doesn‚Äôt show her affection to me in public besides hugs but at the wedding (which I was walking my mom down the aisle Bc her dad had been dead since she was five and she hated her step dad) she kissed me in front of everyone and I was dumbfounded I ask her why she said she was comfortable with my family. But this is where shit starts hitting the fan. My older sister dropped her off at Walmart and I later got a text saying her dad called my bestfriend my main hoe and the girl was my side hoe (my bestfriend has been my bff since kindergarten) and she said she was mad and yelled at her dad Bc he was being an ass and he grounded her for yelling at him and he made her block me on everything for like a few days and the next day we talked and we had to give each other some space but not break up (I went to her house every Sunday and cuddled and watched a movie) and I got sad yeah but at least we were still together but without being able to hang out outside of school we grew distance and she ended it but it wasn‚Äôt a bad break up and it didn‚Äôt hit me until a few months ago and I lost it I was a mess and then I rebounded and that was horrible and the thing is when we broke up she said she still wanted to talk but she ignored me and revolted away from me when I walked by her. It‚Äôs been like 7 months and only a few weeks ago I finally burned out notes and pics Bc she moved away to Louisiana Bc her dad went nuts quit his job and now they live in a family vacation trailer. But it‚Äôs like we never got to resolve everything we never talked again and we never talked about how we became distant and why she didn‚Äôt talk to me. I mean I‚Äôm happy kinda Bc I can go to school without worrying about seeing her and whenever I see her I die a little inside. I loved her and it hurts and I‚Äôve just been lonely I‚Äôm not depressed but I‚Äôm bummed I hate feeling lonely it‚Äôs like a dark room I can‚Äôt see what going on around me I only have my thoughts.

My (20f) life features a controlling and clingy mom, who won‚Äôt let me date, see, or call my boyfriend (of 2 years tomorrow), monitors my phone and controls where I go because ‚Äúshe cares‚Äù, is passive aggressive and doesn‚Äôt leave me alone about ‚Äúworking too much‚Äù (35ish hours per week) Also featuring a house that is a mess constantly, tired from work, fighting for independence while figuring out how to adult. 

I‚Äôm dealing with standard relationship issues that everyone has, as well as serious stress from not being able to see/talk to him in months. (Yes we text but he‚Äôs been really busy lately and I miss him like crazy) 

I‚Äôm saving for a car and to move out, but I have no idea how I‚Äôm going to get away with buying a car or my own phone while living here since my mom is so strict. I have nowhere to go (all extended family lives hours away, and my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have his own place. I don‚Äôt have any friends close enough to live with) if I did take a big stand against my mom and it didn‚Äôt work out well for me. I am a legal adult and still stuck here at home with no idea how to do taxes or banking or anything that has to do with ‚Äúadulting‚Äù really.

I work a just above minimum wage job (which I actually really enjoy and I‚Äôm looking at a promotion in the next few months so that‚Äôs one good thing I suppose.).

I‚Äôm terrified of the future and I try to stay positive but constantly dealing with everything weighs me down. I get really sad and in a depressed mood a couple times a week on average (I usually try to keep positive but sometimes you just can‚Äôt yk?) I‚Äôm exhausted and sad a lot, and I don‚Äôt really know what else to do so I‚Äôm ranting on the internet üòÇ

If anyone has any advice on moving out, how to stay positive, how to effectively stand up to clingy and overprotective parents, or anything like that I‚Äôll take it. Thanks and I hope you have a great day :)

I‚Äôm a mariner and I spend a lot of time away. I have felt for a long time that I don‚Äôt come back to anything. Nobody‚Äôs waiting for me here. Written like that it reads like I‚Äôm whining. But even so, it hardly gives me a reason to actually want to come back. In the quiet hours, when I can use the satellite internet, I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to. Nobody‚Äôs wondering where I might have got to.

But a year ago, I might just have found someone. An old friend from school still lived in the area, and gave me some advice. We got to talking more frequently and they agreed to meet when I got back, which we did. As I was returning, there was something to look forward to. Somebody that I actually wanted to talk to. Make no mistake, I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a matter of romance. Perhaps I was secretly hoping for something, but only very quietly. But I wanted to come back and see them, and I believe they wanted me to come back and see them. There passed a good time. 

I had to go again, for several months. We kept talking and I felt alleviation. Someone somewhere seemed to give a fuck. I‚Äôve returned since, in the middle of this pandemic. That obviously ruined the plans we‚Äôd made, but we‚Äôve seen each other since. 

We‚Äôre getting there, don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôre leaving. They‚Äôre going to move to another city to be with a partner that I didn‚Äôt know about. And so it‚Äôll be just me again; and there is once again nothing for me here. I am sad for that, though I know I shouldn‚Äôt be. 

Nobody should be responsible for another person‚Äôs happiness. I know this. And everyone is well within their rights to move on to somewhere and someone better. Which is virtually anyone and anywhere. Yet still I‚Äôm hurt. I feel a sense of loss. And consequently, I feel guilt. It‚Äôs wrong of me. It feels like envy and it feels sick. I know that I am not even in anyone‚Äôs story, but in my own story that would make me the villain, as it were.

I shared this here because like I said; it‚Äôs just me. There‚Äôs not a great deal I can do, or want to do, about it. But I don‚Äôt even know how to feel. I don‚Äôt know if anyone here fancies bestowing some profound wisdom upon me.",lonely,Are we the baddies?,2020-07-01 07:44:05

3330,escaping__reality,1593547771,1,"I wanna start off by saying I don‚Äôt feel depressed as such, just very lonely.

Okay, from April 2018 to October 2019 I‚Äôd gotten into drinking and smoking weed every weekend when I‚Äôd go out with my friends. This was nothing crazy and I can‚Äôt say I regret any of it they are some of the best memories I‚Äôve got. 

I had 2 friend groups, one in school and one out of school, both into the same things and we‚Äôd sometimes all go out to things together. I‚Äôd speak to them all the time and we were close.

Now, my parents had nothing against the drinking as it wasn‚Äôt all of the time and they did the same as teens. However, I had to hide the fact I smoked weed because they were completely against it despite the fact they both told me they‚Äôd tried at when they were younger.

Anyway, fast forward to October of last year, they found a stash of lighters, papers etc. They checked through my phone and found photos and videos of me and my friends smoking (I know my mistake). 

After that they treated it like a bigger deal than it needed to be trying to take me to a counsellor. I had no contact to anyone properly for about a month.

Since then yes my friends have invited me places, but only to smoke and after a while I just kind of drifted away now to point where we just don‚Äôt speak. I don‚Äôt see them cause we‚Äôre not in school either.

My relationship with my parents was already iffy before but at this point it‚Äôs just broken. They try to make things normal and I know I shouldn‚Äôt have been doing what I was doing but I don‚Äôt wanna forgive them for taking away what‚Äôs going to be years of childhood.

I have a girlfriend but I don‚Äôt see as often as I would because of covid, and I‚Äôve also got in good shape eating clean and working out 6 times a week since December, but apart from her I‚Äôm so lonely.

Of course I‚Äôve seen the benefits of not smoking and focusing more on other things but I have no desire to get high anymore I just want friends and I have none. I‚Äôm moving school to hopefully make some when things go back to normal but it‚Äôs just sad that I have no one really to turn to. I just stay in my room all the time.

Most serious (Lighthearded) injury you got as a child? For me I fell out of a tree into a thorn bush when I was 11 because we were ""building a base"" and I needed to get rid of a branch. 

Most embarrassing moment that you can look back on and laugh? First day of high school in IT class the teacher asks a question and I raise my hand to answer; the teacher goes ""Yes miss"" needless to say the other kids in my class did not let me live it down.

Most badass feeling moment? My friend and I were at a club and had been dancing all night even though the music wasn't exactly our thing. We were the only alternative people in the club and it was like mix ups and RnB mashups. During the night the start of Linkin Parks numb comes on, and it was quite frankly the worst remix my friend and I had ever heard. We stopped dancing and just stared at the DJ, at the end of the night he played the JZ remix, complete not fitting with the rest of the things he'd played that night and we knew we'd shamed him into setting things at least semi right.
